I don't expect the world from a kid's xylophone, but it would be nice if the different keys made different sounds -- ideally, progressively going through some type of range.

He's funny and interesting to listen to and his anecdotes really draw you in, what a great speaker he is. Jay and Bob get Old is unfortunately named because this really got old - fast. This show was nothing like the other evening with Kevin Smith or Too Fat for Forty shows. i felt that Jason Mewe's jokes simply pale in comparison to Kevin's thoughtfulness and humour, and much of the time Kevin Smith seemed to be supporting Jason or \\"carrying him\\" to be more direct. I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan but I couldn't get through this show. Wow, I never thought I would be saying that about a Kevin Smith live show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess this is getting a little old.","review":"Kevin Smith is a fascinating speaker and I have all of his Q&As. This one is a different format as it is co-hosted by Jason Mewes and that is its downfall. Mewes often does a cameo on Smith's Q&As but giving him a bigger role was a mistake. He lacks the quick wit and timing of writer Smith and it makes the show much less interesting. Hearing Smith tell amusing anecdotes is always a good time but listening to Mewes ramble is for the most part boring and distracting.

It appears to be an honest portrayal and for me turns into two related tales.The first (and intended) is as discussed in the other reviews - the cultural differences between China and Western business practices etc.The second (and perhaps unintended) is the more interesting. Mr Clissold and his cohorts may be skilled in the arts of investment opportunities, portfolio management etc but they appear a little inept at actual business management.A fascinating read nonetheless - but not all the lessons learned are due to East/West differences, most of the disasters could or rather should have been avoided through good business practice. An MBA (or investement banking background) does not a manager make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. China explains a lot","review":"Having just returned from a 3-week trip to China, reading Mr. China helped explain a lot about what I had seen.

Mr. China illustrates how wrong that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"I found this book a terrific glimpse of one man's experience investing in China. Tim Clissold spent several years traversing mainland China trying to get in on the ground floor with the entrepenuers driving China's economic boom.

Yet there are not many books that depict such tales from the first narrator viewpoint. Many are dry textbook-like, how-to narrations. Thus, Mr China provides a refreshing look into the realities of doing business in this vast land of 1.3 billion. I particularly enjoyed the story on the investment in Five Star Brewery- perhaps because it is a tale about a consumer product which makes it easier to grasp.However, I do not understand why Mr Clissord kept using \\"arrived back from \\" when he could have used \\"returned from\\". Perhaps, it is due to his long stay in China that he started formulating his thoughts in Chinese?It would also help if Mr Clissold could explain in greater detail the hierarchial structure of the Chinese governmental bodies.On the whole, this is book worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is my shipment","review":"I have not received my drafting pencils yet.

The CD case itself is beautiful, with hieroglyphs on the inside, and the tracks are straight out of the movie. There are a few re-mixes of the original songs, which are ok, but I like the original ones better.

The non-movie songs are alright, but they just don't quite have the same feel as those that were in the movie.

Including this, there are three things I wanted to know since February but never did: A theatrical trailer of \\"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego,\\" the running time of Disney's \\"Tarzan,\\" and the date release of the home video of \\"The Prince of Egypt.\\" I'd recommend this soundtrack to anyone as soon as the video comes out.

I've always loved Hans Zimmer, but I was not familiar with Steven S. I have aspirations of becoming a film composer, and this provided me with the inspiration to create something so clear and precise that you could see the movie through the music itself.It's not necessarily about the melody or pop songs that make the movie 'commercially' popular, but the texture and shape. It allows the listener to visualise and personally involve yourself in the music with out you realising. I can truly tell myself that I have achieved all I have ever wanted when I can communicate as effectively as a film can.... but through music. Then I may have half as much talent as Steven has shown in this amazing soundtrack.After listening to this soundtrack, all the hard work that I have done pays off, to think that someday, I may be that good!

Unless the author can also prove, I suppose, that the hundreds of thousands of cronies who did their part for the holocaust- down to the truck drivers who shipped zyklon B and engineers who designed the ovens- also read and plagiarized from Ibsen, his findings serve only to titilate rather than shed any serious light on the workings and motives of the Nazi murder machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death metal is for losers.

This book really makes you think about the everyday interactions in a tavern. An example is the power and control the bartender has over the customer in regards to the TV. Depending on what channel the TV is on, it can strike up many different conversations among many different types of people.

From the start, this book says it like it really is and does not waste any time describing the comments and actions that these characters make. Within the first chapter you can really feel where these characters are coming from and why they feel the way they do. From this book I learned a lot of things about how people in society think the way they do and how ethnicity really does matter.

Such as black men and homosexuality to the perceived role of black women in their significant other's lives.Taling at Trena's is a must have for any Sociology, Psychology, and Liberal Arts major or anyone who enjoys a humorous, thought-provoking, interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Captures Genuine Atmosphere at local tavern","review":"Reuben A. Buford May's book, Talking at Trena's, is a well-written, interesting, and unique look into an African-American tavern located on the south side of Chicago. May focuses on the interaction and connection of regular patrons of the tavern that is dominated by middle-aged working-class men. The book gives insight into topics of social and cultural significance as it analizes the everyday \\"man gossip.\\" May's book is a well-rounded account of topics such as humor, race, marriage, and sex that occur in a male dominated atmosphere. Reuben A. Buford May's book is a must read for anyone interested in the sociological and cultural aspects of not only African-American males but males in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comical and Enlightening!","review":"It has been said that Talking at Trena's is a snapshot of life inside an African American Tavern, which the patrons use as their safe haven from the hassles of everyday life. I, however, believe that this \\"snapshot\\" is an inaccurate depiction. I believe you would need a camcorder to capture the images of the tavern. The characters are dramatic and ever-changing (in respone to the changes around them). A snapshot would only include a fleeting, brief moment inside this social establishment. It is these changes and situations of life outside the tavern that bring the patrons to become the complex, interesting characters that they are. Talking at Trena's in both humorous and enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very rich and intimate look at a queen","review":"I read Abundance about six months ago. I still think about the portrayal of Marie Antoinette in the novel. It is a very interesting work of historical fiction. Covering her life from the journey to France to become the queen, until her execution, it is as if you live the experience through Marie's eyes.Blaine Zaid author of \\"The Gaines Agenda\\" and \\"Weight Loss for your Nook and Kindle\\"The Gaines Agenda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abundance of detail","review":"I adore historical fiction that goes into great detail about what people wore and ate and bathed and thought about. Abundance is written from the narrow respective of Marie Antoinette herself and therein lies much of the book's strengh (or weakness, according to your prespective). It was wrenching to follow the Queen from the dream-like life at Versailles to the horrors of the Revolution.The chilling scene where the crowd outside her prison cries \\"kiss the lips\\" gives a better feel for the atmosphere of the Revolution than piles of history books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Depiction of the Queen in Fiction","review":"I knew I would love this book when I started it, but when I was finished I loved it a thousand times more. The book accurately depicts the life of Marie Antoinette, all that the public saw and perhaps some intimate moments never yet proved. You really do feel for the queen, the pains she suffered, the neglect of her bashful husband, her mother's hurtful nagging at not consumating her marriage, the resentment of many of the French courtiers, and the eventual hatred of the people of France. I also loved how many chapters were used for the real correspondance between herself and others, particularly her mother. For anyone who knows the history and still despises the queen you must read \\"Marie Antoinette: The Journey\\" by Antonia Fraser, then this one. I guarantee your opinion of her will change. READ IT EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mccin","review":"This is the second time I have attempted to listen to the audio book and both times failed to be engaged. I found the single narration point of Marie Antoinette to be very limiting especially since she came across as self-absorbed, child-like, and irresponsible I kept hoping to get other views, expanding dicussions on the events but never did.The author describes some emotions, rather than evoking them which left me feeling like i was reading a 13 year olds journal, very distracting.The language and descriptions used were rich and flowery but when used to discuss such mundane topics as her dress, hair, and the need for entertainment I couldn't help but feel the words were wasted within the story, creating prettiness rather than intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off with her wig","review":"\\"Ahab's Wife\\" by the same author was probably one of the best books I've ever read. There was so much depth of thought from the main character about her life and life in general. I was expecting something similar with \\"Abundance\\", but didn't find it. This book is interesting in that it presents Marie Antionette's life from her perspective, a human perspective complete with emotions, but those emotions seem thin in many instances. For instance, after the first dauphin dies, there is a lack of grief on her part. I have lost a son, I know that the emotions it causes creep into everything you think and do forever. I liked the side of Marie that wanted privacy and cared about the good of the \\"people\\". There was a lot to like about her in general. Overall, it was an entertaining book and it made me appreciate the person who Marie Antionette was more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marie's World","review":"I loved reading this book. It held my attention - probably more so because I'm not a man and enjoyed escaping into her luxurious and ridiculously unimportant goings on. With a small orbit of friends and family - she seemed out of touch with her country for most of the book until it became a painfully obvious lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Boring","review":"This is painfully hard to get into, drags, and moves at the pace of a snail.

I listened to the audio version of this wonderful book, it was very nicely done. Creating interest, different voices, music at the start of each chapter. The reader does a wonderful job at the frivolity of Marie's statements, and the Motherly tone of the Empress."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew it would be great!","review":"As a fan of Sena Jeter Naslund's wonderful writing, I awaited the arrival of Abundance with anticipation. I was not disappointed. It is beautifully written, sensitive to the young queen as she moves through the various stages of her life, and is true to her real character as revealed in her actual letters to her mother, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria. I was delighted with the first person approach that Naslund dares to use. Naslund's treats the queen's last days and moments with dignity, as Marie herself is said to have lived them.Bravo to the writer for another fabulous novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Drivel","review":"Ms. Naslund has done the impossible - she's made Marie Antoinette boring! She is portrayed as floating aimlessly through her life while thinking kindly, flowery thoughts about everything from her handkerchief (which has too much lace and not enough fabric to blow her nose on) to her little plum colored shoes (that served her so well.) I promise you, when Marie Anotinette was standing on the scaffold, she was NOT trying to decide if the color of light is \\"more silvery or gold\\". By the end of this book I was ready to put my own head in the guillotine just to stop the pain.If you want exceptional research and well-written biography, read Antonia Fraser's \\"Marie Antoinette: The Journey\\". If you want page-turning historical fiction, try Victoria Holt's \\"The Queen's Confessions\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling -- I Couldn't Put it Down","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift and didn't think I'd enjoy it since I hadn't been able to finish Ahab's Wife by the same author. However, I found I couldn't put this book down. I literally carried it with me to read in the car when accompanying others on errands the last week of December. Not only was the writing excellent, the characterizations held my interest, the historical details were fascinating, and the plot (even though I had an idea how it would turn out) was captivating. Reading this book made me curious to learn more about French and European history and more about Marie Antoinette and her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was disappointed in this portrayal of Marie Antoinette.

This book is written more for the Jew who has no knowledge of Judaism rather than for those Jews who do.This book has kabbalistic themes running through it.

We have been wiping out our enemies for many tens of millennia, and most of us are doubtless capable in the wrong circumstances of continuing the practice.

This novel has no conslusion and certainly no resolution, however, I came away as satisfied as I ever have.

I must admit, as a 24-year old male with very little emotions when it comes to reading novels, I was surprised at myself as the tears openly flowed while reading the final ten pages.

I'm not a reader who looks for an easy ending, but I do want a satisfying one, whether that ending be happy or sad, whether it answers all questions or leaves some of them unanswered. In the Lake of the Woods, however, exhibits no emotional power. Essentially a character study, it fails to give us a character TO study. Both John and his wife, Kathy, are shallow people and not developed enough to care what happens to them or their marriage. I don't care if Kathy met a lover, was risky, or was killed. Nor do I care who killed her. Had O'Brien done his job, I would have cared deeply. I'm sure we're meant to identify with John Wade's anguish and pain, but I just couldn't. He wasn't real for me.

As part of our work requirements, we are required to read this novel and do a reprt on specific features in the novel. I feel as a book itself it was a an awful novel. The book constantly jumps back and forwards, making it extemly difficult for the reader to understand the plot. I had to read the book three times before i even understood what was happening, and then i had to reaqd it another 2 times after that, so that i could make notes on the novel. Although i liked the way the book didn't have a ending, rather just a number of hypotthesis, I feel that book was rubbish and when i have finished writing my reprt i will be throwing the book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, horrible","review":"There is some utterly beautiful writing in this novel, and its author takes bold new approaches in telling a gripping story. It all works; sometimes extremely well, sometimes a bit tenuously, but on the whole it works. The small cast of characters are portrayed with incredible depth and seem very real.My only reservations are that some of the war scenes take a pretty strong stomach to get through, as does O'Brien's use of the phrase \\"making yum-yum\\" when describing a passionate encounter between the protagonist and his wife. Both the violence and this phrase sickened me about equally, but if these things don't deter you, it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Mind of PTSD","review":"As always, Tim O'Brien's writing style is amazing, surprising. His structure is enjoyable to read, and re-read. I'll likely read this book again within the next few years just for the great description and prose.However, as much as I enjoyed the style, it took me a few chapters to get into the story. Had I not previously read a couple of O'Brien's other books, I might not have granted it as much time as I did. Luckily, I did give the book a chance because as soon as the story picked up, I was into it.O'Brien's veteran experiences provide a wonderful backbone for his characters and John Wade (the protagonists) is interesting and real. As an Iraq War veteran, I found a number of traits in the character that I could understand, and a couple I could relate too. At times I was surprised but the plot and I enjoyed where the winding trail led me.In the Lake of the Woods is a good book and I'd recommend it to anybody wanting to understand the inner working of a PTSD mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary masterpiece","review":"To be honest, I can't believe this hasn't been turned into a movie yet.Very rarely does a book cause envy in a reader. While reading this book, I constantly thought to myself, \\"Wow. Why couldn't I come up with something so clever and thought-provoking?\\" O'Brien's writing is flawless; it's hilarious, moving, shocking, and beautiful. Not only that, but the style in which the story is told, morsel of information here, a tiny hint there, leading suggestions that rival the best mystery novels of all time. After reading the book twice, I still haven't convinced myself of the ending. It's simply incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a 10 because of TTTC","review":"This book certainly desreves a 10: it's far better than at least 97% of other literature. However, it can't hold a candle to such moving works as O'Brien's own The things they Carried or Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (my reviews of which see), both of which I wanted to rate higher. This book would be the pinnacle of any other author's career (and, if not for TTTC, might be considered the best work ever on Vietnam), but for O'Brien it is only a great book among Greater books. I eagerly anticipate his next, and hope his Nobel comes soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium embodied","review":"This was a tough book to stick through. I found it confusing and repetitous...and upon finishing the book I was left feeling empty because the story never resolved itself. The book looked at the raise and detremental fall of a Politician in Minnesota and how this lead to the disappearence of his wife. It leads the reader through many confusing hypothesis and court depositions to really come up with nothing in the end. I found myself quite disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes sense to me","review":"This book dances around the idea of \\"What is the Truth?\\" \\"What is Illusion?\\" And \\"What happens when you can no longer fool people or yourself?\\"It dances from guesses to quotes to \\"objective\\" facts to narrative in an attempt to find this truth.I had no trouble with the lack of a conclusive ending. I think that the author wanted us to take a journey with a man who had a certain history........and by being on the journey, know the man and what he had done.The point being: It is hard to believe the atrosities that were committed in Vietnam (but they happened)........and even harder to believe the atrosities committed in the Lake of the Woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed with this book.","review":"This novel does not have enough thematic substance or emotional resonance to carry our interest. The symbolism is heavy handed and the protagonist lacks sympathy. His parents are charicatures, as are the other supporting characters. Kathy, the missing wife, is not developed as a character enough nor is their marriage compelling enough to induce our interest in their fate as a couple or as individuals.The Vietnam War flashbacks lack currency since O'Brien has used more powerful vehicles before. I wanted to like this book because I appreciate O'Brien's vision and humanity, but the book is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent mystery novel.","review":"Tim O'Brien seems to keep coming up with better and better books each time he publishes one. _In The Lake Of The Woods_ rasies many questions. One of which is can you really hide or run from the past? John Wade tries to do both of those. After being involved in the My Lai Massacre, John tries to change his records so no one will know he was there. But as always, there was some sort of leak. John also tries to run by not admitting to it. More questions raised by the book would be what happens when two people love each other very much? Could it lead to death, or just disapearence? The way Tim handles this book is excellent. He presents the reader with evidence, and forces them to draw their on conclusions. Mr. O'Brien himself doesn't know exactly how the book ends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Held No Appeal for Me","review":"I REALLY didn't like this book. I don't know if it was the ambiguity (I usually like a good mystery), but I think it was more that it was the characters. I didn't like her and I didn't like him. I loved Tim O'Brien's writing, and will give the author another chance, but this story just didn't hold any appeal for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Lake of the Woods Book Review","review":"This book was selected for my book group as this month's choice. I have Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried\\" several times and was really looking forward to this book. I can't say that I am disappointed, but that I am perplexed. While I found the chapters recalling John Wade's experience in Vietnam compelling, the Hypothesis chapters and the Evidence chapters left me wanting something more conclusive.In part, the chapters labeled \\"Evidence\\" made me think that Wade was actually on trial -- literally, though he was figuratively. As a result, I went through a large part of the book thinking that the truth would emerge.All told, I'm still putting the pieces together.

But this story is not entertaining (it is painful), contains more of the same old \\"aren't we Americans horrible\\" media line, and had nothing fresh or revealing.

The red and the blue buttons are okay. The orange button supposes to pop up when you press it to one side, but it feel like it will pop up once you slightly touch it. The yellow button would not twist back to its original position. Therefore, you need to turn the yellow button back to the original position again before it pops up again.

Unfortunately, it's all too fleeting and we are left with the most boring characters running around LA streets at night doing nothing special.

Once the three college students enter the twilight zone around After Dark, you are propelled into an atmospheric and seedy world. The art direction and photography is well done, the urban night scenes being lit by pools of orange and blue to great effect. The cockroach-chewing night club manager will make you laugh.

With the capable talent of Greg Cannon, Oscar Winner makeup genius, a writhing Grace Jones (A View to A Kill) becomes living artwork and a blood-chilling monster. Character actor Billy Drago (True Blood) adds to the movie's artistic flair by playing a psychotic, white-haired albino gang leader with vengence on his mind. Many sets are bathed in primary-colored lighting. The supporting actors' costumes are designed to emphasize the atmosphere of this campy vampire movie. And the clever lack of dialog for Grace Jones adds to her character's mystique.This movie is fun and at the same time very stylish.

First of all it stars Billy Drago as an albino thug. Secondly, it stars Grace Jones who was probably born to play the mute but imposing vampiric dancer.The film is surprsingly stylish with stylish green and pinkish hues adding to a strange landscape. This film reminds me of Martin Scorcese's AFTER HOURS. Like AFTER HOURS this has a surreal world just around the corner from normality where oddballs lie in wait and strange events lead into other strange events.The film is not without its faults. The acting can be suspect, though not bad enough to spoil the film, and it can be quite cheesey at times. But, then again, I think this adds to its charm.

McCullough knows what she's talking about. She covers nutrition, exercise, health cost, typical diseases, what to expect, and - of course - a discussion on when is the best time to let your friend go. Housebreaking can be a problem for some seniors, and McCullough recommends bringing out the crate. Certain problems that seniors are prone to, such as going blind or deaf, are discussed, as well as how to help your dog cope. Her practicality and compassionate approach to canine senior citizens, who deserve to lounge about in the sunshine, comes through clearly.

In any case even the most lovely sentence cannot make make the banal extraordinary, though the book seemed like a 350+ page hard fought attempt to do so.I wanted to like this book, and I wish that I had, but it was choppy and uninteresting. Not, I think, worthy of such a high prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"The whole book is about horrible people who suffer horrible things. I never sympathized with any of the characters. I continued reading the book because I thought it had to get better (it had great reviews), but it never did.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don'tWasteTime","review":"Inheritance of Loss (I capitalize only because literary tradition insists on it) is a stupid book about ordinariness. It's mostly about Indian people (in India and Manhattan), people who eat gobs of flesh (one loves a pet dog), and are enamored with the West. Oh yes, there's a brief love affair that's scuttled by politics. And that's about it. The story is just plain stupid. I recommend no one waste time (like I did) in reading it.Kiran Desai's obviously a good writer, but the story reeks! What a waste of talent!Regards, mg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of Time","review":"Very dissapointing and very boring. Never could get into the book.

This book was assigned for Eng World Lit at Tennessee Technological University by teacher, Linda J. Null. She also assigned another gross book, that the chair for the English dept. Homer Kemp has no problem with. I previewed the book for my son, since we care about how he is educated, and found the book just plain nasty. The rape of a 14 year old girl is described and if that isn't bad enough, its described from the view of some pedophile watching in a closet also describing his repugnant physical reaction. What is educational about that?Additionally, the book has a character describing how he is (forgive me but its in the book) picking feces out of his anus with his fingers while trying to defecate...again, call me crazy, but how is that literature??? ISN'T ANY ONE CHECKING THESE TEACHERS CHOICE OF BOOKS????? Apparently not. So, be your kids parent and check for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal is an overstatement!","review":"I am surprised that Ms. Desai won the Bookers for this book. It is very poorly written with a lot of cliches and panders to the stereotypes of the Western readers. It is really a sad play wherein she mixes the Gorkha rebellion with a stodgy morbid angry ICS judge and a cook's son in NY. Well - she has tried her best to thread these lives together amid a tumultous political climate - but the thread lacks conviction and unity. The characters are absolutely horribly done - no depth whatsover! I guess the only character that struck out as even a little interesting is the cook and the dead wife of the judge. Ms. Desai tried to mingle a Rushdie and a Mistry -- and has miserably failed. Dont waste your time or money on this. Better to watch Rambo and come out just as empty as reading this book. Except -- u are not disappointed with the former :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"This book was like torture. So boring and I could have cared less about the characters. I tried really hard to get into it but I swear every time I tried to read more than 10 pages I fell asleep or couldn't even figure out what the author was trying to tell me. I never made it past the midpoint of the book. I saw someone picking it up in the bookstore the other day and told them \\"don't waste your time or your money\\". Honestly how did this book win awards ? The only award it should win is \\"The Sleeping Pill Award\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not to be crass, but what a piece of crap","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. I had to read this for a class on Border Literature, otherwise I would have never finished this. There are so many cliches, heavy-handedness, and it is SO PREACHY! It TELLS and absolutely does not SHOW. Everyone is in their head having some cliche \\"inner struggle\\" but very little action takes place. Dare I say that this book is also offensive at many points. Colonialism in India (and everywhere) is terrible, and Desai makes absolutely every Western character ignorant, racist, and selfish. She makes the notion that the everyone of the Western World is evil, a concrete notion. She never objects it. I cannot believe this won the Man Booker Prize. Twilight is probably better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly boring","review":"I love Indian culture. And I was certain I would be fascinated by this book. But instead, I found it unbearable. Incredibly dull, slow-moving plot with unbelievable characters. It was a painstaking read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very negative book on India and immigration","review":"A very depressing book with a completely unsatisfying ending. The stream of conscience writing was also not effective and mostly just confusing. There are many books about India and most of them have some kind of sad aspect, but this just makes it look awful, and it makes the US look awful on top of that. Very little consideration for the beautiful things in life and the harmony that comes of chaos in India. Only two characters were any good and the other ones we just wanted to get lost. The family dog was the best person in the whole book.Read \\"What a Body Remembers\\" by Shauna Singh Baldwin if you want a story about India that is both sad and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew! Finished....","review":"Well, this won the Booker Prize. But so what? By page 175 I realized the story was not going anywhere... What some reviewers may have termed \\"vivid,\\" I found repetitive. Instead of lively and insightful glimpses into the character's lives, the book goes 'round and 'round the same tedious situations. And none of the situations are positive or uplifting.I don't foolishly think that great literature is always cheerful, on the contrary tragedy - as handed down from the Ancient Greeks -holds the highest place in literature. But this book is not even a good tragedy, it simply drags along in a hopeless and apathetic manner very much like the lives of its characters.It should not take so much paper and ink to tell us about characters who are vapid, selfish, and surly."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed!","review":"It's very rare for me to put a book down, but with this one, I just had to.

On pretty much every other level, this novel disappoints. The storyline is haphazard and random, and stylistically, it makes for very exhausting reading. The paragraphs are discombobulated. Overloaded with onomatopea, conversational at one point, bombastic the next, The Inheritance of Loss is very difficult to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a lover of fiction set in India and an avid reader of books that win the Booker prize, this book had me very disappointed. There seemed to be no point, no closure, too many different tangents and characters. She seemed to be doing a poor imitation of Rushdie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling somewhat cheated","review":"Like many other reviewers here I was expecting the goods from Kiran Desai. Not just because the Booker Prize committee usually picks good books, but because Ms Desai hails from a rich tradition of good writing (her mother is Anita Desai and there are countless Indian writers who are excellent today).Sadly I was disappointed. The prose is rich to the point of verbose and her characters are unengaging. Beyond a certain point, you wish she'd move on and increase the pace of the novel. It almost felt as if the lush descriptions (which were overly detailed if you ask me) were written as if they were trying hard to impress; instead of cohering together to form a seamless story. This would suggest the novel itself were written in bouts of seperate inspiration- I agree with another reviewer who said the book was only readable a few chapters at a time.Unfortunately, this leaves me wondering if the next Booker Prize winner is worth reading at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so much praise for this book?","review":"don't you hate it when you keep on reading, thinking it will get better... and it never does. a few sentences scattered throughout were poetic, therefore i give it 2 stars. sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"Like \\"reading\\" a slow train wreck - achingly dull and painful at the same time. There is no effort to make the reader care about any of the characters - do you really want to feel only alternating disdain and pity all the way through any book? Surely that could not have been the writer's intention?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for it to deserve the accolades...","review":"After more than a month of reading this book I began to question my tenacity, mindful of my sister's admonition, \\"You're old enough to put a book down if you don't like it!\\" I agree with other readers here--there was perhaps something beguiling about the occasional lyrical turn of phrase, and I would even go so far as to say the characters were somewhat intriguing. However, the desultory threads were far from woven into a cohesive tapestry. And even though I stuck it out until the end when things attempted to come together, I found myself bitter for having wasted my time!!While I cannot pan it altogether, it was so lukewarm that I must say I question the awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbook, but hard to recommend...","review":"Every once in awhile, I come across a book that when I have finished reading it, I find that I truly enjoyed and yet would not be able to recommend it to others. THE INHERITANCE OF LOSS is one of those books.This is really more of a character-driven/cultural story than anything else. There is no \\"plot\\" to follow. The author does a great job in her imagery and descriptions, and I was quite interested in the characters, but sometimes that's not enough to interest other readers.If you are interested in plot driven stories, this is probably a 1 star book, otherwise I'll give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating languid prose, but not for everyone","review":"As with many books, this novel is not for everyone. The pacing like the prose is often languid, rich in detail and sentences crafted with all the care of a gourmet chef preparing a meal. The author has a story to tell, a complex multi-layered tale that shifts between continents and decades. However, almost by definition, dealing with characters who are trapped, whether by poverty or circumstance or habit the story will not move quickly or offer great grand shifts. This to be sure is not to every readers taste. Some may grow bored; others may find Desai's thick weave of prose less than appealing. There is nothing wrong with that; even some of the greatest writers of all time are not for everyone. How many people can't take Dickens or find Mann impenetrable. I found the book both well crafted and rewarding and would suggest those who do not mind taking their fiction at a slow pace, give this Booker award winner a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This won the Booker? Never mind the incoherent plot and the overwrought, kitschy, and syntactically challenged prose; the nasty taste in the mouth occasioned by the contempt in which Desai evidently holds every single character in the novel alone should have disqualified this from the running. Every character, major and minor, is shown to be unintelligent, unreflective, selfish, and preposterous. Desai's world is populated by people who show neither self-awareness nor empathy, and so exact none in the reader. But I suppose the Rushdie-esque burblings along with the exoticized cast and locale make for a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction in serious need of an editor","review":"Inheritance of Loss was one of our book club selections, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend the meeting where it was discussed. No matter. I didn't finish the book because it was simply too frustrating and painful to continue reading. The structure -- short, choppy sections on each page -- was to me like watching a dance video that never stops long enough on the dancers to appreciate what they're doing. What's worse, nothing happened that made me want to continue to the next sections and it was a downer the entire time I was reading it. I see from other reviews that some felt the downer mood continues right to the end. I read a lot and am willing to stick with a book if it doesn't grab my attention right from the start, but I'm afraid this one didn't have any redeeming qualities for me. Time is too precious to waste on books that I don't enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a big disappointment","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I suffered through it over several weeks hoping it would get better or something would happen that would make it more interesting (or more bearable). I finally gave up about 20 pages from the end. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters and didn't want to waste one more minute of my life to it. Extremely disappointing. I gave it two stars only because it's not the worst book I've ever read (but close)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this book but..........","review":"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wanted to enjoy this book, but found that impossible. The author loves words and uses them with elegance; but so many of these words are wasted. The characters and the plot languish in a sea of words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful Inheritance","review":"An excellently written account of characters caught up in the struggles of modern India to deal with separatist groups who suffer from lack of economic and educational opportunities and resort to violence in an attempt to overcome the real and perceived inequities of their society. An older generation that still harbors the prejudices of the British Raj are powerless in this world and painfully come to realize that what they had taken for granted as their social rights has marked them for particular persecution by the insurgents. Desai conveys this situation through multiple points of view, all somewhat sympathetic, and does not offer any solutions, historical or personal.Biju's struggle as an undocumented person working in the restaurants of New York City engages the American reader and provides insight into our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written novel.","review":"This novel, \\"The Inheritance of Loss\\", is wonderfully written. Desai uses the text in this novel as one would use text in poetry. The histories and interactions of the characters are well executed and sometimes intensely dramatic. This novel depicts how those who are raised under a colonizing nation must either adapt to the post-colonial nation or remain isolated and unwanted.A somewhat challenging read, but a beautifully written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated and Boring!","review":"Not an expert but I think this book is highly over rated. Its not only wordy, lacks to keep readers' attention and stereotypes characters but also found it to be offensive at times. To the writer's credit, the story does pick up towards the end but its still not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I didn't know the characters in this book or care about them at all.

Not an enjoyable read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong and quickly dissipates so... don't bother.","review":"I used to love the Booker prize short list - used to try to read them all before the prize was annouced but lately......?This book opens with some beautiful, lush writing that draws you in then it gets too clever with its structure and flash backs, etc, to bother to sustain the writing quality. So you shouldn't bother to start it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"I found this book very hard to read and understand. I will be honest, I really couldn't finish the book. I just didn't find it captivating. There was nothing in the book urging me to read. I tried forcing myself to finish it due to the Booker Prize, but to no avail. I like books with a story to tell that are both thrilling and entertaining. This book offered me neither. But to be fair, I hated reading Shakespeare back in school, and found his books hard to understand and not entertaining at ALL! Ask me today, and I'd tell you Shakespeare's books are a masterpiece. Maybe I need to wait a few more years, and understand life better to really appreciate 'The Inheritance of Loss.' Otherwise, why would it have won the Booker Prize?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to finish","review":"This is the first time I have ever read a book that I felt disinclined to finish. The only reason I did was to see what happened to that poor wife, but we never really do! It was as though there was no story, so she had to fill the pages with over-description just to make the book more than a short story. (OK, we get it, it was wet, rivers do that) My entire book club rated it very poorly. I usually keep every book I buy, but this one went straight to the charity bin. Who on earth decides these prize winners?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, realistic","review":"A powerful novel, which kept me up reading every night. At once so many dimensions-a political novel, tackling issues of class, prejudice and race; one of the few works portraying the realities of the illegal immigrant underclass in America-and the hopes and dreams that started it all; the self sabotage that destroys families.We read all the time about the success stories of immigrants to the US, but most people are unaware of the immigrants who are hopelessly trapped in poverty and who are worse off than where they left. The portrayal of the visa issue system is stunningly accurate, having observed this first hand for myself, in several countries. Not for those who view the world with rose tinted glasses, or don't want to accept the realities of the lives of many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful painful painful","review":"This book offers a multiple-varied perspective of the world of India. A world that is backwards, even to its inhabitants, and often only offers a small slice of what the world is actually like.I had heard so many good reviews about this book, but it felt too much like a literature class exercise that one muddles through. So I stopped reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Beautiful Novel","review":"The Inheritance of Loss is a truly beautiful novel. The themes Kiren Desai explores in this story, family dynamic and national identity, are almost cliche when it comes to Indian literature, but Desai pulls it off, and beautifully so. These characters will get inside you, their hopeless dreams will become your hopeless dreams, their deep regrets will become your deep regrets, their mountain will become your mountain. The rich and evocative prose is perfect for the subject matter, and the story unfolds in a natural way which will keep you turning pages. This novel strongly reminded me of Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, which is a very good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Booker Winner??","review":"Who determines these award winners? Do they bother reading the book? How were all the typos missed?

Surely they can do better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Winners are losers for me","review":"A friend gave me a most interesting book review magazine for the holidays and one of the most covered books was\\" The Inheritance of Loss. \\"I noted it had won the Booker award and the description was appealing to me.Alas, I found the book tedius and not at all what I expected. I've travelled extensively and have lived on several continents. I recognize the author's intent , I think, to introduce the reader not only to the description of Tibet/India, but to the character of that part of the world; a world we do not know; a world so changed and so rapidly changing; a world of traditions and customs, class and behavior.For me, this failed miserably and I felt as if the author was using a superb vocabulary in a vacume. Perhaps, not finishing it did an injustice to the content but James Joyce she is not. I think I will keep away from Booker award winners and stick with just good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like The Great Big Loss.","review":"After reading the first 14 pages of this book, I had to put it down. I usually force myself to finish a book even if I lose interest initially, but with Desai's choppy prose and overly pretentious style, I think I'm doing myself a favor by sitting this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like wading through mud in the fog.","review":"I found it neither interesting or entertaining.The story line is constantly interupted and in places almost kalidescopic.I found that too much attention paid to what seemed to be superfluous detail was a debilitating detraction from the story which I found difficult to connect with.The characters were one dimensional and the plot unconvincing.I do not like having to \\"study\\" and in some cases re-read each sentence in order to discern the plot which by the end of chapter 6 I got past caring anyway.I am sorry but it did not deliver for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"I started to read this as a member of a book club. 30 pages in and I was yawning with boredom at the endless flowery descriptions that added nothing to the story.

I guess if you write about politically correct topics you can win awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inheritance of Loss","review":"Full disclosure, I have not completed this book, but I am enjoying it immensely and am about a quarter of the way through it. I was impressed with the fact in won the Booker (what's the deal with Mann?) and that Desai attended my MA Alma Mater, Hollins Univerisity, which has a terrific undergrad and graduate writing program. This is a beautifully crafted book and I appreciate the movement of the narrative from different locales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Can't get into this, at all.

Ms Desai does not develop the story or its characters, in fact there is no story! I read the book hoping for something to happen with every turn of the page..but it was handicapped all the way.The choice of Kalimpong and Newyork is a good move on the authors part, she gets 1 star for that and negative 4 stars for the disaster this book is otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been a short story","review":"This book dragged on and on and on. The entire novel consists of character development until the last couple of chapters. This book ends in the same style as her book \\"Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard\\"; there is no resolution, but it doesn't seem at all like she takes this tack in order to leave things up to the reader... she merely ends the book about 3 chapters shy of the actual end of the story. Unlike Hullabaloo, however, this book wasn't much fun, wasn't very clever, blah blah blah. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I learned a little bit about Indian history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"This book was chosen as our local book club read. Based on the reviews on this site a number of us were excited about reading this book. Almost immediately I became disillusioned with this book! I decided I must give it a chance and read half of this book. I finally quit!!! It was laborious to read, it had a very weak plot, and was very choppy. I was definitely not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling story, contrived characters","review":"This book is rambling and lacks cohesion. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters, since they appear so randomly and scattered that you'll barely have a chance to get to know them in depth. Rather, they appear to be the author's puppets in what should instead have been a nonfiction work: one that provides a scathing sociological commentary about the cross-generational legacy of emotional violence. The writing just doesn't flow . . . don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore...","review":"One wonders how some of these litterary prizes are awarded? Political correctness (by a woman, concerning minorities, etc) seems to be the norm. Or is it that the jury wants to show that THEY understand what's great and show us the public that we DON'T.The French awards are bad because there is little of value written in that language today. A group of snobs gathers at a fancy restaurnant and decide what the public should read: generally it misfires. Tthe English litterature is plentiful, yet the winnners mostly end up as duds.This one takes the cake. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost on me","review":"I agree with many of the recent poor reviews. This book is a chore to read - I felt like I needed to have a dictionary at hand every time I sat down to read this book.

The aspect of living in a non-native environment has been beautifully deal with and hats of to her for that. The book should appeal immensely to asians living in the United States, at least those who understand the complexity that is India. The fact that this country has every possible thought and ideology fighting for its space, everything from democracy to militant Maoism, is subtly shown. For the displaced reader it will invoke many thoughts and you will be the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way way way overrated","review":"This book was difficult to get through to say the least. 8 out of the 9 members in our book club couldn't/didn't finish it. The storyline simply wasn't compelling enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, do not walk, away from this book.","review":"I cannot believe this won a prize. I grabbed it off of the library shelf and the synopsis, along with the fact that it had won a prize, convinced me to read it. I will not fall for the Man Booker Prize emblem again. The story is absolutely depressing. Not one thing nice happens to any of the characters. Some people may claim that life is exactly as the book portrays it, however, I have a feeling they are far and few between because the majority of them would have long since committed suicide. Worst of all, there is no real end to this book. None of the characters find resolution or enlightenment. \\"What is my life? It's nothing. Better that it's gone.

Have we become so enthralled with cultural and political diversity that we applaud a poorly done work of fiction simply because it attempts to address the humanity of political issues never minding literary prowess.

Initially I questioned my taste and ability to appreciate a Booker winner but then.... what the heck! I don't like it, I don't like it. Some of the writers that won the Booker have become my all time favorites. Ian McEwan brings out one masterpiece after another and I eagerly wait for his next work, Arundhati Roy, even though does not write fiction anymore still touches my heart with every topical article she writes. And Margaret Atwood, John Updike etc. do not need commendations from me to be known as brilliant writers, who also one Bookers. Kiran Desai on the other hand according to me does not belong to the same league. The characters in this book are simply.... boring! There are many other good books out there for you to savor. Spend your precious time on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to its hype, unfortunately.","review":"I have been immersing myself in Indian novels lately. I looked forward to this one with much anticipation. However, although there were a few spots of truly brilliant writing, with wonderful insights, the novel fell flat most of the way through.The plot line in India was very weak, the characters did not really seem developed at all, particularly the girl, Sai. The only character with a little development was the grandfather, a most unsympathetic character. The plots involving Sai and Gyan, and Gyan and the insurgents, were especially weak points in this book.The plot involving the cook's son in America was much better developed, and frankly, was the only thing that redeemed this book at all.The book didn't end so much as it just kind of petered out from lack of steam. No conclusions, no nothing.Very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complex Tale","review":"Read the book and heard the author speak. Kiran Desai understands the undermining psychological and economic effects of colonialism on a country and on individuals. She writes with a deep understanding of what life as an immigrant is like in this country for many. Her characters are complex and there are no easy answers given. This is a book for grown ups who recognize the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"This was an excellent book! It takes place at an inn on the Pacific Northwest coast.

The poems I always enjoyed and could never forget, even at my current age of 31. Imagine my teacher's surprise when it was my turn to bring up a book to be read to the class, and I started spouting these poems. The other kids never looked at me the same again. Recently, I just happened to do a search for it, and here it is at Amazon, along with the other book (that I had no knowledge of..it was always the one book I remember). So after a hasty order, I'll be happy to add these to my collection of things to remember, and close another chapter in my own life and memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmares : Poems to trouble your sleep","review":"Ok, they aren't quiet that scary, but they do show another side of poetry.

I have stood by Sabbath through thick and thin and eagerly awaited their reunion - but this CD is nothing less than an embarrassment. The music is flat, offkey; Ozzie is a zombie attempting to make up for not being able to sing by screaming \\"f***\\" through the whole concert. The audience sings more than Oz. I was sorely disappointed - but I will always be a loyal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Overpublicized, and a discredit to Sabbath fans.","review":"The music isn't worth ep prices. The audience sings in places Ozzy should sing way too often. The 'f' word is used over and over again. There is little or no creativity exhibited in this compilation. The only worthwhile song is Selling My Soul. Hardly worth the price of a double CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Instrumentation......Totally ruined by Ozzy","review":"The first real live album from the original four members .....Tony, Geezer and Bill really lay it down heavy, sounding as tight as ever... WAR PIGS, the opener, is terrific and spine-tingling until Ozzy opens his mouth.....\\"F\\"-bomb after \\"F\\"-bomb, seems like every 4th measure, Ozzy shows how light-weight and totally vacuous this guy's head is....Believe me, folks , he was not like this in the 70's....Where for aught thou, friend Ozzy???I was really looking forward to this release, originally, but one listen and it went on Ebay......I have heard that there was going to be a cleaned up version because of all the complaints the label execs received...But I've yet to hear anymore about this. Be warned...Profanity galore, and way off key vocals completely ruin this noble effort from 3 of the 4 members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for only 2 new songs","review":"First of all your better off just buying all their cd's, cause there are good songs that aren't on this cd, second of all, The vocals on this cd aren't that great, Although the two new songs rock, they just don't make up for the high price, and there are just too many live albums out there with these songs on them. So find a friend who has this cd and barrow it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SAD MEETING LEADING TO A EMBARASSING ALBUM...","review":"Fans sometimes can't see the truth. and keep giving this garbage a five-star rating. I Love SAbbath with Ozzy, always have, always will ! I own all their records with Ozzy (and with Dio). SO I can honestly say: this CD is horrible. THe band is totally without pace and tightness, agressiveness also is lacking here. Ozzy is losing his voice, Ward was always the weakest part (technically speaking)and is worst than ever. The sound of the recording is buffed, distorted, the audience is very high. The album is clearly overdubed in studio from beginning to ending. There's not here a true Sabbath fan will have to want. Ozzy's \\"SPEAK OF THE DEVIL\\" (1982) is one-hundred times better than this. I think TOny Iommi should finish Sabbath forever and form a new band, recruiting some big shot musician to share with him the burden of composing songs and starting a new project. Please, leave the Sabbath's myth intact while you still got time !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more new material","review":"Reunion: a careful regurgitation of Sabbath's more popular titles Iron Man, Paranaoid...yada yada yada.

Growing up and listening to Paranoid and other Sabbath albums really got me excited when this came out. Boy what a shame it had to be this bad. Ozzy yelling the F word every time Iommi goes into a guitar solo is a little too much. The songs and the concert would have been much better if this had not been done. As for the new songs, well they don't even come close to matching the fire that Iron Man, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Snowblind have. The only reason I didn't rate this any lower is out of respect to the band. I think they may need to think about hanging it up once and for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY ARE STILL IRON MEN!!!!!!!","review":"They are back and louder than ever, this CD shows that they still have it in them, sure they f@#^ up a little, but that just makes it feel more like the real thing. I love how Ozzy make the crowd sing, and how he gets everyone to join in. The two studio tracks are incredible as well. Especially \\"selling my soul\\", which is done superbly. IF U LIKE SABBATH, U MUST OWN THIS ALBUM!!!!!! AND IF U ARE JUST STARTING, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM TO BEGIN WITH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The better show of all times...","review":"Great!!! The best Black Sabbath's live cd. \\"Iron Man\\" shows how much power has Black Sabbath Reunion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album","review":"Let me make something clear. I am a new Sabbath listener, and I regret not having listened to them a little earlier (though I am young). I'm appalled by Ozzy's continuous use of the F word all the time. For God's sake, he has 3 children of his own already. Does he let them hear this kind of music? The Sabbath songs are good though, great in fact. Iommi is a great guitarist. However, I reccomend this album to hardcore Sabbath fans only. Buy the original recordings and you won't have to listen to all the annoying clapping and the public singing the songs for Ozzy. The only thing that really makes this CD worth getting is the 2 new songs, especially \\"Psycho Man\\" (which is the first song to have ever given me the creeps). I know one thing for sure though, I'm going out to buy something like \\"Paranoid\\" (CD) soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with the last review..This STINKS!","review":"OZZY with his constant garbage dialogue throughout the set ruins it for the listener. If the music was played the way they used to...he wouldn't need to try so hard to get audience participation. Just another low point in Ozzy's career. With all the swearing and everything...Ozzy sound like a total loser!Save your money. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great taste of live Sabbath!","review":"I have heard most of these songs before, but they sound better than ever on this live album that was recorded last year in England! One of the two new tracks \\"Psycho Man\\" is so good it could give \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"War Pigs\\" a run for their money.

I can play every note off of the first album. I love these guys. And if I had to pick one album for a friend to buy, this would be it. It doesn't have all of their best stuff, (no Sympton of The Universe) and I really don't like Dirty Women, and Ozzy jabbers a little too much. So it only get's 4 stars. It does have the best version I've ever heard of Electric Funeral ( my favorite Sabbath tune). It doesn't have any of the lame ballads that people have always tried to sell me. It does have a lot of their best stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The overdue reunion album, still waiting for more.","review":"This was a great disc I picked up on the day of release, new black sabbath with the original line up, unthought of for so long. All the classics with Ozzy. Now I keep waiting and hoping someday they will get together and do a new full album, but hope is shrinking. The two new songs are OK, Pscyhoman sounding more like recent Ozzy songs, but Selling my Soul sounds more like the Iommi riffs of past. Must have CD for the sabbath fan, the first official live release endorsed by the group with Ozzy on vocals...20 years after his leaving. Live at Last has been around for years, but was never endorsed by the band, and Live Evil, although good in its own right for DIO fans, just is not Ozzy. So Get this, its Sabbath at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but Ozzy ruins it","review":"What's here is awesome, but Ozzy ruins it all by dropping the F-bomb at least 10 times per track- it's no big deal at first, but wears thin quickly (\\"Come on! Clap your f---ing hands!! You're not f---ing loud enough! I can't f---ing hear you!\\" etc.) If you can get past that, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Sabbath: LOUD & PROUD!","review":"I'm a 41 year-old family man (with the wife and kids in a minivan) Sabbath's Reunion CD instantly takes me back as a twelve year old in 1970.

I love the crowd noise, it reminds me of a close Browns vs Steelers game late in the 4th quarter in Cleveland. Loud, passion, intensity. \\"Orchid/Lord of this World\\", \\"Into the Void\\" simply wails, Tony Ioammi's guitar is brillant. \\"Electric Funeral\\" off of 'Reunion' will stick in your head for days, you've been warned! My only gripe is Ozzy's constant use of the F word, c'mon Ozz, it's a little tired after the 20th plus time.

Plus the Tokyo Marui gun looks 10 times more realistic. [I love how Amazon lies and says it is better then the Tokyo Marui] They Should be sued. The crappy gun shoots 220 fps witch is ok for a low grade gun. It also shoots low grade bbs .12gs to be exact witch makes it much more inaccurate. Do not buy this gun!!!!!

I think the script is not as well written as it could have been for a story as powerful as this. Tyrone Power was a terrific actor and I have always loved his work. I think in this one the script is just somewhat weak.I don't understand why the studio picked unknown Cecile Aubry for the part of Miriam. She was simply terrible ---totally miscast. There must have been Hollywood actresses galore who would have jumped at the chance to be Ty Power's leading lady in this picture.All in all, it's a good story and, with that one exception, a good cast. I rented it this time, but will probably buy it to add to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound","review":"The sound on this Captain from Castile DVD was not what I had heard in the theatre!

My favorite Power movies are The Razor's Edge and Nightmare Alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Rendered Impotent","review":"\\"The Black Rose\\" = stinkweed. Its unprepossessing plot is shot full of holes. The poorly drawn characters are generally unsympathetic. Consider the atrocious casting of the film's leading roles: mature, very American Tyrone Power as a young Oxford scholar; juvenile French actress Cecile Aubry--as the (unconvincing) romantic interest--is about as sexually devastating as a kewpie or cabbage-patch doll. The film's leaden pacing, its prolix and unremarkable dialogue, its profound lack of credibility as well as its failure to appeal to any other emotions than this viewer's boredom and contempt result in my judging \\"The Black Rose\\" as one of the worst films Tyrone Power ever had the ill fortune to make.This otherwise undeserving DVD release does include a single interesting special feature: a Power Family Reunion featurette, in which Tyrone's son, two daughters, and second wife sit down and reminisce about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment! A collection of silly, dated, films.","review":"I always liked Tyrone Power, but this set is nothing but a collection of \\"B\\" movies. Some of the scenes are too funny to be believed and, while Power is a timeless hero, these producers, writers, & directors made him look ridiculous. The only really good film is Prince of Foxes. Blood and Sand should have died with Valentino. Captain from Castile may look good, but it is sadly dated by its heroic depiction of Cortes and the stereotyped portrayal of the Aztecs as if they were rich Redskins. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie of a great book.","review":"I first learned about this story by reading the book as a young lad.

I have the previous BOP albums with Lance King and like them very much. This album took a few turns to grow on me (it's a little dark) but after some time I found it great. The front and middle of this project is awesome while it dwindles a little on the back half. Let me tell you though, tracks 1, 4,and 5 are the best I have heard ever since Savatage's ... album is escaping me right now... oh.. Power of the Night album (crack my cranium and stuck on you stuff).

BOP has maintained their signature sound, but have become a little heavier! The new vocalist, John K., does a great job replacing Lance!

It is not just a journal of his life changing experience living off the land, however. It is also a book that contains very specific guidance on survival skills from pine tea to debris huts, baskets and cordage to fire, hunting and fishing to cooking and food storage, and many more, always emphasizing function over form. Thus, it's like two books in one. But it is his journal of survival and growth that will touch you; from his crying as he held the deer he had just killed, to his realization that when he eats an animal or a plant it becomes a part of him, and creates an obligation to do good in his life. While the survival information in the book is excellent, the journal portion tells, in Elbroch's words, \\"a story of learning rather than expertise.\\" I for one enjoyed that, and I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Story","review":"This is a great book that tells a great story of wilderness survival. Mark has some of the best field guides and this book can be added right along side those. Being that this is told from first person makes it that much more intersting.

Although it did get into the Iditarod, dog sledding, and blizzards, it really did not cover the culture of living in Alaska like I thought it would--and let's not even talk about the characters. As a Christian woman, some parts of the book (such as Rita Eriksson's fight to be independent of God) were definitely realistic; however, in the end it seemed as if every single character, even the less important ones, were model Christian citizens, and because of that these stories lost much of their [realistic] appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Life","review":"This book is funny.

They used the god of destruction Kali as their final justification. It is interesting to know they were quite ethical according to their own lights.I like the book as it is well written and tells a lot of history as it was probably understood in those days. I recognize the Moslem faith back then as similar to what it seems to be today.The book was written in the mid-1800s and comments upon the ruins of a bridge between Ceylon (as it is known today) and India. I found an aerial photograph of it by googling it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting story but needed more fully drawn characters","review":"Liberty Square was a good idea squeezed into too few pages. Memories of the war in Vietnam weren't really fleshed out, leaving me with the feeling that Forrest was rushed or over edited. The plot twists held a good number of surprise, but I would have liked to see the other characters (especially the male characters) more fully drawn. I've only read one other book by Katherine Forrest so her references to past events in Kate Delafield's life left me both curious and frustrated. I don't mind reading past books, but I don't think it should be necessary in order for me to understand what motivates the main character or where she is in her life.

The Wright Brothers cited Lilienthal as one of their heroes and carefully studied his work, developed their own theories and designs, and went on to invent the first working heavier than air aircraft. Originally published in 1889, Birdflight As The Basis Of Aviation features more than none hundred drawings, graphs, and diagrams (including many historic photographs of Lilienthal flying) and is a very welcome contribution to contemporary aviation history reference collections -- and a \\"must\\" for all American aviation history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdflight As a Basis Of Aviation","review":"Still reading, excellent - all professional - when words counted.

The word genius is thrown around frivolously these days, but Monk was a true genius, whose unique style and vision came from an inner source only Monk himself was privy to. The title track wonderfully showcases Monk, Sonny Rollins, and Max Roach, in a cerebral, quirky, yet playful celebration of sound. All of these Jazz giants were at their peak when BRILLIANT CORNERS was recorded. Monk came out of Be-bop, but was one of the major influences in the avant-garde jazz movement.For jazz novices, BRILLIANT CORNERS may not be the best place to start with Monk. It's complexity may turn people off. I would start with a best of compilation like his GENIUS OF MODERN MUSIC recordings for Blue Note, delicious appetizers to whet your appetite for the main course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Monk isn't easy to \\"get\\".

I absolutely love Monk's Dream and was looking for more. In contrast, this collection seems saxaphone-heavy, with Monk most often deep back. Monk's Dream seems carefully crafted whereas here I feel like I'm walking in on a club performance with a lot of one-off improvisation. And the tempo here is soporific, as if everyone's under-the-influence. There is not a lot of material on the recording, but more of the same would not help me. My search for a great second Monk recording continues..."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Monk's best","review":"On Brilliant Corners, the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past, but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing. Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece, and rightly so. Max Roach's drumming on the title track sounds great--tight, and full of impact. \\"Pannonica\\" made its debut on this album, and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time. Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album, the tender \\"I Surrender, Dear\\" sounds like you're right there in the studio. \\"Bemsha Swing\\" is a bit sloppy, but Roach's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version.

He still ends up in jail now and then and spends a lot of time in drug rehab centers.The writing thoughout the entire book is amateurish, repetitive, and poorly edited.

Unfortunately, it also -- mostly, in fact -- contains more of Henry's usual rambling, nonsensical comments and pointless reminiscences.

The whole book looks like biased Indian culture bashing boring read. The information sources and references seem like they have been picked specially for a pool of India hating English historians library.

I have read many books on Indian history and none else even come close to it. The author treats all most all aspects of Indian history in the most professional way.

It transformed my entire outlook of India & Indians and their relationship with other Asian nations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romila's history","review":"Romila Thapar is infamous for her ideological view of Indian History.

Unfortunately, the rest of the album was sophomoric dribble. Read some of the lyrics before you buy the album and you will get a good picture of what the rest of the album is like. The lyrics are worn out or just silly, and the music in every other track reflects this.

Nana, a teenage prostitute, makes a stunning debut in the theater (Les Varietes) and soon becomes a sought after commodity. However, the power of her attraction to men proves self-destructive to all who fall under her charms. One after the other the lives of these men get caught up in the whirlwind of Nana's desire for comsumption and living, a whirlwind that leaves these men in ruination. The book is remarkable for the vivid portrait of these times and the people that brought such life to them. I absolutely loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much detail, too many characters","review":"Lots of detail. Sometimes way too much detail.

The stand out song on this CD is \\"#41\\". Dave's voice is filled with emotion and the acoustic solo to close the song is almost haunting in the melody and precision Tim Reynolds gives it. This is the BEST live album ever made.

It is by far one of the best compolations of the Dave Matthews Band that I have ever heard. The acoustic guitar solos provide an added bonus to the otherwise perfect songs, and the blend of lively and mello music is awesome. These two CDs come everywhere with me and never leave my car. I just can't seem to get enough of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"After so many years of listening to this, I finally got to see Dave and Tim live this year.

This performance feels very intimate, and some of my favorite versions of songs were performed at this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Dave's best live work.","review":"I was kind of weary about this cd, but now that I have the cd I love this cd.

I recommend this cd to big Dave fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, From Start To Finish","review":"This is, of course, another of Dave Matthew's masterpieces as he and Tim Reynolds light it up at Luther College. The acoustic setting with live commentary from Dave makes this two set CD worthy of any cd collection and a must for the DMB fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Live Dave!","review":"This is a great live recording of Dave with Tim Reynolds. All the songs are eloquent in only a away Dave can sing and play. Even without the Band he is still just awesome. If I were to recommend one album to someone who hadn't heard DMB, this would probably be the one. Although, I don't have Red Rocks yet (which I have heard is great also)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST Live Albums","review":"If Tim Reynolds' guitar playing on 'Stream' doesn't make you get the chills then you are not human.

Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!, DAVE AND TIMMY THE DYNAMIC DUO","review":"Amazing album...DAve and Tim really combine nicely to produce great acoustics...Its just so relaxing to hear the two guitars syncranize so nicely...Although this album is an acoustic one it does contain one of the best Two Step that i have heard...oh yeah, and Warehouse is amazing, just out of this world...Its so spaced out in the beginning which puts a great introduction to an introduction song.. Definatly the best Warehouse ive heard from dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Dave!","review":"Another great CD from Dave Matthews and Timmy. Tim is so amazing!

Still, this is a chance to hear some fine arrangements of some of Dave's older work. Tim Reynolds, mandolin player and long-time DMB accompanier, shines on \\"stream\\" and provides a perfect complimentary counterpoint to Matthews' sweet vocals and percussive embellishments. A few jams also reflect the good ol' days of Peter Grier and the early nineties. A good CD to fortify a collection for fans. And a nice return to basics for those who may have written DMB off after his over-produced latest efforts. But don't throw away those bootlegs yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Awesome","review":"Dave shows his skills on this CD. Along with his parterner Tim Reynolds they tear it up. The acoustic guitars are unbelievable. They make you fell all the songs. If you like Dave you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Tim; the dynamic duo!","review":"Here we have a long awaited acoustic performance by two of the moat talented musicians today. Tim Reynolds fantastic guitar work is the perfect compliment to Davids'original style and sound. The rich,jazzy jams will reach into your heart and soul and fill you with the undeniable truth that what you're hearing is exactly that, PURE SOUL. The acoustic renditions of some of the more band oriented songs like \\"Tripping Billies\\" and \\"Jimi Thing\\" are still toe-tapping, get up and dance jams. even if you're not a fan this album shows Dave in a whole new light. Pick it up, open your mind and give it a good listen, you may be surprized!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD which brings all of their best songs together","review":"The Cd is absolutely amazing. In my opinion, it's a collection of all of my favorite Dave songs. It's put together very well so that while it is a live CD, it doesn't take away from the music at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live @ Luther College is AMAZING!","review":"I bet some of you are trying to figure out if you should buy this Cd or not. Well, take my advice and BUY IT! It is so great! Dave and Tim are wonderful live preformers. One more piece of advice, as soon as you get this CD put the second disc in your Cd player and select track #8 (Little Thing). THIS IS THE GREATEST SONG IN THE WORLD! For all those big DMB fans this particular song has tons of \\"dave speak.\\" It's the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews at his best","review":"Without a doubt one of the BEST complete live Dave Matthews CD sets that you can buy.

Tim Reynolds has some of the fastest guitar pickin' fingers you'll ever hear. From start to finish, I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A \\"TOP TENNER\\" FOR THOSE WHO LIKE DAVE!","review":"As I listen to this CD I find myself totally inclined to offer a review. I consider myself no music critic...all I know is that these CD's are the culmination of Recently, Under the Table, and Streets. Dave and Tim Renolds are at their best. No person that buys these CD's (even the non-Dave fan) will be disappointed. Have Fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is a kinder, gentler dave....","review":"the cd contains primarily old material, and without the band, it has a bit dreamier feel to it. tim reynolds' impressive technical skills add signficantly to dave's hearfelt acoustics and voice. i just saw them in concert, and was wowed by how tightly they played together. it's nice to see dave allow himself to stretch a little as he does with some of the vocals here. it would be even nicer to see all new material on a live release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Dave Fans","review":"Although this may not be his best concert, or accoustic set, this CD has outstanding sound in comparison to any bootleg. I believe Dave is best seated with his band, which is why I recomend it for Dave fan's; however, if you enjoy accoustic or live music this may be a great CD for you. Tim is truely one of the best at the hands of an accoustic guitar. I find myself listening to this CD over his other albums when I am relaxing or studying.This CD does contain my favorite versions of \\"Seek Up\\" and \\"Christmas Song\\", but otherwise I find the CD as a second glimpse at his other songs.For those of you with High End systems I think you will find this CD to be a very satisfying live set. The audience is very rarely distracting, but the interplay in between songs can make you feel as if you are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good...but it gets old fast.","review":"If you love Dave and you love guitar, you should get this CD. But don't expect to love it so much after having it in your cd player for a week. I bought it...and it is a good deal with two CD's full of music, but the songs are old news and the sounds seem very much the same from song to song. It has some fabulous guitar work (especially by Tim reynolds), but it was like when they play your favorite song on the raido so much that you hate it after a week...I got the same feeling from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Dave Matthews live album","review":"DMB is known as a jam band and too see the DMB live is to understand their mass appeal. Live at Luther College is just Dave and Tim Reynolds who is a honary member of the band. The jams are cut down and the music is stripped down to the bare essentials. This is an older cd so the songs are from what are now classic DMB songs. Recent DMB live cds focus on the newer music so this a chance to hear the classics in a way that you most likely will never see played this way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Tim are white hot!!","review":"I worship DM!! Dave and Timmy Reynolds chemistry is insane!! If you want a cd set where every, I mean every song is beautiful, and moving, then you have it right here! It's hard to write a review about something I'm so fond of. One disk is in my SUV and the other in my Dakota. My kids know almost all the words. Very kid friendly and the groove is incredible. Just buy it!! You will become a fanatic like me!! One Sweet World..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like DMB, this CD is for you!!","review":"This CD is one of the best DMB CD's out there. The song selection is second to none, Dave's playful guitar playing off of Tim's masterful solos is awesome! The only thing better than this CD would have been actually being there to witness this magic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over 400 reviews already? I must REALLY be moved","review":"Why add another word to more than 400 reviews already posted for this cd? BECAUSE ITS THAT GOOD. In fact, this is the way I would rather hear Dave in the long run. Intimate with the crowd. Not over produced. Listening to this you feel you are the guest of honor on the front row. The songs are pretty true to their studio/band versions -with the very exceptional Halloween. But because they are so bare and unmasked, they sound completely new.Simply put, this is the high point of the \\"unplugged\\" movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I own","review":"Wow, what a CD. This is by far the best Dave CD not only because it is all acoustic but it also has so many of his best songs on it. The guitar on this album is some of the best I have ever heard. Dave sounds awesome playing rythm while Tim has to be one of the best guitar players. And on this CD you can really hear the Dave's voice and it is incredible. Not to mention you can hear Dave ramble on and make jokes only like he can. All in all this CD is the best Dave CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"But what else could we expect? It takes me approximately 2 hours to drive to school and these CDs do the trick every time. The sound on here is so incredible that you will play it over and over and over and STILL want to hear it again. This is also an opportunity for fans of the band to get hear more of the AMAZING guitarist, Tim R., that we only get a taste of on studio albums. Of the 23 (count em.. 23! ) tracks found here, my favorite has to be \\"#41.\\" It just sounds... incredible. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live How It Should be","review":"The true mark of an excellent musician is hia ability to perform live. And to make things scarier try a live acoustic concert. Why? The small crowd requires a level of intimacy (working the crowd) that most performers just can't pull off. If you have any doubts about Dave, just check out his performance on VH1 Storytellers. Second, the live set is where you find out just how much talent the performer has musically. There's no hiding behind the magic and technology of a recording studio (unlike the vast majority of today's pop stars). Finally, you get a rare chance to see a little creativity with the music (and this one has a lot). It is an art and Dave is a master.This CD is a sample of Dave at his best. My only regret is that he and Tim do not do more shows together like this. This is my all time favorite CD. I have had is for 3-4 years now and still listen to it at least once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"I love this CD. The acoustic performance of Dave and Tim is amazing. I cannot stop listening, singing, humming this album. It is constantly in my head. Dave's live CD's are by far the best, and this is one of them. Seek Up, Jimi Thing, One Sweet World, Granny, Typical Situation, are some of the best. Dave, please keep releasing CD's like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A winning collaborative effort that proves to be Dave's best","review":"Dave Matthews has always amazed me through not only his musical talent, but also the mood instilled through the unique tone of his songs. This production is no different, showing once again that he is a master of his realm. A masterpiece, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can he get any better?","review":"The best part about this cd is that it seems like you are listening to his songs for the first time. The parts in which you know by heart that a violin or a drum solo comes up disappear, acoustic guitar is added. I think Dave and Tim are a great combo. If you liked anyone of Dave's cds, you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is awesome!!!!!","review":"This is the best live Dave Matthews album that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Its a 10!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly enlightening!","review":"This format suits Dave Matthews' music to a 'T'. Hearing the music in a raw, broken down form is a special treat. Although when together with the band the music is extremely powerful, this album has it's own feeling. It's wonderful to get to hear Dave and Tim Reynolds alone on a stage with their guitars. Even if you don't normally go for the DMB, if you consider yourself a \\"music lover,\\" you must own this abum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Tim","review":"I think that all I have to offer is this: there was a reason why I waited three days in line to get tenth row center seats to listen to the two of them play at Bailey Hall at Cornell, a college experience better than getting an A on a prelim. Those two are simply amazing--their talent is overwheliming."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL guitar-playing","review":"This is definitely a CD that deserves to be heard in a discman. Dave and Tim's performances are astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful acoustic set","review":"I like this album much more than several of Dave's studio recordings, because it lacks that annoying over-engineered quality that so many of his studio sets take on. It's fresh and altogether like the early days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Live CD ever!","review":"This has to be my favorite Live CD of all time. I bought this CD at the same time as Listener Supported, and I must admit that this is my favorite CD out of the two. There is just something about Dave and Tim playing together that excites me, and makes me sad because there probably will never be another CD like this. Some of my favorites on this compelation are \\"One Sweet World\\", \\"Trippin Billies\\", \\"Jimi Thing\\", \\"Dancing Nancies\\", \\"Typical Situation\\", \\"Stream\\" which is an amazing piece by Tim, \\"Warehouse\\" and \\"Two Step\\". Now that I think about it, the whole CD is great so listen to all of it as many times as you can without stopping! I bet you won't and you'll agree that this is an amazing CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every fan or soon to be fan","review":"Let's face it. When it comes to music in general, a good live album is hard to find. \\"Live at Luther College,\\" is one of the few exceptions.Buying this album on a whim without really looking at it, I was pleasently surprised to find out that this CD was Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds live, and that's it. No Band. Believe me, I love the band, but hearing Dave's popular songs done on two acoustic guitars added a new element that I loved from track one.I've been a Dave Matthew's fan since I first heard him, but I never appriciated his talent until this album. There are many excellent musicians in bands, but until you can solo them out of their band you'll never truely realize how amazing they are.In the end, this CD is a must. Even if you have every DMB CD put out, this one's a must. If not for it's uniqueness, then for Tim Reynolds. That guy is amazing! I swear he has seven fingers on each hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it Out!","review":"How neat that Dave Matthews (HIMSELF) would actually take the time to write in to AMAZON.COM via the reviews (by artist). Check it out. Human, just like the rest of us. Makes me like his music even more. You're an okay guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic DM........not DMB","review":"If you like Dave Matthews, dazzling guitar works, get this CD. If you like DMB don't get this CD. This is classic Dave + Tim Reynolds doing what they do best...........playing to the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Though completely acoustic and mellow, the cd triumphantly remains largely un-folkish and even more impressively without lags. It's tough to put out a quiet album that isn't boring, but Dave and Tim succeed wildly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I saw the Dave himself posted a note of thanks to all the fans out there, I was wondering if anyone out there has heard anything about the release of this on DVD. Dave if you happen to read this, Keep up the awesome work and don't ever sell out to the masses!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From a devote fan","review":"Anyone who calls dave matthew's sing annoying is just jealous because his music touches people, and the only time they make is when they sit at home every night watching the home shopping network, listening to yanny as they cry themselves to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"I just can't understand why people think Dave Mathews is so amazing. In truth, his band is quite talented, but his voice could be topped by anyone. The nasal screeching lyrics make me want to puke. Try listening to real music with people who can actually sing. Lay off the bong for a while and listen to someone talented. Possibly with a voice....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the studio recordings!!!","review":"...unless of course you are a hard core dm fan. This album is basically the cd's with the band removed. DM's guitar work and vocal work don't really shine like I had expected them to. I just think that hsince he knew this was going to be an album, he could have rearranged the songs to make them a little more interesting and intimate for his fans, as is fitting for solo acoustic guitar. But these acoustic recordings really add nothing to the songs, they don't let you feel them in a different way. Plus, for some reason, the way the acoustic guitar was recorded made it sound really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE MORE MONEY","review":"Another live album. Don't get me wrong live albums are great, but he just released \\"Live at Red Rocks\\" a little over a year ago, and this is another way that he can make more money.

Lyrically, they are one of the most pathetic groups. I can only give this cd 1 star. Satilate is one of the worst songs I have ever heardTheir #1 fan Jon Kriewall Seattle, Wa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"Before I wrote this review, I just glanced over some of the other reviews that happened to stand out today, and I must say, I am disgusted. One must be careful not to write this album off as a DMB album, because this certainly is not. All the poetic and musical talent of Dave Matthews combine with the raw guitar talent of Tim Reynolds and even I, a drummer, sat in awe the first time I listened to this release. There is nothing that I can say but that whether or not Dave and Tim had another better concert (although that is debateable) this release is still an awestriking demonstration of the talent that Mr. Matthews and Reynolds posess. I am of the opinion that if you like Dave Matthews you cannot help but like this album. It is worth every penny and then some. You will find yourself humming along with Dave hours after you have abandoned your CD player. It's a real winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best There Is...Dave Matthews, Of Course","review":"Now mind you that I've been a big fan for six years, so there isn't much Dave Matthews Band stuff that I don't like. However, this little 13 year old girl thinks that this is the best of what's around. I like the whole idea of Dave unplugged with one of the most talented guitarists in the world along side him. I enjoy the vibe that the rest of the band gives off, but Dave alone has this certain electricity to it that shoots through your body. I like all the songs on the album and I think that it's an amazing set list. If Dave and Tim are coming to your town, try as hard as you can to get htem, because they are one amazing show...I saw them in Conneticut. Seeing them live is way better than just hearing them in you sterio, but I HIGHLY recomend this album to any one who is reading this who hasn't already bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best live Dave Matthews recording yet","review":"If anyone hasn't heard Dave Matthews live, you will never hear a better live album than this. Without question, this is the best album that Dave has released to date. Nothing can capture Dave's incredible musical talent like a live performance, and as performances go, this is one you won't want to miss. Live at Red Rocks is a good example of what the band can do live, and an excellent album, but Dave and Tim together are probably the most talented duet to perform together. The style is unparalleled by any other performer, and together with Tim on acoustics I don't believe you will ever find another album that captivates you like this one will. You simply can't beat this album. It makes me giddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"When I bought this CD set, I wasn't a big Dave Matthews fan. I liked a few of his songs, but I wouldn't have considered myself a fan. But I fell in love with these CDs; they are outstanding. Dave and Tim are very talented. A must-have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Renditions","review":"Great Live renditions of some awesome song, I think this CD more than any other of DMB's truly brings out the awesome musical talent of Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. The acoustic quality is simply amazing and sounds great on just about any system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The paradigm of Dave Matthew's music","review":"I bought this CD on a whim because I friend of mine had said it was good and I had been waiting for a really good album of DM's to come out. Upon listening to it, I absolutely fell on love with it, and, furthermore the talent expressed by DM and TR. The songs just want to make you veg out, but at the same time they fire you up. I would recommend this album to anyone interested in DM or anyone who is wanting a good selection of music founded on the acoustic guitar. DM found a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surprise for non-DMB fan!","review":"Although I own one DMB studio album and enjoy hearing his tunes on the radio, I was never a big fan. Enjoyable music, but sometimes a bit boring. This album changes it all! I bought it after seeing Dave and Tim on some TV special. What a fantastic album. Combining Dave with a superb guitarist like Tim Reynolds brings the music to life. They sound a bit like a latter-day Hot Tuna, especially when Tim shows off his guitar chops. Most everything is great so I won't even pick out any favorites. Buy this album and enjoy! Take it easy.....Kenny"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER","review":"This may seem like an overstatement but it's not. I've never had a cd before where ALL the songs were great until i got this one. There are some really sweet versions of Two Step, #41, Say Goodbye, and Warehouse. I didn't even really like Dave Matthews until i got this cd, but now i know that he is one of the best artists of the decade. Oh, and Tim Reynolds is amazing. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Stuff","review":"When I bought Crash by Dave Mathews I was quite impressed but his is not the music I like to listen to over and over. I'm getting tired of his voice and the same songs on several albums. C'mon Dave come up with some new good stuff. Your last studio album laid an egg. Time to step up and produce."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELLOUT","review":"now that he's popular, we have all the college-aged kids trying to find their identity in his music. welcome to the bandwagon."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I have to say is HA HA HA!!!!","review":"What a waste of money, this is nothing new! I mean, it could have at least been the whole band! DMB fans everywhere, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love live @luther college","review":"I will make this short but sweet. This CD is fantastic. As I live in Australia, there is still not a huge following of DMB. I picked up the 'Crash' album which made me a huge fan,however, it was Live at Luther college that made me a HUGE fan. It sheds a different light on a lot of DMB songs, in a lot of cases actually making them 'easier' listening. There are not a lot of people who have heard me listen to the Cd and not wanted to borrow it themselves.. I recommend #41, satellite, & probably most of all 'Lover lay down' as some of the better tracks on an overall excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of What's Around","review":"Next to Under the Table and Dreaming the CD is definitely the best of what's around. I own many a DMB and just Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds concerts and I like the live stuff much better than the recorded stuff. Songs are different every time they are played and with just Dave playing for all you tabbers out there it's much easier to tab. This is definitely my favorite of the Dave Matthews CD's thus far. The few unreleased songs although nice aren't what makes this a great CD. It's got Dave from all points of view old and new although *L* it could use Lie In Our Graves. But the only other concert I like as well as this one is the 2/17/97 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two guys. Two guitars. One incredible piece of music.","review":"The Dave Matthews Band is the best band out there today! I was so thrilled when Live At Luther College came out. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys listening to great music. I've purchased all of the bands' CDs. Every night before I go to sleep, I put on my headphones and fall asleep listening to Dave. His songs are all so incredible. I already can't wait for his next CD. Dave and Tim are two of the most talented guitar players in the world. OK- so now you know how awesome this CD is. What are you waiting for? Go buy it NOW!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews/Tim Reynolds, what else needs to be said?","review":"Dave and Tim come out with the best version of \\"One Sweet World\\" with an awesome solo that fits in so perfectly. After that, they go into one of my favorties, \\"#41\\". Dave plays \\"What Would You Say\\" slow and it is honestly amazing. The whole cd is awesome, with a wide variety of music. \\"halloween\\", \\"Granny\\" and also one of my all time favorites, \\"minarets\\" are some songs they play during the show. Must not forget the all time classics though: \\"Christmas Song\\" and \\"Seek up\\". Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds are truly the best! this cd is a must for anyone who likes Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"describes how much she loves Live at Luther","review":"Although the songs are from Daves earlier albums, the sweet rhythm of his voice with Tim Reynolds on guitar is amazing!

It consists of two CD's and all the Dave Matthews' classics. I had the opportunity to see this tour in 1996-1997 and being able to hear it on CD quality makes it that much better. Dave gives nothing less than perfection and Tim Reynolds is the best guitar player I have ever heard.

I bought it not knowing what it would be like, Dave without his band accompanyment...but to my suprise, I found it better than all of his other releases.

A must buy, now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD's - Dave and Tim Rock!","review":"These CD's are just plain fantastic - Tim is the most talented guitarist I can think of - TRIPPING BILLIES - amazing.

Basically, a must-have CD - an out-of-this-world listening. experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"more isn't always enough","review":"Let's be honest...there are those who get Dave Matthews music , and there are those who have yet to get it...This 2CD set rekindles my spirit upon each listening ,and CRASH INTO ME just gets me every time . These inventive , oft daring , forays into folky heavenly guitar-wonder are well married to Tim Reynolds own brand of magic. My only regret is that there are only 2 CDs... The versatile , prolific DMB always garners my respect.Less is more , indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of the person, then...","review":"this is the album for you! I, for one, love both the music and Dave, himself. With this album, not only do you know every song by heart, but you, somewhat, get to know Dave as a person. I love the conversational manner in which this concert is performed. Whenever I play this album, it's like I'm in some small, quaint pub listening to someone who lets you into the music. Although it always has been, you get a greater feel of the emotion and depth from which these songs came. And, you can't help feel that this concert was meant for you, kind of like a \\"Thank You\\" from them to us.And, if you enjoy DMB like all of my friends and I do, then this album feels right at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, if you like Tim Reynolds","review":"This is a really cool cd for people who like guitar music. The DMB is great and Tim Reynolds makes it the best. This is the best cd I own and the best Dave Mathews cd I've heard. Buy it now cuz it's a great price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, together like peas & carrots","review":"When I first heard this Cd, I had no idea that it had actually been recorded prior to the release of \\"Crash\\"(1996 BMG Entertainment). You can actually feel the mood of the audience as you listen to the two musicians playing as if they'd played these songs together all their life. The funny thing however is that they hardly ever practice the sets that they do. Almost everything on this CD is completely improvised and the music doesn't suffer one bit. Hearing the songs without the usual band does much to offer change to the songs. One song, \\"Ants Marching\\", has an amazing Tim Reynold's lick in place of Boyd Tinsleys violin. It doesn't diminish Boyd's playing, but merely offers something different to the song. I gave this album a 4 though, not because it wasn't a great CD, but because there weren't any new songs and if you looking for progressive Dave Matthews, you'll only find it here if you've never heard Dave Matthews Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave in a truly intimite setting- Spectacular!","review":"Although this album lacks many of the things that make DMB so amazing, such as Carter Beauford's amazing chops on drums and Boyd Tinsley's rock violin, but the amazing vocals of Matthews and Reynolds' breathtaking, awe-inspiring guitar work make up for it. A collection of wonderful songs in a way you've never heard them before. It is something that will touch every DMB fan- one of my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live CD made","review":"This Cd has changed how I listen To Dave. I have been a big fan for awile but after listening to this CD he is now my favorite. The set list for this concert is unreal and I wish I could have been there. If you don't have this cd by now definatly buy as soon as possible I guarantee that you will like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"*****Once again, Dave shines through.....","review":"Alright. I'm tired of the clueless music critics, unappreciative morons, and idiots who don't feel the power of Dave. So what if this is another live album? Big deal if us devoted fans know all of the songs already. If you don't get this CD for #41, Crash, Jimi Thing, Lover Lay Down, One Sweet World, Christmas Song..........you're missing out. They're perfect. Face it. The man is brilliant. He knows how to say, or should I say sing, everything we keep locked up inside and see life in a whole new light. Thank you Dave for expressing everything I've wanted to but have not known how. Oh yeah, thanks also for Granny :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of the utmost talent!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is one of his best CD's ever, it truly shows both Dave's vocal as well as his and Tim's acoustic talent and enthusiasm. The Luther College crowd most definately enjoyed his music and everyone, with good taste in music will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the concert, get this instead","review":"I was one of the lucky fans that was able to see the Dave/Tim duo in '97 during their first, limited tour. Althought the music was fantastic, Dave's interaction with the crowd left a lot to be desired. My overwhelming impression of Dave was-- who is this meathead? He was rude to the crowd on several occations, and not once did he strike me as the gentle, sensitive lyracist of his songs.If this album is as good as the MUSIC in his live show, I say save your money for a concert ticket and buy this instead. On his best behavior, he is tolerable. In the unrecorded show I attended, he was an ***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome performance by Dave and Tim!","review":"What can I say...Tim Reynolds and Dave Matthews are just simply brilliant on guitar!

MIKE until I came across a raving review of it at allaboutromance.com. I found a copy at the library and couldn't put it down.

It makes me happy just knowing that this book exists and just looking at the cover makes me smile. I am a very, very picky reader and won't suggest a book unless it is awesome. I quickly e-mailed everyone on my e-mail list about this book. My aunt couldn't believe it when she read my message. She had read MRS. MIKE years and years ago in middle school and remembered everything about the book all this time later. We talked for hours about it over the phone. That weekend she went and purchased a copy for her daughter, who, of course, loved it as much as we did. It may sound trite, but if I could only have two books, I would choose my bible and MRS.

So, I logged on to Amazon.Com and there it was. The brief synopsis brought it all back to me - the adventure, the heartaches, and the lasting love.

My teacher took me to the library, and the first book she gave me was Mrs. Mike. Like other reviewers, I tell the story about that book and the great favor that teacher did to keep me reading. For years, I have wondered if it was still available. Thank goodness I have found it, as it was one of the most influential books in my life. It deals with real life and doesn't sidestep life's joys or sorrows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated!!","review":"Maybe I missed something...but I think this book is highly over-rated and simplistic. There is no depth to the plot; the 'white' characters' dialogue is stilted and sometimes silly--\\"Oh Mike, do you really think so?\\" whereas the Cree conversations are reduced to language resembling that of Tonto. Tragedies abound, and Kathy, the protagonist makes astounding rebounds, time and again, with a wide-eyed, little girl enthusiasm which grates, after about page 18. I don't get the rave reviews and testimonials which seem to span some readers' lifetimes. This is really thin reading fare and so unrealistic; if you're looking for historical fiction, this ain't it. If romance is the genre, I'd say fair enough...but there is certainly better stuff out there.

That is exactly what I did. Since it was old and worn I expected it to be a book that I wouldn't find interesting, or very good. I was SO wrong! I have read many books and this is the VERY BEST book I have ever read. My mother told me that the book has stuck with her ever since she read it! I can see why. I couldn't stop reading it!

She fell in love with a \\"mounty\\", which is similar to a police officer, doctor, etc responsible for hundreds of square miles in the middle of the wilderness. It was not only a love story but it was about the harshness of the Canadian wilderness and what people went through living there before even the railroads came through.

Some sections are flawless; the author is elegant in his explanation, the examples are clear and relevant, and the problems serve their purpose. However, the poorly written sections (and trust me, there are plenty of them) far outweigh what little beauty lies in this textbook. Anyone who wishes to meticulously plow through this book will know what I'm talking about. The most depressing thing about it all is that I can't seem to find a book (on DE's) that's any better!

When I went to Harvard Law School (starting in 1995, exactly 20 years after Turow), everyone told me \\"It's not like One-L anymore.\\" That's only half true -- One-L is overly dramatic, but the basic events and emotions he depicts rang true again and again. Of course, as the other reviews show, some law students are able to blow off the intensity, others (like Turow) become consumed by it, and the rest (like me) swing back and forth between panic and enjoyment. All in all, this is an excellent peek at the law school experience. Just don't use this as your only basis for deciding whether to go to law school and/or to Harvard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book for aspiring law students","review":"This is a second read for me. I read this book severwl years ago and I have thought of it often. Scott Turow was a teacher before he went to Law School. This book is really a journal of his first year at Harvard Law. I think it is a wonderful book, that has whetted my appetite to learn more about the Law and to read everything I can on it. I definitely would recommend it to anyone wants to go to Law school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to read before law school","review":"I thought this book is a good book to read before starting law school. Granted people must take into consideration that this is Harvard Law, set in the 70's and from one man's point of view. I enjoyed the book and found it interesting and insightful. I'm not taking everything he says in it as an absolute truth, but it does help to gain some insight into how one may feel while going through your first year of law school. I would recommend it to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, and hopefully overblown","review":"As someone who is in the application process for law school, I'm hoping that indeed the events depicted have been 'dramatized' for the sake of the book.A recent law grad told me pretty much the same thing I've seen from other reviewers here...thatthis has a heaping grain of truth, but it's pretty sketchy to use this when deciding whether to go to law school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to have an interest in law to like this book","review":"This is only my partially educated opinion, but I cannot imagine someone enjoying this book who does not see themselves going to law school. I don't know how much people who have already gone through law school would enjoy this book either. But for me, having not gone to law school yet, but having a great desire to do so, this book was very good indeed.I enjoyed learning about the delicate politics involved with being a one L. I enjoyed learning about the egotistical professors, and I enjoyed the seemingly honest nature of the author. The narrator seems to present the experience of his first year with great humility. Once I get into law school and finish my first year, however, my opinion about this book may change.I recommend anyone planning on going to law school read this book, you will certainly enjoy it. I actually think it is required reading in some law schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Law Student - Yet Loved This Book, Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I found this book in box filled with old books. I have no idea who in the family bought it, but I started reading page one and saved it from the donation/sell pile. I am SO GLAD I DID.I have no desires to be a lawyer but I found this book an incredibly fascinating journey of a first year law student.Scott Turow is an excellent writer and has this ability to draw you in so that you feel you're living the life he's describing. I actually found myself anxious when he was anxious! LOL.Truly a remarkable read. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An insider's view of Harvard Law","review":"My son is attending HLS this year and doesn't share too many details of his experiences as a first year student.

The time period is late sixties and seventies so I know there have been some changes but still the atmosphere anddaily routines of the students who are learning a new language-the law-come through and are relevant to today's I L class.I recommend the book to people who considering law school and for their families so that they can understand their sons and daughters better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One L","review":"Great exploratory read for those interested in what the first year of law school is like at an prestigious institution. Accessible enough to imagine yourself in the everyday shoes of the writer. It helped me, to an extent, form decisions about where I chose to attend law school. Other recommendations available on Amazon:\\"The Bramble Bush\\" by Karl Lewellyn\\"The Paper Chase\\" by John Jay Osborn"},{"rating":"2","title":"accurate view, that's for sure.","review":"I read this before starting law school, and thank God I did. While law school is not today what it was, Turow's depiction still holds true in many aspects, such as the socratic method of teaching, the stress surrounding exams, and while others do not agree with me, the competition. Anyone who is starting law school should read this book. Then as you finish your first year, you can breathe a sigh of relief that it was not quite as terrible as what it might have been, were law school still the way Turow describes it. It's a fast read, and very enjoyable, although not always comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it Today","review":"All I have is two words for Turow's work in One L: c'est magnifiqueWell perhaps I have a little more...to say...First I shall commence by mentioning that most will agree this text is far from literature intended to prepare you to begin legal studies. Instead, Turow stresses the very challenges one may possibly stumble upon as a first year law student, \\"1L.\\" One L is not \\"true scholarship\\" per say, but is exceptionally informative and includes critical legal vocabulary that all first year law student ought to be aware of.This work should be used for entertainment purposes and nothing further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Peek Inside","review":"For someone like me, who is considering law school, this book is definitely a worthwhile \\"peek inside\\" the experience of law school, or at least the first year. Not being a law student I don't have anything to compare it to, but reading about Turow's experience and comparing to the experience of lawyer acquaintances makes it seem to hold a lot of truth. True, it's probably a bit dated, but it's a worthwhile read for anyone who's considering law school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighten Up","review":"I didn't like this book when I read it at the beginning of law school, and I still feel the same way, now en route to graduate. I suppose it's a testament to the book's staying power that I remember it some 3 years later, though that's not a good thing in this case.I thought the book was unnecessarily melodramatic, as if the author was trying to make sure his law school experience read like a cliffhanger or shoot-'em-up blockbuster, and that he kept the reader's attention despite the tale not being that interesting to begin with. Granted, getting called on in class and vying for a law review position are mildly harrowing experiences, but I imagine they aren't like being on the front line of combat in war, or performing open heart surgery for 14 hours. However, the author sets the kind of tone to make you believe he equates the two. Although I realize law school isn't all laughs, I thought more levity would have been appropriate, and I kept wanted the author to \\"lighten up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that accurate","review":"I think that anybody who is about to enter law school should not read this book. It will only scare you. I am completing my first year of law school, and my first year was nothing like this. The students were not that competitive, I did not study every waking moment (in fact I worked while going to law school), getting called on in class was not the emotional nightmare portrayed in this book, law review was not all anyone could talk about. The reading was interesting at points, but read it with a grain of salt. Law school is not like it was portrayed in One L, unless you make it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like Law School Today","review":"For anyone considering law school, don't worry about this book. Before I went to law school, I heard from numerous people that I needed to read this book (and watch The Paper Chase--which, as other reviewers have pointed out, has many similarities).I don't think either gives a very accurate portrayal of law school today though. Yes, there is a lot of work to do; yes, some--perhaps many--people still use study groups; yes, there are \\"gunners\\"--the people who inevitably feel the need to talk in every class and want to outdo the professor. But there's a lot of fun too, and I don't think the stress level ever reaches some of the extremes portrayed in this book.My law school (not Harvard, but still in the top 20) had kegs in the courtyard every Friday (similar events on campus or at bars are referred to as Bar Review at many schools), and people found a lot of time to blow off steam and otherwise have fun.Read this book if you're interested, but don't stress about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a self-centered and immature law student.","review":"Could this guy whine just a little bit more? Oh....Harvard Law....too much work.... sketchy explanations....do it on your own.....gotta take responsibility for my own learning........Harvard Law.....almost guaranteed first year salary of high 5 figures and 3-4 year salary in the 6 figure range.........permanent prestige....write your own ticket.........IMHO being able to have that opportunity should leave any student leaping for joy every single morning and evening and thanking God that they got accepted.Listen kids, an education is NOT a right. Ask all the people who are not able to go to college in this country. Education is a privilege. The more prestigious the school, the more of a privilege it is.Don't follow in this guys footsteps and whine all the way through it.He might be a Harvard Law graduate but I really hope his character has grown since his 1L days. A more self-pitying, ungrateful wretch I have rarely known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love Scott Turow's books in general, but this one is of little interest for anyone except lawyers.

On the other hand Turow's writings about the death penalty are terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth About Lawschool","review":"This book is a deep exploration of the emotional and mental rollercoaster of the first year of lawschool. I read it after my first year, and was astounded that my experience was so similar. It is a revealing look at human reactions during a time of extreme stress and scrutiny. A good read for people considering law school and anyone who has wondered what it is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate reflection of a first year at Harvard Law School","review":"I was recommended this book as 'background' reading for a recent visit to Boston. I didn't start reading it 'til I returned and I didn't miss much. The autobiographical nature of the narrative revolved around his own first year at the Law School. He avoided almost any references to Boston (or Cambridge) and to his family - especially his wife. He showed his aptitude to prose. This was interesting as it was written contemperaneously ie many years before \\"Presumed Innocent\\". Summary - essential reading for students considering law school anywhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, inaccurate, outdated, a complete was of time","review":"This book may have had some value if you went to law school 30 years ago and you went to Harvard. Beyond that, its pretty useless. The impact technology has had on law school and the study of law is tremendous. Obviously, Turow doesn't comment on this because it didn't exist then. This book hasn't been updated because naive, would-be law students still buy it in droves making him a boat load of cash, so why should he update it? It also is MUCH MUCH too specific to his particular situation. Being married, attending Harvard, carries some unique elements while going through law school that do not exist for that vast majority of law students. Reading this book will inform you about some aspects of law school, but will also severely misguide you regarding others. I think it leaves you worse off than if you had simply not read the book in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, if a bit earnest","review":"I hung out with some wisecrackers during law school. We had to keep it to ourselves, but we found plenty of targets for satire and parody. This book certainly made it easier by creating the cliche of Prof. Kingsfield. Whenever we had a professor who didn't measure up to the perfection of the cliche, well, it was time for another round of chuckling.Read the original for a more indepth portrayal than the movie, but try not to let the earnestness affect you."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE L","review":"It's very interesting for students who live in a country with german-roman system, because they can learn more about the common-law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recitation of the first year experience","review":"In this book Turow does an excellent job of describing the first-year experience. This book should ideally be read after at least one semester of law school, I read it between my criminal law, and civil procedure exams. If you do read it before beginning law school, fear not, its not as bad as it sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"a peek into a self-contained world","review":"This is a great read, and I would recommend it to anyone, but especially the spouses of law students. Just like it happens in other areas of academia, these graduate students have to block out the larger world in order to focus and succeed in their own sphere. It's fascinating to watch the political struggles that go on over various issues and professors. This is among Scott Turow's best work, as his fiction beyond \\"The Burden of Proof\\" really deteriorated."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful, but possibly a bit dated","review":"comprehensive, and well-written; a fine intoduction to the mechanics of law school, many of which appear constant over time; still, the book is creaky with age in places; it is a reflection of a different generation; word is a new version with a modern touch and by a different author is in the works somewhere; true?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Turow seems a bit, how shall I say, overwrought. Like when he messes up a meaningless, ungraded assignment and claims to feel \\"corrosively ashamed.\\" And what's with him writing like some English wig-wearer, circa the twelfth century: \\"I have finished my first term at the law.\\" Yeah, I hear you. The guy's popping Valium and getting all weepy whenever a teacher says a sharp word or two. Chill out, dude, it's only school. Harvard at that.

Turow accurately recreates the insanity of the year by exposing how utterly selfish everyone is or becomes because of the desire to be the best. The professors are driven by ego, the students are driven by fear and greed. Turow realizes that despite his best liberal attempts to stay above the fray that he too wishes to be one of those who finishes on top of the first year grades and thus make the Harvard Review. Well-written, very engaging (although a little too long), and all too real, Turow's book remains the classic to read for those entering LS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Law school in excruciating detail","review":"While Turow is a skilled writer, he appears to be a less skilled editor. This book expounded upon every last conceivable detail of the first year of law school, and, in my view, would have benefitted from more brevity and less exhaustive detail. I read this book after having completed my second year of law school, and found it to be a slow and painful recap of every moment of my first year. It is accurate, but to one who has experienced it, it contains no fresh insight on the experience. Good for those contemplating law school, ho-hum for those who have already gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, as a novel","review":"I suppose that for people who are way too tightly wound, law school might actually be like this. It wasn't for me. As other reviewers have pointed out, Turow must have never before been in an actual stressful situation before if he found law school this bad. In fact, it almost seems as if law school was the first time anyone had ever been mean to him at all.On the other hand, I didn't go to Harvard - I went to a school where no student had any chance of clerking for a Supreme Court justice or anything fancy like that. If people believe that their lives will be meaningless if they don't get to be on the Harvard Law Review, then maybe they do go to pieces when professors are mean to them.It's really not a bad book - it's entertaining and readable - but people should realize it's not a description of what most students experience in law school.

It's not as if that's where I spend most of my coding time.After reading about 30 pages of introductory material I was getting desperate for some real-life examples, especially involving databases. I searched the table of contents, but all the chapters have cute names that give little or no indication of the contents. I checked the index for terms like \\"database\\", \\"entity\\", \\"record\\", \\"query\\" - zero, nada, zilch. But hey, I did learn that it's more important to have an expensive chair than an expensive desk!I'm sure I can take what I learned in this book and extrapolate it to real-world application development.

I cross-referenced to Autozone {Wells} brand and they showed a different part number, but the picture showed the same small wire connector and I could not tell from the picture about the tubing size. I used the part and replaced the wire connectors and adapted the tubing size. Something I learned from electrical work--electricity always uses the path of least resistance. It was easier to make it work, then to try and find a part that may not be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slice of Life","review":"Don't be mislead by the title, there is mo pornography here--unless you consider murder pornographic.

Nonetheless, author Douglas crafts a nailbiter of a story (one that I read in one day) that allows the forlorn single father Kyle Foster to shine in the line of duty.When Kyle rescues Laura Quinlan and a group of trapped school children he has no idea that the woman will play a vital part in the search of the Black Order, Montana Confidential's Public Enemy Number One. To help Kyle go undercover, Laura allows for a marriage of convenience and things heat up between the two. The only serious problem I had with the whole faked marriage between the two was how Kyle and Laura handled it with Kyle's daughter Molly, other than that its fine.

My daughter can't get enough of it - now at 9 months, she goes to the tv and starts to dance to let us know she wants to watch it. She loves the music, the action, and the colors in the video. Even the babysitter enjoyes playing Hebrew Songs 2 for our daughter. We are all learning Hebrew the fun way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing, yet entertaining read","review":"This is a title that is a bit of a throwback to more classic storytelling, in that it takes you at least the first year to have any sort of sense about what's going on. It differs from classic storytelling in that the dialogue sounds like something a real person would say, and the art is simple, realistic, and fantastic.A series that should be given much more praise and critical examination, and is my pick for break-out series of this last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls no punches, but helpful and compassionate","review":"More than once I was in tears as I read through this. Allender pulls no punches, and shows why recovery from abuse is not a one time thing, nor is it easy. However it is also written with a depth of compassion that allows the reader to know that while this is no quick and easy fix, these are pearls of wisdom that are worth the effort.I still have a long way to go, but this book helped (and is continuing to help) me understand myself and see the changes that *I* need to make and the ways in which I need to repent in order to find the restoration I so desperately need. Although it may seem unfair (\\"I'm the one who was hurt, why do I need to do all the hard work?\\") it is actually a relief to realise that we ourselves hold some of the most important keys to healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious","review":"From page 1, this book has a religious slant.

Being a particular religion doesn't exempt one from abuse, nor does abuse make you less likely to be faithful to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts more than it helps","review":"I will point out just one harmful aspect of this book: The author, like many evangelical authors, believes in the victim working through feelings before confronting so that the victim will approach the offender with compassion, forgiveness, etc. A major problem with that approach? While Victim A is \\"working through her feelings,\\" the offender may be abusing Victims B, C and D. How could it possibly be a Christian goal to allow that?! Please take his advice with a giant grain of salt if you choose to read this book, and be open to other opinions if they are helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive!","review":"I bought this book hoping to heal enough to be in a sexual relationship without being defensive and afraid. Instead, I ended up seriously offended.The author, who is not just a Christian (as I am) but completely fanatical, suggests that the only thing worse than rape is the lack of a close relationship with God. EXCUSE ME? For someone who claims to have personal experience in these matters, he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.I also found the book to be more preachy (stuffed with Bible verses) than helpful. I know the Bible verses, and I know God can provide healing, but Allender doesn't connect the two with helpful advice for actual healing. SUCK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wounded Heart","review":"this book has a very religious base, as suggesting that abuse can be fixed by embracing prayer to God/Jesus. However the basis for the reaction people have to abuse and the actions of the abuser struck the chord of reality for me. It explains the reactions of the abused and helps to understand how the abused lives in society. Very eye opening explanation of the way an abused child lives their adult lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"All victims AND counselors of sexual abuse should read this...","review":"Two and a half years ago, I was referred to this book by another sexual abuse victim. I'm still in the middle of reading it... it's definitely not light-reading but it's definitely necessary. Eight months ago, I had to take a break from reading this when I got to the Betrayal portion of the book. It was such a painful and vital slap to my face. I had no idea how many raw wounds I still had from my childhood/teenage years filled with being the victim of sexual abuse at the hand of many different abusers. This book is uncovering every wound and even showing me reasons why I do the things I've written off as possibly normal or crazy. I've opened this book up again and am in such a better place than eight months ago but I'm still learning who I am and why I've got so many negative quirks. This book has been the most detrimental book or feedback I've ever had on my healing journey from sexual abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Fun Learning Apache on Your Own","review":"This is an excellent book for someone who wants to learn by doing, as the subtitle suggests. One needs an Apache server to work with, but the book comes with a CD that includes the Apache server. One can experiment with the different modules and try different things. The book is filled with review questions (and answers). A big plus is that it covers more than just Apache. It has stuff on HTML for the HTML non-expert. (It has a whole chapter on frames.) This makes it a great book for beginners.The book is easy to read, and flows nicely. The coverage of the basics, the fundamentals and the theory of running a real Web server under different circumstances far outweighs the fact the book is a bit outdated. The Apache vesion discussed in the book is not the current version, so there may be a few things that are slightly different with today's Apache server.I am really glad I bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"best we had","review":"I had couple other bags which all cost about the same and did not last vey long under my abuse. however this one has survied almost 5years. traveling all over the world.

If I put my short portrait lens in the cases then I have to fish them out, since they only open on the top. As a result to make my system work I have to mount the big zoom on the camera, the 3 smaller lenses in the small outer lens tubes, flash and hoods in the center with the camera. If the pack had adjustible size lens tubes or even larger ones as options, I could make this work. I need to be able to strap around my waist. Terribly limited organization options.

Still he wants you to take him seriously like he is an artist who matters. Forget It! I take him as seriously as Lenny Kravitz, who is another wannabe in a slightly different genre. Both are mediocre artists hiding behind some sort of relevance they feel they have achieved by doing their musical homework and writing some socially conscious tripe on occasion. THIS GUY IS A LOSER.

The album design is awesome, but the songs need a little more energy. Sure, i liked some of them, but overall, its not something i would want to listen to more than once. If you are a young person, like me, and desires music with a BANG, to it, don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"I'm a huge fan but this is easily Ben's worst album. I can't even get through a lot of songs without skipping to the next. Some of the songs have momments of greatness, but are then ruined by trite lyrics or ripoff riffs.Between The Will to Live and this album, Harper slowly lost the ability to infuse soul or feeling into his songs. To be honest this album is just plain dull. It was apparent that he invested a lot of emotion into his first three albums (Welcome to this Cruel World, Fight for Your Mind and The Will to Live), but since then he's been on cruise control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ain't what it used to be.....","review":"Long time BHIC fan, and was really looking forward to this one.

I just don't feel these discs (I bought the 3 cd edition) have the soul to them that seem to permeate his earlier works.

Its more concise and cohesive with his writing and soloing. The producing/mixing of the album is much more professional and creative than the previous albums.

Boy was I wrong. They immediately dispose of their rich, complex instrumental songs and replace them with a stupid robot voice who sings such vapid lyrics as \\"in my future car/ we will drive far\\".

The genre is capable of so much more uplift and complexity: see Tortoise, earlier Trans Am, Mogwai, etc. It is a sonic transcription of the apocalypse, but not in a good way. I bought this at the time of the Columbine shootings and it felt like a nauseatingly appropriate soundtrack. This did not challenge my assumptions about the world; instead, it just made me feel mighty low.In terms of how it sounds, see what the guy from Georgia wrote below. He hit the nail on the head. There is no redemption on this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this from Thrill Jockey for 9 bucks!","review":"I really have no idea why this album is reviewed as poor or even mediocre.

Hopefully Trans Am will come to the dreary Boise, Id."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not THAT bad at all","review":"In fact, the more I listen to it the more I appreciate it. Trans am once again fuses different styles with ease. The marriage of a kraftwerklike influence and heavy metal riffs may seem confusing at first but don't be afraid of it. Its pretty darn good, especially television eyes and futureworld. Both those songs alone made it worth buying. The second half of the disc is nothing short of sublime.

I perform it myself. However, the choice of Joe Cocker to see the poorly arranged \\"Bye, Bye, Blackbird\\" was a grave disappointment, and took away from the overall collection. Not only did it betray the composer's intent, Cocker didn't even include the introduction to the song, which is vital to understanding the tune.There are standouts, for sure, such as Jimmy Durante, Louis Armstrong, Harry Connick, Jr., and Celine Dion, of course. She is not over-rated as some have suggested. She fits perfectly with this collection, and a great surprise is the presence of Dr. John. He is such a great artist and performer.

He literally lives as each day is his last as he \\"earns\\" 24 hours of time from his daily efforts in his job. As an aside, Timberlake does a really good job in this movie and is definitely one of its key positives.But other than Timberlake there aren't too may other positives. The movie moves quickly which is good but lacks real integrity. When it is so easy to rob someone of time (just lock your arm in theirs) it should have been far grittier and frightening rather than the overly ordered, almost robotic depiction of the future shown here.Not one I'd recommend nor watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Time","review":"One of the worst movies i ever saw, absolutely terrible.

The acting definitely isn't the best, and there are some parts of the film that drag, but the premise is so intriguing (if unsettling) and the film is shot so well that it makes up for it's downfalls. I thought Timberlake did a fine job as the lead and I found myself thinking I wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of him in future roles.

However, the likability of In Time's two leads just wasn't enough to overcome the film's other problems. The story takes place in the distant future when adults stop aging at 25 but instead accrue time as currency. When factory worker Will Salas ends up with 116 years of time belonging to a dead man, he's accused of murder, and with a businessman's daughter in tow, he sets out to confront the system. Despite an intriguing premise and capable people both in front of and behind the camera, In Time suffers from all too blunt and heavy-handed storytelling. You'd probably be better off with director Andrew Niccol's similarly themed previous film, Gattaca."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Idea Wasted","review":"Ugh...this flick has a bad story/plot filled with a bunch of people who try to look and sound cool but don't and most of them cannot act, especially Timberlake.

That shouldn't be too difficult a question to answer.If you had all the time in the world, would you tire of it? That's the rub.The movie really doesn't deliver on the premise. It takes the tried and not so true path of us against them, rich vs. poor.

The cast is pretty good. Timberlake is a relatively weak link...he's a basically competent actor, but just surrounded by better ones, including Cillian Murphy and Amanda Seyfried. And, we've seen better performances from Timberlake (The Social Network, most notably) The problem here is the constant flow of cliches and standard action movie moments. There are all kinds of logical problems and plot improbabilities.

And unfortunately Justin TImberlake is not that strong enough an actor to make this movie better and also Dakota Fanning is just not a hot chick.

The concept is good but - the acting is 2nd rate and the script is sign posted, cheesy and lame . The graphics are laughable, though that clearly wasn't the intention. It focuses heavily on Justin, if your a die hard fan of his you will love it, otherwise it will probably make you queasy. It starts off ok but gets lamer, everyone in the room where I was watching the film was rolling their eyes and mocking the movie by half way, and were struggling to see the movie through to finish. Lots of cliche scenes that are hilarious though not in a good way.

No more currency -- time is now the currency. Buying a cup of coffee for 4 minutes off your life. It's pure gold. It really is. However, the direction was poor, and the movie fell way short on what it could have been.Timberlake did a good job. It wasn't his fault that the director crapped the bed on this one. Justin Timberlake has pretty much solidified himself as a well rounded, excellent actor. I have no issues whatsoever with his performance. It was believable, and he did the best with what direction he was given. Cillian Murphy (Timekeeper) gave an incredible performance. It's too bad it was wasted.I was actually explaining to a friend the other day the concept of this movie, and my friend was like, \\"Holy [explicit], that sounds amazing!\\" And it does.

No, but then few films of this genre have ever approached that 1982 intelligent philosophical portrayal. I do give \\"In Time\\" some props for a potentially creative storyline but then it fell into the Hollywood shallow formula of cheap CGI (LCD time display embedded in the arm); foot and car chase scenes with bad guys; love interest with daddy's daughter; the usual rich selling out the poor storyline. Acting was passable OK with Timberlake a touch better. What was missing to me was greater depth-of-character and in particular the back story of how the whole time transfer and it's consequences was achieved. There's just too much dumbing down coming out of the film industry. Perhaps Hollywood et al. might show more social responsibility and put out some educative effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Anti-Capitalism Movie","review":"The premise was interesting ... the screenplay and writing were really poor.

The message is that we are all running out of time. Unknown to most of humanity, only the elite selected few really know the real story of the earth. There is an interface that can bring immorality to the selected ones. (And yes, it really does exist ... but it is not for the masses, unfortunately - most of humanity must indeed die. But this is really their own choice.)Some believe that this is some sort of New World Order ... but that too will be a miserable failure.How do you really change your time zone?

I thought Cillian Murphy did a great job with the role he played, but it wasn't enough to make me like this movie when it was all said and done. It's hard for me to even recommend this movie unless you're either A.) A huge Justin Timberlake fan or B.) A huge sci-fi fan. If you're neither of these I would definitely suggest you take a pass on this, but if you do fall into one of these two categories I would make it a rental only."},{"rating":"1","title":"mainstream train in action.","review":"I never watch anything mainstream but this title promising something edgy catch my wallet and I bought it used--good move Kawasaki!

The concept of using time as universal currency is not bad but what happened to all welfare people if even working class dont have enough for tomorrow and half of population dont pay any taxes? This is the question. I kinda expect to see future as is, instead, for no reason males and females share apartments without having connections or sex.

The comment on the huge gap between the rich and poor was not lost on me , but I found it almost being repeated and repeated through out the movie. While the concept of time as money makes for a great film, I feel the In Time missed the mark in execution.

I was not familiar with the writer and nothing thrills me more than to have a BIG book that is supposedly a \\"must-read\\" but this choice had the BIG happening for me but not the \\"must-read\\" part anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music, Time Theory, Race: How does he do it?","review":"The government should immediately construct a time-status machine and put Richard Powers in it so that he can continue writing novels for eternity. Every time I read one of his novels I come away almost speechless. As a result I limit myself to one of them every 3 or 4 years; otherwise I'd be mute.Powers takes on the issue of race in the United States in his novel. He uses music and time theory as two ways to advance the plot. If you think the three issues are unrelated, just hold on, Powers makes the case and seals it shut.The enigmatic message of the white, Jewish father to his black, estranged daughter says a lot about this novel: \\"No matter where you point your telescope, there is a different wavelength.\\" (I hope I got that right, I gave my copy of the book to a friend).I can't say how much I admire this novel. Read it at your own risk; it will change the way you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A writer with too much talent and too little ability to know when to stop--to stop a sentence, to stop an analogy, to stop altogether. This books needs a very good editor of a kind which no longer seems to exist--Max Perkins, for example. This book is like the housing bubble, way out of line with reality. It is difficult for me to believe that so many reviewers and readers have been praising this book, with few suggestions that it is overdone and BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time outlives everything","review":"This is an amazing novel byRichard Powers. an ambitious generational tale of an American family with a mixed heritage of African-American and German Jew, and covers the travails, triumphs and tragedies of this family. There are three children, one with a beautiful singing voice who opts for a classical music career, a daughter who becomes involved with the civil rights struggle,and a second brother who, though gifted as well, buries his ambition to bridge the gap between his siblings. Not a perfect novel--sometimes Powers' superb style turns into a list of historical events as a means to convey the sweep of time-- but the central issues of race, identity, culture are handled well within the story. The writing is generous and frequently beautiful, especially at the moments when the description turns to the music. Powers, as well as any one, describes how notes played the right way can make one believe in heaven and the angels who live there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was totally enraptured","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I had never read any of Powers's previous work, and I'm not sure I would have picked this one up on my own, but a friend gave it to me. The writing was beautiful, and kept me enthralled for the whole book. At the same time, the author covered such a huge range of topics -- race relations, music, human relationships, Civil Rights -- that I felt that I was getting an education as I read. It's a smart, lterary, moving page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither fish nor foul","review":"This is not a book of ideas - it is a loose tapestry of music theory and the physics of time woven around a weak narrative concerning characters that do not engage the reader on any emotional level.The exposition, through inner thought and the scant experience of the characters about race in America, is interesting, especially when placed against the Jewish experience of the boys' father but that's all there was for me. I don't care what happens to Jonah - he's too lost in his world, too much not of the real world to be a proper character. I don't understand why Ruth abandoned everyone in her life - who taught her, what was the turning point - she was too young when her mother died for that to be it.I wish I cared for the characters, I wish I wasn't so bored with the musicology and I wish it had all fit together better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about Kindle version?","review":"I wanted to purchase this books for my Kindle.

One creepy criminal is throwing spoiled fruit juice bombs into people's cars in Manila Bay, meanwhile a \\"cockfight\\" is disrupted by gunshots. The way the entire plot unravels is quite unbelievable, but for people who like to read books where the bodies stack up (unfortunately, sometimes, that's me), it's a fairly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is brilliant...","review":"I went looking for a simple book to read as an introduction into the process of healing from emotional abuse. I found this book and it changed my life. Filled with quotes, brief yet poignant advice and bold-faced affirmations, this book made so many things clear and helped me to sort out a lot of my confusion. I learned as much from this book as I gained comfort from it.I have one recommendation to anyone who reads it: while you are making your way through the book make a note of the affirmations that really touch you. When you're done, go back and copy those affirmations on index cards and place them where you can read them each day. I copied at least twenty. My favorite one is \\"You deserve calmness and tranquility in your life.

(The one I bought in Ireland charged very slowly, but it did charge and the being charged icon showed on the BB screen.)

Keneally's Joan, although resolute, is a human, vulnerable figure, unlike Mark Twain's saintly heroine.This retelling emphasizes the very real sacrificial aspect ofher life. I thought the dialogue wonderful - plausible, informed, witty. To this former soldier, the ways Joan's fellowmilitary commanders skillfully translate her special charisma into battlefield advantage is imaginative. Joan's career afterRheims is not covered. I greatly enjoyed this book, and its very different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Inspiration?","review":"Keneally is, no doubt, a skilled and knowlegabel writer, and this novel based on the story of Joan of Arc is very well researched, but as the story of a brave and mystical hero, it's a dry and inhumane read which lacks passion, courage and inspiration. It's all too rational, too predictable, too over-explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book!!!","review":"I ordered this book maybe two months ago. It sat on my shelf for a long while until I finally began to read it. I hated it from the beginning but gave it a few days to see if it would improve, but I only got to the third or fourth chapter before I tossed into the trash can, (literally) What was writen about Joan was horribly degrading of her, portraying her to be a violent, sarcastic person and you get the impression that she is not completly right upstairs. It even had her participating in ocultpractices! All the characters are perverted and foul mouthed and the book is not based on true history at all. In other words its not worth the paper its written on.

The \\"extra thin\\" diameter ensures that the pin fits in tight watchband ends but may not be suitable for dive watches or others that take hard abuse. However, the action of the internal spring is strong and sets the pins securely into the watch case arms.

I can use it to warm up stuff while using the toaster oven to roast. But the inner height of oven is smaller due to design of the separate warmer section. For my old toaster oven(different band), I can easiy roast a chicken or pork shoulder, but when I use this oven, the chicken or the pork will touch the top of the oven and become burn. I am little bit disappointed about this. And suppose it is a convection oven, will cook faster. But I find it the opposite, it takes me longer to cook (I compare it with my old toaster oven which is a convention oven). And also for the boiler, it is not so powderful, it takes longer to get the food get brown. Tell you the truth I am thinking about return it to find out is there any problem with my oven or it is design like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Starner","review":"I received the item on time and was very happy with the features that the oven offered. I was looking for an oven that offered \\"toasting, warming, broiling, and conventional features. I looked at other ovens with the features that I wanted but none of them came close. The price was just right for what I was willing to pay for such a good quality oven. I would say that the value of this oven is worth over $150. I would hightly recommend this oven if your looking the features mentioned above. However the only draw back to the oven is that it must be kept unplugged at all times (outside of being in use)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine, until...","review":"We got this as a christmas gift and have been using it fairly frequently ever since.

Some toast well, some bake well, but never have I found one that did both well...until now. The T Fal Avante is the toaster oven that does it all. Nice toast. Big enough to bake a casserole on Thanksgiving, when the oven is full. A nice feature is the warming tray on top. Great for keeping rolls or biscuits warm before dinner. I actually bought 4 different toaster ovens, and tested them before buying this one. It's hard to find one that is a toaster AND an oven, this does the job. It's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my T-Fal convection/toaster oven!","review":"The first think I made in it was lamb chops... they were perfection. The combination of \\"convection\\" and \\"toaster\\" is great for cooking meat because it seals the meat and keeps it juicy. If you like your meat very well done, you might want to lower the temperature and cook it a little longer. Batter recipes might also need adjusting in the same way.The only issue I have is the size. I wish it were bigger, even an inch each direction would help. It's been a little hard to find pans to fit in it. That is usually because the pan measurements don't include the \\"lip\\" around the edge of the pan. The curved design of the door may also make some pans less compatible.Aside from the size issue, I like everything else about this oven. I'd buy another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy","review":"I bought this before Christmas since we were having a lot of company - and I really love it.

Count me as a very happy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for couples","review":"We got one of these ovens for Christmas and so far I like it! Unlike others, I find the warmer very useful. It's just the two of us, and I freeze bread because we never use a whole loaf, and the warmer is great to defrost and warm it. Just turn on \\"warm\\" and use the default setting of 15 mins. The oven comes with two racks, a broiling pan, and two shallow pans, one for each section. I read the directions once, but the oven is simple to use, and even my husband got the hang of it right away. Yes, the clock is not backlit, and thus hard to read, but no big deal--everyone has a clock already on the stove and microwave, right? This is a very handy item to have, and I look forward to eliminating our toaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfaction beyond expectation","review":"I find that the T-Fal Convection Toaster Oven is all that it is advertised to be.

Three gripes I have are 1.you can't put 2 racks in at once, even though the oven is large enough, the slots are not there 2. When you pull the rack out towards you, it tilts downward and is likely to fall 3. Toaster is pretty slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Purchased this in hopes it would quickly toast up bread for my three kids, and it takes literally 9 minutes to toast a single slice! What a waste of money. It has a large footprint, so it eats up precious counter space, has no interior light and, worst of all, bakes, rather than toasts bread. Bread comes out stiff and difficult to chew. Am going back to a 4 slice basic toaster oven for a fraction of what I spent on this inefficient machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tfal toaster oven","review":"I like this oven very much. Have used it for toasting bread, & bagels. Broiled a steak for my husband. Much easier to clean a little oven than a big one.

I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of problems with this unit","review":"The first unit I was shipped had the one side broken in...this was the side with the convection fan. (The sides of the oven are made of plastic.) I returned it, and Amazon promptly shipped me a new one. This one looked to be in mint condition. I actually cooked a piece of toast in it, and it turned out perfect. But when I tried to heat up a sandwich on the Bake setting, after 2 minutes, when the convection fan kicked in, it made this hideous noise like a machine shop saw...very loud.

I reseached and bought this oven because of the good reviews on amazon.com.All of the food I have prepared in the oven has been great -- BUT -- I just cooked some pork chops and I had opened the oven door and cut a piece of meat, closed the oven door and put the piece of meat on a plate in front of the oven to see if it was cooked.Suddenly the top glass shattered, the handle from the top landed on my plate and there was glass on the counter top and the floor. I am lucky I was not hurt.I immediately called t-fal and they are closed for the weekend -- I will be calling them Monday morning and I do expect my money returned -- I would not want a replacement oven.I came here to see if this has happened to anyone else, and apparently it has.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS OVEN.And I am disappointed because I liked it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but a hassle to set timer","review":"It's a very nice toaster oven. Just two items to keep in mind. One is that it is pretty big. If you are used to the cheapo toastmaster size, this is a lot bigger. Be sure you have the counter space for it or otherwise don't mind a pretty large oven.Unlike our Panasonic, its default timer is 30 minutes. If you go to turn it on, it will stay on for 30 minutes if you do nothing but hit the start button. I think that is a hassle as most of the time we use this to reheat things, so we set the time for 3 to 13 minutes. Instead of counting up, 1, 2, 3 minutes, you have to count down from 30 minutes. It takes a lot longer to do it that way and this gets old pretty quicky in regular use."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good little oven","review":"I ordered this when I realized that sadly, my oven was not working properly and it was going to be a while before a replacement or repair man showed up. The reason for the four stars is the wire racks go in a little stragely, at least the top one does, the bottom one is fine. Still it is fuctional and cooks and toasts quickly and evenly, and that is really what I was after. Easy to program and the alert is just loud enough to let you know your food is done. I chose free shipping and it arrived super fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK toast, but lousy grilling/broiling","review":"I boutght this for two reasons.I live alone and want to keep a loaf of bread in fresh in the freezer, and want tothrow a couple of frozen slices in the toaster and forget them.And I want to grill (broil) single portions of things like chicken breasts or steaks without messing up the large broiler in my stove.The T-fal makes OK toast (though it does tend to dry out the bread) but the grill function simply doesn't get hot enough, fast enough. I need to waste huge amounts of energy to get it hot enough to work, and even then the result is still so-so.The warming tray is handy for keeping vegetables hot while the rest of the meal is cooked.The racks are hard to adjust, and I still haven't figured out how to use the ill-fitting pans and trays.In all, a disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"This replaced a 15 year old DeLonghi Alfredo that is still going strong, but a little tired looking and lacking in modern features like convection. The Avante Elite looks very nice. It has nice heavy, enameled pans along with the wire racks. Toasting seems a little slower than my previous oven. It is simple to operate. It is quiet. The warmer on top is nice. I miss the interior light and the quicker toasting of the DeLonghi, but not the noisy clockwork timer. Overall I like it.

We use it as a toaster, and an oven. Cooked a chicken in it in 70 minutes, just like the picture shows, and it came out great. The bun warmer seems to make the bottom of the buns crusty/burned before it gets them very warm on top. The main glass door rattles something awful while cooking. We've inserted non-flammable pads into the space between the glass and the metal so it doesn't rattle as much. As far as cooking performance and efficiency, we love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional taster oven","review":"This toaster oven serves my purposes very well. I find the warmer feature very useful, it toasts well (though a bit slowly), can accomodate a small chicken, and the crumb tray is much easier to clean than my previous one.

I don't \\"cook,\\" I reheat (mostly) steaks from Sizzler. It does this in splendid fashion, keeping the rare center, crisping up the outside of the steak.But the warming tray thing is very problematic. I have it on my cooktop so I can use the fan when broiling, but the warming tray lid will not open completely. Even though I never use it, it gets filthy from the main oven use and since the glass lid is not removable, it's nearly impossible to get truly clean. Since there is no flange between top and bottom ovens, this also causes grease and dirt to build up on the warmer glass cover.It isn't as easy to clean as it claimed to be. The insides and top of the main oven refuse all attempts to get them clean.However, for baking and broiling, I've never used a better oven. Bar none.

It was dark, eerie and moody tuned which is what I was attracted to. Collected does deliver this dark and eerie music with the classic Karmacoma, the melodic but dark Angel, Teardrop, Inertia Creeps and Risingsun from Mezzanine. Collected does keep me happy with these well known tracks along with other past hits that are enjoyable and adapt towards my tastes.

When I saw a 2-disc best of cd come out, I was ready to take the plunge and buy this instead of the single disc also offered. However, maybe I didn't read through the specifications closely enough on the second disc. It is is a dual disc CD/DVD layer made in Holland and formatted in NTSC. Therefore, neither the CD nor the DVD portion will play in all players. I have tried several players so far with no luck.

He also argues that the idea of bishops being direct successors to the Apostles is historically false.He then argues from a philosophical standpoint that dogma cannot be infallible because of the limitations of human language. After this, he gives a description of his vision of the Church. One where bishops and Pope act as leaders but give more freedomg to theologians to engage in scholarship and teach doctrine. In Kung's vision, the bishops would only step in and exercise binding teaching authority when there was an \\"emergency\\" where the Church was rife with heresy and disunity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Veteran's life","review":"The book Poetic Healing is a very in depth view of a vietnam veterans struggles with returning from war and also faced with having to live with tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears. The poems in the book are very good in that they show emotion on what he is feeling during war, after war, and faced with the difficulties of living with this ringing and having debates on ending his life.

Rather, his strength is effectively covering and interpreting old blues songs into a more contemporary setting. This is John Hammond's best early album from 1965. The record features ace players such as Charlie Musselwhite on harmonica as well as future Band members Levon Helm and Garth Hudson. The playing is strong and Hammond gives his best white boy blues growl. The record is pure electric blues, none of the acoustic wimpy stuff. Hammond's vocals may seem a bit parodical because it sounds like he is trying too hard, but it is good music nonetheless. Check out his version of Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD- terrbile sound","review":"Recently picked up two copies of this CD from Amazon. The sound is awful on both copies- lots of crackling in the background. It almost sounds as if it were mastered from an poor quality record. This ain't exactly a hot seller- perhaps this is an old pressing that is a number of years old. Stay away from Amazon's inventory. Another retailer's inventory or an import pressing might be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An under-appreciated legend","review":"This album should properly be considered the first super-group, since it contains half of The Band plus Jimmy Lewis, Charley Musselwhite and Mike Bloomfield from Chicago. It may also be the origin of Dylan's employment of the Band, since he and Hammond knew one another well (Hammond's father, the legendary John Hammond of Columbia Records, hired Dylan for Columbia). A little rough in places and therefore much more faithful to the Chicago blues sound, it is a stand out album. Hammond is one of the few able to slide easily between acoustic and electric blues, and is still performing 45 years later. Hammond plays primarily slide electric and leads are taken by Bloomfield and Robbie Robertson with Charley Musselwhite on harp. I've owned various iterations of this album since it was released and am glad to have the CD.Rob Boyter"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"In the last few years I have read many spiritual books, and this is now one of my favorites.The author draws on the readings of Edgar Cayce, as well as the views of several others, to discuss the realms that await us after death. A great asset of this book is that it shows how our thoughts and beliefs will actually impact the realm we find ourselves in upon death. For instance, although God does not damn anyone to a hellish afterlife, if someone believes that that is what they will find, they will. However, no one is stuck in a \\"negative\\" realm forever - there is always help available to those who are ready to give up their \\"earth-bound\\" thoughts.The author also discusses the importance of prayer and meditation in preparing our souls for the afterlife, and he has included several exercises to help readers with the process.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality, the after-life, &/or Edgar Cayce's readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting and Affirming","review":"After my father died I woke up in the middle of the night by persistent thoughts in my head.

I am not even totally sure where they are from although I think from Germany. This is a disc that had to grow on me. At first I found it rather generic and reminded me a lot of Enchant. Upon additional listens I came to enjoy the disc a lot more, especially the last third of it. The band is fairly typical of the Inside Out label, solid mainstream progressive rock that occasionally borders on metal. Instrumentally the band is solid and vocally they use a lot of harmonies to get their point across. I have also seen them compared to Riverside and indeed there are some similarities. This is a very nice album that I think would appeal to fans of other Inside Out label artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scripts for shows","review":"I wanted to peruse a copy of this play as a possible fall production at my school.

If you are interested in the Bible as a historical/cultural document, you would do well to seek out other sources.Early on, this book begins to make the case for reading the Bible to be close to God, and presses the case by arguing that societies (such as the contemporary U.S.) with low or patchy readership, are not \\"hungry for God\\". On a few occasions, the book professes to be a resource for non-Christians, but I think there are other texts (like the Dummies book or the notes in the Oxford Scholar's Bible) that would better serve an audience truly not looking for a religious experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"I was very disappointed in it.

All you need to do is find \\"one that works for you.\\" Following that advice, many people may do themselves harm. Not all diets are the same, and someone trying to avoid diabetes needs to eat those foods that will specifically not spike their blood sugar - namely low-glycemic foods. After all the hype about this book, it was truly a disappointment, full of quaint, over simplified, and misinformed advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"This book is essentially useless. It is filled with silliy things like \\"learn to read food labels\\" (duh), \\"listen to music while you excercise\\", \\"spend some time with elderly people\\" (I am elderly).Etc., etc.If you really want to know about prediabetes and how to prevent its progression to type 2 diabetes, look elsewhere. Unless you are into touchy-feely bromides, that might made you feel good, but don't help anything. I take it back. If you don't know what food labels mean, and you are not aware that starches convert to sugar, or that dancing is excercise, or that it's helpful to stay trim and active, then this book might be a wealth of information for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DVD Rock Power","review":"If you are a true die hard AC/DC Fan from way back then you will want to add this DVD to your collection.

It doesn't have the extension parts like Settlers, so only 3 or 4 people can play...this limits total play by larger families or groups.

Some whisper, some shout. A moving tale is told","review":"This wonderful book is about John Washington, a man who does not fit any preconception, any pigeonhole. He is hero and anti-hero, he drives headlong through life, yet somehow sustains two separate lives. As he leads his fragmenting family into riches and ignores it into ruin, the story sinks and rises, sinks then rises again. A musical theme, Madame Butterfly, runs through the narrative. The structure is operatic, tragic. There are arias, duets, trios--asides are spoken in low voices. Memorable people and places, and stirring events flow in and out of story, yet the author's skill is such that the thread of the tale is never lost. You cannot wait to turn the page.

No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this.

The research is poor, the writing is dull, sanctimonious and irritating. Unlike some commentators here I didn't mind the tendentious, anticapitalist stance (was quite looking forward to it). What I minded was the accumulation of small and obvious errors in a work of non fiction (suspension of disbelief applies as much in non fiction as fiction) and a prose style like a boiled pudding.First book I've ever ordered from Amazon that I wished I'd skipped. (And I read the first 50 pages in the bath -- otherwise I'd've sent it back.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and skip it!!!","review":"To call this book a Marxist rant would be an understatement. Davis spends over 400 pages verbally demolishing a great city. I've lived here my entire life and I could not imagine living anywhere else. Nothing escapes his wrath. He engages in the same tiring class warfare arguments all Marxists value; Rich against poor, black and latino against white, religion against secularization. Everyone who has a position of power in Los Angeles is raked across the coals. Never mind that he does not provide any of his own solutions for the supposed problems of our city. If you are looking for a balanced well-argued book do not look here, but if you are looking to read a leftest diatribe you'll feel perfectly at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually lacking","review":"Mike Davis, in an interview, admitted that he does not let the facts stand in the way of his arguments. City of Quartz demonstrates this tendency to the fullest. In a previous work, Davis pulled a passage out of a work of fiction and cited it as fact. He shows similar inventiveness in this work, citing studies that were never conducted, inventing interviews, and displaying a creativity with statistics that would be admirable if it weren't for the frightening fact that many who have read this work found it \\"incisive.\\"Those who applaud this work do so because it supports their politics. Those who attack it do so because it does not. I tried to remain neutral while reading, but when I read the book I found the inaccuracies to completely outweigh any points made by Davis. His purposeful and methodical deception does more harm than good to his cause.For more information on this work, see an article at:(...)I would steer clear of Mike Davis and his blatant distortions of the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant analysis of LA history--prescient vision of future","review":"Cultural Studies at its best.

This idea blinds him to the vigor any dynamism of Los Angeles, and to the benefits that have accumulated to anyone other than the rich, or the middle-class white homeowners who are the secondary demons of his story. If one is capable of filtering out all the marxian cant and \\"un-class-angle\\" the text, it can be quite informative on both the shifts of the power structure in Los Angeles and the sources of the Tax Revolt of the 1970s and 1980s, but the book is otherwise an unrewarding slog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antiquated representation of LA","review":"This book presents a very antiquated and negatively biased view of LA. I am left doubtful if many of the scenarios in the book were as \\"bad\\" as the author leads the reader to believe.It is naive on the part of the author to separate the actual problems of LA from other large American cities, and present them as mutually exclusive to LA.This book panders to a seemingly worldwide hatred of LA, and a kind of love affair with the notion of a eventual LA apocalypse.What a disappointment that the author investigates no deeper than what the popular opinion of Los Angeles is, and panders to this misconception."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Marxist Trash","review":"Thanks you MbuArtRnch@aol.com for exposing the truth.

Free your minds and do a body-bag count of the Communist/Socialist legacy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"As a student of urban development and politics, I can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of Los Angeles that, by employing only simple and misguided economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems.

Shame on Columbia for making this guy so wealthy. Shame on you if you've bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"This could have been great but somewhere along the way Neil Diamond must have lost it. He's got a great voice and has at least occasionally interpreted other writers' material quite well before. There are only two tracks that I consider as being up to Diamond standard: \\"As Time Goes By\\" and \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\". The other 18 tracks all sound dull and uninspired, as if ND wasn't really in to the songs when recording them.And what really upset me is that the original 2 CD release could have easily fit on one disc as the total combined playing time is just a little over 60 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Paced.

However, I am a great admirer of film scores and, often, the songs that have gone with them. To me, Elmer Bernstein's orchestral work and a soulful Neil Diamond singing some of my favourite songs form a difficult combination to beat.While the tempo isn't what one would expect - songs such as 'Windmills of Your Mind' and 'The Look of Love' are delivered much more slowly than I am sure the composers ever envisaged - Diamond offers a unique and, in my mind, completely delightful collection of some of film's best-loved scores. While boosted by Bernstein's work, buyers should know that Diamond's songs do not surpass the originals' pizazz, though in some cases they come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd will make you fall in love, again","review":"When I bought this cd I had no clue of what to expect. I have bought other Neil Diamond cds before, but those had a lot of his songs on them. This cd was different because it had all the old standards on it. I should say this cd had my kind of music on it.When I played this cd I had serious doubts about whether Neil could make the adjustment to sing soft love songs. Well let me tell you, Neil did a beautiful job with these songs. His voice really sounds like it was made to sing this kind of music. What a wonderful surpise this cd was.I would hope that Neil will try some more projects like this in the future. I think anyone who hears this cd will be very pleased.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Oldies & Newbies!","review":"Neil Diamond's medley of past and present movie adagios in this great album are indeed very pleasant listening. He still has the voice to delight those of us who enjoy the music and lyrics of songs from great lyricists, past and present, although I thought that at times Neil held the pitch of the note a little too long and as a result the notes became a little flat. Nevertheless, he still sings with passion and feeling and I have always regarded him as a great songwriter and singer. He has definitely earned his place in the annals of the all-time great singer/songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"like Neils traditional songs better.","review":"Tempo is to slow for most of the songs on this album.

He rarely misses with that combination and has produced some of the best work of the 70s,80s and 90s. However, like \\"Songs from the Bril Building\\" these are not his works, and he simply is not good doing them. Fans will no doubt buy it, but we have had no new written output in a while - Tennessee Moon - being the last. Since his divorce we have had live albums, several greatest hits packages recycling what most fans already have and this. IT is technically good, well produced, just dull music by numbers. It is maximum output with minimum effor and a far cry from \\"Moon\\". If you want to hear a singer with an orchestra who does hit the note, try Linda Rondstadt's albums with Nelson riddle. Neil can do better, so why do this ? Write a new album and hit us with it, that is what the fans really want."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bomber","review":"I'm been a Neil Diamond fan for years.

I had a similar experience with his recording 'Up On The Roof' and still trying to recover from his version of 'Don't Be Cruel'. Stick to your own gutsy music Neil.

I should have saved my money and got some food with it. And Neil's attempt at the well-known Titanic song is, in a word, disgraceful. If Andrea Bocelli were to sing that song, he'd kick Neil's @! .I'm sorry, but this man doesn't have a lot of talent on his back. He did sell 110 million albums, but who cares?

The 'textbook' strikes a good balance of high interest readability and scientific accuracy...most other labs err on the latter. About 1/5 of my students wind up buying the kit themselves...when else does that happen? A FEW TIPS: Once attached, hot glue the components and posts on the underside of the board...it will last MUCH longer. Hot glue the leads on the piezo transducer. Be VERY careful with the transisters. The other weak link is the battery attachment, which can be cut open and hot glued for a more permanent lab (18 students x 20 projects...and still running).

I find that when I am shooting I will often use shoulder strap or waist belt separately, but when I am hiking, it helps ease the weight when I use them together.I also like that the Orion's low height, allows me to carry a regular daypack along if I need the extra room.Overall, a very useful bag.Just wish it came with an AW cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUITO LEGAL- GREAT MUSIC","review":"Este cd e muito legal, e o cd mais novo do Marcelo D2.

I came across it because I heard the score was done by Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails. To my surprise, it's the best use of Nine Inch Nails music since the title sequence of \\"Se7en\\". The story and the music are like an inseparable force pulling you toward... madness? They really got the dark vibe thing working.Story concerns a drifter who gets a job painting an old motel in this rural town. On one level it's like a 1950's thriller, but it also feels like it's on acid. We watch the main character go through his daily routine, but it's always like there's this huge, horrible thing looming around him. And when we figure out what that thing is, the film achieves some old-school catharsis. There may be some rough spots along the way, but unlike a lot of recent films that rely on cheap \\"twist\\" endings, Deepwater's twist is the real deal. Well worth watching, and LISTENING."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, everyone's a little harsh","review":"This is not my genre of choice, but I got hooked early on and was totally surprised at the ending.

His vanity and hubris are on clear display and one has to wonder why he felt the need to share this type of personal information with the general topic.

In addition to Ellison's writings, Robert O'Meally's introduction offers keen insight into the style of jazz culture.I wouldn't recommend this book to readers looking for an introduction to jazz. For that, I would suggest sticking to liner notes, writings by musicians, and objective writers.

Forget it: even complete strangers to the Divine Sarah's music deserve to hear the original, untainted. Sassy never needed special effects, and neither do listeners with good taste. You either like Sarah, or you don't -- no amount of remixing would change most folks' minds, nor should it. Sarah can shine on her own, thank you very much!

His reading of the Swift Jewel Cowboys' \\"Little Willie Green\\" is great -- his final warblings made me laugh out loud. And he does to \\"Moonlight Bay\\" what he once did to \\"Shine On Harvest Moon\\" -- he takes an impossible corny and tapped-out relic and transforms it into a strange, haunting dream.

A priest, Father Beale, known to Ben since childhood, is accused of murder when two of his parishioners are found dead. One of them was found dead on Father Beale's desk. Ben is now in a position to defend Father Beale against these charges and possibly save his life. However, there is more than meets the eye with the priest and these surprises very much threaten Ben's defense.William Bernhardt is quite adept at writing the courtroom thriller. Most of the action does, in fact, occur in this arena. The trial, itself, propels the book forward as the well sketched characters battle it out. A conclusion that highlights a flaw in the legal system, is a bit unsettling. However, the book is a pleasant enough diversion on a hot summer day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Poor","review":"This is my introduction to this author and his apparently recurring cast of characters, and it will be my last look in their direction.

The manga is creepy, agonizingly slow-paced, and leaves most readers a little ill. The movie captured some of that with its depictions of popular music being used to influence mass suicide among young people. One scene shows high school student talking about the suicides and deciding, seemingly on a lark, to do the same thing. Suddenly they are standing on the edge of the roof and leaping.The addition of a murderous glam rock band only makes the film confusing and, like many Japanese horror films, some of the cultural references and monologuing are tedious to Americans.This is a good purchase if you like horror movies and want something outside of the regular hack-and-slash offerings in the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"What feardotcom shoulda been","review":"This is what feardotcom shoulda been IMHO. The ending, without giving anything away, was wholly unexpected and something you'd expect from manga or anime.

Several American movies have had similar plots to this, but the whole feeling I had while watching it was that of an anime with live characters -- especially the end (which I won't reveal). Personally this is a movie that I won't be ready for watching again for at LEAST 5 years; it was that* creepy -- though I'm glad I did* watch it, it belongs up there with the new wave of Japanese masterpieces IMHO. It's VERY intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Content","review":"This review will be short lived as 30+ five star reviews have already backed this movie.I felt the movie was done in very poor taste. There is a way to handle the subject but it was almost as if they filmed this movie because \\"ohh suicide! What a marvel!\\" By no means am I bashing the movie because of the gore, gore is a part of our reality but the movie lacked a tasteful plotline. I have to say the skin shreds were a bit much as well.I'm sure things like this do happen but when you put it into a film there's a line between being real and taking it too far. I strongly advise no one under 17 to watch this movie.I'm sorry to those that did like it but this is just another person's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be deep, but has no depth","review":"What a waste of the $4.00 I paid to rent the film. This movie attempts to be deep, but ends up proving at the end that it was poorly thought out and poorly executed. There's no logic to this movie. It doesn't even come close to being the \\"psychlogical thriller\\" some claim it to be. Instead it's cheesy and corny--and extremely disturbing.It sounds intriguing from the back of the case, but save yourself the time and money and leave this lame movie behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was that?","review":"This could have been a pretty good movie. It started with a bloodbath, that didn't at first seem to be obligatory. As the number of suicides mounted and the collective tension of the detective squad got worse.. this movie does a swan dive with the introduction of a fey, mincing rockstar-wanna-be character that ultimately has nothing to do with the plot.Did I say \\"plot\\"? It's shortly after this point in the film when the whole thing runs out of steam. There's no more plot advancement. Characters disappear for no reason. And instead of coming to a climax, the movie just stops, as if the filmmaker ran out of film. Real stories have a beginning, middle and an end.I rented this thing for $2.99. Someone owes me $2.99!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Is Awesome!!!","review":"first off id like to say this movie rocks. the opening scene is the best, unforgettable. if people tell you not to watch the movie dont listen. especially the ones who say they didnt get it so neither will you. its one of the best stories ever. and one of the truest. POP CULTURE followers. everyone has to fit in, everyone has to be the same. if you dont understand the story, then watch it twice trust me it helps. there should be more writers,producers,directors in america that have to guts to put out a movie like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Glam Rock Can't Save This Movie","review":"This movie started out OK. The cutesy school girls committing suicide was a good time, and there was even an excess of blood spraying on bystanders. The movie even held up about 45 minutes in, that is, until the main character committed suicide. Roll Credits. No actually, there is an hour left. This is when the movie divulges into a meaningless, directionless waste of film. The first half of the movie was building you up, and was actually pretty cool and interesting. With a quick pull of a trigger, the whole plot, character development and movie go into the toilet. I can only assume that this movie was intended to shock, but ends up falling infinitely short. It seems the director forgot that without coherency, nobody would care. If you want a good gore-fest shock-cinema movie, see Riki-Oh, or even Battle Royale. If you want a well-done, frightening movie, see Audition. Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this trite abomination of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the wost films I've seen. Ever.","review":"I took this film not knowing what to except. This movie was on tha wall of \\"Employees favorites\\" in our local Blockbuster. Well, if I'll find the guy who nominated this movie I'll definately ask him for my money back.More to the point - this movie is NOT a thriller - there is no logic, no explanation, and lots of loose ends. It only show bizzare, unrelated event, and some (not too many) gory details. If you do take this movie after reading this, hoping that maybe \\"This Amir guy did not get it\\", and \\"There must be something good about this movie\\" please come back later and write your honest review..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was awful.","review":"I don't know if anyone pays attention to these reviews or not, but believe me...this movie stinks. If you want to see a similar movie done much better try \\"Battle Royale\\".Suicide Club's opening scene was great, but it was all straight downhill from there. It just kept getting worse and worse, even ending horribly with the all girl pop group \\"Desert\\" singing over the closing credits. This movie is unintentionally funny in several places, but overall it's a loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd","review":"It has very good photography and feel, but it's a bit hard to follow. It seems to try to have a moral message, but it doesnt deliver very well, so the ending leaves you drawing a blank. Nonetheless, vivid and stirring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Bizarre movie, in a good way. Unique look at a taboo subject like suicide and popular culture. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Are -All Of Us- Already Dead...","review":"SUICIDE CLUB is one of the best social satire / black comedy / horror films I've ever seen. It ranks as high as NETWORK, MAN BITES DOG, FUNNY GAMES, PULSE, or BATTLE ROYALE in its stinging commentary on modern cultural disintegration. Large groups, as well as individuals, are committing suicide. The police are baffled, unable to find any motive or logical reason why groups of young people would suddenly start killing themselves. Is it because of television? Video games? Internet addiction? A cult? All or none of these? SC leaves the questions unanswered, at least specifically. Generally, it seems that the idea is that we've all become so dead inside that the only hope we have is to die, and see what lies beyond. The use of children as harbingers of doom only adds to the overall atmosphere of hopeless terror. One for the ages..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suicide Club","review":"I watch this all the time and I still don't get alot of it. The singing kid group and the bags of skin, i dunno. It's a very unique film to watch. The students say \\" lets go kill ourselfs!\\" and they all agree happily and do it, as if agreeing to go play jump rope or something. Twisted. I'm not ever going to try and understand this film though because it's fun to enjoy and maybe knowing it fully would end the enjoyment of watching it?? I like it no matter what for some reason. The deaths are yucky but he cast is good. It's a great film, just real confusing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perils of disconnection","review":"Suicide Club is truly a Japanese statement. I enjoy Japanese films for the interesting glimpse into a psyche strongly influenced by a world of forced detachment and often unfeeling behavior. Often, Asian films address the disconnected feeling associated with a fast-paced, demanding industrialized society. Suicide Club normalizes the emtional pain of suicide into a 'what the heck' fad. Asian horror often delves into the forbidden. Viewers eagerly, though painfully, peek as if watching a train wreck. There is a statement. I've never seen an Asian film that didn't have one. That disconnection resulting from society's demands is paramount in this film. The presentation can be compared to the unconventional shocks and cold emptiness of A Clockwork Orange. NOT for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap art","review":"I just spent $13 to buy this DVD since it seemed pretty interesting from all the reviews I read about it. Bad idea, huge waste of money. I believe the general consensus of everyone that watches this movie with me was this movie's fu**ed up. It's obviously satirical, but it was trying too hard to be artsy. There's really bad subtitles, which gives you an idea of what they're trying to say but comes out corny or stupid. Lots of the scenes in the movies don't make sense and once again comes off as stupid. There are some disturbingly sick parts, but aren't enough to be gory. It wasn't scary at all. Althoung it was disturbing, and had really bad flow/organiztion in putting the story together. It definitely had potential in becoming a really cool movie, but seemed to do everything it could to make it become the worst it can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you wanna...","review":"The premise of the movie is intriguing and the first hour at least kept my interest. The tone of the film is all over the place, so I wouldn't say the execution was great. Ryo Ishibashi is the lead in this and he is a great actor (as best seen in \\"Audition\\"). The problem is that after the first hour, the movie takes a horrid turn into some nightmarish faux musical. I'm not kidding, if you blink, you'll think you're watching a Japanese take on John Waters. The next half hour quickly deteriorates into an unwatchable mess. Horrible, truly horrible, and an absolute waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, Misguided, Stupid","review":"I turned this movie off right when a man randomly starting crushing puppy skulls with his high heeled shoes (note: they were alive.). This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. I do not flinch watching Kill Bill or Bravehart, and Saving Private Ryan's gore did not catch me as particularily over the top. However, this movie and its makers are morally reprehensible. Do not watch this movie, it will degrade the morality of the viewer. If you like this movie you have no soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Club What?","review":"Ok, so a movie about a group of school girls killing themselves sounded intriguing at the very least. I'm sorry, after the plot brakes off into more branches than a Mormon family tree, I found myself thinking what the real reason behind this movie was. So I looked for a common theme, and of course everyone has spoken about the critique of Japanese and capitalist culture; but I am simply not happy with that. Look, this move is just plain bad. The theme is something like this: kill yourself, become an individual . . . oh no. . . . just kidding (insert Japanese school girl laugh) living is the best and makes you an individual. All and all, it's more incoherent than Descartes' account of clear and distinct perception. I'm sorry, but I just like it when my movies make sense all the way though, rather than tricking the populous to think something more Existential is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing grapes on Long Island?","review":"Alex and Louisa Hargrave went against conventional wisdom when they decided to plant vinifera grapes on Long Island. As you might expect, it was a bumpy adventure in horticultural history, complete with weeds, hurricanes and an incredible amount of work, bringing the couple to the brink of financial ruin. But by the time it was over, they'd proven that grapes could grow (even flourish) on Long Island - and the chronicle of their exploits is charming and lively."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful","review":"This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story makes no sense. The dialogue is laughable. Whoever wrote and directed this film watched too many Tarantino rip-offs and decided to do just one more. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly the same as the diagram","review":"Ordered for Klein screw driver and received a Vaco, I don't know Vaco and Klein is the same company or not but I am sure the one shown on the web site is Klein because the tip is hardened.

Please fix it, otherwise your listing is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who loves it more-- the adult or child?","review":"We bought this book for my daughter when she was 4 and heavily into the world of princesses (especially Snow White) and fantasy. She had the book for months before she ventured off the Snow White page. There is so much to do and see with this book, and it can be easily adapted for multiple ages. This book is an especially good companion to reading some of these classics for the first time (Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, and others). While the older child will memorize the maps and whiz through the hidden pictures rather quickly, all kids will enjoy the creative process of studying the map and imagining what else happens. We have fun asking questions about where other scenes from these books could happen on the map and making our own maps from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book especially for teachers to use","review":"I found this book wonderful to use for teaching third grade map skills even if just used as a read aloud. Follow-up activities could easily be implemented from this book. The only thing to be warned about is that in the Peter Pan map, the Native Americans are called \\"Indians\\", but then again thats from Peter Pan. But I fell in love with the book for its content and purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching Geography!","review":"I've been helping in a 5th grade Social Studies class and we've been working on geography. North, south, east and west, is confusing. This really helped, especially the grid format. I read the story first and then we used the maps. So fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a preschooler","review":"I love that this book has well done, detailed maps. Each page has a different map (Alice in Wonderland, Jack and Beanstalk) with little hidden treasures to find. It also introduces kids on how to read a map (key, points of interest, grids-A2, B5, etc.). Each map lets children explore each world or take a trip via the instructions. It kept our 5 year old busy for awhile and she really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age with a Catholic perspective","review":"I read this book as a girl and it had a huge impact on me, for better or worse... I say \\"for better or worse\\" because it set up very high standards for a teen, so this would make me anguished: How can I be better? I am not good enough? In the end, it did feel like a book written by a religious man, who did not deeply understand the complexities of growing up as a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young teens","review":"\\"With Love Ann Marie, Letters for Growing Up\\" is a great book. I remember reading it as a teen and it helped me a lot with teen issues. It has a Catholic twist to it.

I thought the making of the dress was a bit of a stretch, but overall, I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy parts for little kids","review":"I love this movie's music and the overall plot is fine. I would enjoy it without the outright murderous villainess. But showing it to little kids I'd feel the need to fast forward probably 20 percent of the movie. The evil queen is very clear in her intentions to poison and murder, she's not nice to her rat henchman, and she's got a creepy monkey. Not a fan of any of that. I get that she's the villain, but for little kids I don't feel the need to teach them about murdering, poisoning, and animal cruelty so blatently at age 3 or 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie","review":"Great music.

When I went to view it yesterday with my daughter, it defaulted to Spanish as the language. Not speaking Spanish at all, I went to change it to be played in English and the DVD consistently gave me an error on my television stating \\"disc is scratched and cannot be read\\". It then defaults back to Spanish. So, here I am stuck with a DVD that I cannot use or return!! It's VERY disappointing and I won't use this seller again. They should have known this was a faulty DVD before offering to sell it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit Barbie movie!","review":"This is one of the best Barbie moveies made. I am a mom of a 3 year old and in the last year, we have purchased every Barbie movie made. My daughter loves it, especially the singing and the animal characters...Azul is her favorite! At first, the songs were very annoying to me, especially the opening track \\"Here on my island\\". However, they soon grow on you and now I find that they get stuck in my head! As an adult, I think that the movie is actually pretty good. It rivals some of the classic Disney movies, which had a higher production budget than Barbie. Of all of the Barbie movies, the new Diamond Castle is our favorite, followed by The Princess and the Pauper. This would probably be third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great musical from Barbie!","review":"I wish they would go back and do more Barbie musicals. The three that they have done (Princess and Pauper, Diamond Castle, and Island Princess) are so fun for little girls to watch. We have loved them all. Love the songs in this one, we bought this movie for our neice as well, and when she and my daughter were together this summer, they would not stop singing \\"here on my island the sea says hello.....\\" it was adorable.Great storyline, great characters, loved it, nothing bad to say about it. Loved the animals :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie's 2nd Movie Musical Since The Princess and The Pauper","review":"Since Barbie's first movie musical, Barbie as The Princess and the Pauper, comes an all new second movie musical...Barbie as The Island Princess.The Island Princess' name is Ro which is short for Rosella. Two animals, Azual the Peacock and Sagi the red Panda finds poor young Ro washed ashore as a six year old kid...they decide to raise Ro not only as their own but as an Island Princess. My favorite parts of the movie was how Prince Antonio discovers Ro's Island, Ro falls in love with the Prince, the animals and Rosella become friends with a monkey, and of course-the wedding.There are 9 original songs in this movie, but my most favorite song of all is \\"Here On My Island\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Kids!","review":"WHY do children's movies have to have adult themes? Why do a boy and a girl always have to fall in love? I don't want my 5 year old thinking about this crap yet!! SHE'S FIVE!!! Not fifteen!!!I just wish that Barbie movies were more... innocent. Can't Barbie just play with her friends and do fun things instead of having a \\"fall in love\\" theme to almost every movie?The thing that bothered me the most with this particular movie was the mother of the princess who is a disgrace to humanity. She sings about marrying an old guy so he'll die quick and she will inherit his wealth. I just don't understand why they need to put this stuff in a kids movie. Don't they know that 4 and 5 year olds are watching this? It just seems like such a \\"mature\\" theme for such a young audience...Can't anyone come up with a good, child-appropriate story line for young children beside Elmo?!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For my princess","review":"I admit.

I never could overstand how one can think they can explain something better by comparing it to another? And the other is a subject most readers do not know about or are not concern with! If it was the Laws in KMT why reference India? What did the Indians do that is more understandable than what the KMTians ORIGINALLY wrote?

But the album ignores the band's power pop roots and instead is straight-forward hard rock. There is a Beatles reference here or there, but this album owes more to, say, Led Zeppelin than the Fab Four. The dry production doesn't help either. Still a very good album, but it was a concept album that ushered in their 80's phase: a decade that wasn't kind to them. High points are: 'Baby Loves To Rock', 'Just Got Back', and 'Can't Stop It (But I'm Gonna Try)'. Drummer Bun E. Carlos really shines on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Trick but way better than most other bands!","review":"Some other reviewers have commented on this being the first collaboration with Sir George Martin and Geoff Emerick and that the sound was muddy....well, listen again to the crisp guitars in Baby Loves to Rock (In the morning, in the evening). Sometimes Rick Nielson's playing requires some leeway-- he can run all over the place. With Tom Petersson's 12 string bass the dynamics of most CT recordings are already wide open, what more do you want? BTW I saw CT at Radio City with UFO opening, they were also promoting a George Martin/Geoff Emerick production, and I can't say enough about either band or their performances. All Shook Up is way better than Dream Police or most subsequent efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"all shook up","review":"This album contains some of Cheap Trick's best work.

Prescott was one of the great American historians of the 19th Century and he describes historical events whose effects still resonate today in the Americas. His histories read like novels and are are backed up by footnotes giving references to sources and additional facts. Prescott has a 19th Century view of events, but that's when he was writing. I highly recommend this book, which combines both histories in a single volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Collection","review":"A definite must whether or not you are a Cyndi Lauper fan. I cannot think of a better time where Cyndi has sung so well..... the birth of her son must have been her inspiration. After I first listened to the CD in its entirety, I immediately knew this album is a true winner. Nice remix and chorus add-on in Early Christmas Morning. Christmas Conga is sure to stir so much fun to a Christmas party. Minnie and Santa is a true original confirming why Cyndi is one of the best female artists of the modern pop era. Her signature vocal style and quirkiness shows in true Cyndi spirit. I can see myself drunk with many friends being jolly listening to this tune in a beer hall. Lauper's rendition of Silent Night is breath-taking. I could go on and on but I think and hope you get my point. All in all, this album has brought a big smile to my face for this big Lauperhead! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For The Holiday Season!","review":"This is a truly wonderful holiday album by an artist who gets better with each new record.

While most of my other Christmas albums have been collecting dust, Cyndi Lauper's is on constant play. You have to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Christmas Album -- EVER!!!!","review":"I have always been a fan of Cyndi's, and how I missed the release of this album is beyond me, but better late than never.This album is absolutely charming.Lauper manages to be cute (without being annoying, as with many Christmas records), and soulful all at the same time. I just mailed 4 copies of this one out to my friends, because everyone should have this record in their Christmas repertoire.I wish Cyndi's record label would do a better job of promoting her, because her voice and artistry are amazing.The lady is truly talented and we do not hear enough from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"I suppose if you're not a Cyndi fan this CD may not appeal to you. But for my money, it's one of the more creative, unique entries in the pop Christmas genre. I especially enjoy holiday CDs (like this one) that have songs other than the usual standards you hear over and over again.Of course, there are a couple of covers, like \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" and \\"Silent Night.\\" But mostly you'll get to enjoy some new sounds that only the Cyndi could make work.Highly recommended for any Cyndi fan, or any pop fan who wants something off the beaten path to jam to during holiday festivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prerequisite For Climbing","review":"Sensational edjucation-the most important way to understand the frequency and causes of climbing misfortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember reading this in 1981 or 1982...","review":"I have to disagree with the review above.

The toaster barely toasts, even when turned all the way up, and helpfully flips over when you press down the handle. It takes two hands to use. The radio, in addition to being the worst-sounding radio I have ever encountered, has to be reset to your channel each time the radio is turned on, and that has to be done by a blind search button. How convenient is that?I assumed that coming from Kenwood, the radio would at least be a decent unit.

It is a so-so radio, though...the speakers are necessarily not very large and the sound it emits is rather tinny.BUT, I just keep in mind that it's a TOASTER first, and a radio secondarily. The radio controls are, ummm, primitive, but perhaps that is for a reason---all radios usually are affected by electrical appliances running close by to them, so maybe overcoming that interference necessitates the non-sophisticated radio controls. I do notice that when I run a blender nearby the radio transmission is silenced.Let's face it, it's a gimmicky appliance. But I love it. I can have my radio on right by the stove while I'm cooking, and hear it well, and not bother someone watching TV in the next room. I've developed a great affection for the thing!!!So.

Although it looks great on the counter,the sound quality is poor, and tuning the radio is almost impossible. To add insult to injury, the toaster functioning part is just as bad or worse than the radio. The toast slot has an off center hole that causes English muffins to get stuck. When this happens, the toaster cannot pop up and if you're not paying attention, the rest of your family will be awoken to the sound of the smoke detectors going off.

It sounds worse than a $3 transistor radio you might get at the Dollar store. That is not an exaggeration. It has no dial or station display - you just push the seek button untill you get a acceptable station. When you turn it off, it forgets and you start the process again.

Instead this work offers virtually no narrative and really mediocre photographs.

The captions for all the photos are at the end of the book, which is cumbersome, and the editor left out narrative for some photos and mislabeled others.If you're looking for the scoop on the grunge behind the glitz of motorcycle racing, this will not satisfy you at all.

The danger here lies in a reader new to Weil, picking this up, reading it, and struggling with Gray's simplistic, biased agenda concerning Weil's abandonment of leftist politics(not true), hatred of sex and romance(not true), defaming and misuse of Jewish thought and history(certainly not true). In fact, du Plessix Gray spends more time celebrating Simone Weil as a sort of 1930s French version of the hideous David Horowitz(once left, now far right), then she does helping the reader understand the heart and soul of Weil's holiness and unending compassion. So don't waste your time here.

Most importantly, while illuminating the experiences, insights, and influences of the noted French philosopher, Du Plessix Gray has not shied away from Weil's darker sides, including her virulent Jewish self-hatred. It is sad that such a deep thinker could be so blind to the suffering of her fellow Jews when they faced the greatest catastrophe in their history. This is a book to be read not only for those who wish to understand modern French thought, but also for those who need to understand the limits of the intellect as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific introduction to French thinker!!!","review":"I knew very little about Simone Weil before picking up this volume.

I also thought it would be grainy like the re-runs on TV, but the episodes are squeaky clear. After taking a day to watch all three DVD's in a row, I thought that there were extra little bits of footage here and there. I could recite episodes from TV before, but there was a little add in on occassion. It's just good old TV that you just can't find anymore. Shows what true friendship is all about. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY! A MUST HAVE for any L & S fan!!! I can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out. (Amazon when can we pre-order??)

Had taped most of the eps on VHS. Kinda lost interest when they moved to California. Best seasons were 1, 2, and 3. Fave episode was where they were guinea pigs for pay. Classic, physical comedy. Another fave was where they cooked dinner for two guys who showed up with dates. Hilarious Murphy bed sequence. Can't wait for the release of future seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for my daughters","review":"This is a really great game. My two daughters (7 and 5 years old) love it. In particular they like the games' mini-games such as coloring, tattooing or making necklaces. This is a game appropriate for all ages and obviously more aimed towards girls than boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"This game is a snorefest. I got this for a 7 year old girl who likes Bratz and ponies. I played it for a little bit and the little games/missions are so infantile and uninteresting. It makes use of the stylus, e.g. using a needle to string up beads, using the stylus to clean up the horses. It lacks adventure and a general sense of purpose. The music makes me want to go to sleep too. I should've just gotten any of the mario games or even pokemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmz...ok","review":"this game is pretty much only mini games.plus dha mini games sumtimes repeat and it's not challenging and very boring after a while.but it's kinda a good game if your lik,10 years old.but not for sumone lik me."},{"rating":"2","title":"TYR Unisex Tri short","review":"The shorts are high quality and extremely comfortable for any sprint or Olympic distance triathlete."},{"rating":"1","title":"no gromet for hanging","review":"This towel does not wash well.

Maestro Abbado's technique is fascinating to watch. As with most great conductors, his gestures are measured and lack histrionics. His orchestra is up to the task of performing the well-known works on the program. Helene Grimaud is clearly one the of the world's top pianists. Her Rachmaninoff is controlled, sensuous and spot-on. Having this concert in video form as opposed to audio-only CD adds to the enjoyment of the wonderful works performed and simulates a live-concert experience every time it is played. I recommend purchase of this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"Well folks, we have to go all the way back to 1976 to get an album of this quality and excellence.You know when you have both Dio and Blackmore together, you're in for something special, but this album rose above my expectations. All the reviews I have just read are right on the money. Artistically, I think this was the peak era for both Ronnie and Ritchie. This work is by far the best that Rainbow, with any lineup, has ever produced. Absolutely flawless. Tarot Woman is high energy with an excellent riff. Stargazer is an immortal classic. Imagine if Rainbow, with this lineup, had remained together for a few more years. I think the music would have been unsurpassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTAL CLASSIC","review":"This is one of those albums that is a total classic.The second Rainbow album is a \\"dream band\\" byitself: Dio, Blackmore, Powell, Bain and Carey. Uau! All of them at the peak of their creativity, energy and youth. Dio's voice will leave you breathless, wondering how can someone sing like that in a rock record.Unfortunately, this line up would not last long (Blackmore's famous bad temper being the cause, I guess...)and Rianbow would try to make America using the pop singer Joe Lynn Turner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have.....","review":"This album, combined with \\"On Stage\\" marks the beginning and the end of Deep Purple. Even Blackmore's artistry on \\"Made In Japan\\" couldn't touch what he accomplished on the \\"On Stage\\" album. The reason I gave this only 4 stars is because some of the tunes are obviously over-produced. \\"Stargazer\\" is the MOST KICK-A** track that's ever been recorded. It's the one my oversized drummer used to measure himself by while blasting it into his headphones and trying to copy Cozy at the same time ! Jimmy Bain is brilliant as well as RJD. Ronnie's voice was never better except on \\"On Stage\\" and (maybe) \\"Heaven and Hell\\". Just turn up \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"Light in the Black\\" and feel what true power is about.....UPDATE: Dream Theater covered \\"Stargazer\\" on a recent LP, although not an entirely flattering rendition I must admit. However, this obviously points to the influence that this song and this band had on other musicians/afficionados like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put This Album Is Still Very Amazing","review":"Having seen Rainbow as my first concert in 1976 when they toured with this album was amazing. Although i have seen almost 200 concerts since then, I still remember the show like it was yesterday, the lights, the incredible voice of RJD, the killer guitar playing of Richie, and thunderous drums of Cozy were mind boggling. After many years of not playing this album, i recently came across it in my collection, and in the last few days have not stopped playing it, the album still sounds as fresh as it did when it first came out. It is very sad that Ronnie recently passed away, I have seen him many times with Sabbath, Dio band and more recently Heaven and Hell, I cannot believe that he is gone, in my humble opinion he was one of the best RnR singers the world has ever seen. Buy this album, it is truly one the best hard rock albums ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 star for each song.","review":"But, unfortunately I can only give it five. This album is a classic, right up there with Machine Head. \\"Tarot Woman\\" is an awesome opener. \\"Run With the Wolf\\" rocks along and is one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head. \\"Starstruck\\" is pretty good too. \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" isn't quite as good as the rest of the album, but excellent none the less. The real highlight of the album is \\"Stargazer.\\" Wow. Wow. WOW. It left me stunned and speechless the first time I heard it. An epic in its own right. \\"A Light in the Black\\" is a great finisher for Rainbow's best album. Long Live Rock and Roll is a close second to this one. Rising is an essential must-have in any rock collection, especially for Deep Purple fans and people who don't own it. Verdict: Buy two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rock effort like no other","review":"There simply is no other effort in rockdom that equals the raw power of Rising. Blackmore's guitar, Dio's voice, Powell's drums, Carey's keyboards, and Bain's bass provide a texture of music that simply has no equal. From the opening track to the close of \\"A light in the black\\", intelligent songwriting and powerful musicianship will give you years of enjoyment. Buy this one and you will *not* be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow - 'Rising' (Polydor)","review":"Originally released in 1976,this is the follow-up to their debut 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow' album(see my review).Didn't realize it until now,but this second effort brought in keyboardist Tony Carey,bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Cozy Powell(R.I.P.)to the band's line-up,joining Blackmore and vocalist Ronnie James Dio.Best tunes here include \\"Tarot Woman\\",the classic \\"Stargazer\\"(some might think it's title is \\"Where Is Your Soul?\\") and \\"A Light In The Black\\".Notice the playing here is rather.I've heard several patrons compare 'Rising' to that of classic Deep Purple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds boring after a while (2.4 stars)","review":"I bought Rainbow Rising because Axel Rudi Pell, the GermanHeavy Metal King, cites it as a main musical influence in his youth. Well here we have an example of the pupil surpassing the master! Repetitious heavy metal without creativity or melody justwon't do it for me; it's OK for 5 minutes after days of musical abstinence but then I'm bored. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Album","review":"No enough words in a foreign language to describe such magnificent album !!!Blackmore\`s best as a rock musician.

Everyone is great, from Dio to Blackmore to Powell. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply essential","review":"Blackmore underrated, eh? Not by himself, certainly. Still, this stands with Sabbath's Heaven and Hell as the best setting for Dio's dark, other-worldly lyrics and dramatic delivery.

It's a masterpiece of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising Above","review":"This album is quite simply the greatest work by everyone involved.Ronnie James Dio sings his ass offBlackmore, after years of stagnating in a waning Deep Purple, wakes up and delivers some unbelievable playing. Stargazer especially shows an uncaged Richie at the height of his powers.Cozy Powell (RIP) If there is a better drummer from the NWOBHM please tell me who he is. He rules on this album, and delivers another in a string of fine performances.Tony Carey had his work cut out for him. Playing a lead instrument with Blackmore around is a daunting task for any keyboard player (in other words: only the strong survive). Carey hits it out of the ballpark especially on Tarot Woman.Jimmy Bain is a solid bass player and is still with Dio, good work here by a Journeyman.I put it in the top ten Hard Rock/Heavy Metal albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACKERS RULES!!","review":"there is a very good reason so many people have given this CD such rave reviews. It has got to be Rainbow's masterpiece. Ritchie Blackmore and company have put the pedal to the metal here and the results are fantastic! This is a must-have disc for any metal collection. Ritchie is firing on all cylinders and Ronnie James Dio, one of rock's finest vocalists, sings his heart out, especially on Stargazer, a super track. And it is always a pleasure to hear the drumming of the great and gone-too-soon drummer, Cozy Powell. Rainbow went on to record some good tunes after this album but for me and many others this is their masterpiece. Crank up your hi-fi on Stargazer and let the drums of Cozy Powell lead you into some serious headbangin'!www.electriceyes.us"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I usually don't write reviews but I felt that this needed to be said. The first disc features two versions of the great 1976 Rising album \\"remastered\\" in different ways and neither seems to get it right. The 'new york mix' is supposed to be the original mix featured on the original release but is so totally devoid of any bass it's difficult to listen to...even when compared to the 1999 remaster. What gives? The 'los angeles' mix on the other hand is so bass heavy it buries Blackmore's guitar. The second disc is strickly for die hards... rough mixes. I doubt the biggest Rainbow fans in world would listen to this more than a couple of times.All things considered I would be happy to stick with the '99 remaster and save the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"...greatest metal album of all time...","review":"The best work Dio and/or Blackmore have ever done. This record is perfect. Inspired playing, writing and singing, combined with flawless production...it's all there. The fact that the album only has a hanfull of songs serves as a benefit ,because you don't get bogged down or bored with any 'half-baked mid-album filler...'Stargazer' is one of the best songs I've ever heard in any genre of music, and the ONLY time I've ever enjoyed an orchestra alongside a rock band...BUY THIS ALBUM,IN FACT, BUY 2 AND GIVE ONE TO A FRIEND!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STARGAZING","review":"This is a masterpiece of hard rock! The spectrum of music, lyrics, and style is amazing. One of my favorite Rainbow tracks is here, \\"Stargazer\\". Blackmore, Dio, and Carey shine, but I can't leave out Powell and Bain. All of the Rainbow albums have proved what a talented line up can do! This is a pleasure to listen to from begining to end. Other favorites here are \\"Starstruck\\", \\"Run With the Wolf\\", and \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\".

The only problem I have with it is that the red eye in the pictures is HORRIBLE. It cannot be removed on half of the pictures. It does have a red eye reduction built into the camera, but I find that it takes to long to take the picture that way, and the multiple flashes for it is confusing, most people turn away thinking the picture is over before it actually is. I find it easier to just take the picture normally and fix the red eye on the computer. However, on more that half of the pictures I have taken with this camera, I cannot fix the red eye. The eyes either stay red, turn yellow/green, or turn a weird mixture of grey and who knows what else. It is the same no matter which program I try and I have tried about 6 or 7 different ones.

She also doesn't mumble to herself like La Stupenda does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sills can sing and act better than La Stupenda","review":"Sutherland is overrated when it comes to coloratura. Sills has the best coloratura. Her staccati are lightning-fast. Her arpeggios are unbeatable. Her trill is the tightest in recorded history. Her runs are faster and more accurate than Sutherland's. She is much better at acting than Sutherland is. On top of that, she has a heart of gold. Compare Sutherland's Shadow Song with Sills' version on her \\"Sillsiana\\" recording and you will see that Sills is the better coloratura. Sills' \\"The soldier tir'd\\", also on \\"Sillsiana\\", is faster and much more lively than Sutherland's version on \\"The Art of the Prima Donna\\". Sills has the best coloratura technique. She is the superior soprano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good solid advice","review":"While reading this book, I expected a little more.

What a harsh world, where the Inuit seemingly survive on a diet of seal meat and fat, and not much else. This is a very well written book, with crisp exact prose, and a nice dry humour.

They have proven themselves durable, as one has already been left out in the sprinkler overnight and still works fine. They love to groove to their tunes and have everyone else hear them too.

It soon became his favorite toy. My only issue is that the single AAA battery lasts about a day before running out. We solved this problem by buying some rechargeable batteries and immediately replacing the spent battery with a charged one.

You can get MP4 through Itunes, but not MP3s. So that means you cannot download ANY music from the big music download sites onto a Shaker. MP3 is now an \\"old\\" format. Unless you're planning only on ripping songs from a CD to put on the Shaker, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

We bought it for our 5 year old after a cheap MP3 player died (after about 2 weeks of owning it). We were a little skeptical of this one, and didn't really want to pay the price for it, but it was worth it. Pros: ability to use without ear buds, thus protecting her hearing; ability to plug in two sets of buds for sharing, comes with stickers and color choice of pink (totally endearing this product to my kid!). Cons: you do have to be aware that it only takes MP3 files, the \\"shake it\\" method of changing songs takes a little more dexterity than my kid has (you have to push a button and shake at the same time), it wouldn't work with a memory card from another device, even though they appeared to be the same kind, size, etc. That could be more due to my own technical incompetence.

I'll buy another, because that is a loooong time for my kid! This player was dropped, thrown, stepped on, dragged, left outside and in the car in 100 degree weather, and who knows what else.The player is very simple: he was 4 when we got it, and he was able to use it on his own immediately. What a life saver!!! I could only listen to the wiggles so many times without going crazy. I highly reccomend this item. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it takes one AAA battery, which has to be replaced often (lithium batteries are a MUST), and the part you unscrew to get to the battery and memory disk was a bit tricky.One tip: buy some separate headphones that go \\"over the head\\". The kids-friendly set we bought are still working (I don't remember the brand, but they come in animal designs - he has the tiger)."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun gift for kids but eats batteries","review":"With its external speaker my five year old cant get enough of this mp3 player; so much so that i have to replace the battery every day or two.

He turns it on in bed and falls asleep listening to it. Yes, there is an issue with music format however, this can be resolved - you can purchase a program online to convert the music.

I have to turn my bass all the way down so it won't sound awful.

From the parent perspective, it was very difficult to load songs on. You have to make sure they are in MP3 format and most computers automatically convert to windows media.

When you re-format a card you must erase everything on it so it is a little frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$","review":"I would not recommend this product. The iPod shuffle would be a better buy, and definitely better quality. I purchased two shakers as gifts. The bottom cover continuously unlatches on one and the other shaker stopped playing after about 1.5 weeks. I tried troubleshooting by reconnecting to the pc, but it was not recognized. Sandisk said this is a recurring problem and to connect to the USB ports at the back of the pc. Haven't tried that step yet (but sounds like more trouble than it's worth). Besides, I've been successful at connecting iPods and digital cameras just fine to the front USB ports. The battery life is AWFUL! Required a new battery after several hours of on and off play. Even with brand new rechargeable ones! Hope to send this cheaply made product back and get my money back to use towards the shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"Purchased the Sansa Shaker for my son who is 5 yrs old. I downloaded songs for him and it worked for a day and then stopped. I thought it was the battery, but it was not the case(i changed it to different batteries). It turns on, but then it shuts off by itself. I am very disappointed at this product. It did work only for one day. I buy things from Amazon.com all the time, but this product was not good. I am wondering if i can return or something. I would not recommend it.

I was expecting to be able to download my daughter's music from our windows media player, but no, it all has to be changed to a different format to play. Now I have to buy a program to be able to change the formats of my music so she can listen to it. For me, it would have been cheaper and easier to get a little bit more expensive sansa player that I can throw any kind of music on than buying this one. If I could put my music on it the way it is formatted originally, this would would be the perfect little mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 year old loves it!","review":"We got this as a \\"new baby gift\\" for our 2 year old. She's really into listening to \\"her\\" music in the car so we thought it would be great! It's simple enough that she figured it out in minutes and loved having her favorite songs on it. I like the built in speaker that can't get too loud and drive me crazy.

It stopped working after less than an hour. I watched him play with it, and he did nothing to cause it. The battery had a hard time connecting to the player. Well, after 3 different sets of batteries (just to make sure)we contacted Sandisk and their customer service was terrible! Long story short, they admitted I needed a new one after an hour on the phone, but it took 3 weeks to get a new one; explain that to a 5 year old.I gave this 2 stars because it is the only one I could find with external speakers, which I prefer so he doesn't need earphones. The new one has been working, but we had problems turning it off once, and the only way we were able to turn it off was to take out the battery. THis seems to be a flaw in this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, good player","review":"Overall, I'm happy with this MP3 player. The only issues we have had are that yes, the headphones are too big for my daughter's ears (but this isn't that big of a deal, as she rarely uses headphones anyway), and the MP3 format problem. I was about to be upset about this...I didn't realize just how many of our songs were in WMA format. But I found a free program online that you can download that converts files. It's quick and easy to use. It's called Switch Sound File Converter. Since I figured that out, no problems. Is it a pain in the butt? Yes. But this thing was cheap, and I'm not paying big bucks for a more streamlined MP3 player that might end up getting broken or lost.

It seems to have been written for people who have no prior knowledge of natural medicine and yoga.

On the other hand, if that's what you are looking for and this is your first exposure to the subject (and you like it), then I can't recommend enough that you do more research and learn about hand mudras and natural foods, different types of yoga, etc. I think they should have added \\"An Introduction to\\" prior to the rest of the title.

It is sobering to think he most likely would never be confirmed as Secretary of Agriculture today, and certainly would never be considered an appropriate choice for Vice President. Imagine, someone who actually thinks for himself in high office! Of course, idealism has its drawbacks, and certainly Henry Wallace was blind to some of the less savory aspects of his more leftist supporters.

I found his characters very realistic and very human, each with good and bad traits. Although Maugham claims to have not understood Larry's very important tale in chapter 6, he presents these views very well. This chapter is where Larry tells of his journey to India. Maugham tells us it is not important to the actual story line of the novel, but it is the most important part of the whole book. Do not skip it. Actually, I think Maugham was using a bit of reverse psychology there. This is a magnificent novel about people enveloped in society and one who flies above it. As many have said before, an ispiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self discovery through reading and writing","review":"Maugham's classic novel of Larry traveling the world in search of himself is one of the few up front philisophical narratives. The story reads well, however one will need patience to get through the first half until the story picks up. When you reach this point, you will be glad you did. Characters were well drawn, with some sketchy situations about relationships between the characters, particularly Maugham himself. If you read the book, I would not bother watching the 1946 Tyrone Powell movie, for it loses it 'classic' name when you have read it.

But in the middle of class and humerous snobbery, there is a man who is on a quest for cosmic clarity and union with the infinite.

I liked the way the story patronizes true spirit and internal quest in life.It is the story of Larry, who as a young man serves the army and loves a pretty butterfly but when his search for truth begins, his lover(Isabella) leaves him and marries a young businessman. Larry travels around the globe, working wherever he can and gathers interesting experiences and skills. Young people will identify themselves with Larry and might be inspired. The discussions between the author and Larry/Isabella are engaging.

This is only the second book of his I have read, the first being \\"Of Human Bondage\\" which I hated. It made me leary to know that \\"Razor's Edge\\" was lumped with \\"Human Bondage\\" as his greatest works. Razor's Edge, although similiar to Bondage is about a young man \\"of breeding\\" searching for himself, is far less pretentious. It contrasts Larry's search for meaning and God in a post WWI world with the meaninglessness of 'cultured society'. The characters lives are interesting and the novel moves fairly quickly. A must-read for anyone searching for their own happiness in a meaningless world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg you to read this book.","review":"I found out about this book after being shown the movie with Bill Murray. The friend who introduced me to it told me it changed his life; I now see why.

This book has made it onto my list of favorites; ones I know I'll read once a year. I think you will find this to be true for you as well. No one is too young or too old to find meaning in the story of a few tormented friends in the 20's and 30's. Please read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understand its popularity","review":"I had not seen the 1940's movie version of this story until recently on TCM, which prompted me to purchase the book on Kindle and read it. The written story is intriguing and was certainly helped by some of the character portrayals from the movie version. Hollywood put the story in a chronological order, unlike Maugham did in the book. Some of the pivotal activity of the book, i.e, situations to help understand the plot better, are reserved for the end, kind of putting it all together and into perspective. The movie ruins some of the intrigue by placing things in time-line order. Also, because it doesn't require the physical limitations of actors, the book allows for greater character development, especially with Isabel, Gray and Sophie.The story is one of self-discovery and I could see several people from my own life in the role of Laurence Darrell. I would have liked to have read the book first and then watched the movie, but it was still good the way I did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"After a short term of adjustment to the prose form and dated situation, the plot and characters were compelling.

One of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"New themes, fantastic character development","review":"I approached Maugham reluctantly, as I do many British authors. But, the Razor's Edge was clear, descriptive, yet not mired in page-long sentences. Maugham does not try to present a \\"theme\\" to the reader, although he does set up situations in which the reader can try to grasp lessons from the plot.But that is all the reader can do--grasp. Maugham is Dickensian in his character development. Each character is ethereal, and readers can project themselves on them--especially Larry. Maugham seems to understand that we cannot simplify characters to simple symbols or thoughts, and he uses this to his advantage.Brilliant book, lucid enough for reading on vacations...stirring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book!","review":"nice book,Easy to understand even for non-native speaker.

Why Maugham chose a first-person narrator is beyond me.The narrator's periodic apologies for having to use his imagination for details he couldn't possibly know, including the thoughts and feelings of other characters, become tiresome very quickly as simply a ploy that goes nowhere. Maugham may not have understood the importance of point of view or I may not yet understand why he used first-person. Narrative intrusion is the greatest sin in fiction.If the former is the case, it's a great shame. It could have been a lasting work of art, if so, art being that in which every detail has a raison d'tre, most especially the choice of the best narrator to tell the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better ways...","review":"There are far better ways to acquire what this book has to offer. As other reviewers have stated, it is about a handful of people and the way they live their lives, particularly one young man who strays from the beaten path in search of Truth.

Somerset Maugham. He may be the best writer of dialogue of the last one hundred years.\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is timeless. It could have taken place during the Vietnam War or the Napoleonic Wars. All of Maugham's books have the underlying theme that you must go through your ration of pain and lonliness in life and if you hang in there you will come out okay in the end. Although I actually like \\"Cakes and Ale\\" slightly better than this book, this one clearly had the bigger impact and better expressed these recurring themes particularily in the relationship between Larry and Sophie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Literary Creation","review":"This book, recommended by a friend, was my first exposure to Maugham. I enjoyed it thoroughly, as I find myself asking the questions (or perhaps looking for the questions) Larry, one of the main characters was asking. While it was billed as a book about a man searching for purpose, truth, and meaning, it was only partially that. Maugham juxtaposes the snob Elliot Templeton, contrasting their motives, yet comparing their actions in many respects also.Having read \\"Siddartha\\" by Herman Hesse and \\"Into the Wild\\" by Jon Krakauer, I found \\"The Razor's Edge\\" to be very similar. If you are a fan of the theme of a maverick youth looking for truth outside of comfortable society, then the \\"Razor's Edge\\" is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic books","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...I am one who started reading late in life and i reccomend this book as a must read.

I highly reccommend this book. If you have a chance, see the movie staring Bill Murray of the same name, it's extremely well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Our Way In the World","review":"\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a wise and well-written novel about American expatriates in France in the 1920s and '30s. The characters make different choices about life: one is a ludicrous social snob; another enters a loveless but stable marriage; another opts for degradation and self-destruction; and another seeks enlightenment in India. Every character (and path) is vividly rendered, making it an unforgettable book.That said, readers expecting a tale of Eastern mysticism may be disappointed. The section on India is a relatively small part of the book, and the events there are rendered (rather artificially) in the form of a long reminiscence by the enlightenment-seeker, suggesting that Maugham didn't quite know how to pull off the \\"spiritual\\" material. But it's the only \\"off\\" note in an otherwise near-perfect book. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book in a Great Trilogy","review":"(Spoiler Free Review)If you liked the first book,Twilight Falling (Forgotten Realms: The Erevis Cale Trilogy)then this is an excellent continuation of the story. Both the heroes and villains become more powerful as they battle each other through the realms. Cale struggles to hang on to his humanity as he chases the villains through the most vile parts of the realms.The story, battles, and characters all become more intense in this book as the stakes become higher. Both the heroes and villains hunt each other throughout the story. The villains are also shapeshifters, which complicates matters for the good guys.There is a little less action in this book, but more time is spent on developing the characters. And these characters are great! The character development in this trilogy deserves 5 stars.This is an excellent continuation of Twilight Falling and a good lead in toMidnight's Mask (Forgotten Realms: The Erevis Cale Trilogy, Book 3)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayne's Review","review":"The record player works fine but the software is a mess.

I accidentally started off using the \\"advanced\\" Audacity software for recording and found it not only easy to use but actually a bit fun. Great amount of control over your recordings. I'm enjoying the process of converting all the stuff on vinyl that I don't have or won't find on CD. The only complaint I have is the the 45rpm insert is just a tad too small and allows for movement when playing 45's. Just used one I already had and still happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but software wasn't there...","review":"The CD came with NO documentation, and didn't even include all the necessary software. Thankfully, everything is free on the net, and with a little searching I was able to find and install it all. Once that was done though - I love the thing. We have hundreds of Albums. Not sure what reviewers were saying about that the records must be pristine. I have some from my childhood that are anything but pristine, and they convert quite well. Not without a few crackles and pops, but still quite good. Any that are in fairly good shape have come out great! Yes, it does take the time it takes to listen to the music, plus of course a bit more to process, but gosh - if I didn't like my music to begin with, I wouldn't bother! Again - I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac users: Not for the faint-of-heart","review":"The Ion USB Turntable was a gift that held much promise to convert vinyl recordings to MP3 files to add to my iPod. The unit looks and sounds great as the records play through the Apple G-5's sound card. Unfortunately the recordings are in wav format and you have to download additional software (LAME MP3 Encoder) to convert the wav file to mp3. The link they provided is a dead end, and the forums are full of comments by other users who have exactly the same problem. There may be a solution somewhere for Mac users (a number of work-arounds are suggested in the forums), but after several hours I have been unable to find anything that works. Note that the authors of several positive reviews used different software to make this product work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The software for this machine did not work properly and the company, despite many requests, offered absolutely no technical support.

The biggest problem I had, and the reason I didn't give it five stars, is that the instruction manual isn't as clear as it should be. I haven't been able to separate tracks, although I've followed everything to the letter. Some step in the process is not indicated in the instruction book.

It took me three hours to record 4 songs. At this rate, I'll have to live until to 180 years old. But I have better things do do with my life than spend the remaining time getting aggrivated.

I found it easy to use with Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9 - so I can't comment on the software that comes with the turntable. The lack of a cuing capability and dust cover are minor annoyances. I have already transferred my 45-rpm collection to digital format and am working on my LP collection. I recommend it to those who want a relatively easy way to save their record collections to a digital format. I just want to make clear that you get what you pay for and except for the USB connectivity, the turntable itself is very basic. If you already have software that supports LP transfer, such as Roxio or Nero suites, it is probably better to stick with that, than try to figure out how the provided software works. Good value, adequate but not great turntable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase","review":"Took about 90 minutes to unbox and set up.Worked great the first time.Did not use the feature to reduce static or noice yet, but the CD's still sound great.Very pleased and the price was right"},{"rating":"2","title":"LP Record Conversion to Digital Format","review":"The product is easy to set up and use. The software as provided does not enable one to burn CDs, therefore one must also purchase a Roxio product or equivalent.

The driver software worked fine. It comes with Audacity, which is a very good piece of free audio software. You place an lp on, start up the software and hit play on the turtable and record on the software. You can record tracks individually or whole albums. You can then select what part of the recording you want to save as a mp3 or wav or whatever. The cool part is that you can remove pops and clicks and background noise.

Sound quality is very good and the software is simple to use (iTunes required). Once you have installed the Audacity software, the drive belt, and balanced the arm (about 15 minutes), you're ready to begin transferring albums to your computer. However, you should expect to experience a few minor glitches when the music automatically transfers into iTunes. Since the software uses Gracenote to find the album info, it's often wrong more than it is right. The good news for non-iPod users like me is that Windows Media Player will automatically convert the music from iTunes over to an MP3 format. One last note: you record the albums in real-time, so this can become somewhat time consuming. I'd also like to see ION add a dusk cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use, Great Value","review":"I borrowed a turntable from a friend that wrote to CD. I used it to convert my vinyl LP's to mp3's for my iPod. When I inheritated a large collection of music on LP that spanned from the late 1950's to 1980's I started looking around for a USB turntable. I wanted to write directly to my hard drive. This Ion TTUSB Turntable has been great. Good quality sound at a great price. It's super easy to set up, and easy to use. It feels light weight when you're setting it up but it's been a solid performer. I've ripped about 60 LP's over the past 30 days and love it.

The needle provided is not bad at all, though, I wanted to ensure as best sound quality as possible. My biggest gripe would probably be the editing software provided. Audacity is a free program, while good, it would have been nice to have something a little more substantial.

It was easy to set up, the directions were clearly written, and it does a good job of converting my old LPs to digital form, in my case, to MP3s.The Audacity software is intuitive and easy to use, though you do have to go onto the Internet and download a particular file (a snap to do). On some albums, the MP3s created sound significantly better than the album itself -- the static and pops are gone, for example. But on others, getting rid of all of the static results in a somewhat distorted digial version. It's kind of a balancing act and you have to make adjustments using the software (easy) to decide what the optimal level of noise removal is. But even with no noise removal, the skips are abbreviated, and I'd say that almost all of my MP3s (I've converted only about 12 albums so far) sound at least a little better than the LP.This is a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The answer to my prayers!","review":"My father, aged 88, and I, aged 60, combined have an extensive LP collection and I wanted our tunes on my ipod.

If your vinyl isn't in mint condition, and I mean PRISTINE, it's not worth owning this turntable. The included software is capable of removing the snap, crackle and pop from a new album, but older records are a disaster. Perhaps if you are a professional, with all the time in the world to perfect a recording, this turntable might be the ticket. However, for the casual user that just wishes to tranfer his vinyl to CD, this gizmo is a lot like work. It takes well over an hour to record an album, work the kinks out, and burn a CD. If you make your own labels, add another 30 minutes. The time spent to money saved ratio is absurd. Instead of buying this turntable, blank CDs, jewel cases, labels, and ink, just go on eBay and buy the CDs for cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"hit it to play","review":"I bought this from someone off Craigslist brand new out of the box.

That said, if you invest in the Ion turntable, invest another $99 in Bias Soundsoap software to get a digital-quality final product without having to analyze and edit every second of every track.I found only two shortcomings. First, there is no dust cover. The only option is a (third party) soft cover, which does not provide the protection of an integral, hard one.

Murray's writing or subjects can seem quite \\"masculine,\\" yet then there is \\"The Hill Station\\" or \\"A few Short Notes..\\" and you see too an alternate perspective, character. Some of the settings in stories are large and exotic: mountain climbing, Third World disaster scene.

Father's Day is a film few go, it's as if they thought of every great idea for a film and threw it all into a stew. Cannibalism. A serial killer who sexually attacks fathers, incest, Grindhouse films, extreme gore, comedy, horror, action, Well, I don't want to give it all away. The conclusion of the film is hilarious!

What makes this book special is how it combines a serious musical analysis of jazz-as in the chapter on Elvin Jones' drumming-with an understanding of the social and political dimensions of the music-as in the piece on jazz as a weapon of the Cold War. Kofsky takes on a range of music critics to argue the case for considering jazz as distinctively Black music. And he shows how John Coltrane and his collaborators had to fight to maintain their musical integrity in a business dominated by white critics, promoters, club owners and the like. Occasionally, the book reads like a personal vendetta by Kofsky against particular jazz critics, which is distracting. But for anyone who wants to understand better the connections between jazz music and the politics of the 1960s, this is a very useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped","review":"My dog wore it for a week maybe and he started chasing after another dog.

The suspense builds better from the music when Bourne is in a car chase or kicking the stuffing out of a bad guy.But it's still great to buy if you want a taste of Bourne away from your tv. The only bad thing about this soundtrack is that it wasn't available for mp3 download, which is where I usually buy my music.

Unfortunately, it has devalued the worth of her recommendations for me ever since (which is my mistake). My basic gripe was the fact that the title (and the hype) indicated to me that there was going to be well, how can I put this, some Fantasy elements in it. All I got was some characters that I didn't relate to wandering around a place I have no particular affinity to (San Francisco/California).

The plot is good, even intriguing, but it all goes to reveal the \\"exemplary\\" character of the heroine. If you like the Elsie Dinsmore books, you may like this even more. It is an exjoyable book, but if you think a well-written story should offer something more substantial to the reader that an example of wonderful character, you may be dissapointed, as I was.

Statues \\"crying\\" oil and blood are shown. But in the latter half of the show, there is talk about Mary worship. I guess if you are a staunch Catholic, you would find it offensive. But I viewed it with an open mind and found it thought provoking. The movie uses the bible as their bases of worship.

I hope you will study the true Scriptural and Traditonal meaning of Catholic Marian spirituality because these misconceptions can easily be refuted. For example, Mary's Immaculate Heart will triumph because of the vicory of Her Resurrected Son. To take this truth away would actually devalue the glory of Christ's triumph, which is certainly not the intentions of the author of this video.

I hate books that force me to struggle through the prose. I'm not a great fan of poetry. And I avoid stories of child abuse like the plague. So along comes The Bone People, which has the poetic density of the most abstruse 20th century poets, and it's the story of a child abused by his adopted father. And it is just plain gorgeous. Yes, the first chapter is tough (get through it, then after you've met the three main characters, go back and read it again: it's wonderful when you know what it's talking about). The writing becomes hypnotic; you don't read this book, you live it, you hear these people talking in your head when the book is closed. It makes you see your world differently. It was the best book I read in the decade of the '80s, and one of only a handful of books I have read twice. It's beauty does not fade on second reading.

As the mother of a 5 year old, parts of this book are unbearable. If I want to read about child abuse, I'll look in the newspaper. However, I must admit that the author has a splendid writing style, and I understand that there is much more to see in this book than child abuse but it is overshadowed.

I tried to work up some enthusiasm, but could not. The author giving the main character a very similar name to her own grated on my nerves. The central problem with the book is that far too much time is spent on long, meandering expositions on the characters' inner lives and the contents of their heads, as well as endlessly repetitive incidents in their lives - having drinks, the kid stealing, the terrible poems she inserts, etc. At LEAST 100 pages could've been cut. I never felt much affection for any of the characters, either, even if I felt sorry for them. The wordy expositions did not deepen the characters, they were also as repetitive as the scenes. I'm really amazed this won the Booker Prize.

She chooses her language with precision, and each word adds to the magic of the story of these three unfortunate people. Kere, Joe and Simon are, for all their faults, characters easily sympathised with, which I think comes from Hulme's empathy as a writer. Each personality is well-developed in itself, and the three come together almost as three aspects of a single person. This makes it easy to relate to all of the characters, and captivating to study their interaction. The best thing about the novel, in my opinion, is its fluidity and spontaneity of narration. My attention was never lost, and I read as much in one sitting as I could. It was also incredible to taste the words Hulme uses, and linger on the poetry she has created from language.

Showcasing the vitality of the Maori ways, Hulme has used universal archetypes that make this story accessible. Yes, the language is challenging and unique. And yet, like writers such as Virginia Woolf, Hulme uses the words themselves, not just the imagery they convey, to move the story and give depth, which ultimately makes the reading a much more enriching experience. It is a story of humanity's hope through the detritus our world society creates in us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple note of thanks","review":"This review will be short; I just wanted to thank you, Ms Hulme, for a terrific book. It makes me so happy when I know there's nothing else I'd rather do in the world than finish the book I'm reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"aue, e hoa ka pai","review":"a grieving thankyou to Keri Hulme... bitter heart, you heal my heart. one night i'd had too mush caffeine and i stayed up reading the bone people, the images all distorted in my mind, they were too real, i ended up crying. this is an amazing book, it will change your life. the moari language is so beautiful i find myself using the phrases to express my most intense emotions. aue, e hoa, ka pai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Great literacy is about taking chances. You may love this book.Surely, the discourse was presented excellently.As for myself, I was excruciatingly bored and left feeling rather tentative about the time I put into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rapid descent into New Age gibberish","review":"I feel compelled to rescue any readers from the misleading plethora of 5 star ratings below. The first two thirds of this book are good (not great). The characters are intriguing, in part because of the exotic small town New Zealand locale, and the plot unfolds in a meandering pattern that leads the reader on while flirting with frustrating said reader.The last third of this book is absurdly bad in all senses. The plot becomes a ridiculous New-Age-tussle-with-cancer story. The style becomes a really horrible attempt at magic realism. The prose loses all discipline (and it never had much) and turns into some undergraduate writing seminar exercise in the use of the tangled metaphor coupled with the pointlessly histrionic use of adverbs and adjectives. Help! I only finished it because I'm stubborn. That this book won any kind of prize is a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages falling out","review":"Literally, every other page falls out of the book. We ordered it for a school project and have had to buy a new book locally so it can be finished. Disappointing quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written? I think NOT","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish. The longer I read it, the more disgusted I became trying to follow who was saying or thinking what. It was totally convoluted and ruined whatever story the Author was trying to portray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"This was an extremely difficult book to read. It is long, the font (in the copy I had) was small, and the writing style was unique, but hard to follow. I got the basic gist of the story, but I'm sure I missed a lot of what the author was trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favourite.","review":"Thank you, Keri Hulme. This is a book that I have carried across continents, and re-read from time to time over the last 12 years.Excellent, emotional, really grabs me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a book","review":"I read this book along with four other friends to launch our book club. I had no idea what to expect.Unlike many of the other reviewers, I was very much taken with the Prologue. I thought it was beautifully written and read it several times. After finishing the book, it was a delight to reread the prologue.I would recommend this book to any other individuals out there who belong to a book club or reading circle. It's full of mystery and depth, and there's quite a bit that you will want to discuss with others.Thank you Keri Hulme for an amazing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, and not in a good way","review":"I found this novel deeply disturbing: are we really meant to sympathize with and care about the oh-so-sensitive alcoholic child-beating male protagonist simply because he is Maori and can blather on about ancestors and sacred spaces ? The destroyed child , progressively more destroyed and brutalized over the course of the novel, stands for what? It appears that the author wants us to approve of his pathetic attachment to his adoptive father....I didn't believe a word of the peculiarly happy ending. The author seems proud of her supposedly innovative style, which didn't seem particulalry innovative to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and original","review":"If you enjoy writing that is thoroughly original, you will cherish this gem from Keri Hulme. It is the most powerful book I have ever read and is the book I most frequently recommend. Take your time to read and savor the language...it is pure poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everybody and definitely not for me","review":"Apparently, many people enjoyed this book, including the majority of my book group. But I agree with the 3 publishers who, Keri Hulme explains in the preface to the first edition, rejected this book. This is a difficult, unpolished, often incomprehensible book. Perhaps as fair warning, Hulme provides what she calls \\"an explanatory dream.\\" What this dream explains never becomes any clearer than most of the book itself. I can't deny that there were parts of this book that I enjoyed, but there were parts of the books that were simply maddening. In the end, I decided that the negatives far outweighed the positives of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kerewin=us","review":"I read this for a graduate course a few years ago, and I still have strong feelings for it. Kerewin is one of the most memorable literary characters I've read. Her circular abode above the rest of the world--initially captivating; later proving more of a prison than a haven--isn't fortress enough to keep Simon and Joe from infiltrating paradise (or hell, however you might see the tower). I see the novel as (aside from the descriptions of abuse, pain, and healing) an explanation of the way life seeps in through any imaginable wall or barrier we might try to build against it and forces us--the Kerewin in all of us--to wrestle with the things we might want to build a circular tower to hide from. Kerewin's (and our) tragic flaw is that she needs to experience the pain of and subsequent acceptance of the things she hides from--relations, love, and giving--to remain human. Joe and Simon are her vehicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult and ultimately not really worth it","review":"What a struggle it is getting through this Booker Prize-winning novel. It's not just the subject matter -- child abuse within the Maori culture of New Zealand, with a hefty dose of alcoholism thrown in for good meausre. It's also the writing itself, which reads as if it were unedited and subject to the writer's mood swings and bouts of mind-numbing depression? The frequent use of Maori language and expressions means you have to keep flipping to the back glossary which, after a while, becomes a pain. The characters are not very sympathetic and, in the end, I'm not really sure I cared what happened to these people, with the exception of the abused little boy.Too difficult for such a minor pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, totally captivating","review":"A fantastic novel that starts a little slowly however soon has the reader captivated. I could not put this book down and the complex relationships between the characters keeps the reader enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"uhmmmmmmmm.....","review":"This book is different. The best reading experience I\`ve ever had - and a beautiful danish translation, if anyone prefers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great activities for all curriculum areas!","review":"Jean Feldman gives many great ideas for all curriculum areas in this handbook. There are interesting activities for math, language, science and art centers along with easy group games with emphasis on having fun rather than competition. This book even contains fun recipes children can prepare with little help and ideas for special celebrations. These ideas are divided into convenient categories which makes finding the \\"right\\" activity a breeze. This is a must-have handbook for early childhood educators!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment from a Gifted Author","review":"I like Jane Smily. I like her a lot. That is why I was so surprised not to like Duplicate Keys. The book had my interest at the beginning and developed the lead character Alice Ellis quite well. The idea of a close knit group of friends falling apart and away from each other as some of them grew up was fascinating, particulary as two of them have been shot dead at the beginning of the book. The mystery element is early on through out, though, as it becomes obvious who it is and the book descends to a sort of psychobabble for the resoltion that is beneath the subtle display of human motives that the author manipulated beautifully in A Thousand Acres. This book is an early one for author as she develops her wonderful style and it feels incomplete. But if this is the phase she had to move through to provide the wonderful later, then it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"After a \\"Thousand Acres\\" and \\"MOO\\" I thought this would be a terrific read. Wrong. Mystery is not Miss Smiley's genre. The murderer was spotted about halfway through the book. The prose was not outstanding. The characters were not memorable. You can pass this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all I thought this book was pretty good.","review":"I really did like this book. It took a while to get into it but once I did I really did enjoy it. There were several scenes that just seemed to go on and on...But then it'd usually get good again. Not as good as A Thousand Acres but I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dissapointing","review":"The murder happens before the story opens. You never get to know the people that are dead except through the rememberances of the other characters. This doesn't provide for a very sympathetic audience. You really don't care who the killer is.The main character, Alice, is very pathetic. During the entire novel, she treats everyone fabulously well except for the one person sho is actually being nice to her, Henry.If this is a picture of realism, that reality is terriby sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bulky","review":"First off, this brand is much harder to install on the buttstock than the MidwayUSA brand. The other thing that I don't like on this is the flap. It seemed like a good idea, but once installed I realized that the flap is much to big. It either goes way past the velcro, or you can line up the velcro and have a huge floppy cover which gets in the way a lot. I would buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks but useable.","review":"This buttstock shell holder needs to be tighter/smaller because it slips and needs to come in different camo patterns. Or they can add a strap to it like the M4/M16 buttstock mag holders. If it were designed like those and with a cheek pad it would be perfect. You can always spray paint it and tape what you can to the stock to keep it in place though. Itches your face but you will get over it. Definitely needs to have a cheek pad sewn on to it. I do like the fact that you can cover your shells with the flap. Nice touch. Holds 6 rounds pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sharpening Steel","review":"This Sharpening Steel is of good quality at a fair price. A good rating is probably a bit understated given that it is of high quality, however,having used steels in the past the proof is in the long-term durability. More important to me was how the company handled a shipping issue. This is a small tool that if properly packaged would have fit in my mail box. However, it was shipped in a crate large enough to handle the national debt so I had to take a trip to the PO, wait in line and get the box. Next I had to dispose of this large box. Not so big a deal but I live 50-miles from the post office and it was a minor inconvenience when a small box would have been perfect. The company promply, professionally, and curtiously responded to my opinion and compensated me by refunding the shipping fee for the sharpener. Highly Recommend the company for their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better picture and clearer description.","review":"The photo shows a mic and mount. That's misleading.

This is as good as Ip Man and better than Ip Man 2. The only minus is that I thought this DVD can play both cantonese and mandarin, but found out that it can only play in mandarin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic Beautiful","review":"I wasn't sure if I should rate this 3 or 4 stars. I went with 4 because the movie had emotional impact. While the movie spends most if its time building plot and character, this does pay off. In other words, it can be slow. By the time the action kicks in, you will care about the characters. You cheer for them and worry as they run a gauntlet of danger. Unfortunately, the time spent on character and plot may bore some people. This is, after all, billed as a martial arts film. The martial arts do show up, in the later half. However, the fights are well done with different styles and various fights (by some well known names!), and because of the character development, breathtaking. You want the heroes to win. You need these people with pasts, tragedies, issues, and courage to win. I won't tell you how it ends. However, I will say, if you want a movie about sacrifice, love, honor, redemption, with some kick rear martial arts, I think you have found the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"China at the crossroads.","review":"This is not Donnie's usual \\"rock 'em, sock 'em\\" film. It is an attempt to represent an aspect of modern Chinese history that most Westerners, Americans particularly, know little about. The plot deals with a visit by Dr. Sun Yat Sen to Southern China in an attempt to gain control over an increasingly chaotic situation. The movie is well filmed, and the director has a sense of the necessity for characters to have some depth, and not just the ability to perform the film versions of martial arts movement. While not, perhaps, for everyone's permanent martial arts film library, it is well worth at least one viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&A","review":"There was not enough action in it,not like the rest of Donnie Yen,like in the Ip man movies,those were more fight scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another piece of Chinese communist propaganda","review":"It seems the Chinese revolution will never cease to be glorified. They keep talking about the end of poverty and hunger as if they're trying to convince us it worked. As for the movie itself it was overly dramatic with poorly choreographed fight scenes. The cinematography was just as bad. I'm a Donnie Yen fan but this was a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The amount of combat in the film is low and poor action sequences.

I feel I just got scammed out of my 2hrs of my life!

Unbelievable. 1-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well made","review":"Great story line.Slow in the beginning, but the final hour was amazing.

Now I know and am ready to shape up my manuscript with confidence.The tear-out cheat sheet by itself (in front of Writing Children's Books for Dummies) justifies buying this book. It lays out the bare-bones of writing for children - things I could never have figured out by myself, such as Children's Book No-No's, and the Twelve Commandments of writing for Children - these will save me lots of time and effortin the rewrite stage.Highly recommended - Not just as a writing primer, but as a way to understand young children's minds in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice Ariel doll for my young daughter","review":"This is a great Ariel doll if you are looking for a plush princess toy.

How pleasant to hear good old four-part harmonies again, instead of the howling cacophony you usually get from this label. For once we get to relax to the sound of four expert musicians with lovely, smooth voices taking us back to 1905 with such soft tunes as \\"My Darling Clementine\\" and \\"Hello My Honey\\". The only concession to modern-day fashion is a synthesized back beat, but this is done so discreetly and tastefully that you don't really mind. (In fact, it actually opens up the songs and adds a little something extra to their meaning.)In short, if you're tired of all the aggressive posturing and the grating lack of musicianship displayed on most record albums these days, take a chance on this lovely, tender, old-fashioned tribute to the great days of American popular music.

But at heart these little \\"badass mofos\\" love their mommies and just want to be cuddled when they feel hurt. Many of these macho-man rappers, it is well known, also seek solace from other men, REAL MEN who can handle the world and know how it works. But since it would be a shame to spoil these little fellas' fantasies of omnipotence (which springs from their impotence), I can't bring myself to give it less than two stars.

Women and people of color (i.e., Muslims) are good","review":"My heading above is perhaps too long to adequately summarize this book. The text has a late 20th century feminist and \\"white-men-are-evil\\" perspective, which tells us a lot more about the author's ideology and her time, than about Medieval Spain. This is most anachronistic and unacceptable in a work that aims to be considered of scholarly value. Readers truly interested in History, and this period in particular, will be enormously disappointed. The book, however, is not without redeeming value: future generations of scholars will find it very informative about feminism and similar \\"victim\\" ideologies of the late 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful Fren Experience!","review":"This is an extremlr good Cd, definetly the french touch in the lyrics gives it a touch of class, and the rythim is great too.

In fact, this should really be broken into two seperate manuals ('93-'98, and '99-'04). For most of the mechanical sections they manage to cover the full range by including doubles of all the pictures, one set for the older models and one set for the newer models. This can get confusing at times, but can be managed. Where this book comeplety falls apart is in the electrical chapter. The information and schematics included ONLY apply to the older, pre-'99 style Grand Cherokees and are completely worthless for newer models. If you have a '93-'98 Grand then this book should be great for you, I'd give it 4 stars, but for folks like me with the newer models then it is barely 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Generic for the job","review":"I bought this book to fix a leaking water pump.

However, if you get to the final chapter (which is one of the most disgusting, revolting things you are likely to read in a mainstream novel), you will be left feeling filthy and in need of a shower. The violence in this book is just way too over the top, and in the wake of the Columbine tragedy, I believe is very irresponsible to release such a piece of fiction; any unbalanced teenager who reads this just might flip his lid.

A theory, by the way, isn't just some idea; it's a complex set of ideas that has been tested over and over again with the latest observable information and has stood up to each test.

Where it is labeled \\"lumbar\\", it actually massages your thighs. When you try the pre-designed massages (\\"modes\\"), the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots. The whole thing is almost musical. Whoever designed this chair should try a different profession.

Still, it does what it says it will do - provide a solid massage. A tad on the noisy side, but acceptable with others in the room, it is easy to operate - and the assembly was a 'piece of cake'.

When we were thinking about replacing our existing chair, we discovered this one at a good price with the message option. The chair works well and is comfortable, but it is more stiff than our old chair. So we cleaned up the old chair and still use that and have this one in a side room where it doesn't get used much. The message system works pretty well and we used it a few times. The ottoman will massage your calf muscles, so it really does do a nice job. It makes a little noise when it is running, but not much.

The thing I like best is that it encourages young professionals and college students to use cooking as a way to gain independence and take control of their lives.

The bottom is open slats; I expected it to be solid given the product description, \\"Constructed to withstand the elements.\\" There are a few nicks, dings, and even splits in the wood, all of which produce splinters.I probably will not return the item, but sand out the dings and splinters myself and give it a good wood oil treatment.

After repeated playbacks, my ears soon adjusted and it's never ceased to give me delight and new discoveries ever since. There are more technically polished, more faithful-to-score-markings, and certainly better recorded performances around. However, the sheer artistry of the two great musical minds and their infectious affection for Schubert's music make these performances something very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a question to anybody","review":"Could someone tell me whether this is the ONLY recording of the Fantasy in f by Richter & Britten or perhaps they recorded it more than once?

My 2 cents that person missed the point. As someone who has been around publishing I can say that all books have typos (like all software has bugs). The point is the content.If you have been a branding-enabled marketing professional for years it is possible that you should try a more technical book. But if you need to get up to speed quickly, refresh your perspective for a new environment or find a way to simply think different, this book is the ticket.The author comes at his topic with a fast paced hard hitting style that gets both fact and perspective out where you can think about it and absorb it without wasting any time.

A second read from a more adult perspective, however, reveals this to be a very disappointing young adult novel. Unlike S.E.

I can't imagine any of the dialogue she created issuing forth from the mouth of an adolescent in ANY era. In addition, while the scenes recounting the hippie pads of Greenwich Village, NYC circa 1968 added a unique flavor to the storytelling, overall the book seems very dated and wholly irrelevant to the faster and more mature pace of life for teens in the new millenium. Not recommended for anything other than nostalgia. \\"A Hero Ain't Nothin' But A Sandwich,\\" which is still in print although written not much later than this in 1972, is a much better kids-involved-with-drugs tale for teens which still packs a punch today."},{"rating":"1","title":"retarded","review":"This book was [not good], I seriously think this girl should have resarched the topics she was writing about before trying to go all preachy.Pot. oooo!

Let us not forget that it was as a member of Steve Coleman's free-funk outfit, M-Base Collective, that Cassandra received attention not only for her enchanting good looks but also for her love and ability to sing a wide variety of material. Anyway, it was with 1995's NEW MOON DAUGHTER that Cassandra has been steadily adopting more folk/blues-oriented styles.THUNDERBIRD, produced by T-Bone Burnett, admittedly does contain more keyboards and percussion with lots of programming and drum looping than Cassandra's previous several recordings. Nevertheless, she still preserves her trademark sensual intimacy with whatever song she picks up. What remains constant is that incantory voice, evoking late night seduction and imminent passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I bought this because I needed it for a job I was doing and I really like to have a hard copy of the music I buy.

Who else would've lead his tome with a literal printing of the lyrics of \\"Surfin' Bird\\"? There was nothing being written about rock music remotely close to \\"The Aesthetics of Rock.\\" Nearly 40 years later, there still isn't.

This movie gave a much needed insight to this man. I actually felt sorrow for this guy at the end. He was such an ass but having to live as he did answered a lot of questions on how a someone can turn mean. It is too bad he could not live a more fuller life and the bigotry against his sexuality created an even bigger bigot out of him. He was ruthless at his job. We cannot turn a blind eye to his accomplishments.

Edgar\\" (2011) from its dire mediocrity. Repeating the structural mistakes that plagued \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" Clint Eastwood's direction simply lacks focus. Working with a fragmented script by Dustin Lance Black, he resorts to confusing flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions. Eastwood never seems engaged in the Hoover saga except for the Lindbergh kidnapping and its aftermath. Not helping matters are the poor lighting, Armie Hammer's embarrassing old-age makeup, and the utter waste of Judi Dench. Though DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for his detailed portrayal, he deserved a much better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"trés bien","review":"J'ai reu ce dvd en temps et en heure, trés bien. je suis donc trés satisfait, que dire de plus?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless acting!","review":"Another winner for Clint Eastwood and what impecable acting from everyone especially Dicaprio and Watts. Unlike a few other reviewers (and although I have seen other movies about J. Egar Hoover) the fact there may have been unknowns thrown in as factual events didn't bother me very much because it is not labeled as a documentary. There is no doubt about it, Hoover (like Nixon) was paranoid, arrogant, and vindictive among so many other weaknesses. Let's not forget what a piece of work his mother was. It is a wonder he didn't have more flaws than he did. Hoover (among so many others) is proof that no one is either all bad or all good and he deserves credit where credit is due. Glad we have this movie to add to our collection. If you are a Dicaprio fan, then you will want to see this movie because his portrayal in both appearance and acting was stellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise late masterpiece...","review":"This is a wise, mournful profound masterpiece from Clint Eastwood.

Know I did not want to go to theater to see this movie but DVD? Why not. In retrospect, no idea what I would include in a film on a man who lived so long and was so very powerful. Think Eastwood's method of switching back and forth from the beginnings and then endings was good. So much could have been included that was not. And on Hoover's personal side, I think Eastman did a fair treatment. If you interested in American history, this will give you some and I think worth a viewing.

Edgar - Boring","review":"Perhaps it was my own fault avoiding reviews, I never had high expectations and it is not the kind of movie I would go to a theater to see, but this fell even below by moderate expectations.So I went into thinking it would cover how he built the FBI, set the direction, and getting some of the inside view on how he leveraged his information, not how he sorted it, which really seemed to impress the writer and director. The movie touched on these things but a very light treatment, more like filler, well except how he arranged the infromation.I think they missed a opportunity to explore a person that was perhaps one of the most powerful men on the Planet, who was never elected, not rich, but armed only with the power of information, and the backing of the US Government.I can see how some would like it, I just had no interest in his personal life, as a person he really is not that interesting, what that person did with th4e FBI is very interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"When this movie first came out I was a bit leery and decided to pass.

The plot followed Hoover throughout his life with much emphasis on his homo-sexual tendencies. There were no details however, about Hoover's famous cross dressing. Despite all the big names, it just could not come together and the stories of big Washington D.C. players seem cliche. The life and times of an Oklahoma dirt farmer during this historical period would have been far more entertaining and less contrived than this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and quiet","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but it ended up putting me right to sleep.

The constant flip flop between the younger and older J Edgar (complete with Brando-ish stuffing ala Godfather) was visually distracting for me. I'll admit that I don't know a ton about J. Edgar; I'm upset that I don't know any more about him after watching this movie.Shot with lots of subdued tones, I liked one scene where the amber glow through a lampshade added additional color. Later on in the movie when Nixon's inaugural motorcade drives within view of J. Edgar's office window, there is a similar flash of color in the drabness of the scene thanks to the flags."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"Leonardo is always good. The movie was okay.

All I can tell you is that my suspension of disbelief was punctured, no, shredded, by this phenomenal underachievement by Leo. The accent fluctuates.

Yet, his skill is not able to overcome a poor movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complex perspective","review":"Eastwood offers a very complex view of J. Edgar Hoover. He doesn't present him as a monster nor as a hero but as an american who truly believed he was protecting the interests of the United States. If you are intent on seeing Hoover as a perverted monster who wore women's clothes then perhaps this isn't the film for you. Here he goes after Martin Luther King but is also credited with going after KKK members. He's seen as waging war with communists and radicals but also strengthening the crime solving skills and protocols within all investigative agencies. He held files on virtually everyone but made sure they were destroyed after his death. So was he a hero or a villain? Eastwood seems to think he was just human, all too human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint's Worst in a Long Time","review":"I normally love Clint Eastwood movies, but this one does not work for me.................It lacked the tautness and narrative pace I have come to expect from his films. I do not think he is losing his touch because the recent Changeling I found to be very well done. Everything seemed wrong in this film...............narrative POV, lighting, makeup, you name it. The ONLY good scenes to me were the clip of Cagney playing a Fed in the movie G Men and the subsequent scene at the Stork Club where Hoover is obviously distressed by the heterosexual attention paid him by Ginger Rogers and her party...................that was Clint as his best...music, lighting, blocking.............things that suffered in the remainder of the film. I hope he comes back with something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to wade through","review":"My mom gave me this movie on DVD after she bought it; I generally can enjoy biographical movies, but this one just dragged on.

A lot of the acting was a bit wooden for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"J. Wikipedia","review":"Every cliché of biographical movies is in \\"J. Edgar.\\" Even HBO isn't making such on-the-nose tripe as this anymore. The framework is simplistic, J. Edgar Hoover is writing his memoirs and the movie is told in flashback as he recalls his life. Then, a re-enactment of moments in Hoover's life happen that never go deeper than what you would find on Hoover's Wikipedia page until it addresses his alleged homosexuality. There are parts of this in the second half of the movie that are affecting and pretty good, mostly when relating Hoover and Tolson's relationship in the second half of their lives. Unfortunately, in the early scenes, Armie Hammer plays Tolson almost as a gay stereotype and does little but announce his limitations as an actor.Nothing new here at all and DiCaprio isn't even that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great man, poor movie","review":"They had a chance to make a great movie but failed.

There are way more interesting homosexual couples to build movies around.This movie is neither a good crime thriller like The Untouchables nor a good romance like Brokeback Mountain -- it's nothing and it will be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.

Somehow, though, the final product managed to be less than the sum of its parts. So what was the problem? There are a few. While the actors all offered up top notch performances, poor lighting and subpar makeup took away from the aesthetics of the film, while a confusing narrative and humdrum storytelling diminished any impact it might have otherwise had. As far as biopics go, you'll certainly learn a little bit about Mr. Hoover from J. Edgar, but because the story fails to explore some of the more interesting aspects of his character from any significant angle, you may find it all a little mundane and uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at times, but a unforgettable performance by Leo DiCaprio.","review":"While people may say that this is not Eastwood's masterpiece (I agree) but this is a really good biopic of a man that changed the way of investigating forever.

My pastor loaned it to me and I refuse to give it back because I don't want anyone else reading it for their own sanity. This boom is just insane and ridiculous.

Not every sect of Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism could ever possibly be mentioned. The book has been on my shelf for over 5 years. Great job and thanks for taking the time to identify, classify, compare and contrast this topic. For the \\"haters\\" out there,.. perhaps the truth is too much for you. Buy this book. Use it, Share it. Move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool...but plagued with inaccuracies","review":"This book has a cool layout that might be appealling to younger people, but even a quick glance highlighted some errors and a religious bias. For instance, groups like the Mormons are not \\"cults\\", unless of course you are of the Evangelical mindset and anyone that does not think like you is an abberrant group. The term is so over-used, it has completely lost its power. According Larson's New Book of Cults, their definition of a cultist would include five American presidents.In the section under Jehovah's Witnesses, on the practise of \\"Disfellowshipping [excommunication]\\" Etue adds, \\"Infractions could be things like talking to a former Witness or reading your Bible without the aid of the Watchtower.\\"Nothing could be further from the truth, and this kind of info is indigenous of the apathy and misinformation that spreads regarding groups we do not like. That is what keeps certain ones labelled as \\"cults.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"overly biased and over-generalized","review":"The big problem is that they end up completely over-generalizing many issues. for example for the figure head of hinduism, they put down \\"think Ghandi.\\" of course this book is aimed at certain audience but i must say i'd be pretty ashamed if i was part of that audience. The only reason i have not returned my copy of the book is because i find it kind of funny how ignorant it is, and i find it to be a great example of a biased work. All in all though its pretty much trash. anyone that is thinking of getting this as an actual reference book should completely shy away from it but if you just want something to look through and wonder how people could be so ignorant and sometimes absurd (is magic the gathering a religion?), then this might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing.","review":"It's good to have proof that other Christians believe that teenagers are too stupid to be given adequate or truthful views of other religions. It's disrespectful to teens everywhere to assume that semantic shifts and logicisms (for an illogical God, natch) are reason for disbelief.I was smarter than this when I was five; if you can read, you don't need this book. If you give this to your kids: congrats! Maybe you should've adopted out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy (...)! What a piece of.....(...) Matter.","review":"Oh My God. What a horrible book. I was really wanting a book about religions. And, ironically, I wanted the author to be of no religion. Or, well, just un-biased. But, this is not that book. The writer has clearly not studied these religions very deeply. It was talking about buddhism, and made the statement that buddhists have no god. However, there's a bunch of gods in buddhism. Also, it says buddhist people shouldn't go to the movies, or wear jewlery, and should have no desire, except for being happy. And it said they can't die their hair. None of which is true. So yeah. I'm gonna try and look for a better book. But buy it if you want propaganda. Which I guess is kinda neat. If you're doing a report on propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowledge","review":"Although the author attempts to explain other religions, he falls gravely short. The author is writing not to compare religions but to denigrate other religions. Many of the statements about other religions are plain falsehoods. Ignorance would best sum up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is a biased and poorly written pretense at a comparative presentation of religions---except that some are left out, apparently by being lumped together with the next most similar religion. The text is sprinkled with snide remarks about other religions that leave the reader with no doubt as to where the bias of the author is located. Look for something more balanced, something in which you cannot detect the preference of the author. This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of accuracy of provided information","review":"I was looking briefly at this book while at the grocery store and looked at the entry for my own religion. The information provided was not just biased, it was inaccurate. The publisher asserted that Mormons believed Jesus was the son of Joseph. This is not our belief. We believe that He is divine - literally the Son of God. If the book's publisher misrepresents a fundamental belief of my religion, I am left to wonder how it treats other religions that do not adhere to the Christian premise of the book. If you are looking for an academic overview of world religions, I suggestReligious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know--And Doesn't. If you are looking for spiritual enlightenment, I suggest you go directly to the source of the religion(s) you are interested in. Most religions have an official website where you can get non-biased theological information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly biased.","review":"A pastor lent this to me because he thought my friends and I would find it interesting. This book isn't repuatable nor is it accurate. On a section describing fundamentalist Islam, there were pictures of GUNS. This book is far too biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This book is the kind of horror that only fundementalists could love. It alternates between intentional ignorance and blatant ommission to attempt to prove that christianity is the only religion that is 'true'. As a read it bounces between mildly offensive to comical. Just about any other book would be better research for those wondering about other belief systems. This book is intended to reinforce christian prejudices, not enlighten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic: the \\"occult\\"","review":"I read the section about magic: the gathering. It is quite far off base seeing as it has nothing to do with religion. Also I can guarantee that Richard Garfield is not a \\"figure head\\" of the game as this book defines it, he maybe the creator but he is in no way seen as a great leader of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerant Drivel","review":"Trying to spread the satisfaction you see in your religion is one thing. Lying about other religions to do so is another. This book's description tells us that it teaches tolerance. However, it sheds every religion besides Christianity in a negative light. This negativity persists throughout the book, even if the writers have to misrepresent the religions described to make Christianity look better.This book has only the proliferation of Christianity as its goal. If you want a book on comparative religion, get a book by an author literate in comparative religion. It will be a more pleasant and fulfilling investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The whole book is based on one dangerous assumption. If there is a God he must be the God of the Bible. The book even references Pascal's Wager! Pascal's Wager is shaking reasoning at best. The reasoning the author gives for not believing Sikhism is \\"It just doesn't make much sense.\\" Just because a Christian can't explain it doesn't mean it can't be explained. The \\"trick\\" for agosticism is basically, there is no point in believing you can't be sure about God's existance, so you might as well believe because it may save your soul. Again, this is based on the assumption that Christ must be the way, so don't consider anything else.I would not recommend anyone to buy this book, Christian or not. It is a baised point of view that gives no validity to anything other than Christianity. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My","review":"I don't know about all the other comments I've read below but...I think this book is great! I know Jesus is the WAY so I don't mind them claiming the same thing. Obviously it may be a bit vague...the target market was for teenagers...so therefore Teens don't want to be bothered with deep theological principles on different religions. It's an easy read, a fun one at that and it breaks things down in separate categories.Everyone is entitled to their opinion but this book is just fine if you ask me. VERY helpful...it'll at least give you a foundation on the religions, if you want to study them further then get other specific books.It does what it aims to do--make people aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly expected more","review":"I really expected more from Coetzee, whom I had never read before picking up this book. I saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes, and I'm not surprised. The title character spends all of her time giving speeches, which is strange for a novel--you think you will get a plot, but you just get lectured to. The writing is good, spare and cogent, but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel, in my opinion. The best chapter, which is the last, has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Want moe.","review":"Alright, if you are reading this all of you need to get out there and check these guys out on the road.

For what they lack in creativity,(which is a lot), they make up for in lyrical cliche's, and jamming. they are obiously a band who is void of all musical sincerity. their jamming, long, uninteresting is clearly an attempt for compinsation.

It lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get. Hey, The Grateful Dead was a good band, but new hippie-wanna-be bands just don't have the talent. The only people who buy these albums are just 14 year old freshmen in High School looking for an excuse to be \\"popular.\\" Well, my bashing has been done, so I will leave you on this note; If you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music once, doesn't it just get plain boring?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blasphemy is still a crime","review":"The book took me by surpise because it came looking like a final draft. It saved me money in this format so am still happy. The book is well written and follows an incident that happened in the late 1800's which is not that long ago, (my grandmother was born in 1908 as a reference point).

But they have a wonderful grasp of all the rock and R&B; sounds that other, more popular \\"Classic Rock\\" bands took to the bank in the 70s.Teenage Licks includes this bands twists on straight rock, gospal, and R&B; balladeering. The playing is no-nonsence but proficiant, yet never once does Stone The Crows lose their live, loose sound. They are as good as Delaney and Bonnie, The ALman Brothers, or any other band in this neighborhood. They simply don't get airplay.Their lead singer, Maggie Bell, actually had a solo career on Led Zeppilins Swan Song label.Those boys knew talent when they saw it.

I realized I wasn't crazy when I suddenly remembered the title and found the book online.Anyway, the reason I remembered it for so long is that it scared me a little...

I was excited to get a Live CD but very disappointed with this effort. It sounds like they recorded it during a keg party in someone's back-yard. I DJ and could not gleam a single song off this CD to mix into my sets. You really have to listen to find some grains of the sound that makes the Bouncing Souls such an endearing and energetic band. Every band is allowed a dud, and this is theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great punk CD","review":"The Bouncing Souls are truly one of the best pure punk bands out there. Tie One On is a great live sample of what the bouncing souls are like, so I suggest you buy it even if you haven't heard anything by them before. All nine tracks are filled with energy and many great chords. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance, Good Quality, Bad Editing","review":"I was pleasently surprised when I got this in the mail from Epitaph. I haven't seen the Bouncing Souls live in 3 or so years now since I saw them with Agent Orange at the Cattle Club in Sacramento. So I was excited to see if they've kept it up after all that has happened to them. What with a new huge (by independant standards) label and playing much larger shows. I was not disappointed. The performance on this record is pretty f**king great. The sound quality is good, but the edit job is terrible. There are very noticible splices where sounds don't match up and the most noticable screw up is on the second track before they go into the song the mention that they're only on the third song and they've already broken a string. Little descrepinces like that. I guess it isn't very punk of me to pick that kind of stuff apart. But oh well. All in all, a pretty decent record. I reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review","review":"1. Run On (Extended) 2. Sunday 3. Down Slow (Full Length Version)I wouldn't reccomend this album. The extended version of \\"Run On\\" isn't much different from the original version, the full length version of \\"Down Slow\\" gets boring after awhile of listening to it (it's no wonder why he shortened it for the album) and \\"Sunday\\" is a pretty good song, but you can also get it on the maxi single of \\"Bodyrock\\" along with some great remixes of the title track and the B-side \\"Sunspot\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Play","review":"\\"Run On\\" isn't that different than on Play, and it's better in the original. \\"Down Slow\\" is just longer than on Play.

The travel descriptions are completely flat, there are no stories beyond the descriptors, and the book does not easily relate the names of places and peoples to present day names, thereby making it harder to relate to. I recommend reading a biography of this phenonemnal woman rather than her travel writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"My great-grandmother was a mid-wife, so this beautifully written story gave me an insight into her world, during that era. This so tellingly describes the \\"witch-hunt\\" against mid-wives during this time as well as using natural potions to birth babies in the best possible way they knew how. It also exposes the fact that doctors didn't have all the answers, (nor do they now?), and that sometimes the oldest remedies work far better than \\"science\\".

I found the story magical, and although I am of a scientific bent, I love to find myself on the side of the mystical and mysterious. The prologue is positively musical in its choice of language, and I was hooked immediately. Like another of the reviewers, I was unable to put the book down.The characters in The Birth House are real people, people we care about throughout the story. These are the women we wish we had as neighbours, women we wish we were.If I have one criticism, it would be seeing our heroine, Dora, in so many historical events. I was OK with seeing her help out at the Halifax explosion, but my credibility was stretched a bit when the small town midwife also helped in Boston during the Influenza epidemic in 1918.All in all, an excellent read. I would recommend it to all mothers and mothers-to-be. (Wonderful to see yet another amazing Canadian woman author!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is There More?","review":"I loved this book and had a hard time putting it down. I loved the characters and could see books being written about each one of them. Perhaps a series about the lives of the women of the Occasional Knitters Society.

I thought this was an excellant first novel for author Ami McKay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I heard about this book in the Fall of 2006 on a Midwifery discussion board and had looked forward to reading it.Unfortunately, this is one of those rare books I regret reading. The writing was immature, overly dramatic, and major portions of the book lacked unity. Random and improbable historical events/figures were peppered throughout the book, further weakening the narrative.What I was most upset about was the poor understanding that the author held of midwifery and contemporary obstetrics of the period. The narrative on both of these subjects was histronic and digusted me.My degrees are in History, Public Health, and soon Nurse-Midwifery. I found this book an incredibly poor portrayal of Midwifery, its roots in history, and in women's lives. Simply an awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I had just read The Virgin Cure by Ami McKay, which I liked, and thought The Birth House sounded good. I was wrong.

I thought it looked interesting when I picked it up, but never found the time to start it. A couple days ago I finally chose this book to read. I could hardly put it down! I found myself rooting for Dora and Miss B and angered by those against her, especially--Dr G Thomas and Brady Ketch. It was a great read and left me longing for more of Dora and her allies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"An overall good book.

As some other reviewers have noted, the characters are VERY one dimensional, and the writing seemed self-conscious and over the top. Although the topic was interesting (divide between midwives and doctors), it didn't make up for the characters, writing, or even the plot for that matter.

The inclusion of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", and \\"October\\" (as a bonus after \\"All I Want is You\\") show that the movers and shakers behind this compilation have a deeper motivation and connection to the music than a fistfull of green.

The B-sides are very well, not that comercial than the first disc of course but if you wanna' hear something new about U2, it's good to hear it for a while. The album only has one problem: some songs are better in concert version, and they put all the original songs. Examples of these songs are Sunday Bloody Sunday, Bad and I will follow.

To me The Joshua Tree was U2 performing at their best, but I dare anybody to find 1 bad song on Achtung Baby!

It helps to show how they became one of the world's biggest bands in the world in the late 80s an early 90s from their early days of boy and war. Every song on this albums is good, and it is good that u2 threw in the second disc because these songs though released would remain unheard to most of the public. The best songs on the album are pride (in the name of love), when love comes to town and desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2's B-sides better than other's A-sides...","review":"U2's B-sides are better than most other band's A-sides. Oh, to be back in the 80's when we would scrap and scrape for scratchy copies of \\"Spanish Eyes,\\" and \\"Hallelujah, Here She Comes.\\" What a joy to hear passionate, intense, and intelligent music again, music you can FEEL.

A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan from the northside of Dublin, somewhere in Brooklyn","review":"All I have to say is I am so glad to see this collection of some of their greatest hits along side some of the best and somewhat overlooked B-sides. I have had this album for years on a tape I made up from the various singles and albums over the years. It's nice to now be able to enjoy these classics via CD quality sound and to also have verified what I have always known....I have great taste.... My wife also thinks I am really cool as I gave this homemade tape to her as a present when we were dating in Portmarnock, Co. Dublin, Ireland and now the band sees fit to follow my lead. Nice to see we Dubliners all think alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Casual listener, Complimentary for the Fan","review":"If you are a casual listener and have only ever owned two U2 CDs, (The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby) then this CD is for you. The first CD is most of their best hits from the 80s. Obviously their are some tracks I would rather have seen from Boy, War, Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. For the fan, the first CD should be nothing new. Although parts of the second CD are readily available through past singles and EPs, it is a good collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"you need this CD","review":"I love U2. This CD does a great job of giving a variety of U2 songs and styles. The B-sides also gives a side of the band that not many people thinik about all the time.

Pure excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no better!","review":"For all its shortcomings (packaging, song choices, edits) this compilation is still far and away the best album I have heard this year.

Ultimately, Rich's own distinctive voice and phrasing said as much about his beliefs and his passion for every word he wrote as the literal meaning of the words themselves. It is amazing how much less impact each song has through another person's interpretation. With The Jesus Record we didn't have much choice: in order to get a quality recording it had to be redone. But what is the point here? Each of these songs already exists in high-quality Mullins recordings. The tribute is the equivalent of saying, \\"We know that your particular voice and phrasing is not marketable to some of the mass of Christian blandness, but we'll fix it.\\" It is an insult to Rich's artistic direction. A better tribute would have been for these artists to reflect on the themes of Rich's life with orginal works, honoring his distinctive voice with their own artistic visions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Moving","review":"This cd is absolutely amazing, and if you feel like using a cassette, i'm sure its just as good. Anyways, words cannot describe what these songs do for me. the most amazing song on the cd is \\"if i stand\\" that jars of clay sang. an awesome version of the song by rich. if you happen to have napster, go download this tribute, and you will be sold for the whole cd.

I was incredibly excited, until I tasted my coffee. At first, I thought my milk had gone bad, because the coffee just tasted unpleasant and odd. I tossed the coffee and poured a new cup, adding milk from a different container, and was met by the same putrid taste.To me, the syrup tastes like rotten squash/pumpkin. I didn't taste much (or any) spice, though that may have been the overpowering smell of something spoiled. I tried several proportions of coffee:milk:syrup and could not come up with anything palatable.I strongly suggest you do not purchase this product, unless I got a terrible batch (in which case, Torani needs to tweak their quality control process!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this syrup was terrible!","review":"I bought this syrup hoping to be able to make coffee or lattes at home that taste at least a little bit like Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts pumpkin spice lattes. Not only does this taste nothing like either, it is actually gross. My husband took a whiff of it and gagged. The bottle was sealed when it came so I don't think mine was tampered with.

Then, the fear starts! Reading the one page \\"directions\\" made me think I'd end up with something that looked nothing like a greenhouse. However, this is a really good deal. Each part (and there are quite a few) are individually labeled and very well packed. Assembly is without tools and, even with sketchy directions, it went together pretty easily.

Seeing the mix of characters in the office and Ben Kincaid's sometime low self-esteem make for a believable and engaging lawyer and his firm. (Didn't actually know they existed!) There is the usual tension between Ben and Christina. There is the goofiness of Loving that adds humor in just the right spots and, of course, there are the last minute heriocs that always come with a twist. This is a good book and I am already looking forward to seeing Ben in action again.

This is so perfect, the tone, repetition, it's everything they need at this age for learning. And they love it. Within in a week, he knew all his numbers, colors, and shapes.

The biography/interview with Parker is brief (you can read the whole thing in less than a few minutes) and far inferior to what you can find on the internet for free.

A much better production and also by discovery is \\"Discovery Atlas: Italy revealed\\" which was produced in 2006.

Somehow, however, it seems incredible to me that Richard Sharpe happened to be at every dramatic episode, from bringing the crucial message to the Bruxelles ball to charging the Guard in the end and always turning the tide at crucial moments. Seeing that Sharpe also instigated the crucial breakthrough at Vitoria, I can't wait to find out that he was also at Borodino, Leipzig and probably any french defeat you care to mention. Is he going to poison the exile at St Helena? Does Napoleon know Sharpe beat him almost singlehandedly, despite the incompetent british officers, cowardly spaniards and the perfidious prussians?

Authors like Cornwell give them back their critical place, purpose and potency. If you have followed the SHARP series then you've watched the rise of Richard Sharp in the British Army and knew that his tie to Wellington had to inevitably lead them here.If you're new to the series then I envy your discovery because you have some good reading ahead of you.

Dahl does have a gift for language, and the story about a young boy and the father who loves him dearly is very charming, made even more so by Quentin Blake's delightful illustrations.But, as I explained to my son, the story glorifies stealing (romanticized as poaching). It doesn't matter if the victim is a hideous, cruel human being who deserves a grand comeuppance, it's still stealing. Another point worth mentioning is that Danny, the young boy, is the most grown-up person in the cast of characters--he's the one who instinctively knows the right thing to do, while it's the impulsive adults who act like children. Good points to bring up with one's own children, if you're going to read this to them.The Roald Dahl Brigade surely will go after me for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like Friendship This is a Great Book for You!","review":"Danny, the Champion of the WorldBy Roald DahlAre two heads better than one?

Out of all her books, this series is closest to what I always thought regular \\"fantasy\\" books would be like -- has a Medieval type setting, castles, dragons, heroes on a \\"quest\\" for artifacts, noble ideals, forces of darkness to be overcome, etc. That said, I think Storm turns a lot of the cliches on their heads and makes it all quite twisted :) The books have a big undercurrent of sexuality, notably a strong same sex attachment while at the same time tying in with things like Medieval sagas and German myths.

I'm tired of being \\"told\\" what Valraven is rather being \\"shown.\\" In fact a great many things are being told and hence the characters are barely flesh and bone and I didn't care about the melodramas going on in their lives. There are too many convenient plot devices that is contrived and tiresome. As for the bed-hopping scenes..... why? They don't seem to serve any other purpose other than to \\"oh lets be shocking, shocking(!)\\" and then left at that with no futher insights to the characters themselves. Once again it is the \\"telling\\" rather than the \\"showing\\" flaw of Constantine's writing that bores me to no end.I will say that Constantine's writing style is lovely and rather poetic.

However, from the wonderful introduction Jorie Graham provided, I expected an equally wonderful collection in a call of arms for poets to help poets realize what they do is equally valid as anything else a writer may write, be it fiction or non-fiction.

I would have preferred straight 100% cotton (non-ceramicized) and done without the UV protection.

As a scientist he should know that debate and skeptisicm lie at the heart of good science, but it is thrown to the winds in this dreadful potboiler. He has written like this before, and all are at a similar trivial level. He raises the possibility of a meteororite destroying earth but it is in the realm of Hollywood rather than we poor mortals.

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. You remember your exercise DVDs and they become quite boring, but this game actually motivated me to exercise every day because each routine was different. Maya doesn't exactly scold you when you miss a day that you're scheduled to exercise, but she doesn't let it just slide either... I love that it is customizable to your weight and fitness goals. It even tells you how many calories you've burned after the workout. I have the stepper, weights, and the stability ball...all of which have really maximized my experience with this game, but I've had days when I've used none of them and the floor exercises are just as enjoyable!I highly recommend this to anyone bored with exercising at home....you really need to buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware (or at least forwarned)!","review":"I wanted to add a second monitor to my emachines desktop running Windows 7.

It won me over and in the end, like a lot of other reviewers, I believe it to be a masterpiece. It is a huge sprawling, exotic horror novel populated with flawed quirky characters. I'm not sure I ever understood the need for a trial. Why the need? This nonsensical event upon which everything in the book is centered around caused me repeatedly to doubt the novel, to go so far as to label it dumb. But in the end, some things are too large to grab your arms around and you have to let go: I don't know why the book centered on the trial. I no longer care. The book is a bold, perverse masterpiece despite being centered around a totally implausible event that held the possiblity of rendering it irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marian Anderson","review":"This is a wonderful CD - her voice is so beautiful and the change from records to a CD were done magnificent.

On line the price is $68-$79 for this small piece. I assume this must break often, because it is way out of line with all of the other parts, so I feel like I would be getting gouged for the $.

Also the rate of inflation of 5% is too high based on current and past values. This also biases the results. It is funny to see the results of her long term care insurance policy analysis. According to Orman, the insured pays in $1,255 each year for 30 years and alternately if they had not taked the policy get no credit for the compound growth rate this money would earn had not they taken the policy. It makes a huge different that was not considered Also there is a chart that shows a comparison of 5% simple and compound interest on an inflation rider. Certainly, inflation is not a simple interest growth rate. The data of Orman's table make no sense whatsoever and certainly have no bearing on the long term care policy decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it.

They kill under the pretence of being freedom fighters against masters, but they are more like terrorists. And what's worst, is that they're on to him and Akki.

I don't mind the subtitles. I've lived in enough foreign countries to be used to that. But good lord, how do you make a movie about killing Nazi's so boering? Quentin Tarantino found a way. It drags from one scene to another with so much talking. The acting was great. The scenes were done beautifuly. But a movie that bills itself as an action movie had me asleep half way through it.

There are scenes that seem to go on forever with a bunch of uninteresting characters spouting boring dialog about things you don't care about. ALL IN SUBTITLES! Pitt's character is ridiculous as is the entire premise of the movie.I know it is a fantasy but it comes off as silliness as the plot and the situations portrayed in the film are completely asinine. It is also mildly disturbing that the horror of WWII is trivialized somewhat, if only it would have been that easy to kill the Nazis.I truly don't understand the rave reviews here. Tarantino rips off himself and other film cliches that have been done a million times before only better.

But it's Tarrantino, so it's to be expected. The direction on this is fabulous, the acting, the story, the pacing, the cinematic appeal... It's really an interesting perspective, retelling a Nazi-era drama, though as one should expect, the underlying details are gritty, ugly, and sometimes gross. The convergence of subplots into the primary story is well done and exciting. If you're OK with Tarrantino's needful spin of fetish-cum-violence, this film will not disappoint, and may leave you thinking about how war criminals are really treated in our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar winner blockbuster","review":"This film has all the ingredients of a good entertaining film: drama, thriller, war.

The movie can evoke some pretty strong emotions surrounding the Vichy Regime and the persecution of French Jews if you take the movie too seriously.But it's a strongly representing movie of Quentin Tarantino and his curiously violent and playful style. The movie plays like a really bad-ass comic book with phenomenally well-developed characters and truly amazing acting on all accounts (probably the best \\"bad-guy\\" acting I have ever seen by Christoph Waltz).Bottom line: if you have a weak stomach for blood and violence, you should avoid this movie.

True, a lot of unnecessary gore but gore is always a part of Tarantino's movies and you should expect that before you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"This movie was ok, there was some fine acting, but Quentin is one sick basterd.Talk about over doing the gore side of things, it was just unnessessary and really took away from sum.Would not buy this for my collection, and would not reccommend it either"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only atrocity committed was this film.","review":"Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even \\"The Basterds\\". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.I'm so over Tarantino. He's like the magazine collage maker of film. Just a bunch of stuff done by someone else pasted all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow death, I long for the time I will never get back wasted watching this","review":"The subtitles were a bit quick for my taste, the dialogue was long, and the music...garbage. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bloody Sandbox Fantasy (this time with swastikas)","review":"The actors are dolls. The director is a little boy. He makes them say clever and confusing things. Then he makes them kill and torture each other. He plays kitschy music in the background.This is every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made. And they've gotten less and less imaginative as the years have progressed.In Basterds he just puts swastikas on the sandbox. Take away the violence and sadism and all you have is a bunch of long-winded machine-like speeches which hold your attention only as a precursor to the violence Tarantino has conditioned you to expect, something like an 80's porno flick without the sex.If you enjoy the victim/victimizer paradigm, or have a deep-seated psychological need to watch simulated torture, this will be enjoyable for you.If you want to see a half-decent Tarantino flick, rent Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Movie Waste of Time","review":"Many years ago I watched a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, I promised myself then I would never voluntarily watch another movie he directed, last night I broke that promise to myself. The cast did a great job especially the one known as the \\"Jew Hunter\\". The costumes where excellent. But at the end of the movie I asked what was the point of this stupid movie? I thought it was going to be a new untold story of WWII, but it was just a venue for Tarantino to display the violence that has been the main theme in both of his movies I have seen. It was a waste of my time. And I promise myself I will never voluntarily watch another one of his movies. This time I really mean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser...start to finish","review":"No-one sane will ever understand why Hollywood insists on continuing to make movies that are downright insulting, ludicrous and unentertaining....could it be the mentality of the viewing public? Evidently, Tarantino has the same \\"tongue in cheek\\" disregard because inglorious basterds has to pertain to the paying audience and not to the storyline. Ten minutes into this movie you'll wonder where it's going and why. At the end you still won't know. My minor grandchild could make a better movie. But, Tarantino, with the IQ of a fence post, is laughing all the way to the bank having fooled his fawning public, again. And you, will have wasted 2 1/2 hours of your life which you'll never get back...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogans Heroes a la Tarantino","review":"Boring, badly written, badly acted, historically and artistically false; this movie isn't even good enough to be a comic book.

I guess some people can't stop beating up on their dead enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charged twice for this movie","review":"We wanted to,watch this movie in HD. However, every five minutes the movie would stop and a \\" Quality HD\\" screen would appear. After this happened six or seven times, we went back to try the non-HD version. The movie did not download at all, we received an error message. When we tried,to,go back to,the Library, the movie was not listed. We ended up being charged for both the regular and the HD versions, neither of which were downloaded. This never happened when we had Netflix, I guess we will go back to using that service and not use Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle disaster","review":"Thank God I know where the freeze button is on my dvd control or I would have missed half the movie dialog. What the H was wrong with Tarantino on this one?I loved the plot, and wished it would have happened that way; millions of people would have been spared Germany's super race garbage.I could only do half of the bar scene at a time as the subtitles were making me sick trying to read light letters against a light background!!!There are those that will give this movie a big 5 star no matter what because of Tarantino, but I have to put this one way back on the watch again shelf, in back of Kill Bill, Etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"If you are going to 'break the rules' you have to do it well.

All the cool Tarrantino trademarks are in this movie..the beautiful cinematography and superb attention to detail, the graphic violence, the striking contrast of later period, hipster pop and rock music choices over the dramatic scenes, the great campiness that pops up from time to time to remind you you're watching an entertaining movie and my favorite , his ultra hip and cool dialogue. Film students probably pour over every word of a Tarrantino flick to see how it's done by the master. Very few people can so consistently create such great tension and interest as in watching something as otherwise sedate as people sitting in a bar , chatting it up. I was a bit surprised though that so much of the movie was about people and scenes OTHER than the basterd bunch, though it all ties in nicely in the end. Thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible -- Only one word to describe it!","review":"A big fat waste of time -- Brad Pitt's acting laughable.

Great movie extras for Tarantino fans!","review":"The movie is absolutely amazing, even I don't think it's Tarantino's best. But with many extras, make this edition definitively unique and captivating.The extras include a 5 minute full editon of \\"Nation's pride\\", the movie within the movie. But also a making of this faux feature, a clip with the \\"Hi Sally!\\" from the set with all the cast and crew giving regards to the recently late Tarantino's editor Sally Menke.Also three deleted scenes and the classical making of.Great edition! Buy it with no doubts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie at a better price, DC issues fixed!","review":"Bought this combo pack on Day 1, only to be dismayed that the Digital Copy code did not work in iTunes as advertised. Thankfully, the issue has now been resolved, and now the DC codes will work until the end of the year. My review has been adjusted to reflect this fact. I think this is a fantastic deal as you get one of the best movies released in the past five years on all three formats for a great price. Another word to the wise, though: only buy one of the Universal 100th Anniversary combo packs at a time. Each one comes with an offer code for their sweepstakes with a guaranteed minimum prize of $3 off your next 100th Anniversary combo pack purchase. If you're a movie fanatic like me, the savings could add up quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino is one talented, er, basterd!","review":"Given his bizarre, genre-twisting reputation, Quentin Tarantino's \\"Inglourious Bastereds\\" impresses most with its decidedly old-fashioned suspense scenes!Everyone knows about Christoph Waltz, but to me the real standout performance here is Melanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, a real study in subtlety and total immersion in a role. And of course Brad Pitt is a reliable crowd-pleaser as Aldo Raine (Fave moment: When Pitt, already in close-up, leans forward and says \\"Ah WILL have mah SCALPS!\\" Terrific)This is as good as everyone says, and makes for a magnificently entertaining movie night. One you'll long remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inglourious, but just, desserts...","review":"Although violence as entertainment is not my cup of tea, violence against the violent is a horse of a different color. Quentin's suggested retributional methods for the handling of Germany's right-wing extremists might just give pause to some of today's, there and elsewhere. That can only be a good thing.No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker. Those skills are unquestionably on display here.All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history. Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.If one knows beforehand that the movie is fantasy, sort of a WWII fictional wish-fulfillment, they will enjoy it more. Another \\"Valkyrie\\" it is not, but, of course, it was not meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellente!","review":"Received this shipment a day later than I had expected, but I'm an impatient guy anyhow.

However, quite honestly they could have been left completely out of the film with very little effort--they were nothing more than background characters popping in every now and again. Pitt's character had so much potential to be interesting, but we never learn hardly anything about him and he quickly becomes rather generic. Similarly, the plot itself had quite a bit of potential to be intriguing and enthralling, but instead became labored and boring. I'm glad I waited for the DVD rental, rather than wasting money on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"It really wasn't what I expected...

In this case I think the previews for \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" were better than the movie and it will be a long time before I buy a Tarantino film again....if ever. This movie was not even up to his efforts with \\"Kill Bill\\". I suggest he spend some time with Guy Ritchie and learn how to produce a story with a more interesting and less predictable plot and characters with more depth.

[I would especially apologize to Ernst Lubitsch].Tarantino has obviously made some fine films (\\"Pulp Fiction\\" might even be great). But his monstrous ego appears to have led him to believe that he is to filmmaking what Bob Feller was to pitching, when he's actually more like Dick Radatz. Radatz had a few good seasons for the Red Sox, and could throw hard, but he didn't last. Unlike Radatz, however, Tarantino doesn't seem to realize that being on the mound in a well-tailored uniform is not the same as pitching a good game.A better medium for \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" would have been a comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only This Version of WW2 Were True...","review":"I am so happy to see a different accounting and kill scores, than most all of the other films using WW2 as the basis of their films.Yes, it's a trip into Fantasyland, but such a welcomed change of pace.

Im no psychologist but I am very observant, Its as if he is trying to kill some part of his subconscious off or maybe its symptomatic of his inability to see the world in a mature adult way. Instead what we the viewers get is a black or white, no subtext, no gray area, incomplete character motivations. I also felt this movie ran longer tahan necessary (Tarantino is getting more hedonistic and excessive as he goes along, no?). There are however several really good scenes (more in way of acting and directing) in this film but mostly I would just rather watch the movies this movie borrowed from and are superior to.

It's as if you can feel how tense people are when they are talking to the SS. Everything was so good untill I saw the comic relief Hitler and Goebbels.

I just got mine and tried to download my copy to no avail! So, buy it if you want a copy of the movie on BluRay. It looks and sounds great! And, this is a fantastic film by Tarrantino who continues to mature as a filmmaker. For me, the movie seemed odd at first but on subsequent viewings I find myself drawn in further. Some of the scenes with The Jew Hunter are going to be classics, especially the first one - so much tension!I haven't viewed the Special Features, but they seemed pretty sparse. There's no commentary, even. So, this is a not very special edition.

After seeing it in theaters, I was very disappointed. The acting was easily some of the best I've ever seen, however the reason I went was for the Basterds, who were barely in it.Watching it the second time, I knew what to expect and I could appreciate it for what it was, however it could have been even better, had Brad Pitt and the gang been in this movie more.Here are some pros and cons:Pros:Perfect acting. Nice special effects. Great characters.Decent story.Cons:Long, drawn-out soliloquies. Not enough action.Fantasy WW2 story made me question why this film was even made. I mean, I get that there are a lot of great fictional history stories, however including Hitler in such a un-historical way, took me out of the movie a bit.Overall, a good movie, and worth owning just for the acting alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart Film for Discerning Viewers","review":"This film is not for the squeemish or those with short attention spans and trouble reading English subtitles. This is not a conventional war movie nor does it pretend to be. This is well written, brilliantly acted, WWII revenge fantasy.

Do not know how much the film cost, but it was a big waste of talent and resources. It seems he wanted to explore other type of stories and stamp his seal, but nothing new here that we have not seen in one of his previous films. The basement bar dialogues are so long that at one point become boring. The movie was well filmed and visually is impecable, but the plot did not flow naturally as other films that simultaneously tell three or more stories melting in the end. Tarantino must do better research before he gets involved in a project that is not pure gore or under-world-related story, in THAT he is master. Regrettably to hear Cat People from David Bowie (which BTW was previously used in an 80's film) in a 2010 soundtrack for a WWII film, it just do not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"really stupid","review":"A really stupid movie -- not even bad.

I like Brad Pitt where did he find that southern accent at the dollar store. Did they just give up on making it worth while. I hope they didn't spend much on this because this movie is middle of the road B movie. The bar room scene/chapter was longer then it should have been. Only two chapters are worth watching with the bar room being longer then needed. The chapter at the show had the complete upper elite echelon of the Reich attending a preimer showing of a hero of the Reich's deeds. It had two soldiers guarding Hitler and maybe ten others guarding elsewhere. The whole chapter was a joke. It seems more like the scene was from national lampoon vs this movie. The scenes happen because the writter said it happened. This movie will be $7.99 by year end. What a complete waste of two and 1/2 hours. I would like to carve into Brad Pitt's head that he \\"sucks\\" its that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Humor","review":"I loved the show! You have to be able to enjoy sick humor.

Don't bother buying this movie. I'm sorry but I don't see the need for humor in a war movie. War is anything but funny, just ask any Veteran of combat.I feel sorry for all the WW 2 Veterans who went to or bought this movie, thinking that they were going to see a new, fair & accurate depection of WW 2.

Christopher Waltz was incredible in this film and the rest of the performances, with one exception, were a close second to Mr. Waltz. And those performances is what makes this movie worth watching. With all due respect to nerds everywhere, a fifth grade nerd with no acting experience could have done a better job acting in this movie than Brad Pitt. He was nothing short of horrible in this film which surprised me because he is otherwise a fine actor. Watching Mr. Pitt in this film I found myself repeatedly asking \\"is this some kind of joke\\". Unfortunately it was not. What was Mr. Tarantino thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Irrelevant Garbage. No More Tarantino","review":"I officially give up on Tarantino. This movie was remarkably bad, it was hard to follow, and showed little creativity. If one knows nothing about history or the epic struggle that was World War 2, you might be entertained. Pitt is a good actor but his role in this seemed forced and contrived. This film was not worth making or watching. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore Glorfied - No Heroes","review":"This story is pure fantasy. With all the touching true stories to come out of World War II, why does a movie producer sink to such a level to supply entertainment? It seems to have been made simply to exploit Hollywood's talent for exhibiting gore. There are no heroes or \\"good guys\\" here. I honestly can't find any redeeming value about this picture. With movie themes like this dumped on our public, criminals have a generous supply of role models to imitate. Wish I could get my money back.This movie is not worth one star but Amazon doesen't allow a zero rating, so....one star it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of an inglorious mind","review":"One star in one star too many for this sick product of a sick mind of what is becoming a sick industry in Hollywood. I could go up the ladder, but I'll stop here for the purpose of this review. In fact there's nothing to review. This movie amounts to nothing, artistically or in any other way. It is a revenge fantasy that comes 65 years too late, so I am at a loss to find the motivation behind this movie. I feel sorry for those young minds who are exposed to this garbage and even more so to see some expressing appreciation. Just glad I live in a different country and a different culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Flashes of brilliance held together with needless gore and confusing, splotched together scenes.

It seems that Tarentino basically gathered every cliche that he has seen in much better films like \\"The Dirty Dozen\\", \\"Underground\\" (an obscure film with Cornel Wilde), etc.--and thrown in a blender and out comes this monstrosity. I even gave the film a second try on Blu-ray and still despite the favorable reviews, changed my opinion of this film. The film lacks suspense and Tarentino over does it in the dialogue department--allowing a scene to go on much longer than it needs to be. Christoph Waltz's performance as the evil Nazi is perhaps the only saving grace in this disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inglorious Movie","review":"This movie was horrible. The story was ok but the acting was amateurish. I knew it was going to be bad when I saw Brad Pitt hold his jaw at a strange angle to attempt to look strong or threatening. I can not understand how or why he or the movie was ever nominated for an Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK!","review":"This is the most sick and disgusting movie I ever had the misfortune to watch. It is the sickest kind of propaganda possible full of graphic horror what kind of a demented mind would even think of such stuff - someone like Jeffery Dahmer? Scalping people was a whiteman's invention and I am so sick of the promotion of this kind of BS and the Jewish holocast when the American holocaust was much worse the East Coast was well populated with Native people and they were brutally slaughterd in many, many ways to the point there a very few Natives left there. No wonder our country is so messed up with this kind of garbage being even nominated for academy awards, that is sooooo wrong.

If Quentin Tarantino hadn't been involved in this turkey, no one would pay it any attention at all, except maybe for several razzies.

I guess this applies to movies as well. While many may claim this is a great movie I digress otherwise. It's slow paced, poorly acted, and comes across as being somewhat pretentious. The only part of this movie that I did enjoy was the part played by Diane Kruger (Troy)and the twist of her character's appearance. Other than that this movie is one that should be placed on life support. Tarantino's only GOOD movie was \\"Pulp Fiction\\" which is a classic. This stinker is no where close to being a good movie let alone a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Strange","review":"This movie starts out good and quickly becomes boring and depressing. I think they didn't know how to end it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Boring","review":"In my opinion this director is absurdly overated. A movie that is 99% dialogue is not what I call entertaining. I don't care if that dialogue is masterfully clever(To me it is ridiculous). There are some cool scenes but they feel like teases in an otherwise bore fest. If the movie were entertaining and it wasn't all talking at a table, it would make up for the fact that it is a joke insult to good WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan. Unfortunately it is a boring joke. I wasted my money buying this movie outright. I don't undertsand why this movie was at all popular and I resent how I was mislead by bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, artsy, and in subtitles","review":"The film is mostly in French or German with subtitles (and reading them gets to be a chore REAL quickly). What's worse, Quentin Tarantino tries to go art noir with this film and (unlike in Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill) fails to pull it off. What's supposed to be new and artistic just comes off as weird and boring. Tarantino severely curtails the amount of action and gore that normally suffice for someone who just doesn't click with his quirky style of writing and directing. The movie was portrayed in advertisements as Tarantino turning the tables on history and having the movie be essentially a two hour gore-filled, splatterfest fantasy of Jews terrorising Nazies. We were lied to, and we want those two hours of our lives back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of Tarantino's best but still good","review":"I guess it's not noe of Tarantino's best films but still very entertaining and made in the classic Tarantino style.You'll like it if you like Tarantino's stuff. Warning: Very violent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iglourius Basterds should have been better","review":"While there were several very good performances in this movie and some memorable scenes overall the film was very slow and way too long. The movie is based on a fantasy and at times is so thoroughly unbelievable to the point that I felt like I was watching a cartoon spoof flick. The movie could have used an injection of humor, with the subject matter this would have been a much more enjoyable film if it hadn't taken itself so seriously. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the commander of the Jewish comandos was the only part of the movie that hinted at humor and it was unintentional. Looking back at all of the WW II movies over the last 50 years fictional or not this film rates fairly low in my book. That is a shame, it could have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"i love brad pitts character on here he is what made this movie great for me.this and pulp fiction i would have to say is tarantinos best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"If QT set out to make a movie where the Americans were just as disgusting and terrible as the Nazi's then he succeeded.

There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised, how bad","review":"The first chapter of the movie was well acted but it went down very fast in subsequent chapters.

Understand, this is his movie and with that comes an added, yet, to-be-expected, twist, or a unique point of view! I, myself, am a fan and loved this movie. If you liked Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and so on...you will like this. Love it? Not sure of, that's for you to find out. It's very entertaining and puts an interesting view on WWII, and a very likely plot. This movie is definitely worth watching AND purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge and Justice aptly portrayed","review":"Quentin Tarantino isn't high on my list of directors. I've always had a difficult time watching most of his films, losing myself somewhere in the gore and inaneness.Inglourious Basterds changed my perception of Tarantino as a director. I found the movie visually appealing and the story line believable. The Basterds brought to mind The Dirty Dozen on steroids with severe anger management issues but,as we all know, war is ugly.Tarantino film displays this ugliness with a talented ease that was both graphic and detailed. Pitt portrayal of LT. Aldo Raine, with his snide and cutting commentaries and his basic he** with the rules theories, is excellent. Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa made my skin crawl from his first appearance, stealthy and as cunning as a snake, all while he mentally examines his victims for weak spots.All and all, if you can handle the gore, this is a fantastic movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"We in the Nazi Killin' Business, and Business is a Boomin'","review":"This movie is defiantly worth spending some money on. The only 3 bad ideas about it is that if you have not seen a Quentin Tarantino movie it might be slightly awkward. Secondly, the movie is very gory, so viewer's discretion is advised. Finally, how the movie ends is not at all factual, which might bother historians. Other than that this movie is extremely funny, interesting, well performed, well shot, and a great story. The three cons about it are so minuscule, and should only be extra information about it, not a reason to pass up on the opportunity to watch the movie. In parts, the movie could have been better, but that is Quentin Tarantino's style, and besides, no movie is perfect. To even put it up to that standard means it must have been a great movie. In Summary, if you spend any money on movies, this should be at least one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino's made better.","review":"Let's start off by saying the picture and sound quality of this blu ray movie is pretty fantastic, not reference quality but it looks and sounds great.Without giving anything away, the movie is basically a fantasy vendetta film against the Nazis that requires some serious suspension of disbelief in the execution of a grand plan to assassinate Hitler and other Nazi VIPs. Regardless, I'm still looking for Tarantino to put something out that was as satisfying as Kill Bill: Vol 2 on the visual and story level. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this film, I wasn't able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm a dumb basterd","review":"The movie is a pointless, and often boring, fantasy. Much of the the acting is sub-par, except for the guy playing the brilliant/repulsive/charming SS officer. I realize many Tarantino fans found it \\"brilliant\\", but that assemsment escapes me. Now I DO like Tarantino's work, but when this one was over all I could think of is \\"THAT was it?\\".I guess I'm too dumb to \\"get it\\". But then again, I don't feel obliged to be that smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top movies","review":"I love everything about this movie. The drama, the humour, the fantasy, the bi and trilingual actors, everything. This is Quentin Tarantino's fantasy of how WWII would have gone down. It's not historically accurate in the slightest, but it sure is fun! Tarantino is such an enthusiastic director and gets so involved with his incredulous movies. I happen to appreciate that, but I know Tarantino's style isn't for everyone.This movie was fantastically done and Cristoph Waltz deserved the Oscar he won for his performance. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to be genuinely entertained and doesn't mind a little gore. For some who is not familiar with Quentin Tarantino's work, I think this serves as a great introduction to his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"The movie is alright, but just to mush damm subtitles. do way with that and you get a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inglorious waste of time.","review":"Frankly I found this film bad.

Even the slaying of Hitler wasn't that good.Oh sure they pumped him full of lead and then some more, I know he's Hitler, but he's barely portrayed as evil other than the fact that he's given the status of being Hitler.

She became the toast of the operatic world, of course, because of a performance of Lucia that is perhaps just days before this one. But I guess maybe she was sick here.

One of the chief reasons I purchase a Topo type map is because I am a Rockhound. A large portion of good minerals and rock formations are generally located at or near mines.

I assume they did this to save on printing costs. The maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had. For example,in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks, few of which are even named, and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included. Other than the newly added GPS coordiante data, they are just glorified road maps, which you can get at the gas station.

As an ornithologist she should have known that. It is also very irresponsible to write about it and have readers perhaps feed it to their birds too.I can't tell you how awful this is that someone who supposedly cares about the health of her bird CHOOSES to fead it a poisonous substance. Totally reprehensible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching memoir for all bird lovers","review":"From the books people write about their pets, you'd think only cats and dogs were worthy enough to be considered literary muses. But finally, a memoir about a woman and her bird that is enjoyable, informative, and moving. As I live with a cockatiel, it was refreshing to read about another person's experiences with a bird as a pet - although her title CLEARLY states that we don't really own them, they own us (so true!). I didn't read this to garner more \\"how to care for my bird\\" information, but just read this for pure pleasure and loved it. Burger's scientific/academic background certainly adds to her authorative voice but even more pressing, I thought, was her call to preserve the natural habitat in which these colorful, social birds live. I laughed AND cried. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"great, if you want to kill your parrot","review":"This woman is misleading thousands of readers as to what's acceptable in terms of rearing a parrot. She very often endangers her bird, everything from feeding it a poor diet to letting it chew on furniture (most have stains and sealants that can be toxic). I also see a lot of people voting these bad reviews down, which is fine, but realize that just because she \\"loved\\" her bird doesn't mean she did the right things for him. She sure left her other parrots in a rut fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfit to be a parrot owner","review":"Worthless and infuriating read. I got the feeling that the author wrote this book to be self serving. She seemed to care less for the bird and cared more about how much her bird needed her and depended on her, like she was getting some kind of a power and ego trip from it. She also does many incredibly wrong things, like letting her bird attack her husband, giving him onion, indulging in his nesting behavior, and many other no-no's when it comes to caring for a parrot.Another thing that struck me as incredibly odd and creepy was how she seemed to want to share a sexual relationship with her parrots, especially the first one. Do I have to emphasize how strange and creepy that is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Dysfunctional?","review":"This woman is an ornithologist and \\"behavior expert\\" on parrots. Yet she indulges in the worst possible parrot husbandry. Letting the bird attack her husband when he's trying to be intimate in their bedroom? Letting the bird lunge at her family/friends when they try to open the fridge? Indulging in and encouraging mate behavior? No wonder I had never heard of her among the respected avian academic and behaviorist community (Barbara Heidenreich, Dr Susan Friedman, Steve Martin). Do yourself a favor and read one of their books, not this self-indulgent, narcissistic memoir where Dr Burger seems intent on showing the readers how exclusive her bond is with Tiko (even to her husbands' detriment), and how vitally important she is to the bird. I wonder if she'd even WANT this bird to live a balanced life and have close relationships with other people? (I think not). Frankly, I think she should do some behavioral studies on herself and her own self-serving motivations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candid Review of The Parrott Who Owned Me","review":"I've read a lot of animal stories and enjoy them immensely. The antics, the friendships that develop over time are fun and fascinating. However, it's dissatisfying when an author misrepresents the story to be about the animal when it is really more about the author. And that is the case here. For example, more of the story about the parrot and author as a result of her contracting Lyme's Disease is about her research project and her condition than it is about how the Parrot related to her after she contracted the disease.So, if you're looking for a good animal story read, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one.","review":"I stumbled across this book at the public library.What a find!

It was a bit dry and I couldn't follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the birds want me....","review":"If you're looking for a book with amusing anecdotes about a talking parrot, I wouldn't recommend this book. This parrot does more biting than talking. The inspiration for writing the book appears to be the author's giddy delight that her parrot wants her for a mate, and I frankly could have been spared the details. I wasn't wild about a lot of the other \\"scientific\\" details the author felt compelled to share, either. For instance, she said her husband's pet cowbird \\"would peck vigorously at my foot or wrist, until I raised it to the appropriate position, whereupon he would hop on, wiggle his tail, and deposit a bit of semen.\\" The author also spends a lot of time talking about her career, which was of no interest to me. It's not the author's fault I was expecting a different kind of book, but I thought there might be others who would want to know a little more about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book hoping to read about a woman and her emotional connection to her amazon, since I have an amazon at home. Instead, I quickly became horrified at the behavior of this parrot and the dangerous behaviors he was allowed to pursue (chewing holes in furniture, chopping on onions and chocolate in the kitchen, free-flying through the house, etc). Its not fair to any parrot to encourage sexual behavior because no human can become a parrot mate. To allow a parrot to dominate a household in this manner is evidence of someone who does not truly understand how to train parrots to deal with our captive environment. I'm not sure now if I will even finish the book. If anything, this book is a how-not-to raise a parrot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was Shocked and Disappointed","review":"at how this woman allowed her parrot to do and eat anything he wanted. I kept asking my self, doesn't this woman know that chocolate is poison for her parrot? Hasn't she read anything about caring for a parrot? I considered taking the book back for a refund but decided to throw the book in the garbage. I would rather waste my money than have one more book in the book store which shows such little regard for caring properly for parrots. I think this author should spend a little more time reading about how to properly care for parrots before writting a book about them. I can only hope and pray,for the sake of all parrots, this book does not influence other readers to care for their parrots in the same way this woman does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bird book for the uninitiated!","review":"\\"The Parrot Who Owns Me\\" provides a great way to learn more about birds without having to wade through dense, scientific terminology and obtuse, technical arguments.

The author examines almost every aspect of prayer life. I must say this is not a book one would choose for light reading. It is well written, and Fr. Dubay has a no-nonsense type of writing style which is easy to digest. This book can transform one's prayer life if read in the proper light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent Book on Bringing One in Union with God","review":"St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross are the Saints to study in contemplative prayer life. They were dynamic people who loved everyone and were very well known, yet in complete union with God, through silent prayer. None of this \\"New Age\\" chant, mantra type- \\"buy the CD\\" and \\"follow the wave\\" kind of meditation, but real, deep union with God. They shouldered their sufferings and didn't complain incessantly to everyone they knew, they didn't try to lessen it, they united their sufferings to the Cross and offered it up.This book gives the real deal of trying to outline and describe the journey they made to God. For anyone who wants to walk the narrow path to God, this is the book to read. One may recognize where they are along the way... beginner, intermediate... the mansions of Teresa are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire My Life With Your Love","review":"That could have also been the title of this book. If you seek a more spiritual yet practical guide to prayer that takes you to much higher levels, then the journey in this book will interest you.

John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila to those of the Gospel regarding prayer.The reason I gave only 4 stars is that this book, for me, is an outline and a synthesis guide. I would recommend to anybody on the spiritual journey reading Teresa of Avila and Therese of Liseux, and for the more knowledgable ones, Catherine of Sienna and John of the Cross. Although it contains much of the same information as in the primary sources, there is uncomparable value in reading them straight from text of the saints.One other thing, Fr. Dubay tends to use many examples. It can get repetitive at times if you already understand the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand ...","review":"I felt that this book is not for the average reader. I found it very difficult to understand. If you are looking for a book to help you understand contemporative prayer ... this isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed but intensely non-ecumenical","review":"Despite the author's claims that the book isn't intended to be a polemic, it starts off with a curt, even scolding tone that never lets up.Exploration of the spirituality of Teresa in particular is overshadowed by the author's condemnation of spiritual leaders within the Catholic Church who in his opinion misrepresent or fail to promote contemplative prayer, and he never passes up an opportunity to denigrate Eastern meditation approaches and practices - what he calls \\"oriental\\" versus \\"occidental\\" - from his intensely Catholic Fundamentalist perspective. This is a great disservice to these inspirational saints whose influence reaches so far beyond one church.If you're looking for a more balanced and universal treatment of the mysticism of St. John of the Cross, I recommend Thomas Merton's \\"Counsels of Light and Love of St. John of the Cross\\" instead. I'm sure there are much books on St. Teresa's spiritual legacy as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friar Dubay a zealot in philosophers' robes","review":"This is a dogmatic and tedious read for an educated person. Although, I am all for prayer, however, Dubay should stick to what he knows and stop shooting his mouth off about what he knows little of. He disparging comments on other faiths and philosophies without thorough education in their doctrines is shameful for a man of his position and shows embassingly his ignorance of such matters. It amazes me that he still hasn't figured out that there is no self-denial in detachment.

We like them better than the gummie type because they don't seem to get stuck between there teeth. After much research we felt these Kid Vits are natural enough to give our kids at a young age.

I'd like to read more and more and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Blood Work\\": A Marvelous \\"Can't Put It Down\\" Read","review":"Michael Connelly's newest is a terrific read, with an intricate plot, compelling and complicatec characters, and a driving narrative that makes it difficult to put down. He is particularly good at creating a sense of moral claustrophobia, as the story's protagonist, Terry McCaleb, finds himself driven to find the truth, even if it is a horrifying truth that will shock the reader. In his Harry Bosch novels and his other works, Connelly is creating an indelible portrait not only of Los Angeles, but also of men and women struggling to assert their humanity in a world of often horrible reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE MICHAEL CONNOLLY WE KNOW","review":"What a disappointment following on from The Poet and Trunk Music. This has to be Connolly's least effective novel yet. It lacks the atmosphere and suspense of previous novels and the conclusion seems fabricated and rushed, giving an overall impression of an overrated read from a more capable author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick another MC's book","review":"MC can write awfully better than this. I bought this book because I wanted to relax and read a good thriller and I got uneasy and bored. The main story is OK if and only if you can find it along its pages. The story has overly loopholes that it could be a strainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense, a little far fetched","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, my first by author Connelly. My only gripe is strictly on myself: I saw the movie several times prior to reading the book. I'm a big Eastwood fan. Not to give anything away, but there are plot details that differ significantly, and I had a hard time keeping the two separate.The book is much better. The plot may strain credibility at times but not in comparison to the movie. For the procedural, investigation genre, this novel works. Some of the plot twists are unlikely if not inconceivable, though. The characters are rich and completely engaging. The character development, at least with regard to the major characters, is superior. Its not the best thriller I've read, but if you find it too tedious, you're jaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Connnelly","review":"I just could not put this book down.

I had a few minor comments I thought I would pass along. 1. I think this may be the second Connelly novel in which \\"defuse\\" and \\"diffuse\\" have been confused. 2. As far as I know, the penalty under California's \\"three strikes\\" law is not life without possibility of parole, but an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. And 3, in reality McCaleb would have made a mistake in ostentatiously locking the door while questioning Bolotov, as that may have resulted in \\"custodial interrogation\\" and a requirement of a \\"MIRANDA\\" warning before any statements could be used. Those quibbles aside, it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie -- a well woven story","review":"I saw the movie before reading the book, but this didn't spoil the book for me. The two differ enough, and, as is often the case, the book is better. I lost myself in the reading as I followed the twists and turns. I couldn't wait to finish, but when I finished, I wished I had more to read.The characters and the plot are very well developed. Factual information about medicine, law enforcement, ... provide additional interest without slowing the story. The ending isn't disappointing, but it may not feel right to you. Endings are hard.This is a mystery with action, suspense and love. This read is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is my first Connelly book I have read. I loved this one.

Full of suspense and twists that were unexpected. Loved McCaleb & Graciela. I've enjoyed all of the Michael Connelly books I've read. Harry Bosch is my favorite Connelly character, and even though he wasn't in this book I have to say the mystery in this one was my favorite. (I have a vague feeling that McCaleb & Graciela, however, were minor characters in a Bosch book.)So I rented the movie but it was a waste of time...Clint was boring, the plot was filled with major changes, many of which were unnecessary and ruined the flow of the story, and there was no chemistry whatsoever between the leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Connelly is a master of the police procedural.

This one is just boring and the Terry McCaleb character makes me want to run and find Harry. Ugh, is this Terry guy scanctimonious and enough to make me gag!

We began this novel as an audio CD, while traveling cross country, enjoying the voice of our favorite award winning narrator, Dick Hill. The story line was so suspenseful that on occasion we read the book aloud to each other when not in the car so that we could both find out what happened next while progressing simultaneously through the exciting adventure. We loved \\"Blood Work,\\" and look forward to reading more of Connelly's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart thriller","review":"This was my first Connelly novel and I wasn't disappointed. I noticed that there was a movie but decided to read the book first.The plot is clever and the book well written. It's quite hard to put down after the first couple of pages.I like to keep an open mind when reading a book, perhaps you can say an emtpy mind, but I figured out where the story was going almost immediately. Still, I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either.Michael Connelly is definitely an author I will read more off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller","review":"This book is as good as James Siegel, Dean Koontz and other leading author serial killer novels. An ex-FBI homicide profiler recovering from a heart transplant is convinced by an attractive woman to find the killer of her sister, her sister she informs him was also the donor of his new heart. The connections the detective discovers as well as the killer's motives are brilliant ideas by Michael Connelly.If you like thriller serial killer/detective novels then you have to read this one.

The motive for the killing was headed in a direction that could have been very interesting. However, once you learn the real motive, your left wondering why Connelly thinks it is even interesting because its really not. It seems Connelly thinks his detective is too important not to make him part of the story. Very disappointed in the end. Since this is the first Connelly i have read, i will think seriously before i pick up another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Good Work","review":"Great character, great story-line.

It has a great setup with a bunch of great twists in it. I know it made me use my brain quite a bit, trying to figure out how everything was going to fit together in the end.My only problem is that the title 'Blood Work' makes you think it's suspenful. It's not. At no point did I feel there was any danger for the main characters, or any character. If you start reading this book, start knowing that the only thing motivating you to turn the pages is the fact that you want to know how the ex-fbi man solves the case, not because you have to know what happens to the people in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book by mc","review":"this is another assured, interesting and enjoyable book by Michael Connelly. It's original (very, really), well written, and Terry McCaleb is a good, likeable lead character. Connelly developes the characters subtle relationships well in this book, the plot of which is incredibly original, and i have read almost nothing like it before. Fans of Connelly will like it, and so should all not-yet-fans of Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOODY GOOD","review":"This is one of my favorite books I've read recently. Connelly delivers a remarkable plot and character in Terry McCabe. The plot is thick, but plausible and inventive. The identity of the killer in this one took me by surprise, although the evidence is there all along. Terry's relationship with Gabriela, is very different and I felt Terry's predicament. Terry is no super-human, that's for sure. Also liked his relationship with Buddy Lockridge, who becomes his \\"driver,\\" but still wants to be a real detective, too. A great read, and filled with tense moments and some marvelous dialogue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had me to the end, but let me down a little!","review":"I've read all of Connelly's work. I always enjoy the plots that he spins, but find he traps himself in the end. This one was no exception, the twist of the killer wanting to knock off people for their organs was original -- having it all hark back to another case, wasn't. I would rather have seen him finish off in the direction that he started instead of the villain being someone our hero never caught. Oh well, still worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue, suspense.............","review":"Michael Connelly has created a tremendous story that is full of intrigue, suspense and surprises!! A young woman has died, her heart goes to save Terry McCaleb and her sister appears on his boat to ask for his help in finding out about the murder. Connelly has, as always, created interesting characters and even more interesting possibilities. Who can you trust, who do you really know and who will be willing to trust you when evidence points to a murder and the person with the most obvious thing to gain is the only person that appears to be investigating the crime! This is a novel that grabs the reader and holds your attention to the last detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good crime story","review":"This is an above average crime thriller. It does not have the nail biting suspense of some thriller, but the plot grabs you and keeps you wanting to find out who the villian is. I have not seen the movie, but it seems like an ideal role for Clint Eastwood. I have read a couple of Connelly's Harry Bosch novel and I like his style. This is an enjoyable read for any crime/suspense fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Lovely Music","review":"Hindemith is known primarily as an instrumental and orchestral composer. This is a bit unfair as he composed a terrific oratorio based on Walt Whitman's Civil War poetry and ambitious but rarely performed operas. On this CD are some of his shorter and less complex vocal works composed for a capella choir. I suspect some listeners will be surprised by the music. These pieces are relatively straightforward and are not as demanding or dissonant as some of Hindemith's other music. These pieces, particularly the Six Chansons, are lovely and feature very accessible and really interesting music. They are informed by his study of Early Music but are hardly slavish imitations of early music. The performances are very good. Recommended strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but better performances exist...","review":"As a side note to the previous reviewer...the performances of the Six Chansons on this recording are indeed good...but even better performances (IMHO) of these exist on the recordings by Uwe Gronostay conducting the Netherlands Chamber Choir (Globe - #5125), and simply titled \\"Hindemith: Choral Works\\" here on Amazon. Of course, real Hindemith choral fans will want both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found at last on record: Six Chansons","review":"The Six Chansons of Paul Hindemith are stunningly beautiful and, since they're in French (on poems of Rainer Maria Rilke), they're naturally brief. But this is perhaps the only recording of the chansons in existence (or at least the first I've found in six years of searching).The performance by the radio broadcast choir of Berlin is good sounding and well-pitched. Lacking only slightly is a polish to the sound engineering as well as the ensemble entrances. Some articulations in the Chansons need to be crisp and delicate and a few of these are admittedly not perfect.However, it is truly a blessing to finally have them on record. If you are unfamiliar with the Six Chansons, even if you're not a Hindemith fan, please give them a listen. Although only 8 minutes in total, they deliver complete release to your senses for that brief period... Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heroes Journey; Joseph Campbell his life and work.","review":"I have read parts of this book in a class situation.

Mr. Piazza did a wonderful job of taking me back in my memories of a city that is so rich in culture, history, and cuisine. He describes the real New Orleans and not the city that is usually portrayed by the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of New Orleans culture","review":"Tom Piazza shares his love and fascination with New Orleans in a concise, easy-to-read format, mostly free of self-centered annecdotes. His descriptions, observations and comentaries are respectful, affectionate, and realistic. He is \\"outsider\\" enough to be objective, and citizen enough to know his subject intimately. This is not another testimony of Katrina, though Katrina is described and its effects discussed; but the treatment of New Orelans is much broader than just this catastrophy. I was happy and satisfied to have Tom Piazza share his love and enthusiasm for New Orleans with me. I read it quickly and enthusiastically. It's a great little book for those many of us who can never get enough of New Orleans."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love (or want to love) America (not just N.O.) READ THIS BOOK","review":"Tom Piazza very compelling makes the point that if we allow New Orleans to die -- and her survival is no sure thing, even as the anniversary of the hurricane approaches -- we have allowed America to destroy through incompetence something precious and irreplaceable.In part 1 he evokes the New Orleans residents and tourists love -- if you've ever been there, you'll enjoy the parade of places, events, names you'll recognize.That good feeling sets you up for Part 2, just as the residents of New Orleans were set up for disaster when Katrina hit.As Part 2 unfolds Piazza achieves a feat I have never seen another author do so well. He MAKES you feel what it was like to be a New Orleans evacuee, returning to find what happened to your home.READ THIS BOOK... and expect to be changed by it.Sarah White"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political points are inappropriate","review":"Mr. Piazza does a good job in the first half of the book describing a few points of New Orleans culture that are unique to this wonderful city. However, he totally blows it by making his own political points in the second half of the book. He attempts to turn this disaster into a black/white issue by implying that the storm really only affected poor blacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nature knows no race. This storm touched every New Orleanian in some tremendous way. Those that think they can determine whom was affected most ignore the psychological toll that this storm took on EVERY individual in this region. Turning a natural disaster of this magnitude into a racial issue, as Mr. Piazza does, is an insult to the entire city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and derivative","review":"Extremely disappointing. This is one of the most boring little books ever written. If you are from New Orleans, you already know about local po-boy shops and the Mardi Gras Indians, etc. If you're not, Piazza doesn't do a good enough job explaining the background of New Orleans customs and cultures. It's all bread pudding and no reality of Hurricane Katrina. This is such a short little book it shouldn't even have been published except perhaps in a local magazine. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Important Book.","review":"In the wake of hurricane Katrina New Orleans faces losing a lot that has made this city a great and unique American city. This book hits the high points concernig why New Orleans matters and needs to be salvaged. I have lived here for 27 of my 57 years and frankly don't want to live anywhere else. The city charmrd me with it's culture, history, love of food, festiveness, and most of all just plain uniqueness.

There's a bit of an implicit message but not one so deep that a teenager who reads for pleasure couldn't find it. The imagery was amazing, I felt like i was there, it was so realistic. Also, I liked how Brain James was not one to preach to his audience about the 'dangers of drugs' and the whole 'just say no' thing. Drugs are bad, it's a proven fact, but this book lets us see why and how they got that association.

This in the internet age. When you purchase something online, you should get your order or a response as to why you haven't. What poor and total lack of customer service. Don't purchase anything from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Bad Vendor","review":"Pads that I was shipped were yellow, according to the vendor these \\"the highest quality pads on the market\\". Well my puppy saturates these pads while the two other brands I purchased from Petsmart had no problem handling her tinkles. The pads were also loosely thrown into the box, making it very unclear if all 100 were even in there. Don't buy from this vendor or these pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing deal","review":"The case is great. While it is small and there is not room for more than one tape, it is not bulky and in the way and protects the camera great. And the leather is wonderful. Very durable and looks good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit...has belt loop which is what I wanted","review":"It's made of nice leather and is specifically tailored for the Canon camera. For me the clincher was having a belt loop which allows me to get it out of the way and always have it at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept...","review":"I bought this thing because I needed a set of battery-powered speakers for my mp3 player, and I thought it'd be awesome to have it hold my Mountain Dew too. However, the cooler is not very good, in that it's not solid and if it's not full, it topples over or folds in on itself. And the speakers only worked for about 2 hours before dying, and the antenna broke off when someone touched it lightly. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetative","review":"I agree with Shawna; the lyrics are a bit lame. They just keep repeating themselves. The songs get old real fast. I had really wanted to like this CD, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I thought the songs were very amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen isn't good without No Doubt","review":"Her voice is off-key, her cheesy music videos. I give it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why No Doubt started going down the flusher...","review":"The most recent No Doubt CD's were tolerable at best. The 80s influence on Rock Steady was starting to peak in...Gwen Stefani needs to stay with ska...or rock. Instead, she decided to make this poppy, crappy album. It's painful to listen to. Some of the songs are catchy, but not in a good way. They're catchy like Britney Spears...you want to stab yourself in the head with a spoon for humming them. I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad...But Not Good","review":"This CD was not as bad or as good as most of the reviewers thought. It is just plain mediocre! OK Gwen, you've proved that you are the media darling in No Doubt - but you need the guys. Gwen Stefani is not a terrific singer, but she kicks ass with No Doubt. Her personal style is cool, and she out rocks all of the Britneys and Christinas, but this CD makes me miss the \\"old band\\". When I listen to LAMB's songs, I long for the mid nineties, when Tragic Kingdom was on top of the world. \\"Whatcha Waitin For\\"? The next No Doubt album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she serious?","review":"I have been listening to No Doubt since I was about 12 years old, I am 20 now. I loved them, they were a great ska band. When I bought this cd I thought that it would sound similar to the single, \\"What are you waiting for.\\" Let me tell you, it's nothing like that. This has to be the most disappointing cd I have ever bought.When Gwen did that song with Moby it was great, and all the songs she did with Sublime were great too... when she did that song with Eve I knew she was headed down the wrong path. Now she comes out with a cd that sound like R&B;, Uhg, it's horrible. If you are thinking the CD is going to be anything like no doubt, or her single \\"what are you waiting for\\" please listen to the demos before wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwens solo album, not so good","review":"As a big fan of No Doubt and Gwen Stefani, I was excited to hear about the relase of Gwens solo album. Not a big fan of pop music, I really thought the single \\"what you waiting for\\", was the catchy up beat funky sound that would follow through out this album. I was wrong. This album is a mish mash of music styles that dont really compliment Gwens talent. This album is a really bad attemp in recapturing 80's pop. Although, I was blown away by the song \\"rich girl\\" ,A very awesome collaboration with Eve, this rest of this album falls short of anything worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first solo outing!","review":"I have always been a fan of No Doubt's radio songs and was a bit skeptical when Gwen decided to step out on her own (I had the simular feeling with Dave Matthews). But I am happy to say this is a good album. I am not, until late, a big fan of dance music but I do like this CD. I heard it once and several of the songs are \\"catchy\\" and I caught myself tapping my foot to the beats and singing some of the lyrics. My favorite song is \\"Serious.\\"It is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars Might Be Generous","review":"I really wanted to like this. I love Gwen Stefani's voice. She's hip, fresh & talented. So I thought until I listened to this.There are only a few salvagable songs. These include: What You Waiting For?, Rich Girl (includes samples), Luxurious( sample included) & Harajuku Girls. The latter is silly wierd & fun.The rest of the songs are terrible. The retro 80's songs are bland rejects form probably one hit wonders of the that time.The album, as a whole, is unoriginal as noted above with the sampling that occurs on the record. Gwen at times mumbles so much you think you're listening to Britney Spears or Janet Jackson. I expected much better from her.She should stick to NO DOUBT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care for it.","review":"I don't let my child hear gwen stefani.and I don't like her songs.like....''what you waiting for?''.the words are bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every few years an album comes along....","review":"It's not every day that an singer offers an album filled with one strong track after another. The mixed-up genres, catchy beats and crazy hooks in Gwen Stefani's songs make this one of the most neatest albums of the 2000's. Although we've all heard \\"What You Waiting For\\" and \\"Rich Girl,\\" the real gems can be found in the funky \\"Harajuku Girls,\\" \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" and FANTASTIC \\"Serious.\\" \\"Serious\\" easily falls in to the same category of memorable as \\"I Will Survive\\" or \\"Summer Wine.\\" The early-Madonna comparisons are understandable, but this album makes it clear that Gwen Stefani is a ground breaking artist in her own right. Not many have managed to combine electronica, hip hop, 80's pop and dance, and provided us with an album we'll be playing for a very long time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a fan of Music,","review":"From a musical standpoint, and a honest one, this album has two good tracks. The simply amazing \\"What You Waiting For?\\" and one hook wonder \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\". The rest is pure, how do I say, boring? Unlistenable? Annoying? The record is rushed and unfortunate. I respect Gwen, but c'mon, dont lie to yourselves, this is purely a bad record, save two tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying (too) hard to be ???","review":"Hey we all know Gwen Stefani cool. But to the point: What U waiting for is cool,with some crunchy guitar samples treatment like Eno might do. A couple of tracks that sound just like 80's MAdonna or PRince are enoyable. But the slut disco rap songs about limos (or whatever) are dumb, and \\"Bubble Pop electric\\" is the most annoying thing ever. If you want snotty smart J-pop influenced punky pop tunes checkout Le Tigre instead.Gwen already has enough sycophants, Im sure ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Ok so I did expect this to be a partial remnant of No Doubt, and I love Gwen, she is amazing in all possible ways. I heard the fist single off the album (what you waiting for) and I thought yea this album will be awesome. NO. I did not like it, not my taste at all; still love Gwen, but a disappointment indeed. The album title is a bit unfitting of her too, I think that if you are looking for bad R&B meets the 80's, then this will be a great record for you, other wise if you are looking for some good Gwen vibe, don't look there."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute mess...both musically & lyrically","review":"This could have been so much better. When I heard the first single I was thrilled. However the album is a completely different story. Gwen said that this is her 80s tribute dance album. Well, she sure did a tribute to the 80s dance scene. In this disc she pays homage to every uninspired 80s dance tune out there. It's a disc full of those \\"other\\" songs on an album that you never listen to. Despite the talented producers they seem to contribute only their worst stuff. I wanted to like it, really I did but even after repeated listens I still shake my head in disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Groovy!","review":"The first three songs on this disc rock! The song produced by New Order is outstanding. In fact, I would give a thumbs up to the entire CD. It will keep you bouncing in your car. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't quite get the Japanese obsession.....","review":"I never really much cared for No Doubt(except Hella Good and It's My Life, which were unlike most of their other radio hits), but I was instantly hooked when I saw Gwen perform the first two singles from this album on Saturday Night Live. I really enjoy the diversity from song to song, 80s dance, new wave, hip hop; and how young this CD makes me feel again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should give it 0 stars...","review":"i hate gwen steffani...i never liked her either. her songd (to me) stink! hollaback girl, and all the other crappady pooh she writes stinks...i do not recommend this poop."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 days no CD !","review":"ITS been about a month and no delivery,when i contacted the seller he told me a couple more days are you kidding me,he didnt give me no info to track the item nor a date of arrival,something fishy going on here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Roch Girl from \\"fiddler on the roof\\"???","review":"WTF, why would you steal a song from an old play that sucked in the first place. I can't believe she made that song sound even more horrible. Do everybody a favor and stop making us listen to your crap. If the rest of your CD is as HORRIBLE as the stolen RICH GIRL I wouldn't expect to sell any coppies. You might even be as bad as J LO it's hard to say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollaback my butt!","review":"I do not like Gwen Stefani or No Doubt.I do not like the lyrics in the song,I am not your fan!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt It Falls Short","review":"The first 2 songs are this CD are great. The rest are terrible. I think if you're a No Doubt fan who loved nearly every song on their last CD, you will be even further disappointed in this one.It starts out creative and interesting, and then it's like she ran out of things to say / tried to hard / or something.My advise, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a star","review":"\\"Hollaback Girl\\" is seriously one of the worst songs I have ever heard. Gwen Stefani is just another pop artist who sings stuff other people give to her, and she is not even that talented! Who does that sound like ...cough...britney...cough...spare yourself from this horrible piece of crap! Switch the station when one of her songs come on the radio! that is how awfully horrible this is! Now if your looking at this item right now, you probably like her music. Go ahead and give me unhelpful votes. I don't care. Considering you like the pop genre, I would sooner buy the backstreet boys new cd than this. If you really want something good buy some hard rock like guns n roses greatest hits or a stone temple pilots cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm not sure I even have words for how disappointed I am in this CD. I wish I hadn't bought it...There are about 3 tunes on it that are even remotely worth listening to. VERY unexpected. The rest of the songs are basically some variation of the same lyrics (over and over and over)with different music as well as ads for her clothing line... It feels like a not-so-subliminal message most of the time. Plus, I guess I just don't know enough about Japanese fashion. She mentions it about every third line in almost every tune. Not at all sure what that's about but I hope it's better than this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first song is the only good one...","review":"I was so excited for this album to come out... Now I wish I knew WHY. The first track, her first released song from this album, is great. The rest just bites. Seriously. If you liked No Doubt's last album, you will not like this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear God","review":"Gwen, I like you. I really do. and I love no doubt, but why why why did you do this to yourself?! I even love the 80s... what with VH1 and all, how can you not? But this CD is a mess. There are a few songs that I have found I can listen to, but most of them are just... I dunno. Everyone has their own opinion, but in my opinion this was a selfless plug for your clothing line (as it is mentioned in many songs). It could have been better Gwen!Gwen + No Doubt = good80s music = goodGwen + 80s music = train wreck squared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like.....","review":"I honestly really miss No Doubt. I think the new solo stuff is aimed for the younger crowd. I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this but the song \\"Harajuku Girls\\" sort of has a Lords of Acid sound to it, no?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna did this years ago","review":"Except Madonna was flawless when she did this kind of music. Gwen just cant pull it off. Please go back to No Doubt! If you want real pop music get any of Madonna's albums from the 80s or her new album which is AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD!!","review":"What the hell are those Japanese girls???The lyrics are shallow, Gwen looks dumb and music are annoying.I'm really embarrassed to say I used to like No Doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better not waste your money for buying this kinda sheit!","review":"Gwen shouldn't have never tried solo career, knowing it sounds and looks like this. Hollaback girl used to be listenable on it's couple of first times, but now, it seems to be the most annoying song (if it even can be called a song) ever made. She can't just do anything lasting or original (with copying Madonna) and that's the fact.Next time Gwen should try to do the Aguileras and get little bit diRRtier than we saw in that hollaback girl-video, get these Harajuku girls naked too, then she maybe would deserve more than just one star. :D Sarcasm :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's not even funny","review":"If I hear that stupid Holla back girl on the radio one more time I think I'm going to chop my ears off, this has to be one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life, It has to be a joke , because if it's not Gwen is retarded. It says the same thing over a nd over and over again. This is the worst no talent piece of garbage album ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry gwen, you cannot be hip hop","review":"Face it, when you heard Gwen was going solo, you knew the album was going to tank. Then watcha waiting for got some play and you thought maybe, just maybe the girl can do it, maybe she knows she is not queen latifa and all will be well. Nope. I took a chance, bought the album, and now i feel like a stupid ho.If you are a fan of ska, pop-alternative, no doubt style music then this album by the former queen of the genre is a literal heart breaker. We hoped it was a fad when she dueted with eve the first time. We forgave her for hey baby. but this is truly the straw that broke the camel's back.This album sounds like some white orange county girl who has the notion that she can make hip hop. Funny, that is exactly what happened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just a small note..","review":"One - this album is a piece of crap.Two - Rich Girl is a cover of a reggae/pop cover of the Fiddler on the Roof song. It's just annoying me because people are saying 'why would she cover Fiddler on the roof?\\" and she didn't. She covered a bad reggae cover of fiddler on the roof. (which, actually, is even worse)\\"if i was a rich girl, yeah i'd have all the money in the world, if i was a wealthy giiiirl\\". Look it up. Maybe you guys are too young to rememeber it. *shrugs* early 90's bad reggae.And seriously, rapping? Honey if it didn't work for Blondie what the hell makes you think it would work for you? You're not even in her league and even she couldn't pull it off. I'd say go beg No Doubt to take her back and make another album, but that'd be horrid too. Never been a fan. I prefer real ska.This whole album is an ad for her clothing line. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment!","review":"who is this girl? this is not the same tomboy/dorky Gwen i know in a band called No Doubt. her image has totally changed and i dont like it. she cares too much of what people think of her now. with no doubt all their songs were deep in meaning and actually meant something! this **** is bananas. i could have wrote that!! no offense to gwen or anything, i luv her 2 death and im the hugest fan of no doubt but i cant accept her new pop sound. it just blends in with all the other artists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's NO Doubt that Gwen should go back to her band","review":"I really liked Gwen as No Doubt's frontwoman and was looking forward to her solo effort. However, once I heard that song, Hollaback Girl, I changed my mind. The lyrics are retarded (at least what words I can understand) and too pop-ish for my tastes. I haven't heard the whole album, because after her last three released singles, I have no interest. Go back to your band, Gwen! Your songs are headed in a dangerously Simpsonesque direction, although your voice is still far better than they could ever hope to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"what has gwen done?","review":"the only okay song is whatchu waiting for though that gets annoying and repetitive, same with hollaback girl it just recycles 80's music like the rest of this album. Thanks gwen, you've just lost every bit of credibility and success you've built with no doubt. I can only hope that this album was made just to get her childish girly side out and that she gets her common sense back and makes another brilliant album with her band. I hope no doubt's sales don't go down just because of the mess she put out with this album. Just listen to return of saturn, that stuff is so much better than this garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking","review":"I have been listening to this awful cd for 3 days, just to give it a chance.Sadly, It is by far the worst CD In my collection. Moreover, everything she has worked for in the past decade has gone down. She's a singer not a rapper, stop talking on your records and stop plugging designers and your own line [...]. The only 2 somewhat ok songs are the 2 singles, currently being played on the radio. Friends that have the CD and myself are very dissapointed (and we are all girls!!!); over arranged and over produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the *&^$ is this?","review":"I absolutely adore Gwen Stefani. She is an icon in many ways, but this is possibly one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It is not even worth giving to charity. Definitely a waste of money. All of these songs are terrible! It is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know.....she's really changed","review":"And it ain't for the better!!! She used to be a sweet, shy, quiet normal girl-and maybe thats still da case, but that aint how she's coming off in her music, which portrays her as a stupid, juvenile, egotistical, Japan-obsessed little girl-who can't make halfway decent music to save her life. God,[...]!!!!! Every song is so annoying (cept of course the smash debut single), you will just want to rip your ears off. It's noise. Not music. And yes, even metalhead teens would agree to this. And don't even get me started on \\"Long Way To Go\\" UUUGGGH, yes, Gwen, you proved that you do indeed have a long way to go before you can do jack s*** solo. As Timothy Brough masterfully stated, a true statement that could be made about this album would be if Gwen were to just come out, hold up the CD and admit, [...] Because that's all this is. Her worthless, nasty, [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Just like Madonna!

But on this album, she seems to be pushing the point that she's wealthy and has everything. That's fabulous for her! She's a great talent and deserves what she's got. But please, does she really have to tell us all about her blingbling in 2/3rds of the tracks?Beyond the display of ego, I was able to tune out the tracks in the last half of the album. Meaning, that they weren't as annoying and grating as \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and \\"Rich Girl.\\" \\"Hollaback Girl\\" is definately hip hop, but not in a good way. The song doesn't make much sense, and just seems a carrier to be able to say \\"this my sh*t\\" over and over again in an urban-like accent. She sounds ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointed","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Gwen Stefani, but I was sadly disappointed with her new album. She has such a great voice and a lot of talent, and I don't feel she fully utilized her capacities. Another problem I have as a No Doubt fan is that at least half the album is R&B/Hip Hop influenced. I hate that genre of music. I absolutely love \\"What You Waiting For?\\" and cannot listen to it enough. I bought the album, expecting at least most of the other songs would be along the same lines as her first single--upbeat, dance-type music. I guess it might be a good album for those who like R&B/Hip Hop type stuff. I hope Gwen decides to lean more towards her old style and/or more dance music in her next album. She has a GREAT singing voice...not so much a good rap voice. I want the old Gwen back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Gwen?!?!","review":"Man, I am so disappointed in this first solo project by Gwen. I love this girl...well, the girl from No Doubt anyways. This must be one artist that is greatly influenced by her producers since it certainly doesn't sound like the kind of things Gwen sings about in No Doubt. She writes a lot of the material in No Doubt so I just wonder about this new cd. Also, it is explicit in a lot areas...I think a warning label would be most appropriate so that people can be aware of what they are buying. Overall, I can see why there are so many used copies being sold here on Amazon. I hope Gwen does another solo project that reflects more of the artist I have known in the past..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree Gwen does reinvent her self","review":"I bought this album after I heard the first two singles \\"Rich Girl\\" and \\"What are you waiting for.\\" Which I did like both of them. Then her powerful pop anthem \\"Hollaback Girl\\" boosted the sales of this great album \\"Hollaback Girl\\" did hit #1 of the billboard charts. The singles arn't the only good songs on the album \\"Cool\\" is a great slow song which I heard is becoming a single soon, but The song \\"Bubble Gum Electric\\" gives u the spark to get up and get moving. I also like the songs \\"Luxiourous\\" and \\"Crash.\\" This album would be money well spent"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG directi0n....completely","review":"The problem with this cd is not the lack of skill but the lack of direction. The best song on here is not 1, 2, or 3. altough saying that the sh*t is bananas is genius (*rolls eyes sarcasticly) The best song on the album is the urban sounding track 7!! this is a great sound for the music and her voice styles. She should definitely learn from that track and go from there in her future!!!

This is the first ((and hopefully the last)) solo cd from Gwen Stefani. I wonder why she gave up No Doubt. Was it to look like an idiot, making horrible pop? I really think that only the tweens who still listen to Radio Disney like this trash. The only three songs that are somewhat good are \\"Cool\\", \\"Rich Girl\\", and \\"Long Way to Go\\".

Buy those mp3's if you must but DON'T buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst cd ever","review":"I was immediately a No Doubt fan since the first time I heard them in 1992 or '93, so when this CD came out I snatched it up, eager to see what Gwen would do solo. I am embarassed to own this CD. It is horrible. The lyrics are laughable at best and detract from any enjoyment of the songs. The first two tracts are the best of the lot, but you can hear them on the radio, so save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt about it, Gwen Stefani has made it to the top!","review":"This CD is one of the best of the year, every song on the CD has it's own unique feel and sounds amazing. The first track, What You Waiting For?, is so fun and amazing, and the perfect first single for this album. Track 2 is Rich Girl, a very cool song featuring Eve, this song will probably be a single, and will do very well. Track 5 is Bubble Pop Electric, one of the best tracks of the album, it's very fun and unique. The mention of the Harajuku girls in a lot of the songs is kind of funny, and strange, but a nice addition, as is the song itself. Track 12 is a wonderful song performed by both Gwen and Andre\` 3000 (Outkast), it's about a black and white couple, and how socioty has a long way to go in it's discrimination against inter-racial couples."},{"rating":"1","title":"wack!!","review":"This cd is not worth buying.It has wack beats she talks about stupid stuf and does not make sense at all!So dont buy it becouse it is defenetly worth $14.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn, About, Music, Biatch is what it should be called...","review":"This CD is as pretentious as it is HORRIBLE, I'm embarrased for her. How is it that a decent vocalist like Britney Soears is badgered for her voice when Gwen manages to sound like Britney on helium with a more annoying whine? As a huge fan of No Doubt I was anticipatign this CD. Apparently the boys behind the girl are where the talent lies in that band. I wonder if Gavin Rossdale can even stomach this crap. It sounds liek a horrible 80's cd? What is with trying to bring that \\"sound\\" back. WASTE OF MONEY and not even worth downlaoding illegally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm A Fool to buy this one!!","review":"This Cd is a disappointment to me,as it sounds too commerical to my ears.I think the song Rich Girl is a rip off of Fiddler on The Roof Rich Man.

The only count on this CD I like is COOL because of it up tempo no Doubt beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful!","review":"Gwen Stefani's fist solo album is so hideous and tripe. Her voice is flat and lifeless, her songwriting is getting worse with every song, she has no talent so why the hell is she is so freakin' popular.

Terrible, terrible record, I heard she is gonna make a second solo album, well good luck Stefani. Her No Doubt bandmates had all the talent, so go flying back to them.

I think in general people like to overrate in order not to dissapoint people. Well this was certainly a big dissapointment, especially after the single, which i did like. No doubt is one of the bands in the pop-genre i still like, which is rare (Although it's not 100% pop). Therefore the dissapointment might even be greater after hearing this load of crap. I didn't like one song, maybe with the exception of \\"The Real Thing\\", but then there are still the lyrics which are written by some 12-yo. After hearing it once, which was a nightmare for my ears, i gave it a few more chances because it was Gwen. I just couldn't believe that it was so bad, but after hearing it 5 times i couldn't torture my ears anymore. I hope she comes up with something more intelligent the next time or at least something not this bad, which is almost impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Doubt","review":"Warning: I have only heard the singleI am No Doubt fan...well not sure anymore.

But I have to say, I could BARELY listen to it once...same old overproduced R&B/hip-hop/rap crap that it seems you can not escape from no matter where you turn these days. And I was disappointed in the lyrics as well. Gwen, stick to rock/pop and let everyone else do the cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?!","review":"I hear everybody talking about how much this album sucks compared to No Doubt. I hear everyone else saying that we should not compare it to ND, this is a fresh release not meant to be an extension of ND's music and style. I agree completely. With that said, this album SUCKS ANYWAY. I don't care if you compare it to Pavarotti or 50, this album suffers from a lack of originality and completely amateur songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so bad...","review":"...it makes 'Rocky Stedy' look like a masterpiece. For god's sake, like Eggplant said, how can you go from being in the same genre as Sublime (great ska/alt. rock abnd if you don't know them) to the same as Britney Spears?????????????????????????? This is the final nail is the GS coffin. Stick with old No Doubt. Listen to Eggplant, he knows his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed with what could have been a great CD","review":"First off, there are some great tracks on this album, like \\"Rich Girls\\", \\"Cool\\", \\"Harajuku Girls\\", and \\"The Real Thing\\". However, most of the album is senseless garbage meant to be \\"weird\\" and \\"different\\", but comes off as extremely contrived and vain. Her lyrics are beyond meanginless, even deplorable. \\"If I was a rich girl, I'd buy a mansion and have endless cash\\". Come on. This is just garbage. Gwen is trying to do what Kylie Minogue has successfully done for years, syntho-pop with urban influences. But it all falls flat and ends in dissapointing garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad!","review":"I like Gwen and No Doubt, but this was a big waste of time, money and energy to produce.

Her vocals were perfect for the band and the R.F. Ska that No Doubt was founded on. I'm not sure what caused her to completely change (though influences of drugs and those providing them to her seem to be hinted throughout the album) but it's not the same. Even N.D. Rock Steady was bad. Don't get me wrong, trying to look at this from a purely new artist point of view, I can't help but think; wow. . .a lot of what these songs are about are completely fake. it seems like she stopped writing from the soul and started writing from the check-book. almost every track sounds the same and reeks of the same fake feelings that Nelly Furtado suffered from. Message to Gwen: Quit the drugs, and find out where your head's at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"When I heard quite a while ago that Gwen was coming out with a solo CD, I was SO excited! Then when I heard months ago all the heavy hitter Producers she was going to have I was even more ecstatic. The first single is (What You Waiting For) is awesome! Rich Girl with Eve is a great song too. They just have a neat chemistry together. Hollaback Girl was one of my favorite songs on here along with Danger Zone. The 2 songs with Andre 3000 are horrid. They just sound like a bunch of noises thrown together that sounds like a big train wreck! I guess I expected more. But, it is a pretty so-so CD. I like her unique voice and style. I am not disappointed that I bought it but I was hoping for so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What You Waiting For?","review":"Good stuff. Overall, Gwen comes through with a fun and ebullient feel that resonates with a unique sound quite unlike any other artist today.Each song, produced by a diverse group of individuals including Dr. Dre, Dallas Austin, & The Neptunes, adds up to an incredibly eclectic group of songs that, despite their vast differences, mesh exceptionally well.Cool is without a doubt her most heartfelt song -- and my favorite on the album. Of course, What You Waiting For? is fun and catchy and what most people are buying the album based upon. The collaborations with Eve (Rich Girl) and Andre 3000 (Long Way To Go), however, fall short in my book. It seems they were thrown together without much effort. However, Bubble Pop Electric and Crash more than make up for those two lesser songs with their originality and fun vibe. Worth getting for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something different!","review":"OK, this is about as far as Gwen can get from Tragic Kingdom, but I say, \\"who cares?\\" All of No Doubt's albums are VERY different from one another and this one is very different from the No Doubt albums. Gwen has never claimed to be a rocker, or belonging to any other genre of music. She is what she is...and that's a music lover. Does anyone out there only like ONE kind of music? Then why should she be restricted to only making one kind of music? She loves collaborations, she loves pushing the envelope.Songs like \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" show how diverse she can really be. I know as a 20-year old, I love the 80's, almost New Kids on the Block feel of songs like \\"Serious.\\" They're just fun and easy to listen to. Let her have some fun.Keep it up Gwen. Keep uniting genres and decades and broadening your musical horizons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your day job! No Doubt!","review":"rI was first excited about this album after hearing Whatcha Waiting For. I thought if the rest of this album is a cool and catchy as this song, Im in for a real treat! Boy was I ever wrong! First of all, I was wondering why there was no Parental Advisory of the cover? I was very disappointed by her vulgar and profane singing to these poor excuse for songs. Second,this album goes in so many directions its hard to try to appreciate. Finally, I am a No Doubt fan and think Gwen is extremely talented but this is a low point for her and cant wait til she goes back into the studio with her boys! One thing Ive learned about this process: No matter how many big time producers you have working with you on your album doesnt mean a sure hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Total schock!","review":"When I heard this entire CD I was in total shock of how bad it was in comparison to the music of No Doubt. I was floored! I know that this is Gwen's solo album, but I really admired her and her music. This CD has no part of the Gwen I THOUGHT she was as the lead singer of No Doubt. hmmmm.....very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How very disappointing","review":"I looooooove No Doubt, but this cd really makes me want to punch someone. All the music on it's good, but Gwen's lyrics really suck.

Having liked No Doubt for a few years, I'd expected a lot from Gwen, aand even though I became skeptical after What You Waiting For came out, I hung in, but this album is terrible. She needs to not conform, and stick to what she's good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"No blood, sugar, sex, magic!","review":"As a fan of new wave faves like Duran Duran, Lena Lovich and Ultravox I was pleased to hear some of the nostalgia used on this cd, but I was left wanting more. This cd leaves me cold. It is an easily forgotten jumble of 80's stylings coupled with today's un-dynamic and monolithic urban stylings. This is a collection of songs that should have been produced on vinyl only. It is intended for those who have an ear for dj'ing the best parts for the dance floor only. A truely disappointing individual listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"gwen's dance-tastic cd","review":"love the beginning of the cd, but it loses some of its electrified steam towards the end...with the exception of \\"crash\\" which is pretty freakin' cool. never cared much for No Doubt, but Gwen is fabutastic on her own! stellar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Style Gwen!","review":"I liked No Doubt, but this alone girl (ALTHOUGH is THE SAME thing), is really very much better, her style Dance/pop is truly sticky, the one single in colombia this sounding very well and this hitting, in 7 weeks that this in the BILLBOARD hardly goes of #47 but anger ascending every week, I wait that it is an entire success in E.U, like in the rest of the world, also the one sails this being arrasador in all europa, when listens for MTv the rest of the Cd I found super good, mainly the song in which this accompanied one for Eve is very good, for my there is not bad song all they maintain me amusing I wait it arrives soon to colombia to buy it of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This album totally sucks. She had lost her writing skills which was obvious when listening to that crappy reggae-wannabe album rock steady. So to make up for it she enlists all these mainstream hit-makers on this one. The hilarious part is that the assitance had only backfired and this record sounds like every other disposable pop TRL trash that's already polluted our airwaves. HAHA her album has only been out for like a week and there's already a ton of used gwen albums up for sale. One final note: there's nothing lamer than a chick in her mid 30s trying to pretend like she's still 18. It's like your mom trying to hang out with yout high school friends after school cause she still thinks she's hip. lame"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stefani: From Fortune to Fluff","review":"There is only one reason that this album raised a single eyebrow in the pop world...because the act was once the lead singer of a unique, cutting-edge female band. In a world of many Pop clones, this album is simply one more soundalike. The lyrics are shallow and often redundant. The Hip-Hop artists are an old gimmick. You can dance to the beat, but the electronic instrumentation is typically boring. I have no idea what emotional mid-life crisis Gwen is going through, but she's a heck of a long way from No Doubt. Teens will probably eat this stuff up like gum, but as an adult, I take no pleasure in watching someone de-evolving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice and Music","review":"Gwen Stefani can make her voice high pitched or can rap with a deep voice. The two best songs on here are \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and \\"Rich Girl.\\" Both have her good singing and rapping voice making the songs what they are. The album does have a little too much adult material for kids under 12 or 13 though. But this is a classic that any of America's youth (ages 12+) should have as they grow up today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with No Doubt Gwen...","review":"The first four songs are very good, extremely catchy.

She acts like britney too by wearing that school outfit on the video. i also didn't get that song \\"holla back girl\\" at the end saying this sh** is banana's.

They're practically irresistable. Stefani also picks some good partners for this CD (Andre 3000 and Johnny Vulture are great on \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" and \\"Long Way to Go\\"). \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and \\"Harajuku Girls\\" are a bit grating on the ears and nerves, but otherwise this album is a fun ride that you'll crave like your favorite candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy beats","review":"The first time i listened to this cd i didnt like it.

And Eve bites....Cool is a nice songHollaback Girl was written when gwen was smoking a joint...Honestly though, her accessorizing of the Harajuku GIrls is so silly. Madonna never accessorized, she re-invented. Gwen take note.She doesn't sing much better than Britney Spears or JLo, yet people are eating her up..Buy any of Madonna's albums over this and be much more happier..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from a very talented woman.","review":"Gwen Stefanis solo album proves you can't manufacture talent. L.A.M.B is packed with fun dance pop from very talented producers.Among the highlights are The Neptunes produced Hollaback girl which sounds like a cross between Kelis MILKSHAKE and a cheerleaders chant with incredably catchy results and Bubble Pop Electric a retro-futuritic romp in which Gwen sounds like a horny Judy Jetson. Also while this may be Gwens least personal album it is very hard for Gwen to ever be impersonal in WHATCHA WAITING FOR Gwen deals with her lack of self confidence and in COOL she forges a strong friendship with an ex. So once again Gwen wins us over with her charm, personality, beauty and with her irresistable hooks.

The first time I heard it I didn't like it but then it sort of grew on me. I do agree that the lyrics do need some work, not for all the songs, just some such as Hollaback Girl. As much as I liked the album I have to admit that song is ridiculous. Gwen Stefani's vocals are great so that sort of makes up for it though. The rest of the album is pretty good. My favourite songs are Danger Zone, Serious, and The Real Thing.

This album is truely full of fun and entertaining tunes and that's what this album is all about. Super entertaining!key tracks would be;3. Hollaback Girl - fun track with simple thumping beats.4. Cool - Very ordinary pop song, and she sound beautiful in this track.5. Bubble Pop Electric - The most entertaining song you'll ever hear.

Madonna already did this kind of music in the 80s but the difference is....Madonna pulled it off great being the amazing powerhouse of a performer that she is. You on the other hand fall flat on your face. Look for this album to sink...and sink fast on the charts! At least we now know one thing....Gwen obviously is NOT the mastermind behind No Doubt!

I don't care for their most recent albums (Return of Saturn and Rock Steady) though. They _were_ cutting edge rock. I respected the originality of the music-lyrics, and Gwen was awesome. I knew those days were over when I heard their album \\"Return of Saturn\\". This album should be sold at the dollar store! Who is she trying to be? Gwen Stefani or a 36 year old bad Britney Spears? Terrible. No matter how much time, thought and effort she put into this, it doesn't show. Her obsession with the Japanese girls gets annoying after a while. The brillant thing about this album is that she's using it to promote her fashion line L.A.M.B. as well. Sorry Gwen, but I'll stick to your work in No Doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth One Star","review":"Gwen realy should not have gone away from her No doubt roots where her music was passable at best. The single holler back girl currently on the radio should tip you off that has to be one of the worst albums ever. Gwen's rapping is just as scary as Madonna rapping. If you have to spell out a fruit on a song its pretty much a clear indicator that your album is also a fruit. Im still amazed at how this can be called music and marketed. Simon Cowel where are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\" by Gwen Stefani","review":"How is a Gwen Stefani album any different than a No Doubt album? Gwen has always done all the vocals. She tries to appeal to both R&B and punk audiences, but it just doesn't work for me. \\"Hollaback Girl\\" is so annoying. She doesn't do any singing in it. All she does is scream random and meaningless things like \\"Bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S!\\" over and over. She's trying to hard to be ghetto now. You can't just suddenly switch from a punk to a thug that quickly. That said, \\"Rich Girl\\" is pretty catchy. But it gets annoying quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Her voice sounds sooo offkey all the time, especially in luxurious.

I can't remember a time when I had to have the CD the day it came out. I love the single and have been a big No Doubt fan for a couple of years now. I have been impressed by Gwen's open, real and yes fun lyrics and was looking forward to more. I can get into most of the music on this new CD (I was a teen in the 80's after all) but am so disappointed with the lyrics on most of the songs. I enjoy American Idol and all the other thousands of teen \\"artist\\" like the next person. I mean they are EVERYWHERE, dime a dozen if you will. Would it have been soooooo costly for 30+ age artist to write about the world of a 30+ person? Well, Teens enjoy this gift you have been given....yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's down-out flamin' *HOT*","review":"First off, it's amazing that she could pull this off.Yes, her sweet synchin' voice and irritating lyrics could be annoying at times, yet I respect the fact that she took a risk. Respecting all genres in music today is not easy. She doesn't care about the competition of music out there ... she respects those genres.I'm a HUGE fan of hers. From collecting all her CDs and albums, especially her No Doubt singles ... she has gone from punk music to pop. She may not like Britney Spears, but she's showin' her love. I like her style, I like her beat/sound. I also come out to be a huge club fan. I love dance and electronica. I remixed a couple of her songs and am very pleased to be able to give her a chance in my world.Verdict: 4.5 / 5 - These Hip-hop, J-Pop, Electro-Pop, Ska-Punk, and Dance beats deserve the title of the best-dressed pop album of the year. Oh! Welcome Back, Gwen!

She used to be a 'rebel' but now she's singing about how luxurious her life is. Theres only one way to go after you get so rich and just want more money and fame, and thats to sing about how much money you have and how good you look.Gwen Stefani really, REALLY disappoints me when she goes from such a cool background into this mainstream flow of... just... blended noise.If it were possible, i'd give this no stars, dont waste your money on this, you can turn MTV on and see it every five minutes anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I have liked No Doubt for awhile and was a little apprehensive about Gwen Stefani doing a solo record, but she did a good job of it.

I was really excited about Gwen's solo album, but on first listen it seemed a little too weird and disjointed to me. However, on repeat listens the album really grew on me and I can't get the songs out of my head. As always, Gwen's lyrics seem to come straight from her personal experiences, which makes the album accessible and relevant. The production is slick, but the beats and arrangements are brilliant. On Love.Angel.Music.Baby, Gwen manages to keep her fans happy with her insightful lyrics, while experimenting with some funky, retro sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't catch it if it was thrown at me.","review":"No Doubt is a band. Gwen Stefani is a pseudo style princess creating a faux Andy Warhol world for herself and her Harajuku girls. More disturbing than the retread of 70's/80's/90's music better done by Frou Frou, Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters is the constant objectification of the dancers in Stefani's videos who bow, acquiesce, laugh and coo at their mistress' bequest.

In rock and ska not many women have the voice and range that Gwen does. Unfortunately she manages to do a wonderful job of hiding her talents in nearly every track of LAMB. Teaming up with hip-hop stars on most tracks has done little to showcase her wonderful voice or inspire her lyrics. The style of the album is everything from 80's Madonna to Outkast without any focus or flow. What You Waiting For is a small diamond in a lot of rough and the only reason to buy the album if you are a fan of No Doubt. The rest is totally forgetable and not worth the cash.

I am a NO DOUBT fan, however I knew this wasn't gonna sound like a CD from the band. I had heard it was gonna be dance/pop sounding, which is the kind of music I listen to the most. I was more than pleasantly surprised with this CD, I definately think it's the most fun CD I bought this year. I like all the songs. My favorite track is Crash, I love how well Gwen captures the essence of the 80's with a few of the tracks on this CD, 80's pop music fans should love this CD. I have to say that I love the new collaboration with EVE, but I didn't think much of the duet with Andre 3000. While I appreciate the message the song conveys about racisim, I think it could've been done more upbeat to match the rest of the album.

The people who listen to this garbage are the same people who think Hillary Duff and Lindsay Lohan have any actual musical talent.-100 stars for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen Goes *Pop*!","review":"I was interested in listening to this CD after I heard the first two singles \\"What you waitin for\\" and \\"Holla Back\\", Im up for a little poptronica with some absurd gangster influence.After listening to this album, I was really dissappointed though.Stefani seems to be trying to be an 80's Madonna ressurection, which, in my book, is near the equivilant of summoning the anti-christ. Fashion and money obsessed, Stefani comes across strongly as a modern material girl, with a crush on Japan, and who likes to bring up her adventures in the back seats of cars as a reoccuring theme. And please tell me she's trying to be funny with all the white-girl gangster talk.So if you like 80's era Madonna, you will probobly like this. Its full of sappy synths and gooey vocals that take you to the tablespoon depths of Stefani's hopes and dreams; \\"If I was a rich girl, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl.\\"Well Gwen, now what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I have to hear Hollaback Girl one more time...","review":"For the past month or so that's all that I've heard. I've been to a ton of events from formal dances to baseball games, and that stupid song has to be played everywhere. It is the epitome of American music in 2005--so bad you wonder if it can be called music.I'm often afraid to say the word \\"bananas\\" around people anymore because they break out into this awful song. The rest of the album, based on what others have said, is more of the same. Still, this album gets a one star for Hollaback Girl alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least Madonna Has Somewhat Intelligent Lyrics","review":"It isn't that anyone really thought Gwen was a brain surgeon but this album reiterates the fact that other than being pretty and having a cute voice, she lacks talent. This CD was truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Sometimes you just have to ask yourself, what were they thinking? Clearly Gwen wasn't. I don't know what this album is, but it's not alternative and it's not pop. Unfortunately, I don't think Gwen figured that out either. Her voice is downright grating, and she seems to have taken her fashion status to new level . . . that would be, a lower level. I really don't understand the total Asian theme going on - it's fine if you're really into that, but with her it's just a fashion statement. She should have spent more time on the music. PLEASE GO BACK TO NO DOUBT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Gwen Stefani...","review":"...but, this album did absolutely nothing for me. It had its high points. The lyrics were okay, but she won't win a Pulitzer for them. The best songs are RICH GIRL, HOLLABACK GIRL, LUXURIOUS, and LONG WAY TO GO. Those are the only ones I can stand to listen to more than once every time I pop in the cd. BUBBLE POP ELECTRIC is a very stupid song.The most ANNOYING thing on this album had to be the fact that in almost every song, she mentions those Japanese minions she has following her around, the Harajuku Girls. She even has a song for them aptly titled HARAJUKU GIRLS. It was cute up to a point, but it really is annoying. Another annoying thing is that in HOLLABACK GIRL, she says s*** way too many times. It becomes overdone after about the tenth time.So, if you like Madonna-esque songs, then this album is for you. If not, steer clear from it and you will be one happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCREAM 4!","review":"Ugggh! I think it's Gavin Rossdale dragging her down telling her this crap is good because his own career died. I can't believe this cd is from a Gwen Stefani because with No Doubt, her music was good. I can't believe anyone over 10 years old would like this. The lyrics are terribly juvenile (Bananas???????in \\"Hollagirl\\" - WTF??! oh, and how original, too!)

Let's just say, I'm not impressed. The music and lyrics are very corny and predictable. I don't think this record really showcases her real talents. Also, the way she objectifies Harajuku women is terrible. She refers to them as toys or accessories to have rather than real friends or influences. \\"I'm gonna get me some Harajuku girls\\" Who \\"gets\\" a person. I'd rather hear name dropping than refering to these women as a brand. I hope the remaining members of No Doubt come up with something better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this \\"music\\"?!","review":"I am a big No Doubt fan, and actually knew them before they blew out and went mainstream, but this CD by Stefani is a very difficult listen. The music here is atonal, lacking rhythm, and overall creativity. Stefani said in a magazine interview that it felt as if she did not write the music in this CD because it was mostly collaborations w/ other \\"artists\\". I wanna know, who wrote this so-called \\"music\\" then? Please, any No Doubt fan like myself only knows that this CD was released because it was Gwen Stefani, but it does not mean it's good. It hurts me to say this but this CD borders on listening to music, and first thinking it is a gag, but end up finding out that this music is real, kinda like J. Lo's music. Stefani, like J. Lo, should stick to acting because there, they're not that awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, if you like cheap tacky pop!","review":"If I had cash in one hand, and felt like destroying it, I could do one of three things; burn it, flush it, or buy this album. I have never heard such a load of trash in my whole life. If you want to see what I mean, look up the lyrics, especially to holla back girl. Hell its the only way you can understand the screaming (not singing) O.T.T. freak show.What happend to No Doubt?!? What is Gwen doing...Gwen takes cheap tacky pop to a new level.Do your self a favour and DO NOT buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian Synthesizer 80's Cliche","review":"It's no surprise that this album is doing well. The worse the music in this country, the better it does. Look at Britney Spears and all those Boy Bands. Mediocrity reigns supreme and this album is the king of the hill. Some songs are just tired and pedestrian, with childlike rhyming schemes like \\"Don't go away, my love. Want you to to stay.\\" Some songs don't even have a rhyming scheme at all. Some songs are clunky and 80s with a bad synthesizer sound that has long been abandoned by most artists and now you can only hear at family barbeques and church events. Some songs have no memorable melody at all, but all songs on this album do have the commonality of sucking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen get live Asian girls as fashion accessories! Trendy! Cute!

It rocks my world. You get more than just a cd; there's a fab, sturdy and pretty velcro closure traveling cd case with room for 12 faves and a cunning small hardcover book with slipcover, which showcases all the lyrics in the style of illuminated manuscripts and includes photos and original Shinjuko illustrations.If I were a recording musician, this is a style of presentation I would emulate.

Love it!","review":"Having been raised throughout the majority of the 80's & early 90's, I was instantly drawn into Gwen Stefani's first Solo Album. Much of the songs are all geared towards dancing and having tons of fun,which basically sums up much of the 80's & 90's dance music scene. In addittion, every single track, including the slow ones, leaves you humming the hooks and choruses all day long. All in all, the album is a must for anyone who loves to dance and it will most definitely leave you with a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"I bought the CD because I love What You Waiting For and the majority of No Doubt's stuff, particularly their albums Tragic Kingdom and Rock Steady. I love music from the 80's and a lot of pop. My favorite song so far is still What You Waiting For but other favorites are now Crash and Harajuku Girls. It's a fun album and I'd say it's worth the $13 I spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirty something going on thirteen","review":"I LOVE this cd. I am a fan of 80s music (new wave, pop, booty) and this cd is like a time warp back to when music was fun and lighthearted. I'm not sure if Gwen was trying to recapture her youth: the lyrics sound like she borrowed them from a thirteen-year-old-girl who just hit puberty. If you can overlook this, I think you will be a happy customer. I have so much fun driving in rush hour traffic thanks to this cd!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! time warp!","review":"Can Gwen bring back the 80's? I don't know. But I'm glad she tried.

This One Is Annoying","review":"I am a huge No Doubt fan , not huge but I have some their music. Ever since Gwen left the band she has changed completely. She seems to have an attitude like she all that or she better now that she out of the band.The music from No Doubt was intelligent , original and suited her voice better. On Hollaback Girl and numerous other songs , the lyrics are childish and her voice just sounds annoying. I enjoyed her voice in No Doubt , but this R/B meets 80's dance and rap annoys me. I realize I am being redundant on the word annoying , but thats the only word to describe this album.Even the album cover , she looks so trashy and stuck up , she wasnt like that in No Doubt. She must remember it was her band as well that brought her to the point she is now.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 , because I cant hate her cuz she used to be so cool in the past. And cuz \\"Harajuku Girls \\"( even though I dunt get what the hell it means, has a weird beat to it that I like )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Album","review":"A lot of people gave this album terrible reviews, but I think that they're taking it too seriously. Yeah, Gwen is grown and approaching 40, but on a lot of the songs I think that they were meant to sound like high school. The majority of the CD is hilarious, and it's definitely something I'll put in my CD player if I want to hear something kinda of wild and upbeat. But in order to enjoy this album, you can't take Gwen too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED","review":"I was highly disappointed when I heard Gwen's new CD. Only one song, HoLLaback girl was ok- even this song is not enjoyable unless scantlly clad women are parading around like in the video. Gwen is a SELLOUT who went totally mainstream.

Instead of staying within one genre like most artists, Gwen actually gives hint to various genres throughout her cd. There's a bit of 80s, r&b, dance pop, soft rock, and others styles of music, and I think she did a great job portraying all of them. I had one person ask me if she was Madonna (I think Crash was on), and another ask me if Gwen Stefani had gone R&B (Luxurious). Some people might not like the novelty of this cd, but I think it's hot, and great to dance to. I'm sure I look like an idiot grooving in my car saying, \\"The sh*t is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S,\\" but you know what?

I think though for the Genre the music is pretty orignial and good. Harajuku girls is my favorite out of the Cd. I spent some time in Harajiku last Christmas while on a business trip so I can relate to lyrics and the spirit of the ,song. I know there are some misguided people here that think that type of song is racist but believe me Japanese would be very proud of the music because it borrows from the Japanese pop music scene and I am confident it would be a big hit in japan. In fact the Cd is somewhat influenced by it in the same way Paul Simon's Greaceland was influenced by the South African music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Above-Average Debut with a Few Standout Tracks","review":"Gwen does prove on this alum that she has the ability to do any type of music. She really shines on the single What You Waiting For?, the awesomely Fiddler on the Roof-esque Rich Girl and the quirky Bubble Pop Electric. This is the album I was hoping Rock Steady was going to be. After such a long wait, this album turns out to be way worth the wait and the price.

I've listened to the albumn maybe three times all the way through and it's not growing on me, nor do I have the desire put myself through that again. The lyrics are a joke and it just doesn't fit. Don't get me wrong, it a FUN albumn, it just not anything I would expect from her. I know that artists grow and change, but this is backsliding.

Every track bears a resemblace to some song you've heard before, and I spent the 20 minutes after listening to the CD trying to piece which samples came from where. The sound ranges from new wave to early 90's dance to current astro-funk. There is definitely a Prince/Cyndi Lauper/Cathy Dennis/New Order meets the Neptunes featuring OutKast kinda vibe on it. There are no arty love songs on this CD and that is a good thing. Every track on this album could be a single and it is very listenable straight through. Many might think that the CD is too varied, and it certainly doesn't sound like No Doubt. Once again, it is pretty clear that this is not the intent of the artist. The sass quotient is at a 10, and for a queer like me, this is one of the top cd's of the year, and the most interesting since Scissor Sisters' debut. L.A.M.B. is the album Kylie wishes she made."},{"rating":"2","title":"This sh*t is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!","review":"The fact that Gwen herself has labeled this a \\"guilty pleasure\\" album, gives us all the more reason to secretly dance stark naked singing along into a hair brush while getting ready for a date on a Saturday night. This album is nothing but bubble gummy fun, but in a really good way. For a few minutes she adjust her leg warmers, throws on her gold bangals and laughs at herself while creating foot thumping music in the midst. I think it's great when artist takes their time to craft really \\"deep\\" pieces of work that make you think, but sometimes you just want to dance. With tracks like \\"Rich Girls\\" \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" and \\"Crash\\", L.A.M.B. summons you to the nearest dance floor of your choice - your living room, treadmill, or shower.

She is the most confused person on the face of the planet. She is the equivalent of a fruit roll-up, or perhaps a swirl cone.

But seriously, be original and don't be like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"colours fade to grey","review":"colours fade to grey... the repetitive monotonous noises fade to white nothingness.this is not music... this is a product much alike a mass produced t-shirt with a trendy lable.(...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This made my ears hurt.","review":"Is Gwen so self absorbed and self obsessed that she has nothing better to say? My 12 year old can write deeper lyrics than this crap she is selling, I find it hard to believe with her life experiences and travels the only thing she can come up with is fashion and style? And once you are over the shock of the poor lyrics, you realize the music itself is just horrible.I can see now why she went solo, No Doubt members would have never agreed to play this. She will \\"No Doubt\\" be embarrased a few years from now for even trying to call this art. I'm embarrased for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This is one of those CD's that has one or two good songs that had a lot of radio play but the rest aren't worth listening to.

WHEN I HEARD THIS I PUKED A LITTLE IN MY MOUTH. I USE TO LOVE GWEN BECAUSE SHE WORKED SO WELL WITH THE BAND. THERE MUSIC WAS GOOD, BUT SENCE ROCK STEADY THEY HAVE SOLD OUT. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HER VOICE? IT SOUNDS TERRBILE !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original, you say??? NO WAY.","review":"Gwen Stefani's cd...I saw it referred to as \\"original\\". Are you joking? It is anything BUT original. It is nothing more than basic tunes and beats that have already been done many times before by other artists. I can't see this album as something that anyone who isn't a juvenile would listen to. And I do find the \\"I am the Queen, you are the subjects\\" mentality of this music towards Japanese girls and Japanese culture to be gauche...Get over yourself, Gwen. Having a clothing line is one thing. But it sounds as if she is EXPECTING to be praised and glorified for it. Or something....I have one defining word for this album.....WHATEVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love. Amazing.Music. Baby!!","review":"At first I thought that I wouldn't like the album, but the minute I heard \\"what are you waiting for\\" and \\"rich girl\\" I was hooked! Her album is amazing! Her style of music totally unique. If you were to ask me what genre of music she sings, I couldn't tell you. It isn't Pop, Rock, Alternative, R&B;, or anything else, it's just Gwen! She has created a new type of music that will take the world by storm.I have to say that the best songs on this album are \\"What Are You Waiting For\\", \\"Rich Girl\\", \\"Harajuku Girls\\", \\"Bubble. Pop. Electric.\\", \\"Danger Zone\\", \\"Hollaback Girl, and, well... all of them. This is definately a CD that you will never get tired of.

All give her props when she goes back to No Doubt.You are probally saying they sound the same.No!Now shes a rap artist.She used to have good lyrics.But now its ZZZZZZZZZZ.Go buy a No Doubt Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna lite","review":"Gwen Stefani is to what Madonna like Usher thinks he is to Michael Jackson which neither one them really aren't. Usher doesn't have the Voice or the proper Material to even try to make a Claim&the same goes for Stefani when it comes to Madonna. Stefani is vocally challenged&the Music here sounds like Post\\"Like a Virgin\\" Era Madonna but minus the Right Hit to truly make it work. Stefani has the Star \\"IT\\" vibe but not the voice or the right Material to fully reach that next level. much Like Usher just Emulating someone you grew up on doesn't mean you Equal them in Quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen Stefani Is Done","review":"After 11 or so impossible years of greatness, No Doubt and Gwen Stefani are finally finished. Although I respect No Doubt, the band, Gwen has finally screwed herself with this album, the Pepsi ads and the diva 'tude. I almost puked the third time I saw the Pepsi ad in which this teenage girl leers in awe at Gwen walking by with her friend, as if she were some idol. PUH-LEASE! The music on this CD is pretty bad, and I like Gwen Stefani too...when she's singing with No Doubt. And the obsession with the Harajuku girls IS scary. She reminds me of the freaks I took Japanese with in college. I also don't understand her obsession with West Indian music. She's really butchering it. She doesn't really understand it. Please, drop it. I don't recommend this album. It's sad to know that all great things must come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"No that great","review":"This album isn't that worth buying. If you have an Ipod, then download the only GOOD songs. Rich Girl, Hollaback Girl are the best. There should be more songs like that. I used 2 like Gwen. Now, she's not all that good. Only a few songs are worth buying the album. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT!!!!","review":"I only gave this CD one star because that was the lowest I could go. I could not wait till Christmas to see if My husband answered my wish list, Pleased as I was to find this in my stocking. Pleased that is until I popped it in the player. Song one is good, I have heard it on the radio but the rest, I only got to about song 7 when I had to pop it out. HORRIBLE!!! Gwen you sold out my friend. Bring back No Doubt!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen, your career without No Doubt is Doubtful","review":"Okay, this album sucks ass. It's really really bad. Sort of like when Madonna started trying to focus on her SINGING, rapping (what a joke) and guitar playing instead of just doing what she does best in her American Life album. I don't even know WHAT Gwen is going for in this one - to me it seem incomprehensible? The songs are simple and silly and for the most part repetetive and annoying. Gwen, stick with the band. They really made you sound SO much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush production meets former punkster","review":"I wasn't sure (other than the radio hits I dug) that I would like my No Doubt front girl trying her hand at hip-hop, but this is more of Gwen making a transition into pop than anything else. I'm cool with that, since I was afraid she would become a total clone of Martha Davis & The Motels (god, do they sound alike or what?). There are still some punk roots to Gwen's approach, but she's been hanging with a more urban/r&b crowd, making this CD, and the results have grown on me. It's upbeat, defiant, catchy, semi-dancy, yet all Gwen at the same time. Too bad the Grammies still feel U2's tired delivery of their patented sound came out on top over this effort. Like the rock critics say, she's the hottest 36-year-old on the planet and this CD proves it! My 13-year-old niece likes it and so do I... and I'm three times her age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two great songs!","review":"And they both get a star apiece: \\"Rich Girl\\" and \\"Hollaback Girl.\\" The rest is recycled 80's new wave fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!!!","review":"I have been a fan of no doubt but always thought that gwen was an inovative star of her own....This proves it. This is one of the funnest CD's I've heard in years. the mixture of pop, funk, rap, r&b all blended together to make some exciting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwen is great.","review":"I have always loved her music & this DVD is so good. It left me wanting to know more about her L.A.M.B. designs, since she sings about them, & the Japanese girls. One problem - one of my personal favorites was not included - THE SWEET ESCAPE. I listen to the DVD every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it--spend your 14 dollars on something else","review":"Prior to listening to all the songs on L.A.M.B., I wondered why it received so many bad reviews. I had heard the first 4 songs on the radio and thought they were okay. \\"Cool\\" was my favorite of the four, but then I heard the whole album and understood. This album received so many bad reviews because it IS bad. On L.A.M.B., Gwen decided to go on a limb and branch out from her ska roots. Although this album is basically pop, some songs have an underlying techno beat. So maybe this review is somewhat biased because I hate techno. Anyway, not only do the songs suck, but the lyrics are crappy, meaningless, and not to mention, annoyingly repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"why, why, WHY?!","review":"I've always been a No Doubt fan, even when they left ska for pop, and Gwen has amazing style, but dear god almighty, what was she thinking?! The thing I've noticed from reading the other reviews is that people usually either love it or hate it, and I think age might have something to do with it. Kids, anyone old enough to remember the 80's saw that decade go with little remorse (unless they were a Reagan fan); trust me, let it die already. The era of teased hair and leg warmers was painful enough the first time around without Gwen dredging it all up in a painful attempt to break the status quo of pop music in the new milennium. One moderatly good song does not justify a whole damn album. It's embarresing. And I'd appreciate her constant self-indulgent referrences to the Harajuku district in Tokyo if she actually incorporated some elements of Japanese pop music (a lot better than her crap) instead of just repeating the name over and over. Better luck next time, Gwen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It isn't supposed to be No Doubt, people!!!","review":"If you read through the majority of these reviews you'll notice that all the negative comments allude to how it isn't like No Doubt.It's not supposed to sound like ND! Otherwise it would be a ND album!!! Try listening to the album objectively and for it's creative value.This is Gwen having fun, throwing back to the light 80's pop/dance that we love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'No Doubt' About It, It's L. A. M. E.","review":"More a fashion fiasco than a seriously taken musical ideal, Stefani has remained a tormentor throughout the years posing as the lead \`singer' of the faux-Ska-Meets-Mtv No Doubt. But this was to be a departure of that dissipated sound, and as a lifetime foe, I clasped my hands and hoped for a revelation - but what I get was armageddon. Here she's zip-code's one target - bad, cheesy L.A. New Wave Pop of the 80s. Her Betty Boop stylings and porn-star hiccup vocals fit right in - Terri Nunn would be proud. Her affected trendiness, her superficial, safe use of guest vocals [Eve...AGAIN!?], her nonsensical acronym of the title [just what the hell is LAMB but a blatant commercial for her tacky clothing line?] and she looks the part of Madonna circa Blond Ambition. How does one, so early in her career, become a caricature of one's own self? My grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Suicidal Torture S**t","review":"If I hear god damn Hollaback Girl once more,I'll jump off a cliff and I bet I wont be the 1st to do so and Gwen Stefani and the DJs should be ashamed for making so many people suicidal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of the year","review":"I really wish that I could give less stars. This album is awful. I always thought that she was a major part of the creative input of No Doubt, but obviously the other band members were doing it all and just using her as a pretty singer. That or she decided to really be herself on this album, a huge mistake. It seems like she is trying so hard to be alt and hard when she is sooo pop and soft. The worst part of this album for me was that because of her fame she was able to bring in some of the hottest artists available (Dr. Dre, Andre 3000, Neptunes) into this project and it made them sound horrible. This album sounds like it was made by a 12 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut, sounds polished","review":"This is a band that reminds me of Cynic. This is understandable being as the drummer and one of the guitar players were in Cynic. They also played with Chuck on Death's \\"Human\\" album. Needless to say, parts of the album can be very heavy. The line-up of veterans perhaps give this band an advantage. The album sounds much too polished to be a debut album.Overall, the band does a brilliant job at bringing in very soft parts. The soft pretty parts flow beautifully into the more brutal parts. Sean does excellent basswork throughout the entire album. The vocals are very different. The vocalist is a female who chooses a style that is very operamatic but not overbearing. She does a pretty solid job. The album is very good because of the elements it contains. Another album or two like this would be too many and unnecessary. If you are a fan of Cynic and middle Death stuff, you should give this album a try. If you only like the super brutal stuff, this may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing","review":"This is one of the most satisfyingly complete albums I've ever heard. Its like taking Cynic to the next logical level: No death metal vocals. The singer, Danishta Rivero, is a trained Metzzo-Soprano opera singer, and her sense of melody helps keep a sort of catchiness over the complex music that is reminiscent of both Cynic and Gordian Knot (two other bands f/Malone and Reinert). Santiago Dobles (who wrote almost all the music) is an amazing lead guitarist. How I'd love to see him team with Ron Jarzombek! Malone, as usual, is simpley amazing on bass whipping out several sharp bass solos and interesting rythmic lines. Sean Reinert is still one of fusion/metal's great drummers, utilizing his unique ryhthms and knowledge of the entire drum kit to provide a solid foundation for the other musicians. An excellent album by all means!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpectedly enjoyable","review":"I just saw this movie as a middle-of-the-night-and-no-one-else-is-up movie choice. I will probably watch it again! Yes it was a bit cheesy, but I loved it just the same. If you are having a bad night and just need a little pick up where the good guys win, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valentine's Day is MUCH Better!","review":"I didn't really like this movie. Valentine's Day is much better. Rent this movie first to see if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another All Star Cast Holiday Romp","review":"New Year's Eve is a by the book romantic comedy brought to from the same team that made Valentine's Day. Instead of Los Angeles, the scene is NYC with the plot revolving around the traditional dropping of the ball in Times Square. Director Gary Marshall has assembled another all star cast (including a cameo by his sister Penny who delivers one of the funnier lines in the movie) who mug their way through a drippy plot. The appeal to act in this film by so many great actors like Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Hallee Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer and the like must be the campy fun they must have had on the set (the closing credits with outtakes and bloopers is funnier than the actual movie). One example is Matthew Broderick making a brief appearance as a Mr. Bullerton (get it, haha) and hamming his way through his lines as a big muckety muck. The film could be worse and is a harmless way to spend two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Studded Dud!","review":"I paid $3.99 for the live stream; if it had been more I would have been angry. This movie was syrupy predictable and trite. It was actually kind of boring and I found myself wondering how much time was left. Hillary Swank and Robert D were the bright stars showing the most depth in this shallow pond. I like the concept of overlapping cross stories (like Crash, but lacking similar compelling story lines). There was a surprise/mystery ending which was somewhat ruined by an unrealistic goofball act. The outtakes at the end were the funniest and most interesting things about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great movie","review":"I have difficulty reviewing movies.

I can easily imagine it being written on Dec 29th, filmed over the next two days, and shipped to theaters on New Years day, thats how little thought went into this production. They don't even attempt to hide the cliches used to try and hold this thing together, one character's main dilema is that he isn't prepared for his \\"big company speech,\\" another is a grizzled old man whos dying wish is to see the stupid ball drop for some reason...It may actually be worth the $20, just so you can show it to young aspiring screenwriters and directors and give them hope that no matter how talentless they may be, they might still suceed in hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This DVD is really good.

The storyline is so plain and weak, the characters totally lack of connection and no sparks between each couples whatsoever. The actors, being all A-list big names and all, played horribly like they didn't even care. The only one that actually caught my eye and was playing his role decently with efforts is Zac Efron. The others, including Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, were so bad like they didn't get paid making this movie. I thought Valentine's Day was bad enough, but New Year's Eve is just unbearable.

Weisberg pokes holes into all of Posner's major arguments and proves the case is far from closed. However, the book is clearly a bitter expression of a feeling of neglect in Posner's book. Weisberg rants about Posner not using his work and successfully alienates the reader. While the information in Weisberg's work is interesting and more likely than Posner's to be fact, it is meant only for those who are familiar with the minute details of the JFK Assassination. If that includes you, this book is a must. For those who, like me, are simply interested in learning more about the case, there are more informative and engaging pro-conspiracy reads with more general points."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE, BUT MORE HONEST THAN CASE CLOSED","review":"I understand why Mr. Weisberg felt compelled to write a book debunking case closed because after all, Posner's book is a sham.

I credit him for revealing some of Gerald Posner's mistakes in Posner's _Case Closed_, but Weisberg himself makes several notable errors in this book. Unfortunately, Weisberg sounds too much like a raving madman for me to take his book too seriously. I know that Mr. Weisberg takes the JFK assassination seriously and that he probably feels betrayed by Posner after allowing Posner access to all his JFK files and documents, but that's no excuse to go crazy.

I borrow material from it INCESSANTLY and without shame.It presents the \\"Keynesian\\" viewpoint on macroeconomics in an extraordinarily clear and interesting fashion. Frankly, I consider the introductory (read literally - first semester macro books) texts to be a waste of time. There is absolutely no reason this textbook should not be used for a first semester macroeconomics course (assuming one has already taken an introductory microeconomics course).Suggested plan of study for those interested in a fairly serious study of macroeconomics (without an INSANE amount of mathematical preparation): this book and Barro's book with the same title.

Many of the tattoos could have been showcased more if the portraits had been posed for that purpose instead of being collected from previous publications.

The book takes the matter seriously, but truth is, it over-complicates training; but who could blame them, no way you can keep selling monthly issues of a magazine unless you follow as a philosophy to over-complicate training regimen and dress up the same lame exercises into different variations.In reality, all you really NEED is the main exercises, the compound ones, like squat, deadlift, press, bench press, clean, and anything else that assist those exercises like rows, pull-ups, dips, etc.And I have NOT found a book to teach you this fundamental exercises and to guide you towards doing some real work, better than 'Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore'.Get it and learn the fundamentals, after that you can do whatever you want, but at least get your foundation in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to explain why i dont liek this book.","review":"Hmmmm how do i put this into words? I simply just didn't find this book very helpful. All the info it gives is basic basic basic almost everything in it i already knew.

I bought the book and realized that I could do 30 exercises, complete with the pictures to do so, as well as how to do the exercises for maximum benefit without hurting myself. I also learned the limitations of a home gym set versus free weights and the value of stretching. For me, the book was the difference between owning a home gym and using it. Your mileage may vary. All the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro to Weight Training","review":"This is a great book for new lifters or people who want to try out some new techniques. The book does a really good job at exposing you to the wide variety of training techniques out there - 1.5 reps, 21s, strip sets, wave sets, supersets, trisets, negative reps, different grips... This book covers it all. I think there's a little too much variety in the intermediate and advanced programs - you need access to a lot of equipment, and the workouts change every 4th week so as soon as you start to really improve at a lift you switch to something else. I also think the volume is a little bit low but your mileage may vary. Overall, a very solid and informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Educational","review":"Book includes a lot of information about muscle, and a lot of technical language which is good because when I read it with my younger brother it pushes him to use a dictionary.

It led to my personal best bench press (225 if that somehow helps you quantify my level of fitness).That said, I thought that the abdominal program could have been much more aggressive and sometimes the names of exercises in the workout schedule were a bit annoying to find in the index. Finally, the author suggests taking a break from cardio (though he does suggest you can do it on your off days) so that you can put on mass. It is hard to say how much less mass I would have put on if I had done cardio, but then again a chunk of my mass gain came in the form of love handles. Not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic for most people","review":"This book has lots of pretty pictures and info, but if you are looking for a workout plan, look somewhere else.

I have several of the Men's Health books but this is by far the best looking of their books I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must Read for Fitness Buffs","review":"This book is a bible for those interested in exercise, athletic training and weightlifting. It's easy to understand and covers simple yet important concepts regarding physical training, diet and recovery. Too often we do too much (I did) which yields poor results. It teaches you the importance of rest and recovery. It's not what you do at the gym, but what you do when you are NOT at the gym. I continue to use it as a reference and have shared it with a number of personal trainers I know. All have agreed it's an important read for people who are serious about their physical fitness. The workouts are easy to follow and progressively challenging. I put on 15 LBs of muscle mass in 6 months. If you stick with the programs whether beginner, intermediate or advanced you WILL get positive results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really makes a differencebodybuilf","review":"The anatomy and kinesiology sections are accurate and informative.

While these stories are not the most famous of Holmes' cases (The Red Headed League, The Hound of the Baskervilles, etc.) there is still plenty of the standard Sherlock Holmes fare. Holmes and his trusty companion, Dr. Watson, take on an assortment of 12 cases with such titles as The Illustrious Client, The Marazin Stone and The Retired Coloured Man. While most of these cases involve a crime of some sort, a few ( Thor Bridge and The Blanched Soldier) tell of human tragedy and display both Holmes acute reasoning powers and his compassion.There is no much more than needs be said. The stories are short enough (average of 15-20 pages) to be read in a single setting.

If I could meat Jane Yolen personaly I would have thanked her so much for creating this work of art.I give this book 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fewmets!\\"","review":"A fascinating, funny and charming story of slavery, love, hard work and success that walks the line between science fiction and fantasy and will intrigue readers of any age. The world and society Yolen creates is just outlandish enough to keep things interesting while its inhabitants stay decidedly human. Topics such as drug abuse, crime and prostitution are handled competently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it!","review":"Upon reading the back of the book, I was a little reluctant to begin it. However, as soon as I read a few pages, all my worries at disliking this wonderful book soon melted away. I love most of the characters, especially Akki, who is not one of those girly-girl-help-me-save-me types. Instead she is independent and stubborn which is how I like my characters. The way Jane Yolen displays the characters' likes and dislikes and how she shows how hard it is for them to make a big discision makes them all the more real. Read it. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hard to understand... but still a good book.","review":"Yolen is a very creative writer, but I found some parts hard to understand. I think that she should have done more explaining at the beginning of the book. Also the end was kind of predictable. Still, I liked this book a lot, and the dragon fights were awesome! To anyone that liked this book I also reccomend the Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C Wrede, if you like a little less sci-fi and a little more fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"good begining HORIBLE end","review":"I don't want to give the end away, so I'll try not to. The end was Horible, the arther made everything turn out perfectly, maybee you like endings like that, but I HATE them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon's Blood","review":"The book Dragon's Blood is about a boy who is kept as a watcher in his masters cave watching the dragons eggs.Its wrong for him to take an egg but he has a strong feeling that there is a dragon in the paticular egg that he goes to. He can't be sure about this because not all the eggs hatch. He wants to be a great trainer but ts hard.I would recomend this book to a young age group."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-73f6441f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/63.md","filePath":"library/63.md"}'),R={name:"library/63.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
