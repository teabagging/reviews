Rush, in case you were wondering is a Canadian trio that mixes Prog and Metal influences to create an unstoppable effect. I only have one problem, this CD contains too many of their 80's songs, which were not as heavy and leaning towards synth pop. However, even they are pretty good. You may find lead singer Geddy Lee's voice a little bizarre at first, but you will grow to like it. The best songs on the album are Tom Sawyer, Working Man, and The Trees. The Trees is a rather goofy epic of maples and oaks fighting over wether who is superior. I would recommend this collection for casual fans, or Rush beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't blame the group!","review":"Yes, we all know that there's been too many Rush compilations, and that the first one (Chronicles) had the best selection at the best value. But this is what major labels do... no surprises! In fact, I think it's about time for Atlantic to put out a compilation of the stuff Rush has done since Presto, but there might not be sufficient 'commercial demand'.Anyways, the songs that are here are great. Judged on their own merits, they make up a great compilation disc that is worth every cent. And in terms of repackagings, Rush certainly hasn't had their catalogue exploited to the same extent that the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, or Kiss have, among MANY others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD + Different Stages = Great start for new Rush fans","review":"Tough to complain about the song selection here-- Serious Rush fans always differ on what their best material is, but these are all excellent tracks. If you enjoy these, then by all means dive deeper into the Rush catalog.As for the complaints that the release isn't necessary or that Rush is \\"cashing in\\" - These tracks fall under an earlier Rush record deal. The band had little to do with the decision; this was a record company choice according to recent comments from Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee.I any event- any vehicle that can attract new fans to Rush is fine by me. The re-mastered Retrospectives set is also excellent- as is the live Different Stages CD set. I'd avoid \\"Chronicles\\" (the audio CDs, not the DVD) as it is not the product of the excellent remastering efforts. Also, the Chronicles essay/liner notes and artwork are sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 STARS, For Casual Rush Fans","review":"This Compilation contains all the absolutely essentiel rush songs while they were in there prime, from 74 too 87.

Like I said above this compilation is only for Casual Rush fans so dont expect all the best of Rush. If your a die hard fan there is no compilation that will capture all their best so I urge you too buy all the albums betwwen 74 and 87.If you liked this compilation you might also like:Yes- The Very Best OfKing Crimson- The 21st Century Guide to King Crimson, Vol. 1Chilliwack- Greatest HitsJethro Tull- The Best Of"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it","review":"I have really enjoyed this game.

I have tried to get the difficult adjustments right and I have played around with them a lot and, no matter what I do, I can't get it to a position that's comfortable. Depending on the day, sometimes it ranges from noticeably uncomfortable to downright painful. The maximum tilt back position is a joke. I feel like I'm sitting straight up as opposed to being tilted forward otherwise. Reclining is just not possible in this chair, so even if it weren't uncomfortable, it would not be appropriate for home use. The left and right movement of the arms is incredibly annoying as they just move wherever with very little pressure. The lumbar support is a pain to get adjusted.

This is quite possibly better as an album in its entirity than any of the Primus albums were. I'm not sure I came across a song that needed to be skipped over. As far as musical genre, it's apples to oranges with Primus. But as an adult now I more enjoy this funky style that I can listen to with my 2 year old, than the hard \\"I probably shouldn't be driving this fast\\" Primus. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRIMUS SUCKS!!!!! Oooops, this is not P r i m u s","review":"Actually, this group is probably what Claypool assembled to get HIS best sound out.

That's why I bought this album without hearing anything from it. I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I think I got a little past half way. Les and the boys must have been high on some kick ass acid when they recorded this! The music is all over the place. There is no flow, no rythum, it's like a real bad experimental jam session that they put on CD. Buckethead adds nothing. His guitar playing abillities are not even showcased here except for maybe on one song. Les has done this kinda way out there stuff before and I've never liked it but this is an entire album of it and it and it is impossible to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been kind of out of the loop with Mr. Claypool lately (my main interest in this band, although I am interested in learning more about Buckethead). This is my assessment: there are two types of people--those who will love this album and think it genius and those who will be taken aback by the musicianship-over-song approach found on this album. Sure, there is unbelievable playing to be found here. But those of us who are drawn in by the lure of more output from Mr. Primus will find this to be no Brown Album, no Punchbowl, not even Antipop. Why? Because the focus is on technique and jam rather than driving, insanity-fuled bass/thrash manifesto SONGS. That is not to say it is a bad album, you just must know what you are getting into and what your tastes are. If you like jam bands, you are likely to have a delightful seizure with this album.

As in all her books, Holland achieves her effects quietly and with economy, conveying passion without sentimentality and fleshing out her well-researched historical knowledge with rare sympathy and insight into human nature.

But all I get from someone with \\"direct contact\\" with numerous species of aliens is vague descriptions and passing comments about their agenda/science/life buried inbetween minute details of Steward's story (which I rather not know so much about).

I guess you could say that Swerdlow's story kind of woke me up and caused me to realize what bunk all of this alien crap is. If there really are agents of misinformation perpetuated by the New World Order to confuse us and make us not believe, I don't think they could have done a better job than Swerdlow at making a person riding the fence of mainstream science and the paranormal jump quickly back over the mainstream side.

The company offered me to replace the handles a different color though).I got the handles and after two days I used the machine the same exact problem happened.When I called back the Omega repair service, they said that I could send it back for repair again each time my shipping cost was $20), they said it was my fault because I didn't tighten the nut strongly enough.

This novella alone makes the book well worth purchasing.The three shorts are indeed a welcome bonus. The opening one recounts the first encounter between Pascoe and Dalziel. \\"Dalziel's Ghost\\" is a humorous follow-up to \\"Pascoe's Ghost\\" and the book concludes with a surprisingly good sci-fi mystery with a murder on the Moon.

I am about to recycle the book in with my paper trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Begin 2006","review":"I LOVED One Nation Under God. I heard Mr. Moore speak during his book tour in Houston. He wowed an audience of several hundred with his disucssion of the book and his own personal odyessy. I then proceeded to buy and read his book and was even more bowled over. Mr. Moore presents a mosaic of American figures - famous and not so famous - that only reinforces the presence of prayer in our culture. Statesmen, farmers, scientists, slaves, business tycoons, and miners are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this eloquent testimony of American spirituality. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Audio","review":"To be honest I have not read One Nation Under God yet but hope to do so very soon. What I did do was to listen to the audio book over several days on my drives to and from work. I just finished listening to it a few days ago and cannot say enough good things about it. Never have I listened to something more engaging in conveying history the way it does. It really was incredible. The narrators were really awesome. If this audio recording does not find its way to winning awards for its creativity, execution, and what it represents I will be sorely disappointed. In addition to having historic figures read their own words, all kinds of narrators came together to read powerful excerpts in extraordinary ways. The author, who reads the text beautifaully and with conviction, does a great job as well, providing the glue to the whole thing. This is an audio book at its best. I urge people to listen to it on the road, at the beach, or at any other kind of leisure. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just History ... This is one HELL of a book","review":"While One Nation Under God provides a great read when it comes to America's past, I was taken by the way the author takes his reader into the future by probing into the faith of five young people under the age of 30. He showed how our history is not static, particualrly when it comes to our well of spiritual vitality. This is a terrific book that promises to keep on giving over the years. I am a fourth generation cattle hand with a high school education. I thought this book spoke to me in a whole lots of ways. I really appreciate the author's making thissuch a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Journey","review":"I love the scope and comprehensiveness of this book on prayer in America. Starting with the prayer life of Native Americans, and the early Spanish settlers then moving through the colonial period, to the Civil War and all the way to the present day the author traces US history through the lens of prayer. It is a fascinating study that makes you appreciate the richness and variety of how ALL Americans have prayed. The story is told from a historical point of view and not from a religious or political point of view. Some of the prayers I have begun to make my own. Throughout the book the author has shown how well known artists, musicians, writers, businessmen, public figures, religious leaders, and average Americans have prayed. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"System Overheats","review":"This system runs HOT, make it unsatble.Also the Overclocking is not working.buyers look for diffrent Computer, AMD Athlon makes more stable computers.Also the CD burner freezes once in a while, and makes the system to restart.If you are a begiiner don't buy this computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common knowledge","review":"For those that have been following the Z3, this book does not provide anything new if you have subscriptions to some of the more popular car magazines. Every page is a copy of an article on this or that magazine. The book only serves to reinforce the already common knowledge (for most of us anyways) that this car: drives like a roadster, looks like a roadster, it is a roadster!!

I was so estatic about them that i've been wearing them since i got them back in Dec '08 and have been wearing them at least every other day for hours b/c it doesn't seem to stretch or hurt in the beginning but now after 30+min i do feel some pain but to my disappointment, after taking them off my toes are still the same. Don't know what it is doing but it's not making my toes return to it's natural alignment like it said it's suppose to. On the plus side though, it is GREAT for pedicures b/c it keeps your toes nicely separated as the nail polish dries, so no smudging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"My friend gave me this as a hand me down and my 5 and 2 year old love it.

I thought they might enjoy pushing it, while learning to walk and riding on it a little until they were more sturdy on their feet, and it was so cheap I wouldn't be breaking myself if they hated it. Now my boys' 3rd birthday is approaching and this little car is still in the center of my den. My boys play on it daily, even now and I doubt they will ever tire of it. They ride it through the house and yard and it still looks as good as the day I bought it. While I have gone and bought more expensive and more complicated riding toys, this one still ranks supreme in their eyes...I dread the day they find out they are simply too big for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son has gotten a lot of miles out of this car.","review":"I got this for my son at about 9 mos. old. He would push it until he ran into something, then cruise around to the other side and push it again until he hit something else. It is a very stable walker, whether the baby is pushing from the front or back.My son is now 35 mos. old, and this little car is still one of the first things he pulls out of the garage when we go outside. Now he likes to race beside it down the driveway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"This is not the quality or design I expected from Little Tikes. The wheels are so tiny.

Spend at least $20 more on a heavier, more substantial ride-on vehicle for your child. My two-year-old son fell forward and cut open his chin on our cement patio while slowly driving this toy. This toy is unsafe because it is very lightweight and the front end is not heavy enough to prevent a child from falling forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"BREAKS easily. Awful Customer Service.","review":"DON'T BUY THIS! It's horribly flimsy. It broke when we - very carefully - put it together. I then called Little Tikes to complain and was put on hold for twenty minutes until I gave up. Tried again later and this time after 10 minutes of hold music enter in my phone number for a call back. I then received a call back but was put on hold again for 10+ minutes!!! I finally spoke to an agent named Alison who was rude and threatened to hang up on me when I tried to explain my problem.Just an awful company with ZERO customer service. Will never do business with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best push toy for a 1-year-old","review":"My 1-year-old inherted this push toy, along with four others, from various relatives. This is the one he uses, for pushing or for riding. The others serve as cars to crash this one in to.The key features that make him choose this are:(1) The front wheels don't turn. A car with turning front wheels is a bad idea for pushing since you can't hold onto the steering wheel when pushing.(2) The back push handle is the right height. Others are too short or don't have one at all.For me (Dad), I like the durability and lack of sharp edges. This car went through some large number of relatives before getting to us. It still holds up, even after I took a few turns riding it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to navigate","review":"This toy is great but it's wheels don't turn at all so it is very hard to navigate and turn around.

For the low price, this is a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This toy is great for kids that are beginning to balance themselves on toys. My son had recieved this toy for his 1st birthday and enjoyed playing with it a lot. My younger son, who is almost 1 now, enjoys it also just like his older brother did. The younger one has not learned to push himself forward on it yet, but he sits on it and tries to jump on it. My 4 year old would love to stand behind this walk with this which helped make his legs stronger. This is definitely a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, sturdy, and inexpensive toy!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old. I tested it out in the store, and was surprised to find that standing behind the toy, and pushing with all my weight on the yellow part, even I couldn't tip it over! My daughter, who at the time couldn't walk, immediately grabbed on and pushed the toy down the aisle, laughing the whole time.Now that she's two, she sits on her \\"car\\" and makes car noises while she rides around the house :) She loves it!Assembly was a bit tough, but not impossible.

It helped him to strenthen his legs and after a couple of weeks pushing it he is walking on his own. It was hard at first for him to walk with it because it would move to fast and he'd fall but after a few days he got the hang of it and off he went. Try putting rubber bands around the wheels so they wont move to fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ride On Toy!","review":"We had one of these cars for our son when he was little (now 11) and he loved it, so when it came time to get a ride on toy for our daughter, we went looking for a similar one. All of the ride ons in the store had so many bells and whistles on them, and seemed to be made very cheaply. We couldn't find this in stores so I finally went online and ordered it. We gave it to our daughter for her 1st birthday and she just LOVES it! She isn't walking yet but she loves to push it around the house. At first she would just stand up in the seat and hang on to the back handle, but now she's figured out how to sit on it and get on and off on her own so that's a whole new world of fun! Her feet are just beginning to touch the ground so she looks to us to push her around, but she also has a blast pushing it all over the the house! Definitely a great purchase if you are looking for a simple and solid toy that will last! Works great indoors and outside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the toy pictured, and a nightmare to put together.","review":"I bought this toy for my youngest grandchild for Christmas (I'm guessing at the ratings, since she hasn't received it yet). I started to put it together, but I didn't get very far: the parts were so ill-fitting that I didn't have the physical strength to do it. I got my son to help me, and it was a real struggle for him to get it together, even though he is strong and very handy. At one point we thought we'd have to send it back because we couldn't get a rod fastened from one end to the other. Now it's together (although I'm concerned that it won't be sturdy, given the barely connecting parts), and it's nothing like the racer pictured. It's blue with yellow and red, instead of all red, it doesn't have decals, and the shape is different. The box says \\"Push & Ride Racer,\\" but in fact the toy looks just like the Little Tikes Push & Ride Doll Walker also sold on Amazon. That's not what I wanted: I wanted the toy in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy...very unsafe","review":"ok we bought it we loved it the price was great BUTour son pushed and he got his feet caught all of a suddenand flipped forward and hurt himself pretty bad rug burns on his face not to mention he also is scared now!!! i have put the toy away and am waiting for a reply from little tykes about returning it i dont think i should have to pay the shipping costs when it is their problem they didnt make sure it wouldnt flip"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Zoomer","review":"Our dd started walking holding our fingers when she was six months and let me tell you did my back ever hurt from leaning over so much. I bought this so she could practice getting around our house without our help when she was 9 months old. WHAT A DEAL! Sturdy build, no busy annoying bells and whistles and it really helped build her confidence in walking. She quickly started pulling herself up by the back handle (it was scary for *me* at first because I thought the scooter would roll away on the hard wood floor, but she maneuvered it well). She graduated to holding onto the back handle and front handle at the same time, turning and sliding it wherever she wanted to go. She's 13 months now and walking on her own but is now learning to push herself along while sitting on the scooter. Bottom line: buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sturdy Very Reliaby","review":"We bought this item for our son who is one year old. He loves it, pushing with it, walking by it, sitting on and off and being pushed. This toy is designed for some wear and hard play. Comparing to other similar toys this one seems tough, it may not have all the sound and lights, but this one will last a couple of kids and have many moments of fun. And it is recyclable which is a plus for when it is done. Hope this helps, if not, do not let me know :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made and difficult to put together!","review":"I just put this together today, and my daughter hasn't had a chance to really use it yet, so I can't comment on durability, how much she likes it, etc. However, I felt compelled to write this immediately due to the inordinate amount of time and effort it took me to put this thing together. First of all, the pieces are extremely cheap looking, and they don't even seem to fit together properly- in fact, I worry that there may be some safety hazards (gaps between pieces, loose pieces, etc.). Assembly requires a hammer and a piece of plywood!?!? And you have to really hammer- it isn't just for popping things into place.I should have just put it back in the box to return but once I started it, I was determined to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st birthday toy","review":"This thing is so durable it can take anything your child can give it. This was my son's favorite toy when he was learning to walk, he pushed this around the house and the backyard every day, all day! Now that he's full-on running, he still loves to push it, although faster now, and he's getting the hang of riding on it too. When the neighborhood kids come over to play, they love taking turns pushing him around on it.Overall, this thing is great! Other reviewers have commented on the plain styling of it, but personally, I think that's one of it's benefits. You can use this toy with both boys and girls and, believe me, it will last thru multiple kids.Assembly does take a bit of time, but no where near as bad as getting most toys simply out of the box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 15 months old because it was the middle of winter and we were cooped up in the house with a newborn and I needed more things to entertain him! He absolutely loves this toy and I am so happy I bought it. He rides it all over the house, now that it is summer he takes it outside, and he loves putting things in the little shelf behind him (like his sippy cup). It's easy for him to get on and off and to ride it, it's low enough that he doesn't get hurt if he falls off - the only problem is that sometimes he tries to stand on it, so you do have to supervise. But I really love it, I put it together myself, in about 30 minutes. I would highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Quality!","review":"A Christmas gift for my son.

This toy is good for a child in the process of transitioning from crawler to walker (holding either the back handle or front handlebars as support) or as a ride on toy.

While the presentation of \\"Becoming Jane\\" (which has previously been released on Blu-Ray) is similar to its past incarnations in the format, the HD debut of the 1996 JANE EYRE from Franco Zeffirelli is a huge disappointment. The AVC encoded HD transfer included here in Echo Bridge's Blu-Ray looks very much like a standard-definition upscale with heavy filtering and scant detail in evidence.

The mix of stories leaves you wanting more. The three stories build to a crescendo like a piece of music. Then cuts out as if someone suddeny pulled the needle from the record. Starting with the first story, Thompson writes a stream-of-conscious meditation on his first time using mescaline. Next he gives a wild account of his poet-friend --- short and fast-paced.

This was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I had this book on my list for awhile. When I got the chance to read it, I settled in for what I thought would be an afternoon with the book. After the first ten pages, I starting flipping around looking for the bits where the author would get down to talking about Nobrow culture. It never really happens. There are a bunch of stories, mostly personal that he strings together, but they don't advance any particular idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"author disses nobrow -- but then joins the pack","review":"Author Seabrook takes major potshots at (amongst others) Conde Nast's New Yorker Magazine, which he acknowledges has become less an intellectual exercise than a cultural monitor of our marketing state, which it was never designed to be. Here his assessment of what The New Yorker stood for is right on the money. He quickly points out that these changes are all thanks to the editor in chief Tina Brown, then brand-spanking new (and prior to her departure for Talk Magazine). Having spent many pages dissecting how The New Yorker has run itself into the ground by covering media-friendly topics (the antithesis of intellect) and hiring illustators to provide provocative art to gussy up their dreadfully dull covers, he then is cornered by Brown who gives him a Lowbrow celebrity profile assignment. AND HE TAKES IT! Thus buying into the behavior he classifies as Nobrow. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-written dirge","review":"This is not so much a book about culture as a book about John Seabrook. There is little structure to it, and the tone is self-congratulatory. Although he hits many good points with regard to the commercialization of American culture, it is -- and this is what makes the book hypocritical -- ultimately a work without soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader, flee from this book","review":"This is a very revealing book, but it tells the reader a good deal more about the Seabrook family -- father and son -- than it does about the admittedly dismal state of American culture. The elder and younger Seabrooks come across as a couple of rich twerps -- from the CEO father with his two-story closet stuffed with a lifetime's wild spending on Saville Row tailoring, to the hot-young-writer-about-SoHo son agonizing over whether to buy a $200 Helmut Lang T-shirt that couldn't be washed or it would fade. Seabrook the Younger apparently considers himself quite the deep thinker, but he constantly mistakes pedestrian reportage for piercing analysis. All in all, I was reminded of Truman Capote's take on \\"On the Road\\" -- that it wasn't writing but typing. In short, stay clear of this pretentious, utterly muddle-minded book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reason For Reading Nobrow","review":"In what reads like a series of loosely-related magazine pieces strung together, Seabrook displays his profound grasp of the obvious. Seabrook thinks his rich daddy was hibrow because he read the New Yorker and appereciated High Art - Sonny Boy doesn't understand that the New Yorker was always middlebrow, and that his father's passions were an aspiring aristo joke. Seabrook thinks he's different from Rich Dad because he likes the Chemical Brothers. Wow! Is he just slumming, or does he really not get the implicit irony? And do we really need to be told this again? I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overblown New Yorker Article","review":"Although the title looked enticing, I was greatly disappointed as I read this slim volume. I was vaguely told what \\"Nobrow\\" was, but no whys, no wherefores. Was it a celebration of Nobrow or a critique? The book contains profiles of what the author sees as noted Nobrow figures, like David Geffen and George Lucas. They seemed to be re-edited New Yorker articles, and are nice as they go, but after 200 or so pages, I still don't have much of a clue as to what Nobrow really is. I did, however, learn who the author was. He seems to be the sub-text of this book. We know he is a feature writer at the New Yorker, a Princeton grad, and lives somewhere in Tribeca. If you want to read a book about today's culture and its roots, read Thomas Franks' The Conquest of Cool. If you want to read a book about the New Yorker, try Bright Lights, Big City. At least it's more honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I second alot of what other people say","review":"This book is very self indulgent. I can't think of any bad things to say about this book that have not already been said. Seabrook has a flimsy Idea of what he thinks Nobrow means and builds it up to be a philosophy that doesn't really get executed. The only good things about this book are the four or five interesting stories about the behind the scenes of MTV, Star Wars/Lucas, Ben Kweller and so on. Mind you these subjects are only loosely drawn into his mindless philosophy. I was hoping I would like this book, I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book...","review":"This book is terrible. I got through the first few \\"chapters' well enough, but it felt like the author kept saying and espousing the same rhetoric over and over again. On my second day of reading, I was really fed up with this book. I left it on the city bus for someone else to pick up and read... there's really nothing new offered in this book, especially since its now so out-dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Vintage Books has been somewhat dishonest in the marketing of the book. The description on the back of the book is quite different from the content inside. Rather than providing perspective on the \\"marketing of culture,\\" Mr. Seabrook merely gripes about the politics of working at The New Yorker. I was very disappointed and found the narrative to be flat, even dull. At times, Mr. Seabrook's style is extremetly pompous, always self-absorbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly little book.","review":"Is this some sort of dismal trend? A New Yorker \\"writer\\" taking a dumb little idea that he undoubtedly thinks is brilliant, worth at best a few hundred words as an op-ed piece in the New York Post, and instead inflating it into an overpriced, overhyped book that would float on helium? First Malcolm Gladwell and now John Seabrook.... No wonder the New Yorker is what it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader, spare yourself","review":"This is a very revealing book, but it tells the reader a good deal more about the Seabrook family -- father and son -- than it does about the admittedly dismal state of American culture.

His quick visits with popculture 'tastemakers' are insightful and interesting if not terrably deep. His arguements for his Nobrow theory are many but by the end I felt that for every arguement FOR Nobrow I could think of one AGAINST Nobrow.The book itself is a work of Nobrow - I suppose that's the idea. It's little more than repackaged best bits, or directors cut, from Seabrooks recent New Yorker pieces, tied together with banal reporting on walking through Times Square and Sunday shopping on Prince St. Knopf publishing a book by a posh New Yorker writer who takes such pleasure in how many times he can mention Bananna Republic and Helmut Laing in a book is the crux of Nobrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost comforting, in a weird way","review":"How can one be criticize culture when the absolute standards of measurement have been replaced by cultural relativism? The answer wouldn't satisfy fans of Robert Pirsig; Quality has been replaced by \\"Authenticity\\", which is generally defined as whatever the opinion polls say it is. Although Seabrook is no sociologist, this very interesting behind-the-scenes look at big-time media players is enjoyable food for thought, and even strangely comforting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-consuming Seabrook Comes up Short","review":"This book read more like Seabrook's autobiography and should have been titled \\"My New Yorker Years\\". What's the difference between the culture of marketing and the marketing of culture (and more importantly, what's the relevant argument here)? After two hundred odd pages, it beats me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal view of the state of \\"culture\\"","review":"A very enjoyable read; Seabrook is a fine writer. He covers his cultural background with self-deprecating style. He interviews George Lucas, David Geffen and others.I had expected more of a business book--How to Market Culture or Lack Thereof--and this is not that. I'm from Silicon Valley--we don't relate to Seabrook's Manhattan town house experience with the New Yorker magazine. But his opinions and experiences make for a cultural vacation of sorts. He writes well, and he must be on to something--looking around at the turn of the century I had almost neglected to ask, \\"Why did we build all those opera houses and art museums, anyway?\\" Something about \\"culture\\" has profundly shifted and fairly recently--Seabrook is an entertaining detective with a somewhat inconclusive report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I could not even get this game to install. After about an hour perusing The Adventure Company website, and doing everything they recommended, I called their tech support.

They were not willing to do anything further until I sent them the disc for \\"testing\\" -- to Canada, at my own expense. If you do buy this game, SAVE YOUR RECEIPT! There is a good chance you will need to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 'Cameron Files' game. It was atmospheric, the characters were quirky, and interesting, and the story line was reasonably consistent. It wasn't the best Adventure game I've ever played, but it gave me a few evenings of harmless amusement.As for the sequel......It seems incomplete. The story line has gaps, there are characters who appear, contribute nothing to the plot, then disappear (What was the telepathic Russian countess all about, for heaven's sake?). There are puzzles which lead nowhere - like the 'coded' message found on an Enigma machine, which turned out to be a depressingly simple cipher and which wasn't used later in the game. The settings were bland and uninteresting; the designers could have learned something from Riddle of the Sphinx.I can't help suspecting that it was rushed out in time for Christmas?Was it the worst Adventure game I've played? No. I reserve that honour for 'Jekyll and Hyde'. It was a close second, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"So linear it should be a ruler","review":"I didn't care for the first Cameron Files, so I didn't expect much from this, the second one -- and I was right. It is so linear that it's boring and illogical (you can't leave the hotel without first finding certain items in your own room -- what sense does THAT make?)Plus, the movement is tedious and repetitive. You end up going around in circles trying to figure out what the game wants you to do next (not what makes any sense).I managed about one hour's game time before I uninstalled it. Well, that's an hour of my life I'll never get back!On the plus side, it installed -- and uninstalled -- without a glitch. Big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small pillow","review":"I have the small size pillow, mainly because I didn't realize it was a small when I bought it. We recently went on a road trip/camping trip last week and this came in very handy. While it is too small for me to use as a sleeping pillow at night, it is great for in the car or on a plane. I kept falling asleep in the car and it was very comfy/. You just have to give it a good 10-20 minutes to fluff up after you unwrap it, then it's nice and fluffy/comfy.

When it arrived, I was surprised to find out the front stayed at an angle. To remove the top you must slide the top piece out and off, the lid does not lift up. Because the front is at an angle, when your not using it to hold a recipe card, it is difficult to store the box. The slanted front makes it wider and it takes up a lot more space. I just think if the top lifted up, it would be easier and faster to look through the cards without taking the whole top on and off.So for storage it doesn't work very well and for ease of use it's not the best design. The description would have been better if it had mentioned that the top and slanted front were one piece. The over all quality seems fine, but I feel the design is not the best it could be.

If we hop in the time machine and go back to 2001, we find that these phones were still in common use and that any device that you'd sell for a phone line would have to support them.

Anyone who has struggled with Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept will appreciate Niesenson's attempt to explain how the \\"concept\\" helped shape the direction of Miles, Trane and Bill Evans."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely annoying, many mistakes and a shame!","review":"This book has a complete misleading title.It should be called \\"Eric's stupid opinions\\", because this book is certainly NOT about the making of the great record \\"Kind of Blue\\".Just one chapter steps into the sessions, but Eric gives wrong data and introduces Teo Macero as the producer of this record, and that is also completely wrong.If you want anything serious on this subject buy Ashley Kahn's book, with the same title.Eric has not done any research at all and uses this book to promote his other work on John Coltrane and other \\"free\\" jazz.That's not only misleading, it's a shame!Arnold van Kampen, jazzcritic Netherlands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fawning with a vengeance","review":"Okay, there is some interesting information here, but there's also quite a bit of fiction. Too often, the author infers the state of mind of his subjects. So he was a friend of Miles. Was he also psychic?I agree with another reviewer that the book is fawning. While the author of this book ascribes much of Miles' anti-social behavior to principle, still another reviewer correctly points out that it actually reveals him to be a jerk. The author's adoration of Miles taints his objectivity. The result is an unwitting and failed attempt at a snow job.Ashley Kahn's book on the making of Kind of Blue (which see) is not as adulatory, but in attempting to include musical information Kahn makes many errors, and glosses over the numerous mistakes Columbia Records made in recording and releasing the album.Browse through this book for the fun of it, if you're amused by fairy tales and delight in the hype of a press release."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONY is sooo bad, why is anyone buing them??","review":"I have a sony pcg-fx300p, I have had problems with this laptop since the first day I opened the box. You should also know that I have previously bought two (2) other computers from sony. Well my experience with Sony is that their products are only and nothing else but complete fluff. They brake, they malfunction, the support is terrible, yes they are nice on the telephone and will send you a box just like IBM, but their tech department will return the machine to you with no corrections but a mere reinstalation of the OS.Anyone reading this, don't buy sonY, it stucks.My laptop is under warantee, I have had the product repaired twice, of course I have't been able to obtain an exchange machine.Please don't buy Sony if you cherish your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilot Chrono watch disappointing","review":"Due to no fault of the manufacturer, this watch is too bulky for me and not comfortable.

Just a couple of minor complaints. First, the saw comes with just one blade, and it is very course. Second, included in the kit were two red plastic rectangles, about 1.5 x 7/8 inch, which look like they would cap something. I have no idea what they are for, and there is no mention of them in any of the literature.

I showed it to a group of 2nd and 3rd graders this past Sunday, and I don't think they'll forgive me for it any time soon. They were bored silly, and therefore missed the entire point the movie made.

I pray I can be a witness worthy of God's unchanging love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Once again, it's a book that will bring you to your knees at the feet of Jesus Christ. We here in America have no idea what persecution is. I treasure this book and have read it twice. The incredible example of these martyrs is just amazing. It has really challenged my relationship with Christ and brought me to realize how much more I should stand up for him and take advantage of the freedom I have. This is an awesome book to help strengthen your faith. Their stories must be told!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Jesus Freaks","review":"This is a wonderful book and dC talk did a wonderful job puting these stories together.

Would you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally good book, but misses the mark on fairness.","review":"I love to read about martyrs for Christ, but I became alarmed by the authors continued negative representation of those from Catholic and Orthodox faiths. Saints and sinners (and martyrs) can be found from any faith. It is hard to imagine how some of the obvious Catholic martyrs (Thomas More, John Foster, Fr. Miguel Pro, Edith Stein, Fr. Maximilian Kolbe and many, many more) were not included in a work of this sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I thought this book was very inspiring.

If you didn't realize that this sort of martyrdom still existed, then this is a frightening wake-up call. Otherwise, these stories will just amaze you. dc Talk and the Voice of the Martyrs has done a very nice job of putting together these stories from all over the world, interspersed with scripture, lyrics, and quotes. At the end is a synopsis of each country mentioned and the situation there currently. There are also several addresses in the back to encourage you to get involved. Thank God for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Myths, lies, deception, misinformation and paranoia","review":"From the opening where they use the lie Churches used to get converts after the Colobine shootings. To labeling all contries as enemies of the Church. This book shows Fundamentlist Christianity for what it is, a religion based on lies and deciption to gain converts.Rember the old saying when reading this book. \\"Faith is beliving what you know aint true.\\" The lies in this book show that, it's as if Christianities real martyrs aren't enought they must also make up ones with unreasonable stories.So much for the love of god."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Inspiration","review":"This book is probably the best book I've read since the Bible. It is a true inspiration to anyone with enough guts to read it. It challenges your faith and your love for Christ. It leaves you asking yourself if your worthy to journey down the narrow road of this Christian walk. I truly enjoyed this book, each individual's story will touch in a unique way. If you have the courage to read it you will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom is Precious","review":"I got this book as a birthday gift from my brother. I started reading it at once and it has captured my heart. It is a cry for believers and non-believers in the Christian religion. It shows that even today in the present Christians are being tortured for their faith. It will challenge even the strongest Christian. DC Talk writes this book skillfully. Putting us in the peoples' lives and what they are going through. The reader feels the pain of the person going through it. This book shows that people from the U.S. and other free countries should hold their freedom of religion closely. I have a question for you. Will you risk your life for God like these people did?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring stories of the faith of those martyred for Christ","review":"I first bought this book based on the fact that my favorite music group contributed to it. That changed after a few pages of reading. \\"Jesus Freaks\\" holds provocative, inspiring stories of the undying faith of those who were martyred in the name of Jesus Christ. Some of the people mentioned in the book were tortured. Some had family members killed in front of them. Some had withstood the effects of brainwashing. All were firm in their faith. I would highly recommend \\"Jesus Freaks\\" to anyone interested in being inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want a thrill? Check this out.","review":"I have only skimmed this book but I plan on buying it very soon. Although I am only a teenager, I realize that these people's walk with God was strong enough to trust Him so much that they'd give up their lives for Him. It got me thinking that if the Lord were to come back today as He promised in the Bible, or someone held a gun to my head and asked me whether or not I believed in God, would my belief in God be strong enough to know I'd end up in Heaven? Or would I lie about the truth and what I really thought to \\"save\\" my life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, Amazing, Worth every penny and every minute spent reading","review":"I have been in full-time Christian service for years and was inspired by this book to really live for Christ.

I live in Australia, so I probably won't end up in the same situations as those in the book but know I want to do something for God. I recommend that anyone and everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY eye opening","review":"I don't like books, I rarely read any, but because this was by dc Talk, the ones who made my faith even stronger & made me think about my life at Spirit West, and how it was about Martyrs, made me get it. I was very glad to get it and I am recommending this book to EVERYONE. I am quoting this book to my un-saved best friend in hopes that she will see the truth. I, myself, started living life to the fullest by how much of an impact these stories are. Each day my faith grows stronger. I'm VERY happy that this book was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomended gift to kid's ages 8 on up!!","review":"I teach a 4th thru 6th grade Sunday school class and when I found this book and began brousing through it, God put on my heart to read single accounts each week from it to my class. I have been giving it as a reward to the diligent kid's that bring their Bibles and memorize their weekly scriptures. I only give away (2) copies every other week because I want them to work for this book and to appreciate what they hear from it each week. Also,I can't afford to buy more than (4) copies each month. I know that kid's will read this and that God will use it to create a hunger for more of His Word in them just as Foxe's book of Martyrs did for me when I was younger. Parent, Teachers or anyone: Give this book away and read it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could you?","review":"This book challenges our faith in a very real way. Not only does it ask \\"Can you die for Him?\\" but can you be brutally tortured for Him? Dying is easy compared to what martyrs endure in these stories. Don't read this book unless you are ready to face yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Freak Here","review":"I purchased this book mostly because the title caught my attention. I have found this book to be best for light reading as it consists of hundreds of christian martyr accounts. Although the book has many sad stories, I found it very uplifting to read the bravery of believers from hundreads of years ago to present day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chandler is back","review":"It's an ok show if you like friends.

I just felt his character was uninteresting and lame. Going into a grief therapy session and getting the \\"kooky\\" participants to compete for who has the saddest story could have been funny if anything about it was well-done. His little Fruit-throwing tantrum to prove he actually is affected by his wife's death also wasn't funny. (But I guess we all laugh at different things.)No depth, no wit, no real characters. Nothing to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desparately trying to be funny","review":"You think of Matthew Perry and you think of a fast paced witty TV episodes. Friends, Studio60 and even the odd stint on the West Wing are all great vehicles for his talent. If you are expecting GoOn to be added to that list, then move on.With a 'One Flew over the Cuckoos nest' premise Perry is in a support help group of misfits whom he plays off of for comedic effect. Falls completely flat. Not even remotely funny.Fortunately Amazon Prime gave it away for free but the pilot has done nothing to have me tune in to the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Comedy in Ages","review":"This is the best new comedy in ages and ages. It is funny from start to finish. Also thought provoking. My entire family, from the teens to the adults love this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV Show","review":"My problem with all other shows or movies with Matthew Perry is that I still see him as Chandler and that I don't want to see him as any other character. Go On remedies that. I want to get to know Ryan King and am cheering for him just as much as I was cheering for Chandler in Friends. Matthew Perry, coupled with a great supporting cast and the always funny John Cho, this show is guaranteed to make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"Love this show.

The picture appears to be a bright, vibrant red, but in reality, the color is more like a drab maroon. It doesn't go with my decor at all.

I found the whole idea behind the story to be completely disturbing, especially when the book is geared at preschool age children. The fact that book goes as far as to say at the end when the mother reunites her son's newly found lost pumpkin head with the body they had kept in a \\"cool dry place\\". I'm sorry, but that's just creepy. I will say that the rhyming nature of the book was fun and enjoyable, but the storyline itself was just horrid.

It's quirky, it's laugh-out-loud funny, and... well... it's a little dark and edgy. It's a tonic for all parents tired of reading those sugar-sweet children's books to their kids. This one will entertain both parents and children alike -- a rollicking adventure for the kids, and some delightful humor for mom and dad. To make things better, this is a beautifully designed book -- small, square, exquisite woodcuts. This is the best picture book I've read all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great programme for kids","review":"My kids love this programme. They even like the characters which was surprising.

I thought \\"Fever For The Flava\\" & \\"Going Down On It\\" would be the only good songs on there....I THOUGHT WRONG! The lyrics are catchy, easy to sing to, good guitar solos/riffs, some of the stuff on there album is mellow but all in all it is a great CD to pick up at your local best buy/circuit city (I didn't say wal-mart or k-mart cuz they have the edited versions wich aren't that great).

I bought the album and realized that although it's not all as energetic as their first radio release, it is a great cd never-the-less. It reminds me of old school Red Hot Chili Peppers but not as polished. You know the good'o Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic days. Hey, the rough edges are what I like. Whether or not their the next R.H.C.P or not, I like their music. Maybe the only thing these two groups have in common is that they both have \\"HOT\\" in their names.

I listened to the entire cd once and that was once to much. The lyrics and music are terrible. Their sound is a cross between a generic limp bizkit and sugar ray. Both bands are generic now anyway. The lyrics are pointless, and range from eating crotch to retarded sappy lines about nothing. There is nothing good about the cd. The music is just as awful. Recycled nu metal riffs with generic break downs. If you buy this you will kick yourself in about 2 days, and promptly leave the cd at the bottom of your cd pile. Horrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT ACTION COP","review":"I met the band at a radio station wmms100.7, got a cd and I was blown away!!! The music was great and the lyics were well thought of.

Thanks guys..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is the first cd I can remember listening to where I enjyoed every single song. The songs are just unbelieveably catchy. HAC sounds like nothing I've ever heard before. Some may complain that their style varies too much, but it's a refreshing change to me. It also helps that the band started up in my hometown of Nashville. Maybe now we'll be known for more than just country music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"This book describes the physiological aspects of memory. However, it does it in a fairly scatterbrained way without continuity between chapters. Also, the information is fairly anecdotal and the science is \\"dumbed down\\" significantly.

He mentioned he had NO idea what to do as a best man, so we wanted to give him something to help. I brought the book home and read it and I was astounded. Here I was thinking it was an honest, helpful guide. (It seemed like one when I flipped through the pages in the store) However, I was MOST disappointed to see that it was much more something you might give an 18 year old best man as a joke and hope he gets it. It made a mockery of a very important role in any wedding and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone. Utterly useless.Taken as a joke, it's passing funny.

The only thing I really appreciated with the Let's Go books were their colored maps of certain major cities (which you can pick up at any tourist information center without buying the book). Their directions for getting to places were very vague--I couldn't find half of the hostels or restaurants I wanted to go to with this book. In addition, I found some of their smaller maps to place icons of places in completely different locations than where they were located in the city, but they still gave the correct address. Lonely Planet books were much more reliable, and I believe that the Rick Steves' books are the best on the market if you want to actually experience a city and not just it's tourist traps with \\"We speak english\\" in every window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide","review":"Let's Go was an invaluable part of our trip to Europe. It has a lot of countries you probably wont be visiting, so the weight of the book can seem daunting at times. It's defiantly not a pocket guide, but it does a great job of listing where to sleep, eat and have fun in each city. I would say it doesn't offer much commentary or advice on the actual sites (get an Eyewitness guide for that) but is essential for it's hostel/hotel listings. The information was very accurate (although the prices have gone up a little) and the transit time information was great for planning an itinerary ahead of time. As far as overall resourcefulness, I would say it beat Rick Steve's, Eyewitness and Lonely Planet. It's also oriented towards people who want to have fun and is the best guide for nightlife listings."},{"rating":"2","title":"the single BEST travel book for students","review":"Let's Go covers EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know, and it does it in a realistic manner. The information is real straight-forward-here is where you will find out the cleanest hotels to stay in, the tourist attractions that are over-rated,and where to eat for $5. Plus, it covers all of the European countries and the major cities in each. It also has the weirdest hard to find info of any travel book, like gay-and-lesbian nightlife, maps of each city, and what the locals suggest you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"europe the easy way","review":"Europe 2000 was invaluable on my recent trip around europe.

Living Deliberately is so diverse in style and range. The title track offers up everyday observations about life which ring true for us all. \\"Desperately Seeking Grace\\" echoes the frustrations of trying to get it right time after time - who can't relate to that? Zip into the jumping \\"Bayou Josie\\" and just TRY not to tap your feet. The Celtic tinged \\"High Above the Hills of Sligo\\" is haunting with the inclusion of bagpipes without being too heavy. Then, there's a perfect cover of Gram Parsons' \\"Brass Buttons.\\" All in all, the disc is very pleasing and includes great guest musicians and vocalists such as Pierce Pettis, Mimi Hearn, Scott Long and guitar virtuoso Bill Wharton just to name a few. Buy copies for your friends as well. They'll thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Promise, Shabby Delivery","review":"I wasn't really expecting much from a budget-label DVD set, but I do pick them up on the cheap when I can as a means of screening obscure or hard to find films. That way I can decide whether or not to seek out better, higher-quality editions.In this instance, the films were the sort of 50's and 60's era blood and thunder you'd expect, but the faded, beaten and tinny-sounding public domain/TV prints they used left the films more anaemic and wheezing than blood and thunder.The fault is not the films themselves (which are actually rather interesting), but rather with the shabby, low-budget source material used and the indifferent digital transfer.As the previous reviewer stated, I would be embarassed to screen these for a Bible Study group or film appreciation class, but for private home viewing they should tide you over until somebody releases better editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Material Too Old","review":"No reviews available pre-purchase.

So, it was fitting that I purchase a book with great reviews and about something he loves.This is the only Elsa Beskow book we own right now and I am impressed. The book was written in 1901, I believe. The illustrations are fantastic. The story is creative. And my son was excited when we met the 'King of blueberry land.' The Raspberry girls were exciting because they were a dramatic contrast to the blue.I like the message of gathering something for his mothers birthday and making her a card, especially in a day and age where we buy all our gifts.This is a good book for my three year old and I am sure we will continue to read it as he is learning to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing book, horrible small format in this edition","review":"Elsa Beskow's \\"Peter In Blueberry Land\\" is one of our favorite children's books. The illustrations are lovely and the story delights a wide range of ages. The only problem is that this particular format (a hardcover book measuring 6.7\\" wide x 5.2\\" tall) does not do justice to such a treasure. The pictures are not as enjoyable and, in many cases, the publishers of this edition have chosen to place text on top of the illustrations. It is definitely worthwhile seeking out the larger format hardcover book (12.5\\" wide x 9.5\\" tall) as you will want to keep it for future generations. It would be better, in my opinion, to buy a good second hand copy of the larger book than a new smaller version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal Children's Book","review":"This book is without doubt one of the best children's books out there. Elsa Beskow, having written most of her works between 1900-1925, doesn't have the same exposure in bookstores of more recent authors backed by large publishing houses, but her books are true gems. \\"Peter in Blueberry Land\\" is an excellent story full of adventure and humor but absent any saccharine moralizing or fluffy language. The illustrations are balanced, appealing, and elegant. The couplets in this story actually rhyme in the original Swedish edition, but the translation is quite good and captures the correct tone. Great for age 18 months and up. Don't forget to look at Beskow's other books too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original translation!","review":"Please be aware that this is not the original translation (or at least the 1975 one). I mistakenly bought this, even especially looking for the large format edition, and found that it was not the one I remembered from my childhood. The original translation in entitled Peter's Adventures in Blueberry Land and in translated by Sheila LaFarge. I found the original to be much more quaint and it correctly identifies the mother in red as Mrs. Lingonberry, not Mrs. Cranberry. Why would they translate it as cranberry, when Elsa Beskow goes to the trouble to try and illustrate her botanicals correctly? Anyway, I wanted others to avoid the same mistake and disappointment. I wish the publishers and booksellers had made the difference more clear.BTW, so far, findings of Sheila LaFarge translation are very expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required to use your RPS, but expensive and short. Also, not for new 2960S","review":"I'm using these short, heavy-duty cables with my Cisco RPS2300, and older Cisco Catalyst 2970 and 2960 gig switches. The cables are as expected: heavy-duty, proprietary design, looks like good quality, and you'll pay the premium price because you need it to use your RPS unit.They really could be a few feet longer. Even in a well designed telecom rack, these cables are on the short side for going top to bottom.Although the Catalyst2970 is too old to be listed in the official support matrix for the RPS2300, I found online release-notes indicating support, and tested that failover functioned as expected.

Perry, an Iowa-born playwright who turned to writing essays and short stories during his later years, has a natural ear for dialogue, and a wonderful gift for language and the art of storytelling. I read these pieces when they were first published in the author's local newpaper, the Daily Hampshire Gazette in Northampton, Mass., and someone finally had the good sense to compile and collect these gem-like stories in one place. Terrific photos of the artist as a young man, and of small-town life in the '20's and '30's, as well.

I thought the microwavable is the answer, I was wrong about this one. This wax does not melt properly with recommended time, it brittles easily and does not remove all hair.

And I actually moved my microwave into the bathroom to try and minimize the mess.I tried it on my upper lip, too, and it worked a little better there, but it still left quite a bit of fuzz. Maybe 2 or 3 tries would have gotten it all, but of course, it hurts (no surprise), and I didn't think the repeated pain was worth it.Also, I'm not sure how this amount of wax is supposed to be enough for your legs--the best I could come up with was to keep reusing the same wax...?Oh, well, it was an experiment.

Thought a wax that didn't need strips would be faster. Maybe for small patches you can get the proper thickness, but on legs and thighs, putting down a longer length is necessary and keeping it thick is hard.

If you're into Steve Morse and wish he'd put out more instrumental solo stuff, the Travis Larson Band is a great alternative. (Morse doesn't have much in the way of solo instrumental stuff.)

SSE-2 is a feature built into current Intel and future AMD CPUs. If you don't have it, software that uses it will run slower.

The number of periods missed in the first short story alone boggles the mind. It's depressing to see a publisher care so little about their customers (and their authors!) that they would foist something this horrible onto them.

This is a magnificent collection. The first story starts the collection off with a bang with its clever surprise ending. The novella \\"A Second Chance at Eden\\" is worth the price of entry by itself. This fine gem is a rare science fiction mystery story that works. You'll not only be stunned by how the crime was done but also why. It is the best novella I have read in a while. The novella \\"Escape Route\\" is an engrossing action adventure that in any other story collection would be considered its high point. There is no weak story in this collection. On the strength of this collection I have bought all of Peter Hamilton's other books. I am looking forward to reading them. Do yourself a favor and buy \\"A Second Chance at Eden\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I first read Hamilton's epic series and mostly continued reading them because the future he envisioned I found fascinating. The story was somewhat predictable. I picked up this book thinking I'd get more of the same. You do get more of Hamilton's interesting world, especially a history of how the social groups and technology he describes in his epic series come about. However, the stories are anything but predictable. Every single story, I thought I had figured out and there would be no more surprises, turned out to have a twist at the end that completely astonished me. It was great being fooled each time. I highly recommend this one to everyone even readers that didn't like his epic series.

Noticeably devoid of his trademark electronic sampling this time around, his latest is a bit more mellow, a touch more \\"organic\\", a shade more hearfelt than his others. You won't find any danceable grooves or tribal overtones on this album ... instead he paints for us a decidedly more serene and sensitive aural landscape by utilizing a more acoustic palette. The end result is a refreshingly bold and evolutionary step forward in O'Hearn's already distinguished musical career. I have a lot of respect for this artist, and have been a devoted fan since his first album over ten years ago. He has consistently impressed me with his imagination and innovative style.

It's sleepy and dreamy, a la some of the less percussive tracks on \\"Metaphor,\\" and more in the style of his first two albums. Somehow, it lacks the mysticism and magic of those albums, though.

The only small negative is more photos of the finished foods could be added--there is a fair amount but I always think the more the better in a cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I've had this book as well as \\"Simply Classic\\" for 5 years now and they are my go-to books when I need a nice meal for guests. You know your meal is a success when your guests won't leave without a copy of the recipe. My family's favorites are Pork Tenderloin with Maple Glaze on pg. 185 and Gourmet Mac'n'Cheese on pg. 122. and there are so many more we love. The ingredient list can seem lengthy and specify a lot of fresh ingredients, but that's what makes the recipes so great. The recipes are not really complicated at all...give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and Fake","review":"Horrible. The storyline dragged, and when it didn't, it was awkward and confusing. I have a feeling that York really wanted to use Detective Jack Thornton in a story, but couldn't figure out how his story might feature a werewolf, so she just came up with this weird, convoluted plot that had absolutely nothing to do with werewolves at all. The whole thing seemed forced.Also, after two books I think I've decided I officially don't like Rebecca York's dialogue. Again, it all sounded forced and fake. Yes, this IS a fiction book, so of course the dialogue is fake. BUT a good writer should make the dialogue sound believable...like it could actually have come from a real person...no matter what the situation is. This just didn't. It seemed very amateurish and unrealistic.I have the third in the series already, but I am really hesitating even starting it. I'm getting the feeling that Rebecca York just isn't my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"why is this the second book in a werewolf based series? ross was only a suporting charater and really only a tool the author used to bridge the gaps in the story so she could get back to the smut.. as a werewolf fan and not a romance fan i wished i just skipped this book and gone straight to the 3rd book. i've read all 3 books already and you can safely skip the second book and go to the 3rd and not miss much at all. the 3rd basically fills you in enough about the second book that even if she writes a forth with charaters from the second book you could still understand everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I got into this book without knowing WHAT I was getting into.

That's when I noticed the alligator, and recalled all of the polo shirts I used to have with that gator on them, and then it hit me. So I went out and bought a small bottle to see if I would like it.This stuff smells absolutely terrific. It's the one cologne I've worn recently that's actually gotten comments - every other cologne people have smelled before, so it's nothing new, but this one got people's heads turning. It's just a great scent, period.

I began teaching in Fall 2003 and can say that this book is amazingly accurate. While there have been a number of program changes (noted in the epilogue) the essential experience remains the same - the daily, even sometimes hourly, ups and downs of being a first year teacher with so little training is described in such exquisite detail that the book is, somewhat surprisingly, a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really disappointed","review":"I was a new teacher in a difficult Baltimore school, and this book was very unrealistic and only scratched the surface of the problem. Ms. Moffett is an angel and to be admired, but the author Abby Goodnough Hollywood-izes her experience and really waters down the problems in inner city schools.I felt the author didn't really understand the experience of new teachers. She doesn't get into the student's lives at all. She doesn't seem to be upset or outraged by the terrible treatment of Ms. Moffett by the administration. And-- at the end-- she glosses over the fact that most of Ms. Moffett's colleagues leave the profession within a couple of years, meaning that hundreds of students still won't have teachers. This is deeply unfair to the students, but this book skims right over that injustice.This book is a simple, nice read, but it was not hardhitting enough and it gives no concrete advice or guidance to new teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crappy rock.","review":"Get some Van Halen, It will make this seem like childs play.

But you'd think someone would have run it through an editing machine at least once in the past 15 years. The picture and sound are terrific, but the DVD is exactly like it was on TV so many years ago, bad transitions and everything. Perhaps I'm being picky, but the the transitions between scenes is for lack of a better term, sloppy. The picture would either freeze for a few seconds or seem to cut out prematurely before moving to the next scene.Also, I was saddened to find that there is no option to activate subtitles. While it's mostly in English, the dialogue is not the easiest to follow even to those who aren't hard of hearing.All complaining aside, I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it to anyone who's into historical dramas, and even to those who aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you Shaka","review":"There is nothing better than having the whole miniseries of Shaka Zulu in a beautiful box with all the episodes in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic mini-series + Real Zulu homelands + Supporting actors from Africa + Authentic costumes + Not interesting as the book","review":"I borrowed this set of 3 DVDs from my local library.

For example, the fact that he will choose a camera of a specific brand over a better camera from another brand only because of the name printed on the body is simply laughable.

I searched extensively througout my version of Elements and could not find any access to color channels or curves. After searching on the web, I've concluded they aren't there. He also spends a lot of time discussing the use of layers. The layers discussion is impossible to follow using Elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"I owe a lot to this book","review":"It has everything that a lay man needs to know in order to make best use of his digital camera. In fact you should buy the book before buying a camera as it has a pretty good guide about what various features mean and what you should look for based on your needs/budget.You do not need to know anything about photgraphy (digital or film) to follow this book. It will teach you from scratch - all you need to know about framing, white balance, and focus and exposure control. Also includes a great deal of information about editing your images on a computer.

Don't be fooled into thinking you are buying \\"American.\\") Everyone is disappointed, including the boss.

However the overall album makes me constantly revert to the Creamish BBM collaboration that came out a decade or so ago. Not my favorite cup of tea, but still something you gotta have in your CD colletion. Also find that the drumming includes too much \\"crash cymbals\\" for this style of music.

Good blue collar tunes for his blue collar following, though.The artist seems to be struggling to find a path back to where he was when he released earlier efforts like A New Day Yesterday and So It's Like That. He's gone from writing nearly all his own music to nearly always covering past Classic Rock and obscure blues tunes, thus resonating with a crowd of older, lower and middle class fans. Much of this particular work is background music for the Pepsi Generation from the 70's.As a copy cat lick player, he's astonishing.

This studio effort was interesting for sure, but is it a \\"Blues Deluxe\\" effort. This one is going more difficult to pull off on the road. Bonamassa is still young enough to become a giant on his own. But for now, there is a sense of lost direction. Wishing him well, but im afraid he changed his horses in the middle of the stream too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work.","review":"I had purchased Joe's albumSloe Gina few months prior to this one, and I was blown away. It showed his real talent and his ability to play heavy blues guitar with a new sound in each song.His guitar playing in this album his guitar playing is still good, but the music is very boring. Someone with Joe's talent should be playing better songs with a much better band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Good","review":"Sorry, But this CD is no where near as good as his previous one's.

I know what he can do, and this album does not capture it. The album lacks a good all around vibe, the music is cliche and boring...Bonamassa is such an incredible talent and guitar virtuoso, I know he can do better. \\"Helicopters,Palm Trees, and Gasoline\\" could have been longer. \\"Django\\" could have been more about jazz ideas. Bonamassa could have taken his solos to new and exciting melodic heights like he did in Bloodline, but he choses to play in the box. With this album he had the oppurtunity to take blues to a new exciting place, and this album doesn't accomplish that. If you wanna hear this guy at his best check out the band Bloodline or his New Day Yesterday, So Its Like That, Blues Deluxe or live albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expexted?","review":"With a big name producer, Jason Bonham on drums and Carmine Rojas on bass. I expected a guitar \\"Rippin'\\", \\"Rocked Out\\" ride from Joe. It's a diverse effort I'll give it that, but not a lot of excitement on this one. I hate to say that because I'm a huge fan of Joe's work. For me it just didn't have the same fire and passion as previous releases. If you liked \\"Blues Deluxe\\" this is for you. It's more diverse than that, but definately on the mellower side than previous work from Joe. \\"Joe come back to us\\". Give us more \\"Pain and Sorrow\\"!! If your not familiar, that's Joe's equivalent of \\"Free Bird\\" from \\"So It's Like That\\". That and \\"A New Day Yesterday\\" were much better releases than this one. So if you like your \\"Joe\\" on the bluesy side this is for you. I like my Joe ROCKIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a journalist","review":"Posing as a journalist Bill Kurtis has now shown that he has a very definite agenda, that being to abolish capital punishment, and not be persuading anyone that it is wrong for the state to kill, but repeating the half-truths and outright distortion of disgraced and indicted former Gov. George Ryan, who freed more than 150 stone cold killers off his state's death row.In his book tour, particularly on an appearance by Larry King, Kurtis shows that he is a tourist in the land of criminal justice.

If you never intend on moving it it should hold up OK if your gentle. Putting it together is pretty straight forward, but very time consuming. I bought the whole set and every piece had damage, most of it out of sight, but still.

No pieces were damaged and after almost 3 years of use, they don't show any signs of wear, but then again these pieces were for a guest bedroom, so it won't have the same wear as \\"every day\\" rooms.Really I have nothing bad to say about this product, so far I've been pleasantly surprised about the quality even though its particle board construction, its nicely made and held up well for 3 years.If you are after high quality (ie hardwood) pieces, this is not for you, if you want something nice and stylish that don't cost a fortune you might want to consider this."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"it was all that i was expecting and then some//i have never been unhappy with any item i have purchased thru amazon///thanks sandra l sutton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, its that good","review":"Punkgrass at its best.

Putting that aside, the most annoying thing about his book is that he does not appear to have had anyone proof read the book before publishing.

The replacement (refurbished) machine is even louder.I can't pinpoint the origin of the noise, except to say it is not the scanner unit. My guess is either the paper exit roller or the drum.

It was extremely old fashioned. Most of the bouquet techniques used in this book were discontinued by professional florists. And out of the 125 pages only 4 are dedicated to hand-tied bouquets. Everything else is basically foam bouquet holders.Also, the flowers used are what was considered hip in the 70's. Lots of roses and carnations, lots and LOTS of baby's breath and fillers.

I could make something more elegant and believable without directions.The author relies heavily on plastic and foam implements to construct her bouquets, and her shapes and flower choices are positively outdated. If you want your wedding to look like a low-budget 1960s throwback, go ahead and use this book.On a positive note, there are good instructions for making boutonnieres, although I'd advise leaving out the old-fashioned baby's breath sprigs.Another plus - you will have a good laugh at the bridal gowns the models are wearing.

Of the ten reasons that lean failures occur, he specifies two of them as absolute show stoppers and the other eight are things that can slow down your lean effort. The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is its relatively short length (which can be a plus, however, if you're giving this to a busy executive).

Worst of all, with milk, it's 833 calories and 27g of fat (11g saturated). Even if you desperately want to gain mass, this is a terrible way to go about it. And with 18 servings, you're eating about a third of a pound of powder with each drink. There's nothing about this product that isn't horrifying.

The cork pop works great and is such a simple, easy to use device! No matter how old the bottle, no more broken corks, period. The device pumps gas behind the cork and this pushes it out of the bottle. The only problem I've had with is an unusually long cork where the needle was not long enough. But that's happened only once. It is kind of a scary looking device, you want to keep it away from kids, that's for sure. There is a model with protective shields around the needle, but I would think that it would make it a pain to pull the cork off the needle. I've used this for well over a couple of hundred bottles over the last 10 years or so, and the needle is hanging in there. I did loose a rubber gasket that seals the air cartridge when you push it down. I found a small O-ring that works well to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy wine bottle opener","review":"This wine bottle opener is the easiest little gadget you can open your bottle with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to open corked wine bottles.","review":"What a great devise.

I'll I see is a Shoot'em up game. I was eager to play this game due to the fact the previous Phantasy Stars were really good. If I wanted a shoot'em up game I would have bought Quake 3 arena. It is an absolute disgrace to call this an RPG. If you are a die hard RPG, which I am, don't bought this game. Sell you're dreamcast and get Psx and buy Final Fantasy 9 instead. The only cool thing about this game is that you can set your characters weight, height and features. that is about it. So bottom line is that Sega flopped this one just like they do everything else. I'll stick with my Psx and Final Fantasy 9 thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Fall For It","review":"Trust me, do not buy this game. It is a one trick pony, and that trick is online play. Forget about the slowdown and lag and disconnects, that stuff just happens with online play. The problem with the game is its EXTREME repetitiveness. There are really only 3 quests to do, and thats it. If dungoens on the quests randomly regenerated every time, I'd have no problem with this game, but they don't. Although I've kicked this game to the side, my friend is still addicted to it, and he knows the levels by heart, he doesnt even have think about it anymore, he just goes through the motions now. If its a good RPG you're looking for then check out Grandia 2, or (a little old school now) Panzer Dragoon Saga. Of course if you like running through the same dungeons and fighting the same monsters, then by all means, waste your money on Phantasy Star Online."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This game was fun online but when u weren't able to get online it was boring.

The graphics do not apear to be much better than PSX quality. The game itself looks and plays like a bad clone of Jetforce Gemeni for the N64. After spending an hour of trying to find some one who would join me online (I couldn't find anyone who would), I went offline and played for a while. The game played more like a shooter than a rpg. As a fan of Phantasy Star 1-4, I was expecting something better. I strongly advise a rental before buying to see if this game is your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Phantasy Star...","review":"Basically what you are getting here is another Diablo clone for the Dreamcast. While that may seem all fine and dandy, the game is truly not even in the same class.Incredibly repetative.

At least they were that, original...Don't waste your money on this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"This game is probably one of the greatest RPG's I have ever played. Not because of the story but the wide variety of weapons to use, the great graphics, and so many special weapons and items you will be hooked for a couple of months. The story is ok but I wouldn't by this game for that. I like the battle system. It's not like the old RPG battle system where you select Attack, Magic, Item, or somthing like that. You run up to an enemy and just start swinging, or if you have a gun you stand back and start shooting. I also like the fact that you can make your own character. There are character to choose from but that desides your strength, how much magic you have, and stuff like that. The fun part is choosing their hieght, hair style, clothing color, facial features, and a name of course. If you have a dreamcast you have to have this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest games for DC","review":"Ahhh... another sleeper hit, this game is fun all around. One major drawback for it is that before you buy one used ask the seller if they have the serial number and acsess key. If they don't have those, don't even bother to get it. A awesome thing about it is the online gameplay. It gets really interesting and fun. You get to and play with friends or just hang out and chat. The 4 scenarios are awesome and long. They will keep you playing the game for hours. If you are trying to choose between PSO or PSO2, online play, then go with PSO. It doesn't cost anything(except regular internet charge) to play the game online. PSo2 costs 15$ a month + regular internet charges. In PSO2 there are 2 new scenarios, so if you';re looking for more hours of gameplay, go with PSO2. Thanks for reading my review, BG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Ok, im new at this sort of thing...Writing reviews. However, this game is one great title and is needed in a dreamcast gamers library. The online part is where this game really shines. Offline can get boring and you lose desire to play after a couple of hours.Even though the language barrier is broken, some people still talk in Japanese, or french, Etc. That gets a little old, but Players are very easy to findGraphics are well drawn, and the story line is decent. Advancement is hard and it takes a good while to level up your charcter.A keyboard is a must with this game. I felt that this title was worth my price of 150.00 buying this system and with the price cut its even better.I strongly recommend this game.

It plays sort of like a Zelda mock-up and at that level probably only rates a 2 or 3. The fun really begins when you get online and play with people you know and, most of the time, with people you don't know. The game features a lot of references to previous Phantasy Star games which is great. It features some pretty in depth character development including the ability to change many of your character's physical characteristics. There is a ton of different weapons and spells. The only drawbacks are that if you play only offline or not online much the game might get a bit repetetive. Online is really where it's at. When playing online you really must have a keyboard. It is possible to communicate without it, but those of us online will appreciate that you can communicate faster. If you don't have a keyboard yet, buy it with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My View of Phantasy Star Online","review":"To me, this game is extremly fun. You can choose if you want to go online or offline, and you get to pick from three different types of characters to be. You get to create your character any way you want. Then, you can go to the planet called \\"Ragol\\" and fight all sorts of monsters, from Boomas to Dragons. If you are online, you might meet some other people, and they can be your partners. If you do a job, there are certain jobs that you can have a partner on.

So I bought this to go with my shiny new Dreamcast, thinking I'd like this one as well. And I'm sure I would have...if it worked at all.Let me be the one to tell you, fellow shopper, because no one told me: to play this, you need a Dreamcast modem, which is quite frankly impossible to find anymore, a constant wired connection to a Sega server, and a special serial code, both of which do not exist anymore unless you want to go the hacking route and use cracked codes and private servers, one of which I'm fairly sure is still illegal and the other of which is time-consuming and requires lots of programming knowledge. In short, you can boot it up, and you can look at it, but there is nothing short of hacking that will allow you to play this.

It is warped enough that oil is unable to fairly evenly coat the bottom without creating significantly deeper pools in some parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price","review":"I like this Wok- Its nice- Only downfall is that it had excessive Oil ( Seasoning? ) in it when I bought it that took a while to get clean- Overall it works great for the price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very high maintenance","review":"I like to steam my veggies and that destroys the seasoning. Very high maintenance wok! Heats up only at the bottom.

I am a casual cook who just wanted to wok around a little. Additionally, there was no warning that seasoning a wok on an electric stove is extremely difficult.

The company shipped it promptly and I could hardly wait to try it out. I have tried it in gravy and soup and neither has made me think remotely of chicken. I have cooked with plain TVP in granules and larger chunks before so I knew I would not be getting \\"chicken\\" but the chewiness of larger TVP chunks was missing in these smaller bits and I felt the flavor did not enhance the foods it was added to.There are trans fats in it, also, making it not a healthy option for vegetarian eating, either.The chickeny flavor of this product reminds me of the flavor of crackers that claim to be chicken flavored. If you like those you might like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong stuff","review":"When I ordered the VTP, I order by the picture on the can, the can shows large chunks, but when I got it, all it is, is a bunch of small pieces like you would get when you have finish making the big chucks, This is not what I ordered if I had wanted the small misc. pieces I could have gone to H.E.B. and got them a whole lot cheaper. I ordered the Ham and the Chicken, guess I will not be doing that again. I know there are big chucks out there, as I brought them at the store when I lived in Wisconsin.

Then i plug in my 8gb sd card that had weeks worth of pictures and a lot of effort, plug it in, open my folder - nothing. Now i made sure i still had my pictures on my camera before i plugged it in and they were all there, plug it in - gone. So it pretty much wiped my data and no way to retrieve it.

Then the card stopped working with other devices too. I checked all 4 readers and unfortunately they destroyed all my 4 SD cards, none of them readable by any other device.I contacted seller. They were nice, but didn't accept any responsibility. The only thing they said, was that they will check the readers from now on to be sure something like this will not happen again. They sent me 4 new readers that are working fine, at least for the past few hours.So, if you buy these readers, before inserting your SD card, check to be sure they are working fine. You can do it by using an old SD card without any info or picture on it.

It lasted a month. After which stopped working.

The transfer speeds are nearly exactly what it would be without the reader, and I haven't had any problems with card recognition/reading. The only thing that slightly bothers me is the bright color - it's visible when I have it in the port, but I find it's also kind of a plus because when I throw it in the drawer later I can always easily identify it.

The outward appearance of the finished costumes has a good period feel, but the end result is not a replica, and a conscientious costumer may want to supplement this book with addition readings in costume history."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful book","review":"When I look at the few period costumes I made (I'm only a beginner), I really think this book helped me to improve my cutting abilities, sewing tips and above all, the authentic period feeling when the garment is worn and moves on stage. Jean Hunnisett tells you what you're expecting to find at the end of your work and helps you to understand the historical background of period costume. This is the only book which explains in detail the draping method over a corset and guides you step-by-step in the construction of the costume but it is sometimes a bit confusing in her sewing instructions and she gives the impression there's only one way to realize something (ex: 18th century corset). Anyway, I learned a lot and she's a very good teacher. (Don't be tempted to enlarge her scaled patterns,it doesn't work very well( too many corrections) and it's easier to make your own patterns by the flat or by draping.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Change of pace for Death Metal","review":"Relapse has signed another great band. Skinless are incredibly punishing, but they have a serious groove, especially on \\"The Optimist\\" You can mosh to any track on this CD very, very easily. It is nice to see a band who doesn't take themselves deadly serious. They have a couple comical songs mixed into the slew of heavy death/grind. The vocals are pretty good, very low. Almost every track has a cool sample intro ( LIFE SUCKS...AND THEN YOU DIE!-\\"The Optimist.\\") Definitly pick this up if you like Death/Grind or metal of any sort. It missed the fifth star because \\"Pool of Stool\\" is just disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks in many key areas","review":"ok these guys could have been soooooo much better. Really though, that can be said about many metal bands but in particular this band. there are a couple of cool songs but this sounds like recycled garbage. yes they are somewhat technical, but being technical doesn't make you a good musician.So what does this say about this album? Well if you have a alright metal catalogue then you'll hear the likes of Obituary, CC, and Six feet under on this album. no I am not comparing any of these bands to Skinless with the exception of SFU since they stink anyway. Production [is bad] as the dynamics on this album [is] also [bad]. the only real standout is their drummer and he's mediocre at best. so if you have that decent metal catalogue I was talking about, then you don't need this at all. I mean if you really want to know what they sound like, download any song, and you'll see what I mean"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is like nothing I expected. This is boring.","review":"It's heavy, it's fast, it growls and shrieks. But is it origional? not really. it is all things i mentioned before but there is not one riff in the whole album or any arrangement of music that sticks in my mind and makes me want to listen to it again. When I listen to it, it only makes me want to listen to cephalic carnage or SYL. Because those bands do this kind of sound so much better. There is much better music than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foreshadowing very generic Death Metal","review":"Oh man...I'll admit I had my doubts about Skinless, but when I first heard them today, was I right. I had expected some very mediocre Death metal, but this is just simply god-awful. This is very generic sounding. I would rank their [crudiness] up there with Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, and Deicide. The samples are the only thing I found entertaining about this band. I advise everyone to stay away from this band and go check out much better new band such as The Crown, Lock Up, and even the new Napalm Death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Metal at it's.....blah","review":"Eh, it's alright.

Make sure you search online retailers for the best price."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucked","review":"I seldom dislike something this much. It seemed the more I read the less I liked. I have read books by excellent female authors, and some that left me gasping for air. Half way through this book I was convinced the book was written by a desperate woman pretending to be a man. It was an emotional roller coaster of drivel. I had to force myself to finish it. The author claimed initially the book received a scathing review, but after some time he had decided it was a good read. I'm certain the author has written books that were well received and popular, unfortunately this book isn't one of them. The title Incinerator seems a misnomer. This book should have been called Crash and Burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, but turgid","review":"An admirably thorough book greatly diminished in impact by an unbearably dull writing style. This is a book for academics rather laymen interested in Caesar. When one has recently read history written by someone such as AJP Taylor, it is impossible to read a book as plodding as Meier's 'Caesar'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend for history buffs.","review":"Although not for everyone I thought Meier did a thorough job on the life of Caesar and the late Republic. At times his writing seems a bit tedious and overwrought, but well worth the read. Meier digs deep into the forces that shaped Caesar and his conflict with the late republic. I enjoyed his frequent commentaries and extrapolations when all is not clear. I feel it helps one to think and form their own opinion on the events at hand. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and boring","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. In fairness, I couldn't get further than the first three chapters, so maybe it gets better later on in the book. He spends these chapters mostly rambling without a point. He has the very annoying habit of opening every paragraph with four questions and doesn't even begin to answer any of them. Even with a background understanding of the politics of the late Republic, Meier's questions hardly entice the reader to continue. Like many other reviewers, for a great historical biography, go with Peter Green's Alexander of Macedon and for a good introduction into the late Republic, go with Holland's Rubicon. Both are much more enjoyable than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on the mind, but full of all the facts a junky could want","review":"I've read a few biographies on JC, and this is by far my favorite.

The result is an enjoyable jaunt through an amazing life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Read, But A Good One","review":"This was a hard read for me, there is a lot of history filled within these pages that just does not apply to Caesar but the entire backstory of Rome. It is a great book, just a lot of information to soak up. I would not suggest to a beginning reader on Caesar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best work on Caesar","review":"Since the general content and merits of Meier's biography of the Great Julius Caesar have already been more than adequatley examined by previous reviewers, I shall only say that of the several recent works available, this is the finest.Of particular interest to the reader may be Meier's musings on the existance and nature of historical greatness in the early chapters.One of my few reservations is that the prose seems to have lost something in translation, rendering the early parts somewhat lacking in elegance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"Could have been a great book. But it isn't.The book is horribly edited and organized. You can mix and match chapter titles and content - makes no difference. The authors seem to ramble on about the same topic in each chapter. They seem to have broken most of their own rules with this book.I'm an ecommerce novice and I still found only a couple of info-nuggets. You're better off reading the author's blog (Grokdotcom), Seth Godin and Get Elastic blogs.The entire book is printed in rental-car-agreement-fine-print font. Annoying as hell. And the cover/dust jack art is creepy, so I threw out the cover. May be I'll give the book away to someone with a microscope.I know the authors are smart and respected. You can't tell from this book.

Conversion rates are probably the most important issues for anyone involved in managing a website and I expected to find lots of best-case examples and useful tips. Unfortunately the book does not have them. With more than 300 pages only 30 of them have examples of screenshots, not only that, half of them are of just one site: Cafepress. Too much text to state the obvious and few real life examples.Oh, and the cover picture is just horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Usability","review":"This book has made me realize there is more to a website than content and usability: Return On Investment. And even though a consider myself to be an experienced website-maker, I have learned a great deal from reading it.However, for 2 reasons I decided not to rate 5 stars:1) I found it difficult to discern any stucture. It was as though all chapters where so much related that their order seemed irrelevant.2) A picture says more than a thousand words. Unfortunately you won't find many pictures in this book. Those that you do find, hardly make the point any clearer.

I was hoping this wouldn't happen but when I heard last year that they'd start touring with their friend Dierks Bentley, who's nothing more than a golden boy in Nashville, my radar went up. Well, it's happened. I realize these Texas artists are getting noticed, but it blows me away that they go and change their sound so much to appeal to the mainstream. Randy Rogers was one of the better new outfits to come out in years, and it's a shame that this puppy sounds like a hundred other CMT acts out there. You can try and justify all you want, but this is not the same sound as they had before; this is fabricated assembly-line music. People may not like the negative reviews, but too bad.

It actually represents quite a bit of the hip-hop scene from skratching (turntablist cuts), underground rap (cuts w/ Mainflow, Talib Quali, Black Thought, Souls, Planet Asia, etc.), mainstream rap (Mystic), b-boying (they even made a cut for b-boys!), to dancehall (ridiculously infectious joint by Apollo & Nim).The skits tie all the joints in smoothly giving big ups to the multi-talented DJ known as a Triple Threat DJ.DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM...3T is the truth!

That's the thing about this camera, if your lighting isn't perfect, your shot will turn out like crap. This is due to the excessive digital noise in the picture. I bought this camera yesterday and took it back today because i knew that this camera would be a waste of money and a bad investment. If you want a camera that is about as small as this one with the same or better features, buy the Canon PowerShot S410 Digital ELPH.

My suggestion is to find this in a bookstore, go through the table of contents and buy each volume mentioned rather than buy this anthology. Belitt's translations destroy Neruda's beautiful imagery and the liberties he takes are often inexplicable. The sequence of the images is usually changed in the translations and individual images or concepts are sometimes excised or altered beyond recognition.

His popularity is a mystery to me; perhaps he makes average homemakers feel comforting because if he can become so famous with such poor culinary skills, so can anyone. Give me chefs like Jacques Pepin, and Jacques Torres, watching their shows, you will know why they are the \\"professional\\" chefs. And you will definitely learn something. If you want to know the basic hows and whys of cooking and have fun with it, pick up a copy of Alton Brown's \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\".

First of all the art in the first issue collected here (Xmen #92) was so bad I wanted to drop it right there - and the story was just fluff. A really bad filler issue with nonsense pages until the final sentimental page of \\"We are the X-Men\\". Gimme a break!Then the following issues - Astonishing X-Men #1, 2, and 3; Uncanny X-Men 375; and X-Men #95 - were just assinine in nature. The first 3 are about a group of kids called Manites where Wolverine is killed. Yeah, but of course it's not really Wolverine, because he's actually Apocalypse's new horseman Death - which seemed interesting since i havent read that storyline, then BAM! No more pages!!!! Sure there is a couple more issues in there but I was so displeased with this book I had to just give up reading it.Forget it, the art blows on almost every page and the story is terrible and half baked. Where's Claremont when you need him!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why no one reads comics","review":"Really atrocious. The story begins with the X-men disbanding, and then just reforming for no reason with new members. No explanation is given as to why these characters come in, or even what the point of it all is. The was decent in places, but on the whole pretty [disappointing], and there was basically no characterization. I felt cheated after reading this even though I hadn't even bought it.

It is mostly advertising for Lant's products and services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for serious/advanced students","review":"This is a set of grammar exercises with an answer key. It is only exercises. The book points you to the various sections of the Butt-Benjamin grammar book (by far the best grammar in English; see here: [...]) so you can get the learning you need. If you don't have the Butt-Benjamin book, this is not an ideal workbook for you.If you do, what this workbook particularly worthwhile is that its exercises are not trivial. It's not the usual long pages of drills on irregular verbs and vocabulary usage. Here are some exercises taken form skimming it right now for this review: 25 questions on the various Spanish verbs for 'becoming'; 15 questions on the differences between 'bajo', 'abajo', and 'debajo de'; 10 questions on the imperfect of poder to signify reproach; etc.So, this is for advanced students who are trying to really nail down areas that they know about but don't get much chance to practice.

Not only does this book give real insight into what the game meant to black players and fans, but helps one understand how the alienation of blacks from big-league play was a great tragedy to the game. This book makes me wonder how great the game could be today, if this tragedy had not occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book","review":"This book provides an entertaining look at the Negro Leagues and the years prior, when blacks were banned by the \\"Gentlemen's Aggreement\\" from participating in the national past time.

Stories told through the book tells about the hard times African Americans faced in the earlier years of baseball.

The book also makes you wonder were would baseball be if African Americans had the same chances as white people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Ball Was White","review":"The book is on a a fascinating subject but is poorly organized and tedious beyond belief.

I tried different sources (dvd) and various settings, but it didn't change anything.Aside from that, I simply could not adjust the picture such that the colors looked as good as my old sony analog tv which I had running beside it for comparison. The difference in resolution was very noticable, however the color on the zenith was inferior (in my opinion) to the sony (especially on skin tones)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet is he from?","review":"I must admit that I haven't read much of this book. I simply couldn't. I was offended by nearly every sentence. As an anthropologist, the subject of this book's second chapter is familiar to me; therefore, I was painfully aware that none of the author's sweeping, racist generalizations is even partially accurate. It was almost surreal to realize that this book was published by a well known academic publisher. Encountering this travesty of scholarship made me wonder whether interdisciplinary work is in fact even possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD, Ok film","review":"Cheaply packaged, poorly transferred film put together by someone taking advantage of the fact that this film is in the public domain.

The DVD is a poor recording of an in-class event (possible at a trade show, since he keeps referring to the Booth number he is at).The presentation felt very disconnected....after an introduction to the three different kinds of Feng Shui, it was a mix of answering specific questions from audience members and general coverage of some areas of the Bagua.He frequently starts a sentence, only to interrupt himself and start another one.

After studying blackjack for a few years now I would recommend this book along with \\"Blackjack Play Like The Pros\\" by John Bukofsky. These are excellent books to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated blackjack book - Nothing original","review":"This is without a doubt the most ovverrated blackjack book. Scoblete is a professional writer, not a professional blackjack player. To the general public, this book is considered way up there, an incredible book. To those who are students of the game or professionals, realize scoblete is just a mickey mouse. There is nothing new in this book. Read the works of Wong, Snyder, Schlesinger, Anderson and Zender for serious texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Handbook for Winning Players","review":"If you are new to the game of blackjack, this book can take you from novice to sem-pro. And you'll have fun doing so as Scoblete is just a great writer who knows his material inside out and backwards and really knows how to write. I use this as my bible of blackjack and I supplement it with Wong's \\"Professional Blackjack\\" and Schlesinger's \\"Blackjack Attack.\\" But Scoblete is the author I most enjoy and I trust his experience. You'll just love his adventures in the casinos using the very methods he teaches in this book. This would make a great present for anyone interested in casino gambling and blackjack in particular. What makes Scoblete almost unique among gambling writers is that he is an avid player, notjust someone who runs computer simulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give yourself a chance to win - Great!","review":"I went from being a blackjack chump who consistently lost plenty of money to almost always winning.

All my gambling friends keep borrowing it from me even though they have other blackjack books."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!","review":"This book was written by a rank amateur! I bought this book because of the glowing reviews I read on the Amazon site, but, after reading it, I have to guess that those reviews were written by Frank Scoblete's friends. There's not a unique thought in the whole book. He regurgitates the little of which he understood of others' books, and fills in the gaping gaps with silly stories told to him by his friends. I have NO idea why a publishing company would put this book out! Scoblete presents the sum total of his knowledge, as little as that is, in the first few chapters and then drones on about things no blackjack players care about. Don't waste your money on this one like I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Books in One","review":"This is really three books in one. For novice players, Scoblete explains the game of blackjack, the basic strategies to employ, and how to decide which games to play. For the more advanced player, he explains how to count cards and how to use other advantage-play techniques to get the edge over the casino. For those who already know all the information about counting and strategies, Scoblete provides anecdotal stories, some hilariously funny, some thought-provoking, all of them enjoyable about his and others' experiences in the casinos. This book should therefore appeal to just about every blackjack or would-be blackjack player on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Book","review":"Frank Scobletehas written a very worthwhile book that explores many interesting and varied topics in blackjack. He shows you how to play basic strategy and count cards. he also explains which counting systems are best.

This book was fun reading and really gives you a wealth of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Win With This Book!","review":"I have read several BJ books and Scoblete's is by far the very best one. It is enjoyable, entertaining and contains great information without getting overly technical. He compares many different card counting systems and recommends which games to play. I think you will find that unlike most BJ writers, Scoblete has been there and done it. His book has the ring of authority. If you follow his advice, you will win money in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for strategies and insight","review":"Frank Scoblete is an enjoyable writer who really understands what it takes to beat blackjack. The book is truly loaded with useful information and tips to make you winner. I can recommend it for beginners and advanced players as there is plenty for everyone. I especially enjoyed Scoblete's writing style. he has great wit and tells a wonderful story. This is one blackjack book that is not dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets this pro's approval!","review":"I've been playing blackjack for 20 years and this is one of the best book out there.

You'll learn about the methods and the players. If you are serious about the game, you may have a slight edge (in The Netherlands for example you cannot count the cards and it limits the counting techniques you can apply) but do not expect making big money, and even less a living out the different methods (to say it otherwise you better have a \\"normal\\" job or write books about blackjack).

I was so excited when I saw the concept FJ Cruiser in 2003.When the FJ Cruiser was released in 2006, I was quick to get one. It was everything I dreamed of and more.This book is a great history of the FJ Cruiser and the modern SUV in general. There are so many things that I learned about this truck, and other vehicles like the Jeep, and Land Rover. This details the FJ since its birth during the Korean War to modern day.One of my favorite areas of the book, is how they detail the design process for the modern FJ Cruiser. While the FJ Cruiser is cool on its own, some of the design ideas that didn't make it just completely WOW you.This book is the perfect gift for an FJ Cruiser or FJ40 owner. Or just a great way to learn about a historic vehicle.

Then my cousin took it back and left and well, I never got it back. I just purchased another copy eight years later and it is still a fun game. Sure the graphics aren't the best, but they are pretty nice considering how old the game is. I love the handling of the game and the fact that you get to go through the Porsche history, I wish they would do this with other cars like Ferrari, BMW, and Lamborghini, but so far I do not see any.I also have the Playstation version of this game and I must say this; it utterly sucks. So, if you have played that version but still wantted to play this game I would suggest shelling out the $5 and buying a previously used copy.Pros: It is a fun to play despite the graphic limitations.Cons: I really can't think of any, the sound in the game is done well enough, and the game play is fun with many hours of play-through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"The game is OK.

It works just the way you want it to, a reliable smooth rolling ballpoint pen which fits nicely in the hand.

This pen is well designed and it has that feel to it as you use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"this pen was not what I expected, fine point. I would rate it closer to medium.

I think I am a lover of this pen for life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writes great with poor durability.","review":"The pen writes very smooth. It requires almost no down pressure to write. It is also pretty comfortable. There is one problem that I dislike. The clip to hold it at the edge of your pocket breaks extremely easily. I broke one clipping it into the pocket of my jeans. In one case the pen almost broke in half. I do not recommend this if you plan on using the clip."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite!","review":"My favorite pen! The ink dries quickly and does not smudge at all. These pens are very lightweight which I appreciate as I do a lot of writing (and for a very long time) and my hands are also on the small side. I also use the pens in blue and red. The point is nice and fine enough to write in between text. I first got my hands on these pens from my dad, who works at an aerospace engineering company.

I prefer a fine point, am not fussy about blue or black, but a pen that blots is useless to me. I do not want to sign a letter or card only to have my pen blot. I do a fair amount of note taking and underlining in books and I do not want my pen to leave blots of ink.There did not seem to be an option to give no stars, but since I do not plan to use any of the box of 12 pens I just bought, I cannot imagine why I would give them any stars at all.Do not buy these pens.

(There was no mention of the Pioneers anywhere in Douglas Porch's 600+ page \\"The French Foreign Legion.\\") This book is a must-have for any Legion buff.Note that the information is a little dated.

I read the reviews and there are good and bad. I thought if I read the manual, do what it says we wouldn't have the vibration-lid flying off-destruction and devastation. I was so wrong. The juicer is extremely sensitive to how veggies are added. If they are too soft, they ball up and create an unbalance. I clean the juicer at least 3 times while making approximately 16 oz of juice. This morning the vibration became so terrible the lid flew off, juice went everywhere. I unplugged the machine and grabbed it, cut my index finger. All that for what little juice came out. My husbands grandmother had an Acme juicer for many years. In fact, it is still in the family. Unfortunately, this one is going back to the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime","review":"You would think that for the price this would be a great choice as a juicer. I only juiced apple, celery and parsley, although it does not juice parsley very well. After the second use the basket turned itself around and I lost a lot of juice.

So I've learned price doesn't mean a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again!","review":"There are some major flaws in this machine. The first is that it is dangerous when it becomes unstable, which is frequent. The second is that it will only juice about a cup of juice before becoming unstable.

Iirritating to say the least. I did not buy it from amazon and the vendor is now gone, so I guess I am out of luck. There are so many other juicers out there, so don't buy this one.

It is rock-solid and has never needed any part repaired or replaced.On the down side, it is heavy, bulky, a bit noisy.

It's OK if you like to juice Carrot, apple and celery. I juiced at my friends house with a 100 buck Jack Elane.

It started right up -after a cleaning of course- and I tasted my first fresh apple juice ever. So good!The machine is very well built, solid and surprisingly easy to clean. A scrub brush around the outside and a rinse under running water is all it needs. A friend has the Jack LaLane juicer, and she never uses it because it takes 15 minutes to clean it.

The first was purchased in 1975-76. When my son went off to college he took the juicer with him and still uses it regularly. When I wanted to buy a juicer I went to Acme expecting the same quaility as my original juicer. The juicer is unsafe and has on atleast 6 different times vibrated so hard the lid actually came loose and the whole juicer vibrated all over the counter top. Juice flying every where! The first time I used it the plunger top came loose from the stem and continues to do so during juicing. Has anyone else experienced the same? I have contacted the closest service center and I'm waiting to hear from them. My other concern is that I didn't receive any warrantee information with the juicer. I purchased it as \\"new\\" for $198.00. I hope I can get my money back!!

Delivery driver unpacked TV only to power up with no picture. Amazon would not allow me to return TV and made me call Samsung for warranty repair. I would think twice about buying on-line for this reason. 1st warranty company came out to repair and had to take TV to shop and replace tuner. Returned TV and regular picture looked fine, but HDTV was blurred. 1st warranty company would not come out to adjust, so I had to call 2nd company and they came out and adjusted lines. It is now May and TV just popped and fizzed and now no sound or functionality. 3rd repair service in less than 6 months. I too heard Samsung had improved their products, but I do not see it.

This was not always noticeable, depending on what the on-screen display was, but against bright colors (the sky, etc.) it showed up as a yellow stripe. This did not improve \\"The Matrix,\\" it just made it seem as though Neo occasionally was jaundiced. As if this wasn't bad enough, the quality of the image itself was poor. I would describe it as out-of-focus and as grainy. My DVDs looked like VHS tapes on this television.

It has only one flaw, but it is a glaring one. In the section on catchers, Tim McCarver, who is probably the greatest Cardinal catcher of all time, does not list himself. Instead he chooses Hal Smith, an eminently forgetable player with the mediocre Cardinals teams of the 1950s, who could not hit his way out of a paper bag but supposedly did a great job with Cardinal pitchers. With McCarver behind the plate for much of the '60s, the Cardinals won three Pennants and two World Series.

The writing was very good too, and the fact that it is written in first person makes it more interesting, more understandable. The book is very interesting, but also very shocking, it shows the feelings of the boy, about what he feels for his grandpa and how he's forgetting about him, and caring more about whether he's going to have one of his panic attacks in front of his friends, and how he considers himself an awful person for even thinking it. It is a short story, but not at all like other books that I've read before.

There were a few tidbits I'd not run across before (but I was unimpressed with those - memories from high school acquaintences, etc.). However, it may be informative to those who haven't been keeping up w/NIN since the early days, and it does attempt to place all the earlier info into a framework. I just felt that too much of the book was derived from others' work (e.g., ROLLING STONE, SPIN), and that it could've used a bit more original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"Nothing but recycled interview quotes, and not one instance of applied intelligence. Huxley appears to take everything Reznor says or anyone else says about him absolutely at face value, and makes no attempt at engaging the complexity of his work or his cultural position whatsoever. There's nothing shocking or evil in it, nothing that got me up on my hind legs, but what really disappoints me is that there is literaly nowhere (that I've encountered)where someone writes intelligently about this work. Huxley's book does nothing but cultify Trent's personality, and makes no attempt to approach his subject with anything but sensationalism. And nothing could be stupider than those captions under the photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine Inch Nails","review":"This book is a disappointing read for the average NIN fan - pretty much everything of interest in the book I had already read somewhere before (most online as they are from American magazines such as Spin). The author also pads out the book with information on other artists, some of whom have very little connection to either Reznor or NIN. This means the prose is sometimes more in line with that of an essay than an interesting book. I was excited to find and read this book given the lack of books on the subject but, ultimately, I was relieved to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor representation of a creative genius","review":"Unfortunatly, Martin Huxley poorly potrayed Industrial Rockstar Trent Reznor in his book \\"Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct\\".

In hearing this song, I hope it's not an indicator that the Foos are trying to make the record sound the slickness of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", neither do they need to sound like a Bratmobile record either. I'll give the album justice when it comes out. If the record is lousy, then they will have finally gone to the stadiums and not the 2000 attendance only gigs the Foos are known for.

I haven't read much of the authors he used as his examples (Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, David Guterson, Cormac McCarthy, and Annie Proulx), but it doesn't matter. Myers doesn't get into plot or characters. You don't have to be familiar with the books (though it would help, I'll reread the chapters of this book as I read the works by those authors).

Similar screeds, now long forgotten, were directed at earlier titans of American fiction such as Melville, Henry James, and Faulkner--all masters of difficult, demanding, individualistic styles. DeLillo and McCarthy, in particular, are their heirs--and will also survive the little puffed-up schoolmasters, philistines, and cranks who despise the innovations and challenges of authentic art.

Graphics are nice but after running back and forth countless times they become boring. Worst of all is the time you waste loading each disk, five minutes at a time, sometimes four times in a row. There is way too much inventory [at one point I counted 41 items and I had a long way to go]. The designers seem to have a fasination with skulls,23 in inventory for 2 seperate puzzles with lots more laying around. Some of the clues are so illegible you have no choice but to go to hint lines for help.

I would say that if you are looking for an entertaining adventure game, try Syberia, which though relatively easy, is much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing...","review":"This game was way too confusing. The graphics were great and all, but most of the time you were going through caves or mazes and getting lost. I spent a lot of time going to the walkthrough which I hate doing. The clues were not enough to help you figure out what you were suppose to do next. In one puzzle, I had no idea what to do, so I went to the walkthrough and as I was reading the clue, I sat there trying to figure out how anyone would figure that one out on their own. I finished the game, but with the help of the walkthrough so that's no fun.

The grammar is often quite poor, even to the point that I am stuck trying to understand the meaning of a sentence. The proofs skip steps and are not explained well enough. Finally, the choice of variables will often change mid-problem. (The radius will be given as R, and then used in the solution as r.)This book may serve many people well, but I recently completed a college calculus course that was based on proofs, so when I do not understand how the text jumped from point A to point B, I stop and try to figure it out even though a person simply must understand how to use an equation and not how it was derived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This book contains plenty of problems on all the subjects covered by the AP Exam, and detailed solutions for each problem. It was very helpful in my Physics C crash course before the AP last year. The book is also good because the practice questions are harder than actual AP questions, so that the Exam seemed easy in comparison.However, the errors (either benign typos, or equations which were just wrong) were frequent enough to be somewhat annoying.

Nothing is like the \\"Board Game\\" with its various pawns and pieces, moved around on an artistic designed square piece of cardboard.

This is not light entertainment and will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. It's heavy and dark, dramatic and very powerful. I recomend the film for the outstanding acting and excellant film quality. I feel it was a good investment that helps us understand that Stonewall was not as bad as it could get.

Viewers with a prior knowledge of Arenas' life and work will derive more from the episodic narrative than most casual viewers, though no one could fail to be impressed by Javier Bardem's Oscar-nominated performance in the central role. Strong supporting cast, too, including Johnny Depp in brief - but memorable - dual roles, Olivier Martinez (as Arenas' closest friend) and a virtually unrecognizable Santiago Magill (DON'T TELL ANYONE) as one of Bardem's early sexual conquests. Directed by Julian Schnabel (BASQUIAT)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Movie with Some Language Mix-Ups","review":"Successful in describing what Cuba is all about, this film is also about life. It made me think that, not only in this writer's case, but great writings or other creative works were made in prison. There is something about prison that can force us grasp the nature of life. Or perhaps it can also be said that nothing can kill truly liberal mind.In the movie, English was spoken among Cubans in Cuba, whereas suddenly they start speaking Spanish without translation. I find it very annoying. It makes a perfect sense if they spoke Spanish in Cuban prison and start speaking English after he left Cuba. I live in Miami and am surrounded by thousands of Cubans, so I know that Cubans in Cuba do not typically speak English to have conversations among themselves. I don't mind subtitles while the scene was in Cuba, and I wish what was what they did. Unfortunately this language mix-up is the reason why I cannot give 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before and after Castro!","review":"It is hard to describe this movie because it brings out so many emotions. Without going into the story (you can read that already} let me just say, on the negative side, that it was a little difficult to understand in some parts because of the heavy Cuban accent when the actors were speaking english.Johnny Depp has a small but VERY memorable part. It was a surprise actually to see him in such a \\"camp\\" part. He makes a very pretty girl!In parts you feel a sense of urgency, you laugh, you are disgusted, and you heave a sigh of relief. It also brings back memories of history when Castro shipped out all the undesirables.

In 1990, stricken with AIDS and without health insurance, he committed suicide with drugs and alcohol. It's a painful and heart-wrenching story, but the acting is superb and there are moments of true mirth along with those of care and tenderness. Javier Bardem is fabulous playing Arenas in this movie!Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Johnny Depp was great, the rest, bad accents!","review":"Well, my first complaint with this movie is that it has too many Spanish dialogues when the movie is supposed to be in English language. Unfortunately, English subtitles were not provided on the VCD. It is very difficult to appreciate the movie especially when you can't understand half of what the characters were saying. I don't understand why they have to speak a heavy accented English when they could just do the movie in Spanish then just provide subtitles?On my opinion, only Johnny Depp did a fine performance in this movie although I don't understand why he'd allow himself to do a cameo on this kind of film. I'm sorry but it is not the kind of quality film I was expecting. I'm sure the book is a better version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Firmly Disappointing and Boring","review":"All right, let's be honest. We all wanted to appreciate this film and feel that it was deep and meaningful. However, it was sorely disappointing. The characters, perhaps meant to be portrayed in artful vignettes, were completely undeveloped and unrealistic. I can't imagine the storyboard for this movie, because it must have looked like a poured-out jigsaw puzzle on the dining room table. Not only were there multiple flashback scenes interwoven in odd sequences which subracted from the movie's flow, but these were interlaced with hallucinations on the part of Reinaldo. In the end, nothing was explained well enough for the audience to sympathize with the character. Overall, this movie is a vapid attempt at cinematic depth. I sincerely wish that I had been able to appreciate this film in the way I feel I could have. It is unfortunate that such a brilliant writer's life and writings would be made so insipid and flat through this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats all the hoopla","review":"This movie was very disappointing to me.

Steaks come out perfect with no mess or smoke. If you want another steak, just wipe the surface with the paper towel. In four minutes you will have another juicy steak. You can also fit two small hamburgers, but the bun warmer will take only one bun, so you are better off with one jumbo hamburger. It is true that the bun warmer is not all that useful, but mainly because the bun warms up faster than the steak is being done and if you remove it too soon it will be cold by the time you are ready for it, if you keep it in the grill for too long it will get dry. If you are really interested in using a bun warmer you need to learn to put a bun in at the right time.

After it is cooled all you need to do is take out the towel, it will have absorbed most of the grease. Anything else will easily wipe away. I hope this helps anyone who is having a hard time w/ cleaning. This little machine has become my number one appliance.

But this was really a disappointment to me. There is no timer for this, so you will have to watch the clock when you cook things. Plus (the worse part) is that the surface gets quite warm. You can only eat something fully cooked if it is thin- like a very thin hamburger. The outside of the food will burn before the middle gets cooked. If you do try to risk cooking a fat hamburger and warm a bun at the same time, the moisture from the cooking goes right into the bun warmer, and makes the break a little wet on the ends. It gets a little annoying after a while. You will always have to plug it in whenever you need to use it- it is always on.

If that was what it was advertized for I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. The plastic cleaning fork is worthless, and the non-stick coating begins to flake after 6 months. The barely raised ridges on the top makes the top of your meat evenly brown & dry without the grill marks. The bottom is not nearly as cooked as the top, and has the best marks near the opening where the grill lines are raised to form \\"teeth\\" to hold the meat in. When the grill started flaking, I went back to the Cast Iron grill I can put over 2 burners & control the temperature.

You have to wipe it clean while it is on the countertop. Well anyone who has cooked for a while knows that simply wiping a pan down not only doesn't get it clean, but it doesn't sanitize it either.

Graphics could make you car sick, it did me. To move from one campaign level to the next you have to complete selected goals. In the 4th level I could not get out, just kept flying around with everything destroyed. Game will not let you out.

For an old game, the level of smoothness and detail is great. The game is a lot of fun, but is not very re-playable, I think, due to the relatively low amount of different types of ships, technologies, etc. The tactical element is decent, although not heavily stressed, economy is important, visual effects, as I said, are as good as it gets even today... No multiplayer, is also a big minus (Hegemonia The Solon Heritage is multiplayer only, but very hard to find).Overall, great game all around, but not too replayable, no multiplayer, excellent visual effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeworld Lovers Beware....","review":"Hegemonia is a great game for some, but in my humble opinion it's \\"okay\\", I found the controls to be too awkward for my taste. Of course, being a bit biased, I kept comparing it to Homeworld and HW Cataclysm.So don't expect Hegemonia to play like Homeworld. Instead expect the game interface to be quite different. Maybe only then you can appreciate the difference.

The action is fast, the plot never wavers, and the characters are all well-srawn. One interesting quirk to this story is that, when it is required, Sister Pelagia assumes the identity of her \\"sister\\", a widow who dresses and acts exactly as would an upper class member of the Russian nobility.

It simply feels like I'm taking a placebo before I workout.I switched to this after running out of jack3d and taking a 2 week break from caffeine before my workouts.

I've taken Jack3d(DMAA version) and C4 which were far superior to NO-Xplode.About 15 minutes after taking NO-Xplode I would basically void my bowels, guaranteed. It was like clockwork. No one likes taking a dump at the gym before they workout.The scoops are huge compared to Jack3d and C4. The taste is fine though.This product is also pretty expensive when compared to others.Overall I did not see a difference in my workout performace (pump, energy, focus, etc.) and regret wasting my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single best supplement I have ever taken","review":"As I get older, working out with weights has become more of a chore than I'd like it to be. I was turned onto N.O. XPLODE by a friend going through the same stuff. I have a weightlifting history and have been successful and have also taken long spells off probably like most folks without a corporate sponsor :). Anyway, I started taking this stuff in the Blue Raspberry flavor. First of all, it mixes nicely, without the big chalky chunks left by other products. The texture and taste are ten times better too. When taken as per the instructions, I felt ready to take on more weight than I ever have in the gym. I am now lifting as much as I was lifting in high school twenty years ago! I am really grateful for having found N.O.-XPLODE and recommend it for any regular guy like me trying to get back into consistent lifting shape. I'm a lot better for having used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jittery, eventual puking. DO NOT BUY","review":"It was great at first to make you rady to workout, and you could actually feel your blood pumping. It was a little bit of a weird sensation. Both my roommate and I used this for months, and by the 4th month, we had both gotten very sick because of it. all guildelines were followed that NO-Xplode gave us. Multiple peopel I know had this same problem where they would be brought to basically the level of food poisoning after taking this. Do Not BUY. The jitteriness started coming more than a feeling of being ready to work out, and this has been connected to alot of health issues. Wish I never took it.

So I went with N.O.-Xplode. The taste is not too good, the only way I can put it is that it taste's like a tree. I weigh 160 pounds and to get any results you have to take at least 2 scoops. For the money I'd say it is not worth it, better off going with Hemo Rage for the real bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are way better off using a knife","review":"This works, but in most cases it is more trouble than using a knife. Unless you have some reason to actually want to use it for the fancy wave cuts. It is very difficult to clean, especially at the part where the wires fan out from. It also tends to either leave too much avocado behind attached to the skin, unless you really make an effort to force it along the skin, and then sometimes you end up with bits of skin attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"One of the few kitchen gadgets I really like. Replacing my first one which broke a wire when trying to slice an avocado that wasn't ripe enough, so be careful there. Otherwise, perfect for sushi slices or salads. Disigned for Haas avocados, which are the ones you want to use anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but a bit hard to clean","review":"So far, this has worked well on all the avocados we have used it on, but, then again, we tend to buy avocados that are medium-sized. That being said, this works great! It quickly scoops and slices avocados into nice, thin slices that are perfect for whatever you'd like to eat them on.The only difficulty we've encountered thus far is that if you let the avocado set on it and don't clean it right after you use it (when the avocado bits on it are still soft), then it becomes very hard to clean it since the avocado settles and hardens into the areas where the wire fits into the outside perimeter. This really hasn't been a big deal for us, though, and we've been happy with it to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool!","review":"Fit's perfectly for any avocado. Very sharp blade and the handle feels really good in the hand. Nice. Very sturdy and well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly easy to use","review":"This is a handy little slicer and makes getting the avocado out of the skin so easy! Perfect for garnish slices, or to start your batch of guacamole!

While looking for a replacement came across this bulb and since it was a good deal bought it. My turtles are mostly indoor creatures since outside is way too dangerous with ants, cats, and constant falling avocados...but they need sunlight to be healthy. So this light does the trick. It is not very warm but they did bask in it so I guess the rays were good. Still ended up getting another ceramic heat bulb for them for night time (plus we run the AC at 60- 24/7 so it is a bit chilly!). Overall another good purchase through Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a UVB","review":"This is a UVA, not a UVB.

This hardly explains the Israeli chief of staff's (Rabin) nervous breakdown, or the then ex-PM's (Ben Gurion) white hot fury with him for what he perceived as an existential danger.Oren's book is far more extensively sourced from Arab, Hebrew, Russian documents as well as English one - and unlike Bowen evidently strives for precision and balance. The comparison between the two is highly illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This Product does not contain Hydroquinone","review":"D&R apparently produces two version of this product: one with and one without hydroquinone. The product I received does not contain hydroquinone, which as far as I know is the only substance that actually works. What really bothers me is that the product I received does not even list its ingredients. In addition, my first attempt at using resulted in a red spot (allergy?), but I can't tell what's causing it since I don't know what exactly is in the cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances of Grieg's Piano Music","review":"Not only is Leif Ove Andsnes one of our finest pianists, but he certainly must be reckoned as one of the foremost interpreters of Edvard Grieg. This splendid two CD compilation is replete with Andsnes' technically proficient, lyrical playing. His splendid performance of Grieg's piano sonata is certainly the highlight of this collection, but also worth noting are his compelling performances of the Lyric Pieces and the Piano Concerto. Indeed, his elegant, yet somewhat subdued, performance of the Piano Concerto is among the finest I have heard on a studio recording. The Bergen Philharmonic's playing is replete with warmth and brilliance. Those unfamiliar with Andsnes' playing should find this excellent two CD set quite rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscover Robbie Basho","review":"A simple echo of what was previously written. Robbie Basho was the most dazzling artist of the Takoma Records stable (Fahey, Kottke, Lang). It is a shame that this is the one of the few CD reisssues of his prolific career. Get it and start hunting for vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very accessible, but quite creative","review":"I don't listen to Robbie Basho very often, but I respect him enormously. He does, as other reviewers have indicated, have an uncanny ability to make his guitar sound like a sitar. Technically, he was virtually without peer. Compositionally, he was inconsistent. At his best, he flowed evenly between meditative ragas and oddly pleasing dissonance. At his worst, he sounded like he was just banging away randomly on his guitar. For those looking for a more accessible blending of eastern and western sounds, Sandy Bull played a more accessible blend (in fact, several pieces that he explicitly called, \\"Blends\\") which is not as technically impressive, but is far more fluid, and Ry Cooder and VM Bhatt's collaboration (A Meeting By the River), while I find it a bit boring, may be more to the liking of those who like their music dissonance-free. Incidentally, occasionally, Basho tried to sing, which was a dreadful mistake, but those tracks can be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I ordered this CD after reading the two other reviews and was extremely disappointed; difficult to explain but it sounds like this guitarist doesn't really know what he wants to play, not improvising but hesitating all the time and it's quite annoying; the guitar technique is not really there either and on top of that the recording quality is awful. I must add that I'm rarely negative; sorry this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Thumbs Down","review":"Whilst Leo Kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and John Fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers, Robbie Basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-apocalyptic horror done right","review":"I read this so much as a teenager, the front cover fell off. I no longer have a copy (let someone borrow it, never got it back), but if I ever happen to see one I will pick it up and read it again.

Bought it, and the book quality stinks. NO EXCUSE. Yes a review should also consider what it is printed on. The cheapest quality of paper, and light printing.

I read this book in 6 hours, if you are a teenager who thinks he/she is grown-READ THIS BOOK, if you think you're ready for the real world-READ THIS BOOK. In my opinion the ending was very unreal and sappy...I think it could've ended better, but that's just me. What really made this book, is the fact that Ms. Biggs made you feel these characters, you wanted to reach right through the pages and help them through all their trails and tribulations, at times you felt like you were on the outside looking in, then moments later you were in the character's head. A++++++ to Ms. Biggs, I look forward to many more titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"When You Look At Me","review":"Every black woman and man in American should make it their business to read this book.

As a native of Trenton, NJ transplanted to Los Angeles 20 years ago, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME took me back home in a serious way. Not only did I see myself in Tammy when I was a teenage mother at 16, but the references to the locale, specific streets and riding to Philly made me homesick. Undra has done a wonderful job of smashing the stereotypical idea that all teenage mothers are ignorant and all drug dealers are heartless. Smart people making dumb choices happens everywhere and Undra Briggs successfully makes everyone cheer when the situations gets better. I look forward to more from this talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"dynamic! very well written!","review":"This book is so well written. It's unbelievable to think that this is the author's first novel. The novel is the story of Tammy and Hassan, a young urban couple who face extreme obstacles.

It moved really fast and flowed very smoothly.With all the odds against her can Tammy get her life together and discover her god-given potential.

The beautiful illustrations come perfectly together with the words to tell a story that is quietly moving. With relatively few words, the intriquing character of Grandfather and that of Lizzie are effectively portrayed. The untold details invite an array of questions and speculations. Grandfather seems intelligent and articulate. Why is he living in primitive solitude in the mountains? Is Lizzie visiting, or does she live there? If she is visiting, why is she up there alone on Christmas? This is a book that will affect the adult who is reading to a child as much as to the child her/himself.

Anyone beyond an Assistant Brand Manager role at any decent company knows this stuff cold. And, in my experience dealing with agencies, so do most mid-level and above ad people. Basically, he's selling himself. Every chapter contains tales of his great ideas and the 'visionaires' who agree with him (some of them dead.)Still, Sergio managed a 6-figure advance for a thin book with college-level information.

Useless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the HTM listener","review":"Another blissful fruit to be savored by those who are already Happy the Man fans. As this is a demo tape for their third album (which never went to full production), there is some tape hiss and loss of dynamics. As far as rehearsal tapes go, though, the production is better than can be expectd.Not as aggressive as Crafty Hands or as quirky as the first album, these works tend to be more contemplative and reflective. Some pieces are strikingly haunting (\\"While Chrome Yellow Shine\\", \\"At the Edge of this Thought\\"), while others are Canterbury-influenced , and others still are more fusion-related.If you are not already familiar with their work, look first to the first two albums, the self-titled progressive woodland \\"Happy the Man\\" first album, and the more gripping, powerful \\"Crafty Hands\\" 2nd album. And as they are back together now, watch for their upcoming release, \\"The Muse Awakens\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I liked the story. It's kind of an old times fairy tale, ''of a girl coming from nowhere and becoming someone in the city of dreams.'' Liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"I have read many of Erica Spindlers books and have enjoyed them. I read the reviews on Amazon.com and thought I'd try it. I was very disappointed!!! I usually read 2-3 books a week. It was an easy book to get into but went down hill from there. Too many story lines and not a smooth flow. I will continue to read Spindlers books but will research it much better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable author","review":"I always enjoy reading books by this author, but this book surpasses any that she has written; very hard to put down and keeps you in suspense. Look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring compared to her other books","review":"The first book I read by Erica Spindler was \\"Killer Takes All\\" which got me hooked on her writing. I started reading any book of hers I could find but I tend to shy away from a book that's more than seven or eight years old. \\"Red\\" is not a murder mystery much to my dismay. It's reads more like a Harlequin Romance and I found it to be way too long for the story content. Girl is unhappy; girl leaves small town for big city; girl makes it big and meets the love of her life. It was written nearly 17 years old and I didn't really care for it but it was readable. If I don't like a book I'll just stop reading it but I was able to finish this one. If I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would but two stars will have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE!","review":"This was one of the first books that I read over and over. I absolutely love it!

When I first got Viento de Agua, I shelved it after not connecting with the sparcity of the sound. Unknowingly someone put it in the auto cd player and drove around not realizing it was this cd that I did not like. I love these types of surprises, especially when I am arrogant and dismissive.

Biram travels to some dark places on \\"Graveyard Shift.\\" Certainly, that statement is not a revelation, merely a confirmation. Mr. Biram performs all the music, employing electric and acoustic guitars, harmonica, and organ, plus various other instruments (oops, not so fast, a fellow named Ethan Shaw contributes some steel guitar on the track 18 Wheeler Fever).The primal mix of rock (heavy stuff), blues, gospel, country and whatever else one wants to look for suggests Mr. Biram either vacations in Hell or gnaws brimstone for breakfast. There are no silver-linings here, just gut-checks and coal-black images that linger a bit too long. Though there is a certain flatness in spots (imagine how these songs might sound with a full band of conspirators helping out), hats off to Mr. Biram for conjuring up this eclectic batch of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're new to Pro Tools ?

Take my word for it: There's NOTHING out there as good as this book! And I don't mean that just in an instructional sense ... the QUALITY of the book's pages, the FULL COLOR screenshots, the witty, easily understandable language ... this is definitely THE BEST Pro Tools book I've ever read! The author's unintimidating approach makes you see results FAST! You will literally LOVE Pro Tools from now on ... and you will really KNOW how to put it to use! If you're a musician like me (not an engineer) this is the book to get.Don't think twice about it: you will learn quickly and easily!Bravo and thank you, Gina Fant-Saez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.","review":"I am a real beginner so this review should be taken with some caution.I do not like this book for many reasons. One of them is that it is not updated. No chapter numbers at bottom of pages. Metaphors that I can't relate to i.e., the actual \\"bus\\" on page 152. \\"...no one can get off the bus until it reaches the station.\\" Then later, \\"You can drop a single passenger off at 32 different destinations...\\"I am a Mac user and it became annoying that the windows keys were combined with the mac keys.

Ther'e either overly basic, or worst than the manual, and then comes along Gina's book. This book is top notch and the website has free support from gina if you own the book. Hey i even called her and she was nice enough to help me through an issue (WOW!). You can't go wrong with this book, even the protools courseware book isn't as through and easily understandable as this book. I've progressed leaps and bounds and i'm not even up to chapter 9 yet. I was intimidated by protools before, but no more. Thanks Gina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure Where to Go From Here","review":"I was very excited when I got the book and my working through it started out great. However, I got stuck in one part of it and tried everything I could to get unstuck to no avail. I then tried to contact the author with the contact information offered and never got a response. I tried repeatedly and got back nothing. The book is now sitting on my shelf and I still don't know as much about Pro Tools as I need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This is a book of examples and exercises so don't expect to look up a particular function or problem that you are having, the Table on Contents is not up to that job. Again this is a book of simple examples and exercises directed to beginners that need to be lead completely from scratch but I found the text too drawn out and confusing with such items as references to a real bus to illustrate a mixer. The items that I was interested in were noted in the text that they would be covered later but no reference as to where in the text they would be covered. Obviously not a book for me, I have read and seen better."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!","review":"It seems like quite a claim to say that this is the \\"greatest book ever\\" but I really believe it is. Gina takes you step by step through every aspect of Pro Tools so you can learn the program correctly from the start. Make sure you do the exercises and follow along and you will be recording great sounding music in no time. I have owned several other books and several other recoding programs but I could never get them to work like the combination of this book with Pro Tools. She teaches you all the shortcuts you need to save time and focus more on making music rather than wasting time trying to figure stuff out. I am really very happy with this book and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into home/studio recording with Pro Tools no matter your level of experience. I am so thankful for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love em","review":"One Thing this band never lacked was air play.But there is a good reason for that because they produced alot of good songs that make you feel good.Obviously my favorites are their big hits like Barbara-Ann,I Get Around,Little Deuce Coupe,Surfin' Safari,Help Me Rhonda,California Girls David lee Roths version of that song was great also,Good Vibrations,Sloop John B.,Fun Fun Fun,Wouldn't It Be Nice and a definite favorite Heroes and Villains."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Original Recordings From 1962-1970 Plus California Dreamin' From 1986.","review":"If like me you have lost count of the number of Beach Boys Greatest Hits etc, you have to ask yourself what does this one have to raise it above so many others.Well the songs are really are fantastic summer sounds, for example Don't Worry Baby, God Only Knows, Break Away and California Dreamin'.With 28 songs spread over almost 80 minutes, there's no lack of quantity either.Maybe the clincher is the individual notes on each song, basically very informative.Finally California Dreamin' includes Roger McGuinn's Rickenbacker guitar solo, that really concludes the CD on another high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to the Party but Darn Glad to be There...","review":"Although many reviews have already been written on this novel, I'm not sure we are giving the book as much credit as it deserves. Yes, it's another sexy paranormal, but the adventure component really leaves me breathless. The fights are well-staged and assaults led on enemy compounds with small groups of--er--good werewolves, vampires, shape shifters, etc are NOT predictable. There is an element of surprise/danger to the leads that is not always present in the more typical books. Also going beyond the sensuality part of this genre is always a welcome change. Yeah, everybody is as busy as little bunnies--including the bunnies--but the relationship between bunny-business, adventure and character is more balanced. My only \\"complaint\\" is the name of the Australian towns take a little getting used to--I keep thinking the characters are on another planet!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the same thing","review":"I will have to say I was disappointed in the book, maybe if I had read the previous book it would have helped. I felt the story line was thin and too much sex which was every other page, how much does an author need to stress one trait?My opinion is that the author could have developed some of the characters in this book more, for instance Kade and Kellen. I did like the character Misha who wasn't your typical character in love and his end was quite creative; the letter towards the end was a nice conclusion between Misha & Riley.I'm not sure I will continue on with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed.....","review":"I have read every Keri Arthur book, and was a little disappointed in this one. It could have been so much better. I like sex, but there is too much casual sex w/ too many partners for my taste. The chemistry w/ Quinn should have been further explored. Just b/c Riley is a wolf doesn't mean she has to sleep w/ every person she comes across. I am not too excited about the next book. I wouldn't waste my hard earn money on this book - get it from the library b/c it is not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulpy fun","review":"I am writing this from the Kindle, so it will be brief. I found the series to be interesting, since it was designed as a multi-book arc. I would surmise that the reason why the author has the main character engage in so much sex is to be true to the nature of werewolves. Riley often states that she must have sex to avoid going into a killing and sex rampage. I don't mind it so much, since it provides a motivating force for her character. I like the confusion over her relationship with Quinn, since it provides some depth to the character. a good book to read for pleasure. (something Riley works on having!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enjoyable read...","review":"Another enjoyable read from Keri. If you enjoy your men too hot to handle and a bit of paranormal steaminess, give this book a go.It's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The promiscuity issue is a valid one for the Riley books, so if you're not sure if you can deal with that, maybe these aren't for you.For those of us who enjoy the fun, flirty frivolity keep them coming Keri!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Like the first book, this one was also hard for me to put down. I love all of the action, the characters, and the love scenes. I also adore Riley's sense of humor. I am extremely anxious to read the other books in this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling Sin","review":"Let's be honest, if you are an avid reader of anything with some weight and meat, this is NOT for you. This is nothing more than a tawdry sex-filled silly tale of vampires and werewolves plus some other creatures I'm not quite sure of that is just plain ridiculous.If you like Anne Rice, you will NOT like this. It doesn't even compare.If you like Harlequin romance and cheap sex, you will LOVE this.I love vampire films and I loved Anne Rice's writings, but this just didn't cut it for me. It was just plain all wrong and too farfetched. Plus, what's with all the tawdry sex? It distracted from the story, in my opinion and most definitely did not add to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another success for Keri Arthur","review":"I love this series and Keri Arthur does not let you down when it comes to vampire, werewolf action series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"I've read almost all of Keri Arthur's books.

Would recommend this series to everyone who likes vampire/werewolf books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salacious Action","review":"For those who enjoyed \\"Halfway to the Grave\\" by Jeaniene Frost, this were-vamp story will peak your interest. It's is a neat version of the paranormal... and most certainly for adults only. A unique strong heroine, Riley, doesn't want to be the center of an unexpected conspiracy yet she's strong & smart and doesn't shy away from dealing with it. The story never gets boring. If it's not the unraveling conspiracy, the pangs of sexual craving and needs satisfied, and/or the action, the story is simply never boring. I disagree with those that have indicated that the characters never get to full development. The chief characters are developed well enough to avert boredom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weasels Ripped my Flesh!","review":"While I agree with other reviewers that Feral House's \\"It's A Man's World\\" is a vastly superior book, This is still a nice collection of images for the purveyor of unique Americana.I collect these insane artifacts and there just can't possibly be enough books published on the subject.

The volume is beautifully produced, like all Taschen books, though I have to add that I find it no better than a similar compendium of men's-mag art called IT'S A MAN'S WORLD, which came out six months earlier; and IAMW, it should be said, has a more extensive and entertaining text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a man and then I saw it at my local library.I thought it interesting that my quaint small town library would offer thebook to patrons considering some of the pictures.I found the book to be very interesting and with some historical facts.I did not know that magazines such as those mentioned in the book existedand that they existed before Playboy!I found out some interesting facts about the publishing world,the pictures from the magazines were interestingand artistically lovely.I can understand - for educational and historical purposes, why my locallibrary offers it to patrons.Any facts about people, places and things is worth reading.History is history.Plus I read a book a day so I voraciously read anything and everything.I give it a 5 star rating.

Agricultural chemicals drift at least 25 miles after they are sprayed, even when the wind is not blowing. They end up in our drinking water and cause cancer in humans and animals.

Although this was a great DVD I only have one complaint. (Maybe it's my system though). The audio sounds as though it is too loud so when I turn it up it starts blaring. I also have the Eagles - Hell Freezes Over Tour on DVD. It sounds awesome. It has to be the recording of Stings DVD that causes the distorted sound. Could I have gotten a bad DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"This DVD is best viewed the first time by selecting the documentary portion. The sound is awesome and the video is gorgeous. The somber mood in the beginning of the concert (since it was filmed on September 11, 2001) came through vividly as did the rise in spirits the band and audience received as the performace progressed. I have several concert DVDs and this one is the best made one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super! Fantastic!","review":"I had seen a portion of the documentary on TV and was anxiously awaiting the DVD.As I sat and watched the DVD with my husband, I told him that I would have worked in the kitchen as cook and clean-up crew just to have been there. It was the most amazing thing to have realized that after only 2 weeks, these fantastic musicians could come together when never having played together as a band before and created such an EXCELLENT performance.The sincerity with which \\"Fragile\\" was performed was touching and I was VERY glad that Sting decided to do his concert on 9-11 ... it turned out as a tribute to our lost family and friends as well as our heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with the following:","review":"This CD is so full of stuff I still haven't seen it all. The behind the scenes film is probably longer than the concert. The tragedy is this was filmed the night of Sept. 11th.

The concert is intimate with the backstage footage allowing you to really get to know the musicans you see behind him and his willingness to \\"share the spotlight\\" with all of them. He is a great guy and I love Italy. If you love Sting, this is a must, it's totally worth your money.

It not only hydrated (without the heavy, greasy feeling), but my face actually looked more youthful right away! It even brought some color to my washed out winter face. So I had to get on the computer and look up reviews, and sure enough, this product seems to be a hit. For once, a product does what it says it will, without costing a small fortune!

She could turn in circles easily and it didn't tip over at all. She throughly loved this experience and that makes us happy. Problems - it did not inflate with our bike pump - we had to go to the service station. It began to deflate after about 2 weeks so we had to make a return trip. It completely deflated and was unusable after the third month.

The first one I purchase was deflated by the time we walked from our garage to the pool. I was very dissapointed but figured it was a fluke. I exchanged it for a new one. This time it lasted about a week or three trips to the pool. Needless to say I am very dissapointed in the quality. The concept is great. My son was all over the pool independently and loving it!

The suit worked good for about 3 months. Then they started leaking out air and not staying a float. It was strange that both of these done this.

I would never just let her swim around on her own or take my eyes off of her, but God forbid she ever fell in, her head would not be kept above water.

We have had similar items before, it was the end of the season and they were no longer available locally therefore I ordered it online. When it came it was exactly as I thought it would be, they only problem was after we used it about 3 times it would no longer hold air. As far as I am concerned it was a total waist of money. Had I purchased it locally I would have taken it back but since I ordered it on line I threw all the paper work, packaging and information away after we opened it so I had nothing to send it back with. Of all the things I have ordered over the years this was the first time I have been so disappointed in a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pool Independence!","review":"I saw a little guy using this at a pool we were at he was swimming around the whole pool so I bought it. We started my daughter in at 22 mos. and she did great. She got even better with it all summer at 2 1/2. She took swimming lessons and learned some basics, but this is perfect for the long pool days. She can go anywhere in the pool with our supervision, and she is really mastering the kicking to move and using her arms. Unlike the life vests, she can't get herself in a position she can't get out of. It is so balanced. She can even go on her back, float, and turn back on to her belly. This is so great! It is very durable also. The tube is rubber. You need a bike pump to blow it up. We took it to Jamaica the first time we needed it and my husband had to go to the watersports to get it blown up. Now we leave it blown up at home. I highly recommend this and wouldn't waste my money on other water solutions because I think this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for Independence","review":"I bought several of these for my 3 children, who are now 10, 12, and 14. I looked everywhere for them when the store we had originally bought the first one no longer sold it. These gave my children confidence in the water, and I was confident that my children were always safe in them. The only negative was the serious wedgies they got ( so I always kept undies underneath to help with that), but other than that, they're worth it. I tried so many types of swimmers, floats, life jackets, and none beat this one. The funnest part was watching people's amazement at our two-year-olds jumping right into the deep end as we watched from a lounge chair. Kids are top heavy, so always watch them, but this helps their water confidence so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I purchased two of these swim trainers for my twin grandsons. They are very slender 2 year old's but getting the suits on and off was a nightmare! At one point I thought we would have to cut them out with scissors but after almost breaking their arms and causing red scraped skin and lots of crying we got them out. The neck holes are far to narrow and the material doesn't give at all. The tube itself has an 8 inch hole to fit the child into so if your kid is even average weight forget it! The worst thing however, was that one of the tubes deflated completely and very suddenly while we were in the pool! Thank goodness I was holding the child at the time. We tried to reinflate it but it wouldn't even hold air after that. The company was very apologetic and cooperative about a refund. Don't take your eyes off your kids in the water if you try this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a \\"must have\\" for any child learning to swim","review":"As a Pediatric Nurse and 1st time mother, I cannot say enough about this product. I buy it in bulk to give to friends and their toddlers!. My daughter has increased her water skills,balance and confidance with the Swim School Tot Trainer. Because it is essentially a full bathing suit, unlike water wings, she cannot take this off nor does it slip off. It does require actual inflation with a pump however which might not always be handy but it is well worth the safety and confidance it offers the entire family. It is my best purchase yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"I am a fan of this type of swim aide BUT i recently purchased 2 of these at our local K-Mart.

In the kiddie pool, everytime he bent forward or reached for something, the tube flipped him over and because of it's bouyancy, held him underwater - he couldn't right himself. This happened both when his feet were on the bottom and when he was floating in it. Perhaps it's better suited to larger children in a standard pool where they are truly floating, but I would be cautious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"A swim product that does nothing but tip your child over and dunk his face into the water?

I was delighted to find it on here and buy it for my son.

It gave her freedom and allowed her to enjoy the water without fear. When my nephew turned 2 I purchased one for him. He is only 30 lbs and it is way too small for him. I'm really surprised that it didn't fit, considering he weights less than my daughter did when I purchased hers. Not just that, but I paid $[...] plus shipping on Amazon and three days later they offered at $[...]. When I called to talk to them about it, they told me that is just the way it worked out. They would not adjust the price, I could ship it back to the seller if I wanted to but it was not their problem.

This is much better than any I have used. It's very solid and doesn't use a plastic air plug that can easily be pulled out. Other jackets, etc. would push up on his face. This keeps him well above water. He did tip a little at first but quickly learned how to keep his balance which increased his confidence in the pool. We still don't take our eyes off of him for a second of course!!!! His sister was confidently swimming on her own at the age of 4 and I think he will be swimming this year at 3.

We tried using 2 different bike pumps without success. I emailed the company and got the following reply, \\"In order to effectively use a Boston valve, it is recommended that you use a low pressure electric pump, a bellow pump, or the reverse end of a vacuum cleaner.\\" My vaccum cleaner doesn't seem to have a reverse end, so I guess I need to buy a pump in order to use the toy. Getting to be very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - know its intended use.","review":"This product is not intended for those under 2. I know the product states this but as my son is larger than an average 2 year old at only 18 mths we have to try something that will fit him. This product has an extrmemly durable inner tube, its so buyant it can nearly hold up an adult. Therefore, any child on the low end of the weight scale will have difficulty using it. The tube has a natural tendency to turn on its side with the child in it, which means my son's face gets pushed into the water. He is not strong enough to pull up his head becasue the tube is too buyant. My son weighs 30lbs which is well within the weight range but as you can see you child must also be able to lift his own body weight. This product is a hazard if you are not very diligent when small children are using it and is better suited to older and larger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't work for us","review":"This may work fine for children that are a little older, but we have the neighborhood swim center which is 2.2ft. deep and every time one of them bent over their head went under water.

This item is good compromise and it can grow with him as he gets even bigger and becomes a better swimmer.We alternate between this and a regular old life jacket when we go to the pool or lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"This item did not work well for me. My son is two and weights 29 pounds. In the pool, the float kept tipping to one side. I blew the float up correctly and it still did not work well.

It's rated for ages 2-7 years old, but I couldn't find a weight recommendation. This just did NOT work. He immediately tipped over face first into the water. Our son's about 27 pounds, which shouldn't be too much weight considering the age rating.

As soon as we put him in the pool, he immediately fell forward, face first, into the water. We had to hold him up the entire time, and he was really unstable. The tube is too small to balance him and he would have needed to arch backwards to keep himself upright. I think I'm going back to the first stage of this swim series where he sat in a seat inside a larger tube (Deluxe Racer?). It was totally stable, has handles for the parent to hold on to, and he loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Of all the floats out there for babies/toddlers, this is the best! Many years ago when our son was a baby, we tried many other things before discovering this one. This one is very safe, gives them freedom and you too, because you don't feel as if you have to hold onto them all of the time, though you do have to stay next to them and keep a watchful eye. Also, it was very durable, lasted a very long time before we had to go to the next size and we kept buying them until he was five and no longer needed one. I just can't say enough about this item and it does help them to learn how to swim also. My son did not mind having it on. It was easy to get on and off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best swim aide available for little kids","review":"My two year old twins loved this suit. They had such freedom in the pool. You have to stay next to them though since they can still get their faces in the water if they don't \\"hold on\\" or they tip too far to one side. We had no problem with the durability issues that others had. We inflated these once and used them a whole year, which included leaving them in the car in the heat and throwing groceries on top of them.Unfortunately, at age three they have outgrown them. Okay, I have big kids - 40 lbs each. I don't remember the weight limit on the package, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't go to 40 lbs.

I had bought the 4GB before and also a 4GB from a different brand. In my experience I've found USB flash drives to be EXTREMELY un-reliable, so please don't trust any valuable data to these things. They only thing they should be used for is for temporary transfers of data."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Flash Drive has only 15 GB Capacity -- NOT 16 GB!!!","review":"Everything works fine with the drive. As far as functionality I have had no problems as of yet (only had it for a couple of days). But the one problem I have is that it is advertised as having a capacity to hold/store 16 GB yet when I checked my free space for the first time before loading it up, the max. capacity shown is 15 GB. What happened to that missing 1 GB of space??? I kinda feel cheated. It's not worth arguing to the Kingston company or Amazon about or trying to return it for this reason but I did feel I should notify and inform you guys that are thinking of buying this drive. Works fine but you aren't completing getting what you're paying for.P.S. If there is an intentional reason for this that I may not be aware of maybe somebody more tech savvy can explain this to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution for backing up important files","review":"The Kingston 16 GB flash drive (less than $30) is the ideal solution, at least for me, for backing up my real important files.

Just some ergonomic and convenience issues that made me regret purchase. Moving the knob to get the usb connector out is tougher than it should be. May just be a one off, but shattered a thumbnail in the first few attempts. Also, I prefer to attach these sticks to a key ring fob so they are easier to find and not lose. I found no easy way to do that with the very small bar and space at the end of the stick that seems to be for this purpose.

I use it as the primary storage of important files that I like to keep with me so I can access them at work or at home. However, it has happened several times now that one or more of my files have become corrupted. Luckily, I back it up regularly on my PC's hard drive so I haven't been totally hosed. The previous jump drive I used never had this problem. I'm also not thrilled about how it retracts into the housing, leaving the end open for dust and/or dirt to get into the USB connection. Better to find a product with a real cap to cover the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does have an LED","review":"In response to Thomas Tracy's review, this drive does have an LED. It is green and can be seen through the \\"window\\" which is also the logo for the flash drive -- a man's face.I also experienced faster write times. While not using as complex a data set, I was able to transfer large movie files from an external hard drive to this flash drive at about 15 seconds per 100MB. That's about 2.5 minutes per 1GB.The outer shell is a plastic that may feel flimsy when you hold it, but it should be able to resist most impacts. Don't put it in your back pocket, but sensitive devices like this should never be sat upon. The tab that slides the connector in and out must be depressed before it can be moved, so it keeps the connector safe and steady.The capacity and price make this drive a great value. It has a slot in the end to tie a string or small keychain to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it does well.","review":"It's a flash drive, works well, does what it does without any other software, and generally good, the only thing that can be bad about it, is being scratched easily, but that's just for cosmetic purposes. there is also the issue of maybe dust getting in the port, but I have not had issues with this yet. Doubtful that I will. Great flash drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Great Price","review":"This is a great product for a good price.

The film was a great disappointment from the first two which left one with happy, warm holiday feelings. This one's story line is too disjointed and inappropriate for young kids and portrays a nastiness around Santa and his family that was really sad to see. I would not recommend this film as a family type product."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible..................","review":"This movie is really bad, the elves so cheesy you will want to cry, the scripting terrible. Sadly, this movie had a lot of potential, Martin Short is normally funny, but not in this garbadge, the first time I put it on, I turned it off 40 minutes later, stricken by how bad it was.This movie would be fine for little kids with short attention spans but I don't think the majority of adults would be able to watch this.The plot could've been good too, the other Santas were good movies, this one had Martin S as Jack Frost, sounds interesting right? If you want to waste 20 dollars then this a perfect way to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone want to be there?","review":"It seemed as if the actors didn't even want to be there. Very little emotion in this movie. The movie also seemed to be slapped together quickly. Frost, I think, was the best character, but with a PG rated, how funny can you get? The North Pole was a depressing, child labor factory. Almost all jokes were very lame and the movie was slow paced. I recommend a DVD rental only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, borring and terribly written.......","review":"This movie was absolutly awful. My five kids 9,10,11,12 & 14 dropped out of the living room like flies and my husband fell asleep. It was slow boring and terribly written I felt liked they threw it together in one day!

Don't waste either on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so sure","review":"I was disappointed in the family strife in this movie. Its Santa Clause, it should be good times and magic. Bringing back to us the joy of childhood, not a reminder of real life family struggles and ruthless people trying to get ahead and promote themselves.

Very good family entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santa vs Jack Frost","review":"I must admit, I loved the original movie \\"The Santa Clause\\", and Tim Allen was wonderful as the father turned Santa. It was a funny, magical movie for families to watch. Even the follow-up movie was cute and got my ok.But this movie was not funny, nor cute, and especially not magical. It was all about a mean Jack Frost trying to trick Santa. Not a pleasant feeling anywhere throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ... well, Nasty!","review":"The idea behind \\"Santa Clause 3\\" might work were it not for the excessive nastiness and cynicism that permeates it. \\"Santa Clause 1\\" was light on its feet, fully exploiting the possibilities in the premise with humor and, for the most part, sweetness (some of the late-movie elf stuff was a little overboard). \\"Santa Clause 2\\" was enjoyable, keeping the sweetness but leaving out the pepper supplied in the original by David Krumholtz as Bernard the Elf. It was a bit too syrupy.\\"Santa Clause 3\\" goes several bridges too far in the opposite direction. It gives us sort of a corporate takeover by Nazis, and revels in the misery resulting.And that, folks, is not what I want from a Christmas movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sequel to a once great franchise","review":"Yikes! What a poor effort. While I loved the first Santa Clause and was able to enjoy the second, this third installment was met by a round of boos at our house. Quite obv. a take on It's a Wonderful Life, there was just not any of the old magic left in this limping third installment.Elf (Infinifilm Edition)is a much better holiday movie from recent years, watch that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause","review":"This movie was a complete disapointment. The first two movies were so great and this movie was lacking in everything they had.The acting was stale, as if they were just going through the motions instead of getting into their characters (except for Martin Short who put a little effort into his role), the storyline wasn't good and most of all, throughout the entire movie, the comedic timing was off, meaning there were pauses or dead air after lines were said that were meant to be funny but were not funny at all.In my opinion, they should have quit while they were ahead with just the two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this movie.","review":"I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.

The character reminded me of Jim Carrey's character in one of the Batman movies, only with more malevolence. The story line was ho-hum. There were a few funny moments, but mostly I just wanted the movie to be over. I may give the movie another try when it comes out on DVD. My suggestions to you are to a) not take young or easily frightened children to see this in the theater (my child is quite sensitive, but then, so many children are) and b) unless you are a huge fan of Christmas movies, wait for the DVD next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for family enjoyment","review":"I'm not a Martin Short fan, that said, the movie was pretty good -- I really missed \\"Bernard\\" (the head elf) but I know that even elves grow up.

When I went to watch this movie on Saturday, I did not find one scene funny at all. The only funny stuff in this movie was the bloopers. Overall, the movie just sucks! It wasn't that great as the first one. The first one was more funnier. The second one was good too, but this one was just not that great. It was okay and all but it just wasn't that funny. I personally think that I should have seen Borat instead of this movie. At least, I would have something to laugh about! I miss the 90s! They used to have such good movies that were much more funnier! If anyone want to see a good Christmas movie, I would recommend Home Alone 1,2, Miracle on 34th Street, and The Santa Clause 1,2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, very good","review":"Overall this movie is very good. We bought it because we had the first two, and it didn't feel complete without the third. The ending was a little too cheesy, but for the most part it was very enjoyable and I'm glad we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute - love \\"Jack Frost\\"!","review":"Martin Short plays Jack Frost and is excellent in this role.None of these movies were made to win Emmys. They're just fun, family friendly, and interesting (particularly some of the sets).So, don't expect award winning acting but this is definitely something unexpected - when the third movie is BETTER than the second. The second movie was pretty bad and forced. This is more natural - and takes a page out of Frosty the Snowman with a \\"cold hearted\\" Jack Frost character trying to steal the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"THe Santa Clause 1 is STILL the BEST!","review":"Stick with version 1.This sequel does not match up.... silly.Kids never watched it more than once... a sure sign of mediocrity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Santa Claus 3","review":"I was disappointed with this film.After \\"Frosty\\" showed up, I regainedmy sense of disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"In My Opinion!","review":"I was disappointed in this third and latest sequel to The Santa Clause series!

One thing that really bothers me is Bernard one of the funniest charecters is MIA. Nobody seems to care at all. Nobody so much as says Bernard is on vacation. Curtis is simply the head elf. I spent the entire movie thinking Curtis killed Bernard and buried him in the snow and Santa dosen't give a handfull of reindeer poop.I don't rember much of the plot because there wasn't much of a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"11th day of Christmas 2012 review","review":"On the 11th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...The Santa Clause 3:The Escape Clause. The story while not bad,it's very predictable. It's loosely base on It's a Wonderful Life but instead of wishing he was never born,he wishes he was never Santa. The acting in here is range from so-so to bad. Martin short as the villain(Jack Frost) is a welcome presence but it fails to save this tried series from rolling on drawing from it's bag of bland gags & dumb slapstick. It's clean but boring. The sets are nice. The effects are not great but pretty good. The costumes are nice and creative too. Overall,it's not the worst but they could have better. I give this movie a 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun holiday entertainment","review":"I was told not to expect too much as each one movie in this series is worse than the one before. That's why I waited so long to see this one. Maybe the low expectation helped, but I loved it. I thought that the flash backs to 12 years ago were great! I thought the visuals were colorful, joyous, and beautiful. I loved seeing the original cast back again. The storyline was a bit of a rip off of It's a Wonderful Life, but who cares? It was warm, Christmasy and very kid appropriate. Even the bad guy gets to be good in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent, dependent and cheap","review":"Caiman is a good seller. They possess a wide spectrum of DVDs and are usually found among the top new DVD sellers. I've purchased quite a bit from Caiman and never found reason to complain.

They also often sell Criterion at low prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre","review":"There were so many positive reviews of this film, I figured it must be good. Plus, It had Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren as leads!! How could you go wrong, right?? This movie was so dated, so slow, and so boring it barely keeps you interested. Some reviewers made vague comparisons to \\"The Godfather\\", are you kidding me?? This is a far cry from any good gangster film. The potential of the story was very good, but the delivery, development, direction, and editing were horrible !!! At the end you know the who, but not the why??? Don't waste two hours of your time watching this, it's a BIG disappointment !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pricey for Such a Yawner","review":"40 minutes into the story, it was as hard to pay attention to it as it was in the first few minutes. British suspense flicks are often taught and compelling, but this one moves too slowly and has too much aimless dialog. You pretty soon stop caring what's going on. Helen Mirren is a great actress, but you see little of her and way too much of the male lead who seems to have to hold the entire movie together. Advertising Mirren as primary is deceptive. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoskins. One word that sums it up.","review":"I'm surprised this film isn't more highly regarded than it is. I'd never even heard of it before perusing a magazine article about the PS2 game 'The Getaway', which listed its top inspirations from British gangland cinema. Along with Michael Caine's 'Get Carter,' 'The Long Good Friday' properly catches the grit and chagrin of 1970s Britain. Though Hoskins' Harold Shand has raised himself to a different level of the food chain than Caine's Carter. He's a man living in the past, still enamored by the Bentley motors, fat Cuban cigars, the pomp and trappings of a once-was empire as the modern age crashes in around him. Anyway, great film. Keep an eye out for P.H. Moriarity (Hatchet Harry in 'Lock Stock'), Paul Freeman (Belloq of 'Raiders' fame), and a gum-chewing Pierce Brosnan in his first on-screen role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, shame about the dubbing.","review":"Am i the only person to notice the shameless dubbing of a great film. I originally purchased the Region 2 version.Special Edition! I naturally expected the full uncut, un-edited, and certainly ud-dubbed version to be there.When the Criterion version came out i expected more but unfortunately it was the same. The worst part is that in the extras in an interview with Bob Hoskins and Barrie O'Keefe,Hoskins tells of how horrified he was on first seeing the original version released by the American studio and how they had dubbed his own voice to make him sound like 'a Geordie'(thats someone from Newcastle for any Americans who may be reading ).He was so outraged he threatened to sue the company.Eventually he managed to persuade Hand Made Films to buy the rights from the original owners.The only way to see the film as it was supposed to be seen is on VHS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good movie.","review":"Dated, but still a good movie with a good twist, a very young Pierce Brosnan, worth seeing again, or for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic gangster thriller","review":"A modern classic within both British film and the gangster genre, this movie's stature seems to grow with each passing year. 'The Long Good Friday' is not only a great picture in its own right but, in many respects, it paved the way for more recent hits like 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' which also dealt with the machinations of the London underworld. Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren, two of Britain's most versatile screen performers, are at their very best in this one, which in my opinion is unmissable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The british answer to the Godfather","review":"The clever script allows to build a sollid story. Bob Hoskins surpasses all his performances, past, present or even future. He gave the best performance of his monumental career.The progressive tension around Hoskins literally overflows the screen and struggles us. That hopeless, that certainless of facing against an enemy of the IRA dimensions and the irreverent mood assumed by Hoskins in that unforgettable dialogue with his american partners lead to a smart and unexpecting ending.Helen Mirren , combines her talent and amazing beuty and Pierce Brossnan has a little cameo in the end of the movie.Under any circunstance you can avoid watching this brilliant and even underrated film of the eighties.A true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Viewing","review":"This is one of the best Gangster films ever made.

The engagement ring is well enough, I actually get compliments on it all the time. but the wedding band ring, all the stones are falling out, on all sides, so I cant even turn the bad side underneath my finger.

I was so disappointed when I opened my package today. My first thought was it looked cheap and fake and almost bubble gum machine looking. The center stone is way too big for me and it sets up really high. I can imagine it knocking into everything and getting in the way. The stones go around the whole band and even with the thinness of the band it's too wide between the fingers and the stones scratch the inside of each finger touching the ring. This ring will be going back. Beware...this would be a hard ring to pass off as real looking! Also the picture of the ring is deceiving; I think it looks nothing like the picture.

The forward of this book was written by the author who explains that he is an emergency orthopedic trauma surgeon and he collected phrases for use in his practice and then turned them into a book....that is exactly what he did, so unless you are an orthopedic trauma surgeon then this book would be a waste of your money.Many of the phrases included relate to bone injuries, forget having any questions related to chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other common emergency room complaint. Many of the phrases are redundant. The book is also poorly organized which makes finding any specific phrase or question difficult.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be glad you bought it.","review":"I bought this album based on reading an interview with John5 on [...].

The food i made with it was delicious, and the idea of a bun warrmer is mindblowing. But I found one of the major drawbacks of the grill is that, when provoked, it will attack and seriously wound anything that comes near it. We recently lost the family dog to a grill attack, and my wife was forced to get stiches on her right arm after atttemtping to heat up a sandwich.While these setbacks did bring about some hesitation in my decision to keep the grill, We just can't let this baby go. Its too effective, almost in a hypnotic way.

When the grill becomes hot enough, it does prepare food well. However, for those of us who want to be able to clean the device after using, it is definately lacking. Since it cannot be submerged, cleaning with good hot soap and water is a no-no. Some food can be dislodged with the plastic spatula, and some cannot. Small particles of food become trapped in the grease outlit, and have to be dug out with a toothpick, or other small device. If this aperature is not clean, deposits of food become rancid. Eventually, when the hole is reamed out, the sticky black residue is both unsightly and unhealthy. In short, the grill cannot be cleaned with a plastic spatula, and a paper towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the upgraded grill with the removable plates instead.","review":"I wish I had.

As it describes itself, it is not a documentary and not fiction. It could have been a great documentary but instead they made a mediocre artsy film out of it. They say no special effects are used, so I guess editing out the motor and other noises from the soundtrack is not considered a special effect. The narration is very sparse and sometimes you would like just a little more explanation of what you are seeing. The photography is fascinating but after a while my feeble American mind could stand no more French subtlety (if that is what it was) and I fell asleep. I thought the music was just dreadful.

Unfortunately there are too many 'birds in distress' scenes, with the distress usually coming by way of humans, which take us out of the world of the birds and into the world of a 'message' movie.Spoiler: distress scenes like hunting, drowing in oil, caged for market, about to be run over by a combine.If these scenes were fewer and shown in matter-of-fact manner, maybe I'd have liked the film better. But the reaction shots of the birds were obviously picked for their emotive quality, and the music played during these scenes is overly leading, so that the effect tends toward smugness.I wished the filmakers would have stuck to showing the incredible alien beauty of birds and their behavior in a more straightforward manner.

The birds had learned to get use to the sight and sound of what looks like a bicycle with wings on which the videographer and a pilot rode along with them.

More than just a transcendent meditation on the mysterious rhythms of nature, Winged Migration is a sublime, argument for the Mind behind nature's design.

The footage alone is amazing, but what you learn about birds natural migration every year is even more amazing. What we enjoyed very much in the DVD is the section on the making of the DVD -- that was as good as the documentary itself. This documentary is a must see for the entire family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-dropping","review":"Now, I can't say I have listened to this movie with it's audio, ever. I've rented the movie on two occasions and turn on my own preferred music, usually progressive/new age/chanting to set the pace for the cinematography. The footage is outstanding, amazing at the least.Such a wide variety of birds shown flying the sky, at jaw-dropping camera angles. I'm disappointed at fellow reviews, but they seemed to be more interested in facts than imagery. This is not a movie for learned content, it is purely a film for wonderful footage of wonderful creatures flying the wonderous flies.I recommend the viewing, especially under an intoxicated state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Documentary","review":"I purchased this in DVD format several years ago and have watched it many times. I was delighted that it is now available on Blue Ray, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This documentary is a feast for the eyes as well as educational. Be prepared to be swept away by the cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible photography","review":"I gave this great piece of work 4 stars instead of 5, as I feltthe producer and director had an agenda of their own in making this film, rather than documenting the true migrational patterns of the birds. True migrations have been natures way of sending all species, indicators of seasonal change and harmony on this earth. The films photography was excellent, but much of it was staged for sensational effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. C","review":"We first saw this movie in a theater. We were captivated and soon afterward bought the DVD to share our discovery with others. As much as we love seeing the beautiful images of birds in flight, the feature about the making of the film is itself a wonderful story of innovation and perseverence. The makers of this film have left us with a precious glimpse of one of the joys of our natural world, the presence of migratory birds in our lives. While it is basically a beautiful documentary record this DVD has brought us hours of delight and fascination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Cinematography - BUT young children beware!","review":"An absolutely stunning spectacle. This documentary is a must see for anyone wishing to enjoy nature at it's finest. I do however caution parents that there is a harsh side to this film. I watched it with my 11 year old son who was VERY distraught over the hunting scene. (Threw the remote down and left the room in tears!)I was dismayed that this was not spelled out on the cover. With a G rating, it did not occur to me that there would be any area that I would have to be more watchful about. This scene can be tough for anyone who is unprepared, so be aware of that. I do, however, recommend this film. I had just wished that the film content had been spelled out more clearly, so as a parent, I was better prepared..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good screen saver","review":"If you just want to see a great video of birds in their own element, this is great. If you want to learn something about the migration of birds, get a BBC or other such documentary film. Very little narration, but great shots of birds flying and such. A joy to watch, but not much for listening to or learning anything new about birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compressed Copy","review":"This is a beautiful video but I was disappointed that Amazon sent me a repackaged, compressed copy of the original video. It was poor quality, pixillated, and even had reproduced DVD and Packaging labels. Amazon sent me a new copy immediately (great customer service) but the new copy was the same. Customer service admitted they have no control over - nor ability to verify product quality with - the shipper, and immediately refunded my money. Bravo to Amazon Customer Service. Boo to the supplier of this DVD.Update 11/1/12: Six years after writing this review I see that two people had commented - quick to criticize me for reviewing the vendor - not the movie. I understand that perspective, but this not a MOVIE review. It is a PRODUCT review. The PRODUCT was hardly worth one star, and the seller was Amazon. Please note that Amazon got kudos for their great customer service, but they apparently had no control over their supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winged Migration","review":"Are you kidding me? How can so many people give this such a high rating? The \\"uplifting\\" music constantly detracted from the sounds of nature. If you are going to have a narrator speak English, have him speak English. This French guy with marbles in his mouth was not an enhancement to the film.(If you think I'm biased against French people , I gave five stars to MicroCosmos).Even if they fixed the above problems it wouldn't take away from the fact that the whole damn thing was staged. Trained birds do not a nature documentary make. Just watch the \\"making of\\" featurette on the dvd and you will see how they set up all of their shots. They also constantly harrassed the birds. They would be kicked out of most Wildlife Refuges and National Parks for doing half of what they did.Excellent cinematography though."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"anyone who loves nature documentals, would love this dvd. it is just amazing, incredible beatiful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't my cup of tea","review":"I don't understand what the big deal is about this video. I'm a bird lover and with all of the hype, I was expecting a lot. Yes, the videography is interesting, but that's all this film has to it. I wouldn't consider it a documentary so much as an artsy film. In a documentary I would expect a lot more information about the birds and the hows/whys of migration, complemented by the video everyone is raving about. Instead, the film is focused on simply watching the birds fly (mostly geese) while providing little if any information about them. If this helps people otherwise not interested in birds learn something, then I think that's great. For birders interested in learning something more, I'd say it's a disappointment from a documentary perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning!","review":"Spectacular cinematographyIt's like nothing I have ever seen. I expected more of a documentary since I live on documentaries but it was pleasantly refreshing just to hear a few words narration and just watch all the different birds as if I was there myself, observing them in their habitat and flying right along with them. Unbelievable footage. Only giving 4 stars as I would have preferred it with just some musical background and no singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winged Migration","review":"OUTSTANDING----A MUST SEE-- I would consider this perhaps the most unique documentary I've seen.

Their harmony was great. The camera man could have used some training. It was more focused on one person at a time instead of the group.

Jesse Helms and former Ambassador to Romania in the early '80s--is in the mold of those Red-baiters of the early '50s. He denouces the State Department as communist sympathizers and throughout the book belies his extreme right-wing Christian fundamentalist ideology. He is certainly correct that the Ceausescu regime was horrid, but that was not due to the State Department. His solution, end detente with all communists, has been tried time and again with failure. Funderburk obviously harbors a deep insecurity about his less than stellar academic career and that he was ostracized by everyone in the foreign policy making apparatus from George Schultz on down. If any book deserves less than a star, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby doll's Victorian Pram","review":"I bought this for my grandneice.

I almost made it through the first 2 CDs, and then I was done when the author started droning on and on and ON about the relationship that God wants for parents and kids and other fluffy stuff- and I AM a practicing Christian. I almost wanted to ask him if he had sat down for a cup of coffee with God and heard right from God all about what He wants from us. It irks me when people act like they know exactly what God wants.This book was waaay too wordy, only gave a couple of actionable suggestions for parents. Maybe I picked the wrong book for what I was going for. In my case, waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but sort or odd","review":"This book had the feel that it was off beat from the privious 2 books. I liked parts of it especally Gabon's strides to keep his army together and his interaction with the mentally disabled man that killed 9 reavers with a pick ax. I think the charecter of Baron Walt will come up agian in the fourth installment.I find it difficult to review this book simply because so much happens in it mostly good stuff. I think the serise has reached the crossroads stage. Usually after the 3rd book a serise gets better and stays better or heads south faster than an object dropped from the Empire State Building(can you say Wheel of Time?).This book is great for what it is i'm just holding off full judgment one way or another untill the 4th book comes ot in November.if you haven't started this serise go ahead and do so, you will not be disappionted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reavers, not Ravers","review":"I've already reviewed this book here. I just needed to clarify something brought up in some of the other reviews. Farland's reavers are found nowhere in the Donaldson series. Donaldson wrote about ravers which were men who were so evil that they were basically raving lunatics, muttering and cursing to themselves all the time. Anyone who thinks that Farland stole his reavers from Donaldson's ravers obviously wasn't paying attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I am currently reading book 5 in the series and am happy that I found another series of books in the Fantasy realm.

The books keep getting a little better, although I have not quite gotten use to the usage of dedicates. It is a difficult concept to grasp as this is a kin to slavery and I can't see how the people would want to become dedicates.The writing is good and he has no problems killing characters. David Farland has two more books to go in this series and I will eagerly await the fourth installment.RECOMEMDATIONS: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I was disappointed in both this book and #2. I read the first book, then bought all 3 thinking this would be a good series to read. The author should have condensed all 3 into 1 book. It would have been much better. I was bored to tears by the middle of the second book and continued to plough through the second and almost all of this book before I finally gave up in frustration and tedium. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on any of them. I will be reluctant to buy any books by this author in the future. I wish someone had warned me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Jordan ripoff","review":"David Farland as a writer does not seem to have the breadth nad depth of imagination to write something unique. As a result the Runelords saga contains a lot of the same premises are every other high epic fantasy, with a good deal stolen from D&D and other authors' works. For all that some people rave the unique magic system, I was busy rolling up those characteristics for games when I was in seventh grade.THe worst part is the hackneyed writing. The dialog here comes from spending too many hours in front of bad period movies. The humor works occasionally, but Farland is a one trick pony; when he gets a cute joke he beats it to death, like the walmute thing.Skip this one. Buy something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"David Farland's writig is just plain juvenile. The Runelords books were recommended to me by my 12 year old nephew, a kid I usually find astute and intellectually discerning, but in this case, I guess he is just a kid. If you are looking for a D and D level tale of adventure, with a magic system obviously designed to be a computer or role playing game, read this. Otherwise, spare yourself.

Beautifully and artfully written. The writer is no saint but, after one reads this book, her pure heart in unquestioned. Her sainthood (if I may use the word) is in her humanity and divine inclination to do good. She is like you and I struggling to exist and make a difference in this tragic world. In spite of all the material conforts and easy life, she is the poorer of the poor. I highly recommend this book to anybody looking for a good read to inspire both the heart and the spirit.

It has a wondful, solid feel and it worked wonderfully when I used it to cook bacon. So why the two stars?You have to hand wash and season the press with oil each and every time you use it. I didn't and simply tossed it in the dishwasher, and came out with a rust spotted press. It cleaned up easily enough, but maintaining the press will be a pain in the rear.

Bacon adulterated in this way cooks up nasty. The only way I've been able to get it to come out even remotely edible is actually to let it swim in the grease until it's finally done, cooking veeeeeery slowly on low to med low heat. It's still not as good as it ought to be, but I doubt this press would have helped solve the problem of grody bacon even if it HAD fit in my 10\\" skillet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Well made. Useful size and weight, although it could be just a little larger in diameter. This thing gets really hot and holds that heat for awhile, as you would expect with cast iron.

(My source is the commentary on the Millennium Edition DVD of GRAVE.) Unfortunately, there's no way to tell how much of the music was composed by Mr. Tabor. Also unfortunately -- but not surprisingly -- there was no attempt to enhance the soundtrack for the DVD release, and there's significant wow in the music throughout.As far as the movie itself goes, it's an attempt to graft serious drama onto silly sex comedy, and in my opinion, the graft didn't take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"That's the best way to explain this movie.

Vividly imagined and pleasantly goth, in the beauty it creates from the worst horrors imaginable.The plot itself is more or less straightforward- it's a travelogue, well sort of. It's the ideas and characters that make this a 5-star. Our hero puts a gun into his mouth and pulls the trigger, but unfortunately, he guessed wrong. He wakes up in hell, and his head promptly repairs itself. He travels, he meets people, he saves a hot demon chick, becomes the catalyst for a demon rebellion... you know, same old.As always, fascinating, thought provoking, and great fun.

Don't even wanna waste to much time explaining, but I was turned off when ANGELS with .357s and riding harley's came into the picture.Like I said, what happened?

The main problem I had with \\"Storm Passage\\" was the fact that the writer, \\"Webb\\", comes off as a self-absorbed, pompous windbag. He wines about EVERYTHING. And alternates in personality between \\"victim\\", \\"worldly and cultured \\"gentleman\\" and \\"narcissistic bore bursting with boneheaded pride\\". He will also inexplicably throw in descriptions about himself out of nowhere. -At one point mentioning his \\"full lips\\" and his \\"cleft chin\\" (which he says is his best feature). Really? Hmm. So, any interest in the story of the voyage (s) is literally sucked dry by the fact that you have to hang out with this egotistical and largely miserable person. It's too bad really, because his voyage and his achievements are extraordinary. Who knows, maybe in the years since this account he grew up a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok. For a daily log but....not an interesting read.","review":"I have read tons of sailing books and I found this author spent far too much time complaining about having to bail his constantly leaking boat when he passes dozens, if not hundreds, of ports along the way that he could have stopped at to get it fixed. If you chose not to fix something then stop complaining about it page after page. Since he seemed bent on not stopping, the book lacked interesting stories of people and places he visited along the way and we were stuck listening to a guy give a daily log of the weather, his thoughts and complaints of how hard his trip was and how poorly built his boat was. It was just interesting enough for me to finish reading it, but I was glad when it was finally over. Others seemed to give it good reviews but it just wasn't my type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor's Story","review":"Unless you are a sailor, with your own sailboat, alot of the technical descriptions of what was happening as the author sailed around the world was lost in understanding what actually was happening. Natical terminology was hard to understand, and whenever the author used terms to discribe the various sails and steerage of the boat, it was difficult to fully understand what was going on. The actual events which occurred during his voyage, other than the technical descriptions were interesting, but the story ended rather abruptly before he returned to his home port. Perhaps he didn't feel the need to bring that closeure to his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible copy of TM&TP","review":"This is terrible music. It actually rates ZERO. Purely done to make money by riding on the coattails of TM&TP success. Little rehearsal and really bad singing make this excruciatingly bad. The mix is equally bad.

The story weaves in and out, telling a great story that envelopes the reader. Fast paced, action packed, with a little love story that even guys could like. Tracing scientific anomolies to logical conclusions, one gets a sense of the possibilities that Becker conveys. While somewhat simplistic at times, the simplicity does not detract from the book; but rather it speeds the read along to conclusion. In the interweaving vein of theories like \\"Da Vinci Code\\", \\"Link\\" ties together interesting aspects of buried science to spin a tale of fun and thrills that's hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, bad science","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, thinking I would be along for a well written scientific adventure sweetened with interesting theories. I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Beck's writing style is hackneyed and predictable. He ends every scene with a mini-cliffhanger, lacking the art of following any action for more than a page or two. The characters are paper cutout there solely as pawns in the story. The story itself is painfully predictable, and offers nothing that hasn't been said dozens of times before. His characters jump from one disaster to another, none of which is surprising, and the reader is never in suspense as to whether the main characters live or not, because they always do. The plot is dull and events are not well set up or explained. To make this worse, the science is terrible. Mr. Beck is not a scientist, yet he fills the mouths of scientist in his book with his ridiculous theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat premise that drags on far too long. . .","review":"Walt Becker's book, \\"Link\\" started off with a bang, sustained that bang halfway through the book and then believe it or not---imploded. Excuse the explosion metaphors but that's all that this book really inspires in me. The character's Samantha, Jack and Ricardo were interesting for a while, as was Dorn--the bad guy, but just about the time they all left Africa and headed for Bolivia, my mind started wandering and I kept looking not only at my watch, but at the end of the book trying to calculate how many pages I had left to read. Not a good sign. If Becker had kept the story simpler and not thrown in the DEA and Bolivian drug lords--it could have been a really compelling story, instead it just became tedious, and then at the end---rushed and convoluted. If Becker decides to write a sequel to this book--and gee I wouldn't be surprised if he does--let's hope he remembers that simple is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down - I'd like my money back","review":"Link is a really annoying book. I enjoyed it on the level of an action adventure even though it was predictable and does read like it was written as a movie script. The annoying stuff which is where the book falls down completely is the 'science'. I thought it would be an educated, well researched and therefore credible book that hung together and answered more questions than it left open. But it's actually a thinly disguised old earth creationists account of why we didn't 'evolve' from apes.Infuriating and for annoying me it gets 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erroneous and boring","review":"It took me two weeks to force my way through this book. I'd like to say that it just wasn't my cup of tea, but it goes beyond taste. This is just a bad book. Apparently, there was no time to waste with editors - certainly not technical editors. I'd like to know the author's credentials which lead him to believe he can refute countless learned and brilliant minds. Beyond that the characters were shallow and boring. The lead, Jack Austin, was especially hard to take - Mr. \\"I'm so victimized and misunderstood because I'm so superior to everyone else.\\" Add to that some sappy dribble and you have a should-miss read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book because she wanted my opinion on the science. What science? This author has no respect for the actual science he purports to have researched (for a whole 18 months, no less!).The paleoanthropological search of humanity's origins is actually such as fascinating story, but you won't find it here. With fiction allegedly based on science there's no excuse for the basic science to be dead wrong--especially with this author's afterword. Carbon dating volcanic flows? Civilizations springing up from nothing? I recommend Becker take a few basic archaeology and/or anthropology classes--or read some of the basic literature--before he tries again with this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Idea, but not well focused","review":"I really liked the premise of this book; a team of scientists digging in desert discover an Alien relic. Where did this relic come from? and what was its function? What does this say about ancient history and our world as we know it?The answer to these questions, which weaves fact with fiction is the most fascinating aspect of the story, and makes for a good, intelligent read.Unfortunately, the bulk of the plot is focused on a ridiculous plot involving drug lords, the DEA and many boring sequences in which the bad guys are in hot pursuit of the good guys. I had to skim the last few pages of the book because I was so bored at the end. Not my idea of a good time.In the final analysis, I wish the author focused more on his philosophy, ideas, and imagination regarding the alien relic, rather than try to build an action novel which didnt work."},{"rating":"1","title":"He forgot about his story","review":"This book started out with such promise. It was one of those we came from outer space a zillion years ago plots, but then the author got lost in his theory about how he related every wierd thing in the world into one universal answer and the last 50 pages were rough going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial characters and unsuspenseful plot","review":"I know a book is not capturing my interest when I have to force myself to read it and have a hard time getting caught up in what I'm reading. This is like a book written from the script of a bad TV movie. The most appealing aspect about science fiction (and I am a big fan of the genre) is discovering something or someone in the story is not what they seem, and subsequently having to figure out what is really going on after all. In this book, however, the hapless author telegraphs exactly what the significance of the artifacts that the characters find so far ahead that you become irritated with how slowly the story unfolds. Mr. Becker may have done research to back his plot, but his writing ability just doesn't do justice to the material. Too bad, this would have been a good story in the hands of a talented writer. Not worth reading, unless you enjoy being bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning... but then it just got ridiculous","review":"I picked up this book because the writing was touted as a \\"Crichton -like.\\" I'm a huge fan of Michael Crichton and Mr. Becker is no Micheal Crichton.The story started out great,a real page turner. But then once the crew entered the South American ruins the pace slammed to a halt. I forced myself to finish the book and the further I got in the book the more ridiculous the story became.Unlike some reviewers, I was not offended by the creationist slant.

I am always willing to give an author the benefit of the doubt, but this book is so bad I would dissuade anyone from even thinking of reading it.I always get suspicious when an author is decribed as a \\"director and screenwriter for film and television\\" but no details are provided for projects he wrote or directed. In this case, perhaps it's because Becker's screenwriting is as wretched as his novel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.","review":"Although Becker put forth an interesting premise, he was not able to develop it convincingly. Too many moments in this book made me cringe. I felt like I was reading a screen play for a cheesy action/romance movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding","review":"It starts out with an interesting premise - aliens as the creators of modern man, then deteriorates rapidly into cartoonish posturing and bad pseudo-scientific claptrap. Sorry, the author sounds like a nice guy from his afterword, but the plot reads like a Hollywood B movie from the 50's. I think The Lost World or Journey to the Center of the Earth did the convenient destruction of all evidence better. Throw in semi-reformed arms dealer turned biotech company owner, female drug lord with incest survivor psychological issues and a underground lab with mummies and a working cold fusion device and you have as incoherent a plot as I have ever seen. Truly, the book is pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DEBUT NOVEL","review":"I can't wait to get this author's next book. A friend passed LINK on to me and I read the entire novel in only two days. The ending left me dying for the sequel. Though this is definitely commercial fiction (And I can see (hope to see) a movie resulting from this effort) it is also thought-provoking fiction. I will pass this one on to other friends with glowing reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and thought provoking!","review":"To say this is the first novel by this author, all I can say is, I'll be looking for other books by him. This is an excellent book. It grabbed my attention early on and held it until the end. I loved the way the author blended facts and fiction to arrive at a possible answer to the \\"missing link\\" question. The fact that his answer is plausible really has me thinking. And the best part is that while you read and learn, you're also very much entertained by the story. The book has it all, action, suspense, romance, and danger. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, error filled, creationism soapbox.","review":"This story is barely more than a vehicle for peddling creationism. The beginning is promising and you may forgive the odd technical error. But as you get deeper into the story you find the errors mounting and you realize the author is not remotely technically inclined. Readers who like hard science fiction will not like this book. Think of it as a bad James Bond movie but without as complex a plot, not as technically accurate, and not as well written. If the author had left out the dogma and had the story reviewed at least once for errors it could have risen to mediocre. Only those who are deaf to the fingernails-on-a-chalkboard errors or want confirmation of their beliefs will like this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUICK READ-- GREAT BOOK","review":"I thought LINK was an incredibly delicious read. It was fast, easy, and imaginative. I was really turned on by the world it presented and some of the hotly debated issues it presents.

It's got interesting characters, a fascinating premise, and a pace that truly doesn't let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful book!","review":"I thought LINK was one of the best action adventure novels I have read in quite some time. I was hooked from page one, and unlike one of the reviewers I was riveted until the very last page. I also don't have a problem with the science portions of the novel. I found them interesting found for thought-- but read the novel as a work of fiction. It seems that some people have forgotten it was just that. If I had wanted to look up anything the book deals with in depth, I would have chosen the NON-fiction section of the book store. Seems that some of these \\"science fiction\\" fans forget that. Besides, most time travel novels I've read are absolutely ludricous in their assumptions about the possibilities of time travel-- I just read them because they tell good stories. For any readers out there that are into reading adventure novels, just for the thrills and the characters and setting, check this novel out for sure. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creationist polemic by less than mediocre Crichton wanabe.","review":"What a spectacular pile of rubbish. Entertaining premise looked good for a last-minute in-flight read. Big mistake. At it's best moments, it rises to the level of a weak screenplay for a formulaic adventure TV series c1987. At worst, it's a bad high-school debate performance championing creationism. I struggled to finish it (sadly, I'm a finisher), but the author saved is most puerile, pseudo-science whatifery for the final 1/4 of the book and I just couldn't go on.

But the worst thing is the pretense of scientific truth. To have presumable scientists swallow their fellow characters' pronouncements as if hearing awesome discoveries, fully proved, is ludicrous. Like everyone else wanting to believe this nonsense about alien visitors in prehistoric times, Becker is selective in the facts he presents and the links between them, ignoring all the facts that don't support his premise. He might as well have thrown in a little spontaneous human combustion on the side. (And for all I know, he did.

Also in this section, 'kiloton' should be replaced with 'megaton' everywhere it occurs. The Second Law of Thermodynamics does not apply in the circumstances our protagonist mentions.

Phi!\\" and then explains that Phi is an irrational number, a ratio of about 1.61 to one. If this weren't lame enough, he also goes on about how no ancient people could have figured out this number without help. The Golden Mean can, in fact, be trivially derived with a compass and straightedge.

I could not finish reading the last half of the book, something that has not happened to me in many, many years. I thought the book was so bad that I went to the publisher's web page, only to find it was not up. Was the book actually edited? I am willing to wager 100 times the list price of this book, that it was written with Motion Picture Rights, not Pulitzer prize clearly in mind.Stanley R Goldfarb"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, dismal style","review":"I must admit that I feel envious when an exotic, fascinating premise is treated in such a pedestrian style. Wish I had thought of it first!Since Becker's only stated credentials are as a screenwriter, perhaps that's to be expected.Alien influence on the development of homo sapiens is a fun topic, as Erich Von Daniken showed a few years back, particularly when its sprinkled with a variety of supposedly scientific ideas, but the tedious romance (not worthy of Harlequin), the silly G-men, and the gratuitous gunplay really drag this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an imagination","review":"I thought this was first rate, very well written and considering the scope of the imagination that went into it well worth the read.

It is fast-paced, suspenseful and provides the reader with an education in popular science and mythology to boot. Like Crichton, Becker's writing style is clipped and fluid, which makes this book so easy to read in the course of a day or two. Although this novel's premise is controversial in its slaying of the sacred cow known as the theory of evolution, one cannot deny that it provides much food for thought by raising interesting and unanswered questions about humanity's past. All it takes is an open mind.

It's unfortunate that no-one took the time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche-ridden disappointment","review":"I wanted to like this adventure story blending paleoanthropology and UFOlogy, but the characters are two-dimensional at best and the plot is also stock fare. The frequent asides, in which the author presents less-than-compelling attacks on Darwinism and advances various speculative theories about human origins, might have been more interesting if they were not presented in the context of such a bland story. Likely to be a hit with people who loved the Celestine Prophecy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Link Throws Out Evolution With Bathwater","review":"Sure, \\"Link\\" is a lot of fun -- it would make a great Hollywood summer action flick. But intelligent readers will notice a lot of links missing. The characters end up dismissing all of evolution just because of one case of extra-terrestrial intervention with one species. They don't even pose the question that begs to be asked: even if extra-terrestrials did give humans a civilizing push, where did the ET's come from? The mysteries examined merit more creative conjectures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science and shallow characters","review":"Walt Becker started with an interesting idea (aliens produced Homo Sapiens from Neanderthals 40,000 years ago) and some interesting characters (three paleoanthropologists and an arms dealer) and proceeded to push both of them too far. The premise becomes unbelievable (bipedal aliens that looked very much like humans who were able to breed with Neanderthals given a little help) and the characters never get beyond two-dimensional. It seemed like Mr. Becker had simply bit off more than he could chew, trying to explain dozens of unexplained mysteries while putting his characters through as many adventures as possible. It became very difficult to suspend disbelief (both at the underlying premise and the choices of the characters), a probablem that was compounded by the book's factual errors and inconsistencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"hope you don't know much about science","review":"Do not read this book if you have studied physics, biology, philosophy, or anthropology.

The magenta cast is awful and don't try to correct it by modifiying your in camera's color temperature: it will affect the non-filtered area. If one filter isn't enough, try the old and true Photoshop trick: with the camera in a tripod (ideally), take two -or more RAW shots, one for the highlights and one for the shadows (if I have no tripod handy, I use the bracketing and high speed in my camera to take a couple of pictures, trying not to move); then mix them in Photoshop and.... voila!!!! No need to bother with rings, attachments and delicate and easily scratched plastic filters.Added Feb. 3/09The previous review was done with the filters on Canon's 40D and 50D. I have now a Nikon D700 and the magenta cast isn't any more visible.

What has taken me years to sift through and distill, he beautifully shapes in this highly inspiring, as well as practical, guide to the development of the gay/lesbian/human spirit.As a psychologist, I have often found that because of the great harm that some organized religions have heaped upon sexual minorities, many in our community have closed themselves off to the very essential and very human spiritual sides of themselves. In essence, by associating spirituality only with religion, they metaphorically \\"throw the baby out with the bathwater\\". Mr. de la Huerta's book offers the promise of not only reviving lost spirituality for those abused by religion, but he also offers clear direction for those of us who avidly pursue healthy spiritual growth. Bravo Mr. de la Huerta!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible book","review":"This book is a must read for all GLBT people seeking a spiritual life. It is very empowering. Christian describes the many roles GLBT people have played throughout history. The way he explains the difference between spirituality and religion in a way that will help anyone get over their ideas that being spiritual means selling out to the Christian Right. Please read this book.

This video is a good introduction to someone who is not familiar with Campbell but it is not his best. If you have seen Campbell's other works, there is very little new here.My biggest complaint is that the sound track is sometimes distracting and annoying. At several points in the video the audio of Campbell speaking is very quiet. As you try to listen to what he is saying the sound track comes blasting in with Buddhist chanting or other music that washes out Campbell's voice.The Mythos series is far, far better than this video.

Earth X fit the bill nicely. However, the series title is somewhat misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternate future-history to Marvel Universe","review":"Earth X is a dark and intriguing look at the future of the Marvel Universe. Those who are familiar with the comics will see many of the characters they are familiar with in a completely different light. Here we find out what happens to the likes of Spider-Man, the X-Men and Captain America in a world where everyone suddenly develops super-powers. The story deals with issues like 'what makes someone special' while entertaining the reader with a conspiracy laden story that is bound to keep you reading until the work is finished. The art is very old-school, and was a nice shout out to the original artists of some of these characters. This was an excellent work, a definate milestone in comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing and a fresh take on Marvel","review":"Two Great Reasons to buy this book:1) the writing level is so good that you can get folks not into comics to appreciate it.2) On the other hand, seasoned comic books readers will love it. What these guys are doing is very fresh and helps you understand what Kirby and Lee were doing back in the 60s/70s when they were creating these characters. Especially Kirby and his \\"cosmic\\" sense of comics and the world.More good reasons to buy this book:1) the art is consistently good and fun.2) the covers are incredible3) bound together, these 12+ issues are a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Don't let the negative reviews fool you! The people who wrote them obviously have no taste! This is a fantastic story about the possible fate of the beloved heroes of the Marvel universe, although admittedly, if you aren't familiar with the characters you probably won't enjoy this work as much, perhaps not even at all. But if you are this is an absolute must read.The one thing that I feel is a weak point here is the art. Leon's art can be described in one word: [horrible]. I realize Ross and Krueger were going for dark and depressing and that Ross could not paint a 14 issue Series, but jeeze Leon's art is hard to muddle through, (which is why the book lost a star.) It's worth the muddle though, because underneath his mess lay a fantastic story about the mythic world of the Marvel Universe. Buy it Now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the Cover toss the rest","review":"When this series started on the shelves Alex Ross's covers called out to me. I laid down my money without peeking inside confident that I could safely judge this book by its cover. Who could have guessed what meaningless drivel was lurking inside. I bought the first four books at one time. I fought my way through the first one and then gave up. As near as I can tell Marvel attempted to remake Kingdom Come sans Mark Waid with a call in performance from Alex Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting characters. Plot takes forever to get nowhere.","review":"Maybe Frank Miller and many others raised the bar too much, but when I pick up a graphic novel now, I expect it to hold my interest just as firmly as any other well-written work of fiction. I'm a sucker for the whole heroes-in-their-golden-years concept, and I like the way the older characters are characterized and visualized. Unfortunately, it's in service of an uninvolving plot. The psuedo-profound dialogue is pretty awful, and the new Red Skull is almost as annoying as young Anakin in the Phantom Menace (I didn't think it was possible either). Moreover, an epic can hardly be satisfying if the payoff is a cosmic joke. This may work in a satire, like Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, but not in an epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wok, Wish it had a lid","review":"This wok works great.

The world if beautifully painted and the large number of central characters are alternated between wonderfully.The two alien races inhabiting prehostoric France are well developed with a thoughtful background and unique and entertaining characteristics.

Anyway, this is the worst used copy of a book I have yet received and I order quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to the series","review":"Julian May did a great job in creating a world of characters you can believe in, and it's possible to root for some of them, dislike some, and understand the conflicts of the others.

I really enjoyed all full series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to this party","review":"I'm nearly 30 years late to this party, but I'll add my 2 anyway. I'm tempted to compare this first volume to the first volume of the Riverworld Series, or perhaps to the first volume of Michael McCullom's Antares trilogy. But I won't. This novel stands on its own as an entirely separate attempt at a sweeping saga. And I think it deserves kudos for pulling it off. I also recommend that everyone who attempts to read this first volume to plow thru the first 100 or so pages to get to the payoff. Yes, the first 100 pages is sort of boring as others have mentioned, but it sets up all the characters for the action that's to follow. I'm about 25 pages into volume 2 and it's getting even more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love books, hate scan...","review":"Awesome series!!! Loved it in hardbound & paper back!!!

There is also video conferencing software, which is not worth using as it requires the same software at both ends of the call - surely its simpler to use MS Netmeeting, which anyone with a webcam already has installed.And there are some webcam games which I havent tried.My only negative is that the cam is not as manoeverable as the \\"ball\\" type that swivel around to all anglesFor the money, this is the best cam currently on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the newer PRO VIDEO model instead!","review":"I've only used the camera for a day or two.

Since there are many other excellent textbooks in the field of linear system, I exactly do not recommend this one. In my opinion, Brogan's Modern Control Theory is much better than it.

Most of the book was focusing on either the trip that the production staff took to China (which went on for way too long), or was exerpts taken describing each character - which if you've seen the movie you don't need to hear.

I was a little upset at first that I was unable to use the D-pad, but the analog controls are precise and easy to manage. Missions vary from one to the next, but most entail capturing contraband and avoiding cops and others while you take it (smuggle) to another area. The timed missions keep you on your toes! As you complete missions you unlock better vehicles and different maneuvers for your vehicles. Further along, you unlock different areas, though I'm currently still in Russia. Gameplay is excellent (especially with two players!). The graphics are good on a scale of bad to great. The maps are huge and the terrain is varied. This game reminds me of Red Faction only for the fact that you can have as much fun playing with friends as by yourself. Don't rent it, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xelent game!","review":"This game is really good. The graphics have been improved from the last SMUGGLER'S RUN game. What is bad is that the graphics are decreased in some levels in the game (unlock them yourselves!!!!;)) The cops are still kind of hard to beat but they can be beaten which is good (last game it took more than 1 go each time you played a level to beat it).Buy this game i highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh..Thought this game would be much better","review":"I was really disapointed with this game. The graphics are nice. Not great by any means. The objectives are too basic & simple. I thought you had to pick up certain drugs & deliver then to a certain spot. Taking long journeys avoiding rivals & cops. This was not the case. Basically, you run back & forth. The fun level is minimal. Common rockstar. You can do much better then this.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre game...","review":"This game has better graphics and handling than the original, but the sequel to the original has raised the annoyance level bar several levels. First, the cops are way too good for this game, even better than the first. This makes the game way too difficult. Next, the unlocking of all the cars and their countermeasures should have been done early in the game, because the cops have way better cars than the player has. Furthermore, what is with the additional cop cars that get resurrected? Lastly, you should have the ability to request a team accompany you, rather than alone. True, some of the missions you do receive a team, but not often. I mean, they should permit the player to choose if he or she wants a team or not to accompany them on the mission. The developers could reduce the point levels and such, if you request a team, but at least have the option out there.Overall, rent this game before you buy. This is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENT BEFORE BUYING!!!","review":"i gave this game 2 stars because it asked \\"how fun\\". the game looks awesome and the cars drive awesome, but that is about it. there is a fine line between a game that is difficult and just plain stupid. difficulty is a good thing, you never want to beat it in a day, and the game needs to be challenging.. but wanting to personally find the \\"testers\\" of this game and give them a good thrashing - that's not good at all. the controlls are very strange to get used to - if you are used to using r1 for your e-brake on driving games. the police are just plain annoying. and they could have make the sound affects a little less grating and aggrevating.. but that's my opinion.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!","review":"This game is great! Although the levels are really hard at times its really fun.It is a real challenge at times too.The cars you can use are really cool. My personal favorite is the halftrack(a truck with tracks in the back and wheels in the front).There are a few modes of play,missions,checkpoint race,joyride,and turf wars.Turf wars are kind of like capture the flag.Overall this is a great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY WEFE CAN SPINCAST NOW!","review":"Finally, with this rig my wife can spin fish.

Some however have been disappointing and Digweed's HK was one of those for me. Even upon going back and seeing if maybe my taste had changed, it didn't do it for me. However I could see what he was trying to do. He was serving up two hours of even beats, with a side dish of spacyness to it all, but it never sat right. On LA19 he gets is ALL right. It is another journey, but not one filled with peak and valley inducing athems, big drum cresendo's or \\"signature songs\\" (a la Paul Oakenfold's \\"bullet in the gun\\"). It is a subtle challenging record, as strong as \\"communicate\\", with a even further out there vibe. Digweed has changed with the times, staying one step ahead with a disc that proves he still has something left to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diggers-City of Angels","review":"This is the best mix I've heard in a long time. This is one of those compilations which, rather than having a few standout tracks, is a journey which can only truly be enjoyed by listening to both c.d.'s the whole way through. The first c.d. is the warm up, starting with Pole Folder & C.P.'s \\"Apollo Vibes\\", and builds to the relentless yet soothing progressive trance which Digweed is renowned for. He ends with Brothers Love Dubs' \\"1800 Ming\\", which brings you back down from the inflight movie. The second disc begins in much the same manner, but ends much harder and just leaves you gasping for more. Five stars are awarded for good reason. Once again, we are given what we have come to expect: The unexpected.Full marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ups and Downs","review":"I am a fan of John and to tell you the truth, I was rather dissapointed when I got the album. There was no progression on this set when I first listened to it......hence, no ups and downs on this record. But after a couple of days, I realised John was keeping us afloat, took us off the ground in the beginning of the two CDs and never really let us come down......wherever we may be floating. Hence, John is truly a DJ that dares to gamble with his reputation and this album is for required taste only. But if you realised where John is taking you......go ahead and buy this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but nothing new","review":"Anyone following the GU series knows that Digweed is great at creating trance-inducing mixes. This set is no different. We get the usual Digweed treatment: perfectly mixed minimal, deep house/trance. The tracks, while not immediately appealing for the most part, do grow on you. In other words, if you liked Digger's previus releases, you will certainly love this too. The problem here is the lack of originality. Global Underground has released plenty of CDs with a similar sound already. Plus, this kind of deep house is not as interesting as trance, and it is time for GU to either go back to trance which, in my opinion, was abandoned way too fast, or find a completely new sound. Also, as far as track selection, this CD is fine BUT I can't help but think that there is even better electronic music out there. Is this the best he can do? I think we all should expect a little more form GU from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"it really ... when you forget that even the best DJs can make really bad albums. I figured that I would be safe with Diggers no matter what. Not quite. This album is filled with a bunch of repetitive garbage, and is quite difficult to listen to for long periods of time. The man is awesome live, and Sydney and the first Bedrock were pretty good along with Expeditions; but the rest of his stuff is painfully boring. And what were him and Alex thinking with Communicate, or whatever it was called?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar","review":"I anticipated this album's release for weeks. There had been so much hype for it at clubs around New York--posters plastered onto walls, and of course, Global Underground's own publicity machine. Based on Digweed's other albums, I thought this set would be just as blistering as his other ones. The times I've seen him live have blown me away. But after this album I am only left with a bitter taste in my mouth.The album has its moments, with certain stretches of songs really capitvating your attention. More often than not, however, the album never seems to get going. It speeds up but inevitably sputters along. THe liner notes for this album put it in the same league as as Tenglia's London CD. Tenaglias's GU albums especially blow this one away. But as far as Digweed goes, I'm disappointed and cannot dig this album as much as some other listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"mxing? NO way","review":"Hi all you out there who think that Digweed actually stands behind a couple of Technics, mixing 12 inches when he records his cd's. Well, he doesn't. He records them into a computer program, adjusts the pitch of the files and sequences them into a perfect mix. Not only Digweed, but all the topjocks who make mix cd's do it this way (and heck why not?). It's really easy and you don't even have to be a dj tot make it sound beatmatched and perfect leveled.

I could relate to many of the author's anecdotes. The book is known in Tuvalu and the I Kiribati my wife and I met in Tuvalu told us they are not happy with the book. The book is entertaining and it does accurately present life on a small coral atoll in the Pacific. Sacha Baron Cohen will never be able to set foot in Kazakhstan or return to Romania. Mr. Troost will probably not be able to return to Tarawa which is not big deal because I hear Air Nauru and Air Kiribati flights are tough to book these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot to think about.. enjoyable","review":"Books is an eyeopener.If you thought like on tropical island would be paradise, read this book.Story stays with you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of all times..laugh out loud","review":"This has nothing to do with sex but everything to do with funny!

This a very well written, humorous, and honest portrayal of a young couples move to Tarawa (Sylvia takes a government job, Maarten joins her to \\"write\\"). Troost makes you feel as if you are actually there going through the daily trials and tribulations of their minimalist, island life. From bathroom relief in the ocean, to replay of la macarena, learning about non-pet vs. pet dogs, and island food this book kept me thoroughly entertained. It's impressive that these 2 survived 2 years and even more so that they endeared themselves to the natives and the natives and island to them! Though it may have ended appropriately, I felt the end was a bit rushed-- I would have liked more of a look at their return and subsequent move (attempting to avoid a spoiler alert with any more details).

I kept flipping through the pages eagerly anticipating getting to the good part(s). In a matter of about 5 hours I completed the book, and never really felt fulfilled. It did have it's entertaining parts, but on the whole, it wasn't really worth the price. If you pick this book up used or get it in a bargain bin for a couple of dollars then it would be worth picking up, but otherwise take a pass on this book. I'm really glad I decided to wait to purchase the other books by this author until I completed this one, if this book is any indication of the quality of the other books I'm sure I saved some money. The ending of this book was abrupt and just made me feel like the author was in a hurry to get this thing published so he could make some money and address the student debt he discusses in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest quickly","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book based upon my previous and upcoming trips to Australia.

I think appreciation for this offering is reserved for a narrow audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sex lives of cannibals","review":"There's something really aggravating to me about Americans who write as though they are very properly British. First, even English writers don't write that way, and second, it leaves me with the impression that the writer feels his work is very precious. Also, the title seems like a rip off of Malinowski's ethnography; The sexual life of savages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant title....Loquacious...Rather Anti-American","review":"Troost is clearly educated and intelligent, even mildly amusing at times. But this book is hardly worth any hype. The title is meaningless and unexplained. His text is far too long-winded.

In the end, the hypocrisy was a bit much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there,, didn't see that","review":"I thought I would be able to enjoy this book since I have been living on a small atoll in the South Pacific. I have visited some of the islands he mentions and I found most of his stories over the top and a few of his stories I would bet are completely fabricated. The title of the book has nothing to do with what the book is about. Troost's writing style is very negative. He comes across as very anti-American. After bashing America several times He ends up moving there after his supposed 2 years experience.

Right when you start to think that the story is getting interesting the author slides back into a pit of self-absorption.

I love travel books and the ability to get to hear about other places that I've never been, or that are far away & exotic. This is about as far away as you can get, although it's not really exotic. Although this is a travel book, the only travel is getting to the island they are moving to. From that point, (at least as far as I've read), it's the details of the interesting situation they are put into. Much of the humor is concerning the lack of modern facilities (clean water, electricity), as well as a lot of potty (literally) humor.

Sometimes you have to pay close attention because Troost will veer off the main subject but his antidotes are well worth the path that he is taking you down.When Troost and his girlfriend Sylvia find themselves with an education but no real job skills they apply for and are offered a government type of job on the Pacific atoll of Tarawa. This coral reef that is basically in the middle of no where is only the beginning of their troubles. Exactly how does one pack for a trip to an equatorial sandbar? Needless to say they were quite ill prepared for their lodgings, food and what the locals use as toilet facilities. Ok, that part was really funny.As Troost sets out to write the great American novel real life and death takes over and the reader is scurrying to find out what Troost and Sylvia will get themselves into next.

Not only is it hysterically funny, but it is brutally honest about life on an island. A wonderful guidebook for anyone considering traveling to the south pacific, it is a veritible list of what not to bring with you as well as what to bring (or what things you'll miss).This book is inhabited by wonderful characters doing absurd things. It emphasizes the reality of paradise in a way that only someone who lived there could do.Read it, then pack your bags! Maybe paradise is a bit more jaded than you might have realized and it might not be what you thought it was, but Troost makes a case for visiting, regardless of what expectations a traveler might be packing in their bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"kiribati teboboto","review":"I have the privilege of working with communities from Kiribati (and 13 other Pacific Island countries) that are trying to find ways to improve the management of their waste, freshwater and coastal fisheries. Mr Troosts' book is a great read. Whenever I thought he was getting a little too cute or judgemental he always managed to come up with something that made me laugh out loud. I've only ever been to Kiribati once and, like one of the glazed consultants that he mentions in his book, I was only there long enough to sense that chaos and kindness seem to share a certain, surreal, sort of balance. However, people will be pleased to hear, that some I-Kiribati are starting to inspire others to transform their rubbish into compost and, eventually, into vegetables for their kids.

For the first several chapters, I was reading hilarious anecdotes to my husband and comparing our Pacific island to Tarawa. However, by the halfway point the humor had run dry and the few anecdotes either read as repeats or severely mixed up in time. I expected amusement at the author's switch from novel to humorous-travel writer, but instead felt like he wrote this book in a desperate attempt for cash.

Much better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book if you're an optimist","review":"If you're an optimist, you'll quickly be turned off by the continual negativity and complaining about how miserable this island is, the endless self-deprecating humor about how lazy he considers himself, a procrastinator not accomplishing much of anything, while his wife works.After seeing so many positive reviews, I didn't realize it was going to be such a pessimistic book, but quickly realized that as soon as I started reading. I felt it may eventually turn positive but gave up half-way through when I realized it wasn't going to change.In short, if you're conscious of what you feed your mind and love a fun upbeat adventure, skip this book. If you love supermarket tabloids or modern television shows with their drama, negativity, and sarcasm, then you'll probably like this book.On the positive side, I did like the title, the beautiful cover art, and their courage to escape the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but there's better","review":"Light fun read about a tropical hell hole plagued by faeces and NGO's. Just the book to read on a boring flight or in the airport lounge while you're travelling to another boring business meeting.

It started off slowly, but picked up quickly. Troost's personal approach to the native island lifestyle and environment are both informative and engaging. I also enjoyed the humor he wove into every one of his experiences, from serious to silly. I felt it gave a decently balanced viewpoint on the struggles surrounding island life.My only wish is that he would of been a little more scenically detailed and included more historical material. Yet, as he says, most of their history is oral so, I suppose one could only glean so much...All in all, it was a great read. Being a fan of Bill Bryson's work, Troost has become a new favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I didn't really care for this book mostly because I didn't care for the self-absorbed author. True, there were some funny lines here and there. But, overall, he went on too long in many places and didn't spend time on other things that would have made it much more interesting to me. For instance, why didn't we learn more about his relationship with Sylvia during this difficult adventure? His lack of ambition and other quirks must not have bothered her since she married him and they had a child. Also, there must have been more islanders he could have shared some poignant moments with us about instead of dwelling on all the excrement. Apparently he preferred bathroom humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining view of the other side of paradise","review":"This book is quite entertaining, and gives the reader a peek into the reality of the islands that used to be paradise. Western culture and civilization has rendered many of the tropical islands almost uninhabitable, and the author paints this picture clearly. I'm sure some liberties were taken in describing some circumstances. Even so, there is enough substance here to make you think of the situations described after a few chuckles wear off. My only complaint on the book is that the author seems to want to fit in complex language into the beginning of the book, but this subsides as the reader progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"More enjoyable travel books are easy to find....","review":"I received this book as a gift as I am avid reader of travel stories. Unfortunately I could only get about halfway through.The author clearly is a literary talent but I could not overcome the contrived narrative. I prefer a story where adventure is found and a book results. This one seemed to be from an author who from the onset desired to write a book and had to reach afar for adventure. For example, he constantly is complaining about the local food/customs/landscape, what did you expect to find after voluntarily going to Kiribati? I was unable to give the second half of the book a chance. I would highly recommend The Beach or The Drifters for classic travel related reading (though both are fiction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"Exactly what I had hoped when I ordered this book. It tells a riveting, poignant, no-holds-barred story of a riotous yet troubled comedian, and was well worth the read. Highly recommended for fans of the man, and for those interested in the world of a comic during Sam's all-too-brief life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone loves little donuts!","review":"This product is great! I've found that the donuts pop out of the pan very easily if I hit it against the counter right after they've come out of the oven. My only complaints are that the pan is a bit difficult to fill- it may be easier to use a pastry bag. Also, the bottoms of the donuts are kind of oddly shaped due to the very conical middle bit. But on top, they are absolutely adorable, and with the right recipe, tasty! As with other reviewers, I've found that it is useful to have 2 pans- the donuts are pretty small (perfect as a small treat, or for those watching waistlines)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doughnuts stick","review":"When I first got this, it worked great. 5 or 6 uses later, it doesn't matter how well I grease the pan or how carefully I measure the shortning in the recipe, the things stick.

Cake donuts are heavier than cake mix cakes, so that was my error.I purchased these in attempt to bake non-wheat, non-gluten donuts, and will continue trial and effort.I'm eager to try again, and I will also upgrade to the full-size pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not non-stick,","review":"I want to like this pan. The donuts are really cute BUT 8 out of 10 stick to the pan - every time. I've tried it several times with a 1/2 a teaspoon of oil in each and they still stick. Tried leaving them in to cool, taking them out immediately, waiting a few minutes, nothing makes a difference, it's just not non-stick. Plus it scratches so easily, making me worry about all the little flakes of the so-called non-stick coating."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUMMY","review":"Makes GREAT mini donoughts.

The kids love decorating these donuts as much as they love to eat them. The ingredients are simple pantry staples and the two recipes included are tasty. I have also made donut shaped muffins in this pan. My only complaint and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the pan could be twice the size. Being able to make 24 at a time would be much more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great with cookie dough!","review":"I've only used this pan to make sugar cookies.

If you can find another source I would. We unfortunately could not. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great little pan!","review":"This is a great little pan for a healthier alternative to regular donuts. My husband loves donuts, so I got this pan to surprise him with homemade donuts that aren't fried. He loved them and raved about how good they were. They are very cute since they are mini donuts. Be aware that you are making cake donuts with this type of pan, not glazed type donuts. Also be careful not to fill the holes with too much batter, or the donuts won't have the hole in the center when they bake. Otherwise, the pan worked great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"This mini doughnut pan is so easy to use! The non-stick coating works very well and has not worn off yet! I love making the doughnuts in the oven rather than deep fry, for a more healthy and fluffy doughnut!

It is well made, I sprayed with Pam and the donuts slid right out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"My family really enjoyed the cute little doughnuts made in this pan. My children especially were thrilled to see them in their lunchbox. The cakes were easy to remove. Use a pastry bag to fill as the pans are tiny.

Mr. Helenga does use this as his source of inspiration, it seems, but tacks onto it unnecessarily graphic sexual experiences which add nothing to the content or development of his story. The most disturbing element of their inclusion was not that they were included. Sexual intimacy is a powerful element of the love relationship. However, it was disturbing that Mr. Helenga felt it necessary to be so anatomically detailed and specific. There have been other modern works which touched upon similar ideas, e.g. 'Our Town' or 'The Human Comedy'. Love and death were powerfully connected in these. What they lacked were lurid details deriving from the motto:\\"Sex sells!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible waste of a compelling theme.","review":"Flatulent, pretentious, overwritten, redundant, overblown, self-indulgent, dishonest and dull. What ever happened to the \\"less is more\\" notion? The success of 16 pleasures seems to have gone to the author's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God is this book slow!!!!!","review":"I have completed about 150 pages of this book and I just cannot go on. The descriptions of simple, unconsequential occasions go on and on for pages. The first 150 pages could easily have been condensed into 20. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read","review":"As part of a book club, I forced myself to read this book to the end. It was so boring and drawn out. I would speed read/skip to look for any interesting sections. I personally found his descriptions of sex/romance practically repulsive. I haven't read a male author in awhile. It was a turn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing after 16 Pleasures","review":"I'm about two-thirds of the way through The Fall of a Sparrow and really I am having to force myself to keep going. The characters do not feel real- the author seems to be trying too hard -doesn't seem like he really had the story in him. Too contrived. And why no discussion of why the mother left her children? It is unbelievable that the girls just shrug their shoulders about it and happily go on. I found the endless identification (it wasn't really description) if what the characters were eating, drinking or picking in the garden boring. So many things seem to have been put in the book just so we'd know how \\"cool\\" Woody (Hellenga?) is: He plays the blues, is a gourmet cook, is irresistable to women, is hip about the fact that his daughter is having an affair with an older married man, listens to Garrison Keillor, had hot sex with his wife every Sunday morning, the list goes on and on. Spare me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fall of My Eyelids","review":"As a man, I found no common ground with the smug and self-centered main character, Woody, who comes across as a closet pervert in Fall of a Sparrow. His sexual exploits, fantasies, and considerations are actually repulsive, and I was incredulous that even the author could imagine anyone bedding him. The book was a gift from a friend who had not read it, but who had read Hellenga's previous work. With its main character being, IMO, an unlikable pompous fool, who I would not invite to my home under any circumstances, I could not finish it. Two thumbs down, down, down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike 16 Pleasures, Hellenga's FALL doesn't illicit emotion","review":"I was disappointed in Hellenga's new venture. The emotions of anger, hurt, love, pain, fear are written about and not felt. Whether he's caught by the school, his own daughters, or the husband/father of a lover, he seems cooly detached from the experience. Events seem to happen as though from a dream. Perhaps that is his intent. His Woody walks through life seemingly incapable of decision-making in contrast to the women in this novel. I wanted to feel emotions from this horrific act of terrorism and the pains of the families division."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"THE FALL OF A SPARROW: Am up to page 147, and am greatly disappointed. I should have studied, and retained, all classical literature, I guess. The descriptions of music were so incomplete :\\"D was a great key. G was too\\", \\"Left the low d open like a drone of a bagpipe\\"...the latter wasn't bad, but \\"a great key\\"? Why? Describe it to me so that I can close my eyes and HEAR the music. I won't comment on what bothers me about content, it would take too long. I do object terribly when the editor is sloppy as to let a flagrant error pass: When Woodhouse is talking to the Dean, he says he has voted for \\"Kennedy, Carter, Mondale and Dukakis\\". This scene takes place in 1986, right? (I looked back and forth to see if I missed something). And Dukakis ran in 1988. Bad. I enjoyed the authors' first book, not entirely, but there were many interesting new things about books, it was well paced, and it took a nice turn. I expected more out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but disturbing--Unrecognized emotional incest","review":"Were it not for one sickening theme running through the book, I would have liked it due to his great story-telling and interesting plot twists. But he imagined his daughter in sexual ways as if that was normal, and then had an almost Woody -Allenish affair with the daughter of a past lover. YUCK. YUCK. YUCK. And he made all his sexual diversions and affairs blameless by making his wife conveniently out of it. The book did not run true and really disturbed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"The Mid-Life Crisis of a Man\\"","review":"This is one of the few books I have ever stopped reading two-thirds of the way through. I just couldn't take it anymore.The author intends to create a protagonist with whom his readers will sympathize, but instead creates a character who is juvenile, self-centered, and perverse (do men really imagine their daughters in the act of having sex?). The women characters are contrived (the nymphet co-ed, who just happens to be the daughter of his ex-lover; the pathetic older woman--who just happens to be his boss; the ex-wife who becomes a nun. Give me a break! This book should be listed under the category Fantasy, male."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating, finally","review":"I started out really looking forward to this book, but was sorely disappointed. The main character, Woody, is self-indulgent and sexually immoral, though a kind father. I found all the characters unlikable to a degree. They are privileged and have no idea how privileged they are. I got bored half-way through and skimmed ahead to the end. I also was really tired of descriptions of Italian food, jazz/blues music, academic life, Italy and ancient things. The graphic sex descriptions were a lot more than was necessary too. By the middle I didn't care about anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex","review":"Wow. I feel compelled to say in Mr. Helenga's defense--There is everso much more to this book than sex. I couldn't help but notice thatsex seemed to be a stumbling block for many readers. But there is much less sex in this book than there are sumptuous Italian recipes or gorgeous discriptions of blues guitars. And if you argue that there is a difference I think you miss the point. This is a story about a man and his family, each in their own way, coming back to life--in all its untidy complexity. I was very happy that Mr. Helenga didn't scrimp on the honest detail. I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE CHEAP SEX WITH AN UNLIKABLE STRANGER","review":"I read it all and afterwards had to take a hot shower to wash it off. I thought maybe, just maybe Woody would become more than a shallow, self-centered bumbling fool, but he never did. However, what bothered me most was that every female character in the book was written to be either cheap or simple. The authors attempts to write from a woman's point of view are as unbelievable and pathetic as a 6'5, beer bellied, hairy transvestite in a pink slip. The continual references to sex in the banal, self-absorbed way they were portrayed became like unexpected flashes of a pervert. When I think about this book, the time spent reading about \\"Woody\\" I feel angry, like I have been mislead and taken advantage of. I give it one star because the landscape imagery was well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"Fall of a Sparrow is an unbelievably bad book. First, the main theme is that serial sex affairs are a crucial response to grief. (This is the experience of the book's two main characters.) Second, the book is just plain badly written. The author often repeats virtually the same narrative in two parts of the book. This is either an example of sloppy editing or what the author thinks to be good writing. In either event, it was an annoying testament to the generally low quality of the writing. My advice: Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly from the Male Point of View","review":"This book, on our bookclub list, was a hard read for many of us. Most (all women) had problems trying to relate to or care for any of the characters. No one could understand why there was such an abbreviated story about the wife and her role when it seemed so important to the stated plot. The writer seemed to ignor and not understand any feelings other than that of his hero Woody and he is written as a pretty shallow character even if he is a classics professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life! As Human as it Gets","review":"This book about people comes alive and causes you to care about them as old friends. Even if you don't like what they're doing you can understand and sympathize. This book is not about solving problems. It's about dealing with what life gives us and doing the best with what we have. In other words a great people book. Reading it will help you understand another side of yourself and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife great price","review":"I have had my knife for 8 years, and it is just as sharp as it was the day I bought it.

But for those of us who have \\"grown\\" to love this woman's lyrics and contribution to pop music, her voice works. I owned her first two LP's and was very happy to find this one from a Japanese site. She is the \\"Elizabeth Barrett Browning\\" of the pop world. If you take the time to listen to this cd, you'll find the quiet world of some lovely lyrics sung by their author. A good find! ps: I strongly recommend you investigate her Japanese releases with Melissa Manchester (available on Amazon.com) to hear some of the 70's best music. I strongly recommend the import \\"Best Of\\" and \\"Better Days & Happy Endings\\" by Melissa Manchester, as they contain some of CBS's and MM's best collaborations.

The director had great initiative in creating the movie, but this movie is a film student attempt at best. No one can act at all, there are no characters who you fall in love with/hate, they had no personalities whatsoever. It just is a shallow movie attempting to further stereotype a gay \\"relasionship\\" I feel sorry for the director in revealing how inexperienced he is by making this movie - not only in his filmmaking skills, but also in his own life.

I hesitated taking a look because I hadn't heard much about it. Boy, am I glad I watched it. This film really spoke to me in ways that most mainstream films can't even hope to. It's way low budget, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The acting is so real I'm almost not certain if these are actors, or just real the director followed. Very cool. There's also a couple of very compelling sex scenes -- made all the more so because of the believabilty of the performers.

I had the poor judgement to order this film on DVD without having seen it or speaking to people that have seen it. My mistake - won't happen again! I did get a good laugh from some of the worst performances ever to bbe caught on film. THis feels much like something a first year film student would produce (and not one of the better students).Probably the biggest drawback, aside from the poor acting, is that the major characters simply lack sufficient charisma to get and hold your attention.

In this film, the lead asian male is in the exclusive company of white males and absolutely never makes mention of his own ethnicity and how it relates to being with only white men. This unrealtic and fantastic approach made this film very unsettling. Racism is a very real force in the gay world and gay asian men in particular seem to support the notion that happiness and sexual pleasure is only found amongst white men. If this film really wanted to be thought-provoking the asian lead male would have been in love with an african-american or EVEN a member of his own race.

First of all, it is interesting that the cover of the movie tries to make it look like some sort of sex-themed flick, which actually made me avoid it at first. True, the people and the situations look real, but you still watch a movie for some entertainment value of some sort, and there really isn't anything to see her except for a few well-done scenes. It is a documentary, essentially, so if you enjoy watching documentaries, then you'll probably like this.

The script is boring and pointless. I have never found characters in a movie this uninteresting. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is choppy and comes across like someone reading a passage in a High School English class. To add insult to injury, none of the guys in the movie are attractive in the least. This is one movie that should never have been made. The movie literally has nothing going for it. Buy it only if you are purchasing it as a gift for your worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"My boy friend and I rented this movie and we didn't see the end.

It starts out pretty talky and it looks very low budget, like a documentary. Then about a third of the way through the story shifts and it becomes totally fun to watch and impossible to predict. I've never seen the 3 lead guys before, but they were super...all very unique and interesting performers. Writing is sharp with a good dose of humor. Loved all the shots of Los Angeles. I only wish the DVD had a running commentary by the director, though, because I would love to know more about this film. I would recommend it if you're into independent cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIFT is the key word here.....zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I've never written one of these reviews before, but this DVD was so bad, I had to do something to keep me awake. After really looking forward to receiving my Amazon package (as always!) this movie was a real disappointment. There are a few scenes where one can relate, but trust me, there are very few. At the opening, I thought I was watching a DVD of a videotaped scene, but the entire film was poorly shot, cast, and edited. Not to mention, the forced acting made me feel bad that the \\"actors\\" had to go through all of the agony of making this film. So, everybody's a critic, but if you enjoy watching films while drifting in and out of sleep, drifting in and out of the kitchen, or even drifting in and out of your neighborhood, this film's for you. Otherwise, invest your money in something more meaningful like \\"Big Eden\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile yet flawed","review":"Quentin Lee seems to be a jack of all trades. He not only directs this film, he wrote and shot it as well. That's three jobs too many. He is without a doubt an excellent director, but he should leave the writing to someone else. His dialogue is stiff and intellectual and doesn't always ring true. Thank God for the wonderful actors that he's found here that truly make the characters their own and create a very believable little world. They make the impossible possible and do it with great style and grace. Lee definitely has a career ahead of him as he has wonderful instincts and has an important point of view, but next time, leave the writing to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to sit through","review":"Sounded like an interesting story line, but it wasn't.

May people do something more creative? The white partner actor is good, but others (the younger white, the Asian man) look pretentious. They need more polishing.

Well, thats what youre gonna get with this camera. If you take a 640X480 snapshot, get ready for dissapointment. All images and video is blocky with bad color.

Like to work them while listening to the news on TV and such. No pencil to sharpen, no erasing, lots of crosswords in one small package. Also, consider the Solitaire game.

Nice diversions and should continue to get something from them for a long time as they pack so many puzzles or game variations into them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for grownups and older kids","review":"This is a game that is THE New York Times Crosswords. They are challenging and can be difficult for many people.The interface for doing puzzles with this is way better than pen and paper. You can cycle through the clues easily. You use the left and right buttons to go from clue to clue and use the stylus (or onscreen keyboard) to enter the letters into the squares.The character recognition could use a little improvement but it works. I only need to backup and try again 5% of the time or so. It does not detract much from the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging","review":"This is a great game because it has a variety of options and it's challenging. There is a two player option in which you can play on a team or against each other. If you play against each other, you will get points for each right letter in the puzzle, which is really helpful in eliminating possibilities. One player options are also varied and give you the option of unlocking things and receiving grades. Negatives are that some letters are harder to input,so you may end up doing alot of deleting, and the puzzles can be very difficult. If you are not used to doing crosswords, it's best to do the \\"Monday\\" puzzles. The problem comes from the clues sometimes being too abstract, but overall it's a fun game that eliminates the need for a pen and paper, and you can take it anywhere to alleviate boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly implemented","review":"I do the NYT puzzles on paper, and wasn't sure this could be any good.

It's good and basic none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best designed DS game of its genre","review":"I never completed a crossword puzzle in my life, but I have become addicted to this one. It is completely intuitive and its pattern recognition can't be beat. Its L/R buttons move through the puzzle initially horizontally and on a second pass vertically. I suspect that is the way crossword aficionados operate. As a neophyte. I usually go through the puzzle a couple times this way and then switch to completing areas.I spend one to two hours each evening unwinding with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was really looking forward to this DVD after reading the other reviews, but in the end I felt really let down. You only get to see snippets of the live show. We were really frustrated when the disc cuts away from the Hecubus sketch just when it really gets going. :( Audio and video quality is often poor.

You can tell that they live to perform, and there was something magical about the show that isn't captured on a television screen.But this documentary is beyond sad.

This movie is only disappointing and quite depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Buzz Kill.....","review":"I LOVE the Kids, but this dvd is so disappointing! Too much focus on the backstage bickering. Badly filmed, muffled sound. The situations and discussions filmed seemed to make the Kids look like a bunch of whiny babies who don't like each other anymore. I wanted to see more of the stage show, what little was covered of it looked pretty funny.I guess this is really a look into the reality of the Kids and how they (didn't) get along with each other after working separately for the years after the TV show was over. It just made me sad. I can't wait for the TV shows to all be on DVD--if it isn't in the works then it oughta be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst rip off!!!","review":"I should have taken heed the other reviews of this dvd. Not only is it boring as all but the dialogue is barely audible. It is basically someone with a handicam following the Kids around - who knew it would be so darn boring.

Damn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of money - from a huge \\"Kids\\" fan.","review":"This DVD was the most dissapointing purchase I've made in a long while. I saw this show live in Boston in 2000 and it was a blast, funny as hell! The DVD does NOT capture the show, instead it shows meaningless and humorless behind the scenes footage with some other random footage which adds nothing. Leave that stuff for the extra features and give us the show uncut. The tapes of the old shows, which are classic, are a much better choice for a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Kids in the Hall, Same Guys, New Dresses is something of a disappointment. It follows the Kids on their North American tour in 2000. It was kind of interesting how they showed some behind the scenes stuff and how things were written. But the problem is that the movie only showed clips from the actual tour.There's new material, or at least newer than the old stuff from the series, but we don't get to see it. It's like a tv clip show. They show them getting dressed and eating dinner and talking about the skits. Then they show maybe 10 seconds of a clip. I kept wating for them to get to the actual show.So don't get this unless....well, unless you like being teased. If you like your comedy shown and then quickly pulled away at the last second, this might be for you. Otherwise it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used item sold as new.","review":"Although the timing in which I received this item was above average, when I opened the box I noticed that the knife appeared as though it had simply been placed inside of an already open, plastic Chicago Cutlery package which simply fell apart as I tried to remove it from the bag.

The knife itself isn't too bad either, definitely not the best I've seen but it will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a serious cook","review":"I usually buy Wusthof knives, but was persuaded to try the Chicago Cutlery in the interests of economy. It's a decent little knife if you don't cook much, don't mind that it doesn't hold an edge very well, and don't need to cut up anything more serious than melons. It's worth what I paid for it, but it's not a knife I really want in my kitchen. If your expectations are low, this is a great bargain.

The big line in this remix will send chills down your spine and force your hands into the air. The Dominator mix is of fine quality as well. Yet unlike the Dominator mix of The Sun, this mix tends to stay in the general boundaries of the original mix. The Dominator mix of The Sun ventured off into amazing territory and gave the original mix a fine makeover. Here, I expected the same, but was a bit disappointed when I found out that it is pretty much just like the original mix. But still, a fine mix indeed. But again, The Dumonde remix is the winner here. But with fine material to start off with, i.e. original mix, it's no wonder Dumonde was able to create another masterpiece. Buy this either on CD or vinyl, not only for a superior Dumonde mix, but also because Marc Aurel has put out another fine single.

There are two small screws that hold the tachometer onto the base. By the time I had the tachometer completely installed, the screws wouldn't hold the tachometer in adjustment. It kept drooping and aiming down. As a temporary fix, I grabbed a napkin from my glove box, wadded it up, and stuffed it between the tachometer and the dash.

It has everything going for it. The recipies are delicious and not too complicated or time-consuming for the average person. Rarely are there ingredients listed that are not readily available at the local grocery store. There is an extensive background of Middle Eastern cooking that is fascinating to read. And it is a big book, with a huge variety of recipies from different countries in the region, everything from appetizers to desserts and drinks. You'll have everything you need to make a multi-course feast if you're so inspired...and there's so many good recipies in here it's easy to feel inspired! I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you like to use many flavors and spices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for lovers of middle-eastern food","review":"This is a great book for somebody who loves middle-eastern food and wants to know how to cook it.

It also has useful tips on cooking techniques which I really appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Middle Eastern Cookbook You'll Ever Need","review":"I bought three middle eastern cookbooks from Amazon.com.

I've made 10+ recipes from this book and none have been interesting. I don't know if she was trying to avoid including unusual ingredients or complicated techniques, but there just isn't much flavor in these pages. She does include nice vignettes and stories about the food, so you may enjoy reading this book, and likewise if you don't like your food too strongly flavored and you prefer simple cooking, you might like this, but it's just not even sort of authentic, good middle eastern food. For example, the last recipe I made called for boiling chicken in turmeric and water with a few crushed cardamom pods. Really?? That's what you call a chicken sofrito? My turmeric was from Morocco and even that couldn't save this bland recipe. I'll be looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new book of middle eastern food - I recommend","review":"This book is amazing as it is not only an excellent middle eastern cookbook but also a book filled with stories and even humoristic short texts that are a joy to read.

I kept one, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"for inspiration only","review":"We have made about 15 recipes from this book. The recipes are \\"easy\\" but they aren't very good. You can't follow the recipe as written and expect to get something that tastes good. The author seems to be unaware of basic cooking techniques like frying the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients. Many recipes have shortcuts that sacrifice flavor, but also do things in very long convoluted ways that don't add flavor. Many of the recipes simply taste like chicken without any other flavor, and they only got the chicken flavor because we substituted chicken broth or bullion for water. I made a pork cooked in milk recipe. It took forever, was very labor intensive, and didn't taste very good. I made the same thing using a cooks illustrated recipe - it was way easier and tasted 1000 times better.This book is probably good for people that don't actually follow recipes but just use them for inspiration. I prefer recipes that work - ie cooks illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously different but you must like garlic!","review":"I think I've made about a dozen recipes so far, rating all of them \\"good\\" to \\"wonderful.\\" But just about every recipe has garlic.

One of the things that I liked about this book is that it gave suggestions to alter the ethnicity by slightly changing some of the ingredients, turning it from Egyptian for example to Lebanese. The books first 50 pages are a Middle_eastern culinary lesson in the history and evolution of Middle-Eastern food.Read the how to use this book to help you navigate through the book as it is a bit confusing at first.

From the fragrant stews of Marocco on to the luxurius Francophoenician cuisine of Lebanon, the fiery tastes of Tunisia and the Imperial flavours of Persia.I have tried many recipes, and all were very good.Not one of them dissappointed me.There are simple step by step instructions and even an introduction to each dish.Why then 4 stars?

After about a dozen uses, and no problems, the stove started leaking fuel out of the place where the fuel line attaches to the stove. The flame that shot out the side was sufficient to quickly burn a hole in the wind blocking thingie. We had to cut our trip short. Once back home, we brought it to the outdoor store we bought it from, and they sent it to the manufacturer for us. We got it back a couple of weeks later with a charge of $25 for the repair, and a note stating that we must have damaged/dropped the stove for it to develop that kind of leak. We never dropped the stove, or even handled it roughly. Our last stove lasted us 25 years (and still works; we just had trouble getting the butane); we take good care of our gear.

This stove is great because you can use a traditional wind-screen with it since the canister is away from the flame. MSR has achived this while keeping the stove very light...and quite stable.

Even upside down, it wouldn't go for long. It wasn't even cold, as I was in the Joshua Tree desert. I guess MSR knew that the product is flawed, as they came out with a Windpro II since then that is designed to be used with the fuel upside down.

Written for the then newly founded Provincetown Players, Two Slatterns and a King explores the irony of too-rapid selection of potential romantic partners. While exploring that theme the play follows many of the conventions of medieval morality plays by making the central villain personified Chance, who wreaks havoc on the life of a King who is on a quest to find the perfect mate. The King has determined that he will marry only a tidy, orderly woman and tours his land in search of his ideal. On this day, Chance causes a normally tidy woman to be beset with chaos (and untidiness) through no fault of her own, and Chance also inspires a slattern (lazy, messy woman) to have a whim to clean her home on one day only. The King of course in his hurry to come to a satisfactory conclusion misjudges both women. Chance leads him to take the hand of the utterly wrong person, and the moral of the story is not to judge character too quickly. A fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me in the \\"it leaks and it sticks\\" group","review":"Saw these in a local kitchen shop and thought they were adorable.

So, the result looked pretty good, but if I wanted to cut it, I would have just done so.The other problem is that they are very non-non-stick. That is, they are very sticky. I tried spraying them with olive oil the second time I used them and it still stuck just as badly. The second time, egg squeezed into the seam at the bottom of the heart (where the handle is) and it was very hard to get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I had no problems using these for fried eggs in a skillet. Remember that the cooking surface should be flat as rounded bottoms will cause leaking. I also greased the ring it self with a small amount of country crock on my fingers before cooking. The eggs slid out easily. The kids and wife were impressed and my 3 year old squealed with delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"These leak!","review":"I was so excited to get these in the mail that I immediately tried to make some eggs. The egg just oozed out as soon as I poured it into the heart mold. I'm so sad. I wanted to make cute heart eggs. Sigh. I guess I can just cut the egg after it's cooked, but it's not the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks.","review":"This doesn't work real well. When you crack an egg or put batter in it it seeps. I tried changing the amount placed inside, changing pans, high heat, lower heat, and it just doesn't work. :(Definitely would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea but doesn't work at all","review":"These are cute and I really wish they worked but they don't. I tried eggs and pancakes. Anything you put in it leaks out immediately and then whatever is left sticks to the rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful if you know the trick","review":"I bought this to make breakfast and desserts for my boyfriend, and it works great once you know it's way around.For eggs and pancakes, be sure to rub some butter on the rings and cover both sides entirely, and push the rings a little bit against the pan for about 30 seconds once you add the pancake mix or egg in it, and leave it on for another 10 seconds before you remove it. If it doesn't comes out smoothly, heat for a few seconds the tip of a pointy knife and pass it around the ring.It's really easy and useful once you get the hang of it, at least it's better than doing the shape manually, and for the price these work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for eggs and pancakes","review":"Ok first you need a pan that is flat or it will not work and do not over fill.

I tried several times to try to get the egg from just slipping out from under the mold. When I added a bit a a time and that seemed to work, but then the bottom was WAY over done and the top was raw. What a waste of money and eggs! Maybe it could be used for a cookie cutter is the only reason I gave it two stars, but I didn't buy it for a cookie cutter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"These are great for pancakes, haven't made eggs yet but i'm looking forward to trying those.

The hinge at the bottom of the heart leaks. Fast. It does not form a sufficient barrier to get the eggs to cook. Instead the eggs poor through the tiny opening by the hinge like a river flowing through a busted dam.I have not tried it with pancakes however.I highly recommend you look elsewhere if you are cooking eggs though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Heart These Hearts!","review":"The pancakes you can make with these rings are almost too cute to eat! And, too easy to use. Just mix up your batter, heat up your pan/griddle, spray a little Pam cooking spray and pour your batter in to the hearts! Don't forget to spray the hearts too for an easy release. I got 2 sets so I can make 4 at a time. I just love them! Also, if you make waffles or pancakes don't walk, run to Williams Sonoma and pick up the \\"Batter Dispenser\\" they have. It is about $35 and well worth every penny. Pour your batter in the dispenser and just squeeze the handle to dispense the perfect amount of batter. It works like a flour sifter. No mess, no drips and it is stainless steel and dishwasher safe, what could be better? Also, these hearts are dishwasher safe too. It couldn't be easier to whip up a \\"lovely\\" delicious breakfast!

They say nonstick, but I recommend a small amount of nonstick spray (obvious), but not necessary. Even if you don't have perfectly flat pans, these are still really functional. Honestly, who has perfectly flat pans... they always warp slightly from heating. Made the cutest breakfast ever. Even inexpensive as they are, they work perfectly, and I love the little wood knob for handling them while they are heated."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","review":"The world is a small place. Thankfully there are people out therewho are capable of making it look and sound a little bigger than it is.One of the most intriguing bands of the year, Howlin' Maggie's HYDE deals in funky, driving guitar music fronted with the unconventional vocal and lyrical style of singer Harold \\"Happy\\" Chichester. His range crosses the great divide previously only crossed by Prince. The songs are remininscent of the Pixies,young Rolling Stones, and have the lyrical depth of Tom Waits.From somewhere in the Midwest, I think Columbus, OH, Howlin' Maggie are able to take the listener to a place no other artistcan. Their sound is all at once rock, funk, dance and yes,ambient.I live in France yet used to live in Seattle where Ifirst heard of Howlin' Maggie and I highly highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased the Japanese blu and was pleasantly surprised","review":"Now I can't say that I've read the manga (which I have not), but all things considered this was quite good. While there is blood and grue, I can't say there is anything along the likes of UROTSUKDOJI or GENOCYBER (which are vomit inducing)... but don't think there isn't Nightmare Fuel in this (the scene with the elevator left a big impact on me).You might feel it gets a bit convoluted near the end, but compared to pretentious stuff like DEATH NOTE (which has a great idea but has melodramatic execution) it's better than what you would expect. Some really cool ideas, a nice pace and under 2 hours... what more can you want (other than more US anime)?BTW, NINJA SCROLL was just released on blu in Japan and looks FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of an AU than an Adaptation","review":"All of the characters origins and purposes were changed. As one who has owned all 6 volumes of the manga, this might as well have been a fan fiction, or an alternative universe. It's almost a shame that they share the same title. For those of you that have enjoyed the manga as I have, you'll notice more than one serious plot point has been erased or made so that it was never even going to happen. The rising action that happened in the manga was never even so much as spoken of, and while the ending was the only thing that was even remotely similar to the original, the dynamic changes will leave original fans a lot to be desired. I'd recommend the manga to anybody, not the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is another stay up late, edge of your seat, can't put it down story from Ms. Brennan. The action is fast paced, the characters are likeable, and the suspense is gripping. I read this one out of order (it was my first Allison Brennan book), not realizing it was the same series as The Prey, The Hunt, & The Kill. The change of title fooled me into thinking I had book 1 of a new series. However, that did not effect my enjoyment of the book. It has a few references to The Kill, but not so much you feel the need to put it down and read the other first. It stands on it's own. I immediately ran out and bought the rest of her books when I finished this one. Speak No Evil is next for me. So far, I consider my purchases money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched","review":"I wasn't impressed by this book at all. The plot line felt contrived and written according to a formula. You could just tell that the suspects that they were after were not the right ones. There was a slight tension that built up as the story continued but not anything like what I expect from a romantic suspense. And the real capper was the fact that even though the main character was a woman, the narrator was a man who did a lousy job at women's voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"I absolutely adore Allison Brennan's books. Although I have not read one if a very long time, they were always page turners, suspenseful, and I could never put the books down. I enjoyed her way of having the books suspenseful mysteries, with a little romance thrown in with the hero in the book, whether it was the cop, detective, or other hero in the book. Some of her books spooked me out a little, and I can only describe it as me making sure my back was against the wall, and that I could see every inch of the room I was in. Great books, great reads, great author, really recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense and exciting, despite lacking a bit in relationship development","review":"The mystery was really good, but the development of Carina and Nick's relationship outside of the bedroom was really weak, and the ending was unfulfilling; the whole thing about Nick leaving and all that jazz was just irrelevant, and we never found out what happened with Kyle Burns. The last book in this series,Fear No Evil: A Novel, was the best; I'd go with that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book, hated the crude language","review":"This book was suspenseful, kept you guessing till the end. I love Allison Brennan's books, have read them all so far. The only thing that I really don't like is the crude language, I think it would still be spine tingling if it was toned down a bit. This book was a nice mixture of suspense with a little romance included. Hopefully the next one will have a little less of the crudeness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read!","review":"This is the first Allison Brennan book I've tried out and it will be the last. I am a fan of almost every genre, as long as the books are well written. I have currently been reading quite a bit of suspense/thriller/mystery books and have to say that I was very disappointed. I cannot understand how on earth this author came to be so popular, since her writing is some of the worst that I've come across in a very long time. By the time I reached Chapter 5, I couldn't bring myself to read any further, because to do so was torture. I can't believe I paid for this book. The story line was obvious and the main characters were boring and did nothing to catch my interest or sympathy.For a really good suspense/thriller, I would recommend anything by Tami Hoag and Heather Graham's \\"Dead Room\\" was pretty good, although her other books are not up to the same standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Here We Are","review":"Great songs with interesting meanings and excellent back up musicians. It's \\"My First time in Texas\\", has excellent words and mentions many cities and towns in Texas. This song reminds me of my past visits to Texas because I've been to most of these places that Joey mentions. There is a little bit of yodelling and I enjoy it so much that I wish there was more. I also enjoy the three songs that Joey and his wife sing together:\\"So Here We Are\\", \\"Troubled Mind\\", and \\"Excuse Me Lucille\\". The last one is a bit of comedy, which makes the cd more interesting. There are a few good ballads as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopper leaks","review":"Advertised for 1 1/2 inch to 2 inches.

Sometimes, itchy, too. This occurred multiple times, always after using this. Discontinued using it, naturally, cause, hey, that's not something I need to deal with.I've since switched to Sliquid H2O (no glycerin, no paraben) and that works much better, no strange odors, decent lubrication.

A professor who happens to live on an estate breaks the seal and the zombies rise. Pretty basic and repetitive. Although one decent aspect is the zombies look decent,they don't look as corny as (Shock Waves and Zombie Lake)which are 2 other terrible movies. Also what on earth is going on with the chessy dialogue,line like \\"You look like a slut,but I like it\\"and telling a zombie \\"Im your friend\\". In conclusion I would recommend actual great classic Horror movies like (1978-Dawn Of The Dead,1985-Day Of The Dead,1980-Cannibal Apocalypse,1983-Evil Dead,1981-The Beyond) instead to add to your collection rather then wasting 16 dollars on the terrible Burial Ground from Shriek Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burial Ground should of stayed buried!!!!","review":"There have been countless zombie movies throughout the years.First Night of the Living Dead back in 68 then so on.The market for these things are exploding left&right.This one in particular isn't frightning just gory.This one isn't a milestone it's just malarky.The acting is dreadfull and the characters are so off-putting you'll be rooting for our dead heros to off em.There is the Professor who shouts, \\"I'm your friend,\\" No professor if you were a true friend ya would of left them alone.The most silliest performance is that of David,an adult who plays like a child and has a thing about feeling up his mother!!!!

BUT when they are eating, it's extremely realistic (probably really is raw meat). The combination is ... just odd. No explanation is given, you feel no sympathy or connection to the characters AT ALL, they figure out how to kill them but choose NOT to keep swords, etc on hand (they're in a castle for crying out loud!), and at the end... you're left with some enigmatic quote flashed on the screen from... some story, who knows from where?

We got your Zombies!!\\" kind of Spaghetti-splatterfest, \\"Burial Ground\\" succeeds where most of these thrillers fail, by eliminating most of the slower talky sections and giving us fans exactly what we want. From the first sequence to the last this unheralded trash-thriller keeps the viewer riveted with graphic depictions of Zombi violence and futile Human efforts to fight back. Character development is kept to a blessed minimum as this dark and mean-spirited bloodfest progresses to it's downbeat conclusion. Highly recommended and now readily available, pick this up if you like this stuff. Sure wish the Cosmic-synth soundtack was available(!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for Gore 3.5 for everything else.","review":"I love Zombie flicks especially a good one. This movie is up there in somewhat of a sense. The acting is pretty good the dubbing is not bad either. Why the Zombies came to life, I dont get but who cares. Now, the GORE, thats what makes this film good its bloody and gory and that makes up for it. The Zombie make up is not bad either. But the most bugged out thing to see is the mother and son, and the sons need for love as he is supposably about 10 years old in the film but the part is played by like a 30 year old, pretty freaky, especially when the boy starts rubbing his mothers breasts as he pulls them out of her Bra then procceeds to try to go up her skirt, but when you buy it you will see.

The zombies actually look their age, like actual dried up rotten corpeses. The effects, though not the best that I've seen, are adequate and not so bad that they bring down the movie. The dialog is unintentionally humerous at times but this just adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.

When you pay less than $40 for speaker stands you aren't going to get things like good materials or even reliable product descriptions.These things are made of something. Certainly not wood.It is *very* easy to split the material when you are putting it together if you are not careful.They are not 16\\" tall. As another reviewer also noted. They are at least an inch shorter than that. Keep that in mind as well.The \\"wire management\\" is a joke. There is a hole in the bottom of the base but then there is no groove to route the wire once it gets out so the base ends up on top of it. Very poor design.So it loses a star for the material, the lie on the height and the wire management issue.It gets a star for holding up the speakers and another for being cheap and easy to put together.Any way you slice it.

MDF materials are weak even at this price point.Major problem: The assembly caused cracking of the pre-drilled holes. Either the screws are too large, or the hole is sized wrong, or the walls are just too weak. All three could be to blame. The wood around the screws cracked in most of the screw locations. Some cracked a few minutes after the screw had been inserted, some cracked right away. Too bad, because the overall look of the stands is fine (considering the price).

The less than subtle Jamaican rhythm section with the prominent bass guitar and crackling hand drums induce more basic emotions that constrast nicely with the light sophistication of Monty Alexander's piano. This is also the first time that I've heard M. Alexander's music and he is a talented performer. With his left hand anchoring the chord progressions, his right is free to playfully dance through the various melodies.The selections are all pretty good, although in my opinion, the band is at its best when everyone is jamming hard. These include Tracks 2 & 7 which are my favorites among the original compositions. The two Bob Marley covers are also very well done (except for the cheesy vocals in the second half of \\"Could You Be Loved\\")All in all, the CD was an excellent live recording and it has encouraged me to explore more of Monty's music as well as other jazz-reggae fusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"I've followed Oregon's career from the beginning, and though one might guess that after thirty-five years (and with three of the original members still present), the band might have lost its edge, 'tain't so. Oregon's brand of jazz is timeless. Ralph Towner's guitar and keyboard work are as fluent as ever, Paul McCandless's reed improvisations are endlessly inventive, Glen Moore's imaginative bass lines provide far, far more than just support, and the propulsive drums and percussion of Mark Walker (the \\"newer kid\\" in the group) makes the rhythm sizzle and simmer as needed. The compositions, most of them Towner's (with a few gems by Moore), are all compelling and offer a wide range of melodies and rhythms in which the band can work its magic. The sound engineering equals the performances, and the vitality and presence is astonishing. A real triumph that makes me look forward to the *next* thirty-five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon's \\"Prime\\" is sadly mistitled","review":"I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, \\"Oh, THIS won't be jazz.\\" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found \\"Prime\\" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the \\"smooth jazz\\" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Receiver sold separately!","review":"I STILL can't find the fine print that says \\"Base Station Not Included!\\" This just went from a good deal to not-worth-the-money.

The characters are lifelike, and the plot is compelling. Ms. Rose has both a keen eye and ear for the details of life in Baltimore. Her descriptions of the lead character's fear and anxiety as she travels into the unchartered realm of a lesbian relationship capture the danger and delicacy with which one might sip much needed and desired water from a broken glass.The character's creative struggles are equally interesting, as she comes to terms with her heritage as an African American artist.

Most directors of 'erotica' concentrate on gynecological close-ups to the exclusion of all else; Metzger's hallmark has always been to tell a story and explain the characters and their situation without ever resorting to the patronizing smirk, relying as much on the actors' eyes as on the dialogue. The S&M scene is as alien to me as peanut-butter-and-pickle sandwiches (which I am also told some enjoy), but in THE IMAGE I can see the gamesmanship, the role-playing and the unspoken psychological leveraging that makes it all so compellingly complex. Would I show this film to Grandma? Uh-uh. But then, that's just MY grandma, yours may well have a side you never suspected. This film is hot, fascinating, and, in this gorgeous and UNCUT (thank you, thank you!) video transfer, stunningly beautiful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"it's vintage and maybe that's why it seems overly corny at times, but ultimately it's about as highly sexual as you can get without hardcore porn.

This DVD is hot!!!","review":"The plot as well as the film structure is in the typical european style, but if patient, one falls victim to the eroticism of this film. At times, it can be quite, well, let's just say \\"mediumcore\\". If you don't expect too much, you will be suprised by the quality of direction and photograghy.

The DVD has some scenes where there are lines in the picture but they do not take away from the movie, for being such an old movie it transferred well to DVD. I have to admit that I did not think that the movie would get so explicit in some of the scenes, but I think that just made it even better. Seriously though, if you want a very erotic movie then this one is great. There are some scenes that are a little annoying, like screaming for five or so minutes, but overall it is great. I would not buy it if you are looking for a porno, but there are several scenes that you would see in a porno.Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good image","review":"based on the novel with the same title by jean de berg. i am sorry: everything is unconvincing, the setting in paris, the actors (except perhaps for claire), the sadomasochistic relationship between the two women and between the two women and the man. this is in part due to the fact that this is an american movie which strictly follows american codes; there is no hint of the real paris and parisians."},{"rating":"2","title":"revealing!","review":"Metzger explores the hidden desires of bored rich people entering the world of s/m. The willing victime is beautiful, the aesthetique of the film is good being explicit but never giving the impression of a porno film. It goes further examining the balance between tolerence and jealousy. It could be more insisting on the subject of human emotions through situations of that kind and then it could be a realy good film. Metzger is good but for sure is not Pasolini!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat erotic but badly writen and acted","review":"This movie is marginally more than a porn flick. There are some fairly erotic scenes and an interesting exploration of sado-masochism. Sadly the acting and script are so weak that they become distracting. It is done in a narrative form that tries so hard to be sophisticated and cool about the subject matter yet comes off looking just silly making it slightly more than a mere porn film. There's no real story here and no real humanity, so it cannot be truly erotic. An exploration of the submissive and dominant personalities are what's missing here. Mostly it's an excuse to showcase bdsm. I guess I'd recommend this film for those interested in S&M but would like to steer you toward The Night Porter, The Piano Teacher and Secretary as far superior dramatic works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff.","review":"This movie sucks.

The hero is a slimy jerk who should really look into being medicated for his severe mood swings, I wouldn't trust him to watch a potted plant let alone a child. The heroine of the story is a spoiled rich girl that needs to get her head out of the sand and grow up. I actually caught myself curling my lip in disgust several times and almost gave up on the story but trudged through until the end. The hero and heroine in this story deserve each other, I just feel sorry for their children being stuck with the two of them.Several others have proclaimed this to be one of Catherine Spencer's best books, I'm hoping that's not true but in any case I'll be sure to steer clear of anything else written by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance Junkie","review":"Michael was a big jerk, and I could not stand him.

Traditional criticism (i.e. form criticism) deconstructs texts to pull out strands (like JEPD). Literary criticism is not concerned with how a text came to be, but on the text we have before us. Berlin enlightens the reader on how the Biblical author's use literary techniques to communicate meaning. Narrative is not usually explicit (\\"do this or dont do this). Narrtive teaches implicitly, by showing us how or how not to live. But to learn from narrative, we must be sensetive to the author's methods of communication.

While it's commendable that the anti-Master's films are becoming available on DVD, a certain amount of respect must be paid to consumers when coming up with good source materials. Granted, Milligan's features were never visually arresting, but the print used for the DVD is a worn, battered 35mm blowup from 16mm print. A gray market version of the film I have in my collection is vastly superior, time code at the bottom and all.The one improvement appears to be in sound quality. You can hear Neal Flannagan's pointy bishop hat crinkle like the hasty paper creation it actually is!

In this debut, JoBeth is involved with an abusive ex-husband; the mysterious will of her deceased artist father; a handsome new lawyer in town; escaped criminals; missing children; a handsome private investigator; and lots more.

Tender, funny, literate--this is my universal Christmas gift this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about making friends even if you're scared to do so.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The drawings were warmly detailed and delicate. I felt the story so heartwarming. It explains how Walter and Miss Pomeroy, who were both living lonely existences for different reasons, took the 'risk' of putting themselves in each other's lives in hopes of making that wonderful connection we call friendship.The exchange of notes was sweet - and the first note back from Miss Pomeroy \\"i know\\" actually gave me goosebumps.Towards the end of the book there is a drawing of Walter and Miss Pomeroy together. It was so poignant is made me cry. I highly recommend this sweet story. I would think it would be especially helpful to a child who is introverted and afraid to make new friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walter The Story of a Rat","review":"I loved this book!It is a beautiful story with gorgeous illustrations.

I have small hands which may be why I frequently hit the left click button at the wrong angle so that it wouldn't register. Dragging with this device felt very uncomfortable, and it wasn't as precise as my ancient Logitech FX. I would have purchased another Logitech, but they seem to have discontinued all models with a large enough ball for precision graphics work. Despite my small hand size, I finally decided on the even bulkier Kensington Expert Mouse Optical as the most comfortable replacement for my graphics work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate","review":"I have used a trackball since 1991. I got this product because I got a new computer and wanted something else new. I like the button options and the wheel that can be accellerated. However, these pros do not compensate for the poor accuracy. As I had read in other reviews, the ball will stick unless you press hard on it sometimes. It's hard to explain, but there are times when your thumb glides across the ball without the ball moving. So you have to press harder, but the bushings (little pins that support the ball) will hold the ball in place. The result is jerky performance. I reconnected a couple of old Logitech trackballs and could not reproduce this effect. Yes, I do regularly clean the Microsoft ball as well.It isn't the optics or anything electronic, it is simply the makeup of the ball and bushing.Good LuckAJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough on the Wrist","review":"This mouse is a bit tough on your wrist. As I read in another article that it was tough for small hands. I'm a pretty big guy thus have some big hands and its still tough on my wrist. I find that it seems to angle a little to bit upward causing some stress on my wrist. Enough stress that I'm using my other arm to browse the web while I look for a new mouse. The mouse works great and has a great deal of buttons for many uses but the angle is just to hard on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have been using my TB Explorer for many years. I bought it when they only cost about $60. This mouse has NEVER given me a problem that I couldn't just wipe away. Literally.When it gets sticky or hard to move. Pop the ball out and wipe the gunk from the 3 bearings with your finger. Then pop the ball back in.If it gets kind glitchy. Again, pop out the ball, and remove the little hair or fuzz away from the laser. Then pop the ball back in.This thing is awesome.Granted, it's NOT worth $400+. No pointer device is. Though if you can get one for a $100. Get it. I love this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mouse/trackball for any OS","review":"The Microsoft Trackball Explorer 1.0 saved my wrist, all three of mine also have very long cords.

I really like the addition of the mousewheel and the four programmable buttons. My \\"complaint\\" has been that the design cause me to bend my wrist backwards to fit the shape. Solution: I added about 1 1/2 inches of height to the front (toward me) of the trackball, elevating that end so that my wrist no longer has to bend so dramatically. MUCH, much better!While I wish the trackball itself were bigger, the optical tracking is smooth and trouble free. All in all, a good product, made better for me with some tape and old wrist rest foam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse, very smooth.","review":"The discription erroneously states that 2 AAA Batteries are required.The mouse at first sight looks enormous, but it is much more comfortable to work with that the old index controlled track ball. I like it so much, that I bought 2 already. The extra 2 buttons (default setting or Back and Forward page while on the net) are addictive. The installation was easy and quick. The ball can fall out if pulled out but does not do so from simply tipping the mouse. Overall would recommend it for heavy users of the net and comfort seekers.Ala"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate to say it but it blows my Kensington away.","review":"For years I have used many Kensingtons for production purposes and home use and what always frustrated me was that the rollers had to be cleaned at least once a day because when they got dirty would skip or slip and it was very frustrating to stop what you were doing just to get your trackball to work. I tried a friends Microsoft trackball mouse and noticed how smooth it was and how I could control it it so easily so I asked for one at work, I got it and it has sped my accuracy up and I have never had to clean it yet! and it still is just as accurate and smooth as when I got it 5 months ago! The only problem I have with it is that the right 2 buttons are too close together and so sometimes I hit the wrong buttons but this is nothing compared to the speed and lack of frustration I use to have.I like it so much I had to get one for my Mac at home.Kensington should get on the ball if it wants to keep up with this mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trackball","review":"I have owned more than 15 different trackballs and this one is the best by far.Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please bring these back into production!","review":"I LOVE this trackball!!

If it dies, I'll be lost. I take excellent care of it - seems a little OCD at times - but I want it to hang in there as long as possible. Warning - don't over-clean the unit, especially the trackball. It works best when \\"primed\\" a bit from the oil from your hand.

Of the five that I have used on desktops at the office and home as well as with laptops, all have failed. In each and every case it is the wire connection to the trackball body. The wires stop making contact and the trackball stops working. You can wiggle the wires for a few days and it will work for awhile. Eventually they all stop working at all. I have kept the balls from the broken trackballs in case I want to play giant marbles.If Mr. gates would make the cable a bit sturdier I would buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats the next best thing?","review":"I have had this for 10+ years.

But the question is what the next best USB trackball mouse out there is now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best trackball ever made...","review":"The Microsoft Trackball Explorer was, in my opinion, the best trackball ever made. I am baffled as to why this was discontinued. I have been unable to adequately replace this, and now use a logitech m570, which while serviceable, is no trackball explorer. Please Microsoft, if you aren't going to produce it, then sell the design to someone who will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons about 1\\" too far back - you must bend your thumb!","review":"Microsoft should really take a lesson from Logitech here. I tried the Trackball Explorer as a replacement for my WELL worn Logitech Marble-Man FX (discontinued - though I'll never understand why.) My hands are M/L - totally typical.After 1 hour of use, my thumb was killing me. You see, you must reach BACK to far to hit the thumb button. If you compare it to logitech, you'll see that they have the buttons in-line with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally, meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at all.The mouse is accurate, and the ball feels nice, but you have to use those buttons... and they are awful. If they'd move them forward about 1\\" this would work as well as the Logitech MarbleMan FX does.It's no wonder those things are going for $150 USED on Ebay... Logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Not Recommended","review":"From my own experience, I must say that the Trackball is not a good buy.1) The price is a bit steep for a mouse. Yes, it's most likely due to the fact that it's a track ball mouse.2) The whole thing seems very unprecise. I once tried clicking the minimize button and I closed the program window instead! Luckily, I was just viewing something on the internet but if it was a document you risk the chance of losing it.3) The mouse is simple too bulky. The buttons on the mouse need to be configered, for example you cannot simply double click on the first action button, you have to infact select a mouse button and assign a double click function to it. You also have to assign a right click button extra, leaving you with few buttons you can configurate yourself.Ultimately, I would urge buyers to shy away from the product. It simply is not worth the price. Yes, it does look sleek and stylish, but it's just not worth the extra bucks and sacrificing functionality for aesthetic appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing I got my money back!","review":"I have been using trackballs ever since I got my first computer. This one ranks dead last. You would think the new technology would be great, but it's a drawback.

She does an OK job, but she's no Ozawa, and not even Ozawa could save this installment.The plot - a powerful and ruthless corporate type has paid off the police - is so cliche. Worse yet, the story revolves around how he has the police cover for the misdeeds of his sadomasochistic daughter.Lots of disgusting S&M; type scenes. And when its all over, there isn't even the requisite revenge, because Rei doesn't kill everyone who deserves it.I would recommend Zero Woman and Zero Woman Returns, in that order, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check with Standard Deviants","review":"Standard Deviants: Algebra Super Pack (7-pack) is available for lesser price1.

It holds more that I thought it would and the extender really helps plus it adds color. It does not have an insulated pocket which I would like to have living in hot weather, but the pockets are big enough to store more than enough stuff for a day full of errands, so its a compromise. I love the easy care and the durability, I don't have to worry about hurting it.

I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.It is now September 2012 and both are rusting even though they are supposedly galvanized. They also began leaking where the intake is and where the plastic plug is on the opposite side. Good thought to have the option of intake on both sides - bad execution with a poor gasket on the intake side and no gasket at all on the other (silicone worked for a while but rust took care of that).The worst part is the float mechanism.

Superman and Batman are taken from their origin point by time travelers and brainwashed to be evil. There are times when you see both Batman and Superman murder people. Both heroes end up traveling through different time currents and meet up with different characters throughout the DC Universe. Some well known like Lois Lane or members of the JLA and others that weren't as well known like Jonah Hex, Hush, Sgt. Rock or Uncle Sam. It seemed to be more of an Elseworlds story but it is part of the main story line. I own about 130 graphic novels and I must say that this has been one of my favorites in the DC Universe. I would rank it up there with stories such as JLA: Pain of the Gods or Green Lantern: The Power of Ion. Overall, it is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the *&!$%)?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series, but this one kept me from going any further. While the first two had well-developed characters and entertaining moments, I did not recognize those heroes in this episode.The plot started off intriguingly, but then quickly dissolved into an incomprehensible menagerie of images and reality-flipping. Here's a tank! Here's a cowboy! The story soon dissolved into silliness - I can't believe I spent the money on the hardcover. I read it thinking, \\"This is what the comic store kept wrapped up in plastic? Why?\\"Most of Loeb's other stories I found to be excellent, especially the Hush stories - but this put a dent in my opinion of him as a writer. Save your money and invest it in something else. I already gave my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planetary II. redux (6/10)","review":"How great could this have been if they had just stuck with the premise of a world with a despot Superman and Batman and how they destroyed the JLA.

Planetary did in a few pages what this could not accomplish in an entire Graphic Novel.Re-readability: 6/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read.

You get the entire original poem along with a beautiful presentation. The poem is very short, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in style and mood. From the outset this is a different kind of book. There is no binding, instead it is one long sheet of parer folded back and forth. This give's the reader the sense they are reading an authentic Chinese document. The photos, drawings, sketches, and Chinese writing inside only heighten this impression. It's also a facinating study in how the film was structured. You can see where Disney added to the story or left things out, as well as see the the visual development of Mulan and her world as told by the pre-production art work.

I loved it so much that I bought another one after the first one died about 3 months after I bought it. Now 6 months later the same exact problem I had with the first one started again. The mouse goes offline for no reason. Shaking it side to side would sometimes make it come back but most of the times it was just dead. So I pried it open and took great pleasure in ripping it apart and taking my vengeance on the mouse. What pisses me off the most is that inside the mouse everything looks very high quality and for the amount of money that I paid for it, it should be. So my advice is to save your money and the heartache because you'll end up loving the mouse too much it will break your heart and your pocket book in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Microsoft's idea of a joke?","review":"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop, which only has one PS/2 port, and I'm using that for an external keyboard. So I needed a USB mouse, and figured that Microsoft's optical mouse would be a good choice. Wrong! Windows 98 had no trouble recognizing the hardware, and the software installed fine, but with the correct driver installed, the mouse's movement was totally erratic. Just to be clear, I already have a Logitech cordless optical mouse on my desktop PC, so this was not a question of getting used to an optical mouse. The Microsoft mouse simply refused to work properly, on all types of surfaces. After 20 minutes of trying very hard to adjust the speed and get the thing to go where I wanted it to go, I gave up. I should have paid attention to the reviewers here who warned about the poor quality of this product.

Oh well. My desk is wood grain and the mouse works poorly over the wood grain. I have no problems if I lay down a piece of paper but that defeats my purpose of eliminating the mouse pad. Also, I found (as many others have) that the mouse performance through the USB port is not as good as continuing to use the PS-2 port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunken Rat!","review":"I like the design, and it fits my hands real well and I won't deny that I bought this because it was Microsoft (and assumed better quality).But after 3 days of usage, I'm real diappointed by its performance. As noted in one of the previous reviews, the sampling rate is simply too slow - whenever I move it a tad faster, the pointer jerks and wobbles like it's high on E. I connect it via PS2, will try the USB port as soon as I can free up an additional slot. Hopefully, the drunken rat behaviour would sober up a bit with higher sampling rate on the USB.A tip that might be helpful: If you installed the software that came with this rat, turn the software pointer acceleration OFF. I find that the mouse tracks better. Just increase your pointer speed to compensate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I found this book about a month ago at a used book store for$5.00.

My brother and I grew up in this dysfunctional home and both of us carried the dysfunction into our own marriages and families.

Honestly this feels like the characters are back-sliding in development as compared to the series. Of all the characters Gaara seemed to be the only one that had continued to develop in the movie.

After using the replacement Trackball Optical for 6 weeks (after the return policy expired), I've given up. The ball movement has continuously deteriorated, to the point where if it's used for 30 minutes your thumb won't work.

At first it seemed fine once I got used to the ball itself (having changed from a typical mouse to the traking ball to try to save desk space and my wrist's health) but it took less than one evening of use for the ball to begin studdering, other's who have revieved this have written the same thing. Why sell a product whose primary function is faulty? You can't accurately do anything if the ball doesn't roll smoothly, and IT DOES NOT. ... DON'T BUY THIS. I like trackball concept and will look into other brands and designs. I'm just annoyed with microsoft for wasting my time with this.

It's so much more accurate than my old Microsoft trackball which i have been using for the past couple of years, not to mention the low price. Along with my trackball, I have also been using the explorer intellimouse from Microsoft, which I love. Although I was debating over to get this or the explorer trackball, the price certainly makes the decision an easy one. With the performance and reliability of Microsoft, everyone should have an Optical Trackball."},{"rating":"1","title":"the trackball binds","review":"When I recieved this mouse, by the look of it, it was exactly what I needed - it's size was bigger than in the pictures (about 6\\" long), which makes for a comfortable fit, and it had the 5 buttons that I'd gotten so used to on my Microsoft Intellemouse.As other people are saying, the one thing which kills this product is the trackball binds to the \\"rollers\\". Since this is an optical mouse, there aren't any moving parts, but the ball does glide on three stationary metal balls, and two stationary plastic retainers which keep the ball inside its socket.Depending on where your thumb is at any given moment, there might be pressure squeezing the ball down onto the plastic retainers. Since the ball and the retainers are made from plastic that's similar in density, they bind to one another - sometimes requiring quite a bit of force to unbind them.This being my first foray into trackballs, I figured that I'd return it, and get the wireless logitech that everyone's howling about. Shame :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse ever made.","review":"I purchased my trackball long ago--I remember it from 1999 but could be wrong. Used it a while, gave it up, resurrected it around 2001, put it back away, then brought it back out in 2004 and have never stopped using it since.These trackballs seem awkward and awful at first and become indispensable after a short time. No other trackball handles like this or has function such as this. The wheel/button and 4 buttons are brilliant. It's a great pity they don't make them any more. Luckily mine still works very well after cleaning every few days after grit and sweat clog the bearings. 10 years and perfect! It beats moving a mouse around the table. I have no carpal troubles either, possibly thanks to this device.MICROSOFT--MAKE IT AGAIN!! Just use the same old design, don't update, and crank them out. So many people love this trackball.

I went to a computer store today and got a Logitech Marble mouse. While shopping, I was able to test another Microsoft Trackball mouse and had worse results. The demo mouse ball was stuck hard. The choice of material for the ball and other material lends to the sticky motion. So sad since this could have been a fantastic mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action of the ball sticks on slower movements","review":"The trackball perfectly fits in my hand, but I found that the ball did not track properly when trying to move the pointer slowly. I recommend the Logitech Trackman Wheel instead of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless trackball","review":"This trackball is virtually useless. The ball's friction is so bad that it is impossible to control the cursor accurately and smoothly. Also, the software that came with the device did not enable the advertized features (using Windows XP). So, although the concept is good (the extra 2 buttons, for forward and back, are a great idea), the implementation is so bad that it defeats the utility. The Logitech trackball is orders of magnitude better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trackball doesn't track!","review":"I used the MS trackball optical for about a month. I just put it back in the box. My thumb hurts because the curser/pointer is moved only by your thumb. Even worse---the ball moves the pointer very sporatically. Sometimes, I'll roll the ball up or down and nothing happens. Save your money and buy a logitech \\"Marble Mouse\\" (I use it on my other computer). It cost about the same, doesn't hurt you hand, and actually moves the pointer where you want it to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and Clunky","review":"Bought this mouse and was very unhappy with it. Right out of the box, the trackball gets stuck more than 50% of the time. This got annoying after 2 days. I was also unhappy with how inaccurate it felt. I tinkered with the mouse control panel without any luck.I use my mouse for illustrations on the computer... so the thumb position for the trackball really doesn't work well unless you're double jointed.Even if you're not drawing anything, the fact that the trackball gets stuck so often makes basic window navigation aggravating.

If you do any precision work on your computer, or you need to move your mouse quickly from one side of the screen to a specific spot on the other side of the screen while playing a game (e.g. Age of Mythology), I'd suggest keeping your old mouse.I would have given it a lower rating, but the trackball does work. And, with the software installed, you can easily program the two extra buttons and the wheel to fit your needs. At first, I just plugged the darn thing in and it worked! Couldn't use the extra buttons, but everything else worked fine.

Having recently gotten my office up and running I have all of my machines in operation currently. For this reason I was looking to get more of this particular mouse, because it is the single best pointing device I have owned across the several dozen computers that I have owned in the last few years. I bought the on I have now in 2002 for about $35.00 at wal-mart. To ask for over three huundred is highway robbery. I would advise that everyone stop buying from these yahoos until the get their heads back on right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for gaming","review":"I've used thumb-based trackballs for gaming for the last 15 years. Nothing beats how fast you can turn with a quick flip of your thumb. I used to have horrible problems with my shoulder when using mice. (I game ALOT) When my last Trackman Marble+ wore out I got this trackball. I was excited about the programmable buttons and the fact that there were five of them. I thought it would be a nice addition to my Nostromo speedpad. This was not the case. As pretty much all the other users here have stated... It gums up quickly, and the ball skips out of its socket. This is because it does not have a retaining ring like the Logitechs do. It was comfortable, had all the right features, but when it came down to more than 30-40 min of use... it became worthless due to the socket problem. One little design change and Microsoft would have a winner here. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not smooth.","review":"Count me along with those that don't like this trackball. I made the switch from the conventional mouse when I started to notice my wrist aching. The thumb control seemed like a good idea.I like the ergonomics of this trackball. The buttons are well placed and the scroll wheel works great. But this device fails miserably in the most important area - the trackball itself. Quite simply, it is not smooth. The motion is jerky, making it difficult to get teh cursor on words when editing type. I do a lot of word processing and cut and paste throughout the day. This is a nightmare with this unit.Gunk quickly gets caught up inside the ball cradle, which must be cleaned daily. And I thought the opticals would be maintenance free. I am always taking out the ball and wiping it down to try to make it spin smoother. It works for a bit and then I am back to the jerky motion.My best advice, which I will follow from now on, it try it before you buy. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"New versions of this trackball are defective","review":"I've been using the item for years, but the new ones we've bought for work are obviously defective. The ball performance rapidly degrades, it appears everyone has them on sale. Microsoft should recall this product because of poor manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE! Do not buy it! Don't listen to others!","review":"What a piece of garbage. The ball sticks and binds and there are no solutions. I have tried various lubricants and filing down the plastic bumps that hold the ball in and other things...nothing works. Daily or hourly cleaning makes it manageable, but that is ridiculous, I cleaned my other mice monthly. This thing is just poorly designed. If you need any level of precision whatsoever, like being able to highlight a word or a paragraph or an entire page of text, this thing is too clumsy to get the job done. Screwed again by Microsoft. I should have known."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of what Microsoft does best","review":"Just as with it's software, Microsoft has copied someone else's design (in this case, Logitec's Trackman) only to create an inferior product. The construction and plastic are cheap and toy-like. Right out of the box, the ball movement feels sticky and makes an annoying scraping sound. Others have complained about it collecting gunk too quickly, but I frankkly wonder if some good greasy gunk might actually make it smoother. Total waste of money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to aim the pointer accuaretly.","review":"I'm taking this back pronto, because it fails miserably in its first task, making it easy to get the pointer on whatever it is you're trying to target. While the whole unit fits comfortably in the hand, matching curvature well, the task of rolling the ball is left to the thumb, which is not the easiest digit to move around. (Think about it, if you play a music instrument. All the real work and ornamentation is usually left to middle fingers and the pinky, and thumbs may only hold an instrument up. There's a REASON why the expression is \\"all thumbs.\\" Clumsiness is for the thumb.) Consequently, working with this item is a very slow and agonizing process. I find myself just getting the cursor into a field, and then clicking using the keyboard to right position. I enjoyed my Kensington Expert Mouse, and standard mice, far more than this. This is pure work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product fails to impress","review":"I bought the Optical trackball on the assumption that since it was a Microsoft product, then it would work well. I was wrong. I cannot understand how a company such as Microsoft can fail to properly conduct quality testing on a product intended for general use.The problem with this trackball is the ball. It stops and stutters which tranlates to very imprecise cursor movement. There needed to be a reason, so I removed the ball from the socket and inspected the inside. I found that the source of this stop and start movement was a tiny plastic bump which evidently was designed to hold the ball in place. However, it also prevents the ball from rolling smoothly which is the reason behind the stop and start affair.This design flaw is inexcusable on Microsoft's part. This is one of the worst examples of an inadequately tested product being released I have encountered. Shame on you Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from great","review":"First off, $425?! Even $125?!I bought one of these a while back to replace an old Logitech ps2 Trackman Marble (an excellent product) for around $30 from Staples. The first thing I noticed with it was that it didn't fit my hand. I don't mean it was too big or too small, I mean if I tried to operate the ball with my thumb, my fingers barely reached the buttons and if I had my fingers comfortably on the buttons, the ball was almost in my palm. Either Microsoft have completely redesigned it (though the pictures don't support this idea) or there are a lot of people with REALLY long fingers out there.I have to agree with others here that the Logitech is a much better product, far superior ergonomics, better looking and about a 95% cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Configuration, Bad Construction","review":"The construction of this trackball is just dismal. The buttons rattle like crazy as you click on them, and the ball itself sticks as you try to move it. (i.e. it has a lot of static friction) This seems to be caused by the fact that the ball just sits in a plastic socket, as opposed to other brands where the ball rests on hard \\"ruby\\" contacts (logitech) or on steel rollers (some of the kensingtons).Your thumb is not nearly as dexterous as your forefingers, since it has evolved primarly for clamping purposes. I would recommend any finger operated trackball over any thumb operated model.In any case, don't buy this unless you are going to rip it apart and use the parts for a project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Logitech's Trackman products","review":"I have a LOGITECH Trackman mouse. It works really well. The optical ball on the Logitech is very fluid. I purchased this Microsoft Trackball mouse due to the fact that it was on sale at Circuit City. The Microsoft Mouse is not any where near as fluid and comfortable as the Logitech. The action on the optical ball is annoying and is not as responsive and natural as the Logitech. Bottom line - if you are considering this, buy the Logitech instead. You will be much more happy! Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"How many years now?","review":"Let's see... If memory serves me right, I've had this same mouse for almost a decade, or at least the larger half. And in all that time, it has never once let me down.It is finally starting to show its' age though, as many years of constant use caused one of the rollers to fall out and get lost. However, even with that roller gone, the mouse is still going strong. The movement has become a bit more grindy, and sometimes the ball gets stuck in one direction or becomes hard to move at all, but nothing major.The fact that I'm considering paying two hundred and fifty dollars to replace this mouse because I'm so attached to it says quite a bit about its' quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Device","review":"I purchased this device in 2001 with my first laptop, and have had nothing but good things to say about it since. It fits my hand well, and the rugged construction has lasted me for over eight years. It took my cat chewing through the cord to prompt me to buy a new one, and I was thrilled to see it was still on the market.

It's been over three years since the first.Anyway, this boxset is the successor to the first season. Yu-gi-oh! is a very complicated and intimate series. It does have a good story line and well-thought out characters.But there are problems.Yu-gi-oh, season 2 sees the MOST talking than any other season. Some of it is important story talking (which there is a lot of in Season 4), but most is simply 'What a great move!\\", \\"You're finished,\\" and \\"I've never seen that card before!\\". Also, Yu-gi-oh has little to no character development, but the younger audiences don't much care for that.Overall, Season 2 gets four stars out of five, as it is a great and important season, though contains no character development and a ton of back-talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Printing","review":"I am a graduate student and purchased this book for a class. There is a complete page missing in the 3rd printing of this book and the publishers have inserted a loose copy of this page which can be easily lost. This is not a small errata but a complete page.I called the publishing company to ask about the shoddy craftsmanship and they said that all the 2008 3rd printing had that problem. This seems totally unreasonable for a book costing almost $100 retail price.Apparently the 1st and 2nd printing do not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Awful, and Ghastly","review":"I honestly don't know how people can listen to these club mixes. The original tunes by Frankie Goes To Hollywood are great songs, classics, they reach some amazing heights on their first album and EP's. I collected everything possible by them, and think they were an amazing band (where you have to count Trevor Horn as part of the band). But these are what I call \\"latter day remixes\\", which is essentially putting jungle beats and techno beats to the songs, and it is really just ghastly.It isn't really Frankie at all, but it uses their songs. When you already have a great dance song like Relax, adding the incredibly fake sounding techno drum beats to it, speeding it up, it isn't even danceable anymore, it completely loses its appeal. I suppose if you are into the techno groove, this might be for you, but if you are a regular classic Frankie fan, then the Club Mixes are not just no good, they are a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdate and ugly","review":"for being a book on graphic design, it is not very pretty, infact it is terribly hard to read some of the fonts. it was published in 1996... think about how much technology has changed. while i'm sure you can apply some of the 'theories' put forth in this book to modern situations, i'm sure there are much better, current books that will be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"....

Rhino's claim of \\"re-mastering\\" is laughable though, these DVD's have the same quality picture as a VHS cassette.

There aren't many. What is there is pretty good, but there should have been more. More!The sound. There are some spots where they've added unnecessary sound effects. It's a minor thing, but it can get distracting and annoying.But all that is very little to complain about when you can finally relive some of your favorite old episodes, without the shakey grainyness of worn out old VCR tapes.... often with commercials or such.

Its funny to watch the animation go from high quality anime' and suddenly turn into scooby doo quality.An amazing buy if you were a fan of the show but if your just curious dont bother. It would have been nicer to have seen better menus but i will take what i can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show, bad quality control","review":"I used to love this show as a kid and, now that I have kids of my own, I had to buy this set. Overall, it's still a good show. The poor quality control (transformers colored wrong, wrong voices, transforming in reverse, etc) can get a little tedious at times, as can the bumpers (why were these not removed?). Still, if you were a Transformers fan, and are willing to part with a decend chunk of money, I'd recommend getting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was a little leery buying this collection. Several of the shows I watched as a kid haven't held up for me as an adult. I was plesently surprised by the Trasformers and have become a fan all over again thanks to this set. While the stories are a bit simplistic, the dialoge and jokes are still entertaining today. It was great getting to watch the series all over again, and it didn't seem as dumbed down as many cartoons today feel. If you were a fan as a kid, I recommend it highly, and it just may create a fan of any kids you have as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cartoon of All Time","review":"I remember the Saturday mornings when I was a child, there was nothing I looked forward to more than seeing this show, and now I am overjoyed at seeing it make a comeback after all of these years.

I have preordered a couple sets, one for me and one for my brother, and can only hope that Rhino will release the other seasons, and maybe if they have enough success from this might release other cartoons such as GI Joe in a similar format.

Screwed over would be closer to the truth...","review":"When you remaster something it's generally a good idea to watch your finished product (heck, you might even want to compare it with the original- what a novel idea). Rhino really [messed] the Transformers episodes up.I was so excited to watch Heavy Metal War (HMW) (one of my favorite episodes)... I popped in my DVD and sat back in elated expectation. It took me a few minutes to notice something was wrong. Then it became obvious. I pulled out my old tapped TV episodes and sure enough, HMW was just fine.When Prime throws the boulder Megatron disappears- but not in the DVD. Nope, after he vanishes, why he's still there. And the rock lands on him, but he's okay...Rhino should offer an apology and should remaster the remasterings and allow a trade in for people who bought the first set. Oh well, live and learn.The color is better, though, and the collector case looks nice on my shelf. That's something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Remastered. Rhino Butchered this Season","review":"i only gave this DVD 1 star, in order to pull down its 4.5 star rating. Rhino did a horrible job remastering this season.

I really hope RHINO will also think of finishing the Inhumanoids they started and release the last 4 episodes of the series on 1 DVD.

Would like more than anything to own this collection, but I know better. It's just a DVD version of their VHS Transformers videos with no digital enhancing whatsoever. Yeah it may have extras on it, but it's not worth it if it's not remastered. Rhino please stop ripping us off and put out a decent DVD. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!\\"","review":"Rhino has finally come through with a proper DVD release of one of the greatest cartoons of all time, The Transformers. Here you have the first 16 episodes on three discs, plus a forth disc of extras. The discs come packaged in a terrific looking silver case. Unfortunately, getting the discs OUT of said case is quite a challenge...to say the least. But once you do, you will be blown away by the excellent picture and sound quality of these digitally-restored episodes. The colors are rich and vibrant; the dialogue and background music crystal clear; the many laser shots and explosions ROCK! The extras are exceptional as well - especially the clips from the Japanese version of the show. This set is definitely a MUST BUY for any animation fan. ...So, Rhino, when will Season 2 be available? ...And how about G.I. Joe? ...He-Man?? ...ThunderCats???..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird","review":"I was quite amazed with this set until I actually started watching some of the episodes. I have every episode on tape and I can't understand for the life of me why the sound (and the picture in some cases) is better on VHS versions.

Does every one come with rumble and starscream or are there different ones?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest toy line ever.","review":"I have to take this time to express my gratitude to Rhino Entertainment. Before they got hold of the Transformers episodes, I had to rely on my old tapes of scattered episodes and the old \\"rent from an obscure video store and copy\\" method. I am what would be commonly called a Transformers fanatic. I have over 350 Transformers, from the first series that debuted in 1984 through the current RID incarnation. The originals will, however, always hold a certain magic. To combine the Transformers, what I feel is the greatest toy line ever, and DVD, which is the best thing to happen to animation in a long time, is a move without parallel. I count the days till this DVD (with all it's fantastic extras) is in my eager, collecting hands.

Although I enjoy her books for the most part, I find that many of her historical novels have stilted dialogue and that she tries too hard to add humor.

The only thing that keeps it from being a 5-star is that about half-way through the novel, the dialogue does become a little wooden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It was my first and probably last Catherine Coulter book. I was disgusted with the \\"love\\" scenes since there was very little LOVE or any other tender emotion in them.

So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.

Most of these songs I've already acquired through other means, and the new remix was just bad. Looking forward to the new album release in September for a little redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Overall, pretty good. I am a fan of the more folksy IG songs and think that \\"Let Me Go Easy\\" is one of their best as is the live version of \\"Gone Again\\" available only on iTunes as far as I can tell. The remake of \\"Uncle Johns Band\\" is also great as is the live version of Elton John/Bernie Taupin's \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.\\" The rest of the album is just so-so, and has some truly bad songs - i.e. \\"Shed Your Skin\\" remix - but what album doesn't have a few duds. Definately worth buying and IG fans won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An important addendum for Deadheads","review":"The above reviews reveal as much about Indigo Girls' fans, as they do about this CD. I.G. listeners tend to be comparatively sophisticated, educated consumers, more than a tad apart from the mainstream, and therefore not easily fooled by the music industry's usual manipulative tricks. However, we did buy the CD at a concert (had to have a souvenir)... at any rate, I have an important addition to the valid warnings and criticisms preceding: this is one of the most interesting versions of the Greatful Dead's \\"Uncle John's Band\\" ever recorded. On the one hand, you can get it on \\"Deadicated\\" the tribute CD, which is one of the better tribute compilations, but still not the kind of CD where you're going to like every single cut, so you might just want to snatch up \\"rarities,\\" if just for the UJB cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Suprises from the Girls","review":"Although some of the songs on this Rarities CD have been released before, or at least heard by me before. I always love a new girls CD. I love track 3! It's been in my CD player for weeks now and I am not tired of it yet. I highly recommend this CD if you are a TRUE Indigo Girls Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most beautiful vocal Jazz album I've ever heard","review":"This album has captured me from the moment I first put it on - and after hundreds of listening sessions it still grabs hold and won't let go. The interplay of Mr. Murphy and Frank Chastenier especially is simply otherwordly. And Mr. Br?nners warm tone fits the whole set perfectly, as does the smooth violin accompaniment. An absolute must-have for music lovers of every genre.Buy this album (Don't buy it used! Support the artists!). You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Time, Mark","review":"So sad. I've been a Mark Murphy fan since the early 60's.Except in the past years he's gone way too far over the top in his improvisations for my taste. But now he's off key and warbly. And it can't be excused for improv. There are many fine Mark Murphy albums, but this is surely not one of them. I miss the old Mark. Nice photos at his website, though. I was lucky enough to talk to him at a cabaret performance and he is friendly, nice and funny. I'll continue to upgrade my old Mark Murphy vinyl to CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on 'My One and Only Love,' this album reeks.","review":"I heard this song on the radio, listening with disbelief as the singer warbled and slid around every high note and managed to be slightly flat on all the others. Though my first reaction was horror, I quickly dissolved into shrieks of laughter with every long, off-key croon; the singer has no special talent other than the ability to shift between five keys in one long note. It's good for a laugh, but if you like music, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginner Programmers ONLY!","review":"The Game Programming Gems books are fat and full of good ideas. Unfortunately, these ideas are only really useful to beginning programmers; anyone who has programmed seriously for more than two years will know 90% of the material in the book series.The remaining 10% of the book is remarkably good, with innovative ideas on how to approach problems. But Charles River Media decided to lengthen the book with such trivialities as how to use the C++ Standard Library and using Direct3D. Most of the material in the GPG series is covered better, and in more depth in other books which don't have the word \\"game\\" in their title."},{"rating":"1","title":"GP3 does not worth the money","review":"I pre-order this book before release.

Some of the recipes are excellent, but others just don't taste good. I am an avid cook, and have had to improvise a number of times when the finished recipe was completed because the appetizer was close to tasteless (example: the dipping sauce for the Rockin Rubens as well as the Rockin Ruben breadsticks themselves; Dab a Crab was dab-a-boring).I have found that I use Cocktail Food now more for inspiration than to follow the actual recipes.

Only the season 1 boxset has the fourth extras-disc. Rhino messed with season 1, errors, errors errors...I recommend you to import the season 1 deluxe edition from amazon uk, if your dvd player is pal and region 2 compatible. The picture material featured on the uk boxset is unedited and errorless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Price & Quality","review":"A lot of features for price. An excellent entry-level projector. Its WXGA resolution eliminates screendoor effect and so makes it a great projector for watching DVD, TV as well as games. Watching HDTV on it is a treat to eyes. It's not the ideal -but somewhat livable- projector for movies because of horrendous black levels and low shadow details. Specified lamp life of 3000 hours is bull. Expect to change lamp after every 750 hours or less. It gets too dim after that. It's not at all rare to have to send the projectors to Sony for repairs (which takes 4-6 weeks at a time). If you can live with these irritants, it's a great projector for cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful recording for latin jazz enthusiasts or musicians","review":"This overlooked beauty of a recording will not let you down after dozens of listenings. Roger Beaujolais gets strong praise from American jazz writers and vibes players and deserves it all. He's lyrical, adventurous, and accomplished. Pete Eckford will give anybody their money's worth trying to play along on congas. Everybody shines on this CD. I don't know why everyone insists on filing \\"Talk...\\" in acid jazz. Like me, the band prefers latin jazz as a label. They could keep recording many more works in this style as far as I'm concerned, but we're ten years out since the last one already. Brothers and sisters of jazz, this one is a killer. Get it before you can't find it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Icon Gone Silly","review":"About 25 minutes into this drearly little film, a gang of British thugs send a little boy into the path of an oncoming truck after trying to steal his cell phone. The \\"gang\\" was a white kid, a West Indian kid, and a black kid--the precise makeup of a Politically Correct street gang in a Marvel Comic book circa 1975.That about sums up what happened to this once masterful, but now sadly uninteresting American icon of a director. Next Eastwood is remaking A Star Is Born with Beyonce. Once daring, Eastwood now makes the boring, safe choices guaranteed to garner applause from the Hollywood establishment, and yawns from the public.Please Clint, retire now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearafter","review":"Not a move I would recommend seeing. Strange and weird and not a very good performance by either actors.If you like Matt Damon I would recommend \\"I Bought a Zoo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I'm not going to go into the plot or the story, as that has been done enough here already, and you can look in other places online for that as well. I will say that this is an amazing movie, both the story and cinematography. Clint Eastwood is an excellent director/producer, and with Steven Spielberg and Matt Damon thrown into the mix you have a recipe for success. I don't understand the disappointment so many felt towards this movie, but I highly recommend it. It's not a fast paced thriller or action packed movie, but a serious movie meant to be taken and slowly digested. Do yourself a favor and watch it. I watched the streaming version while I wait for the Bluray to arrive. I can't wait for it to get here so I can watch it in High Def again and see what I missed the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful treatment of a universal mystery","review":"This IS NOT a movie for those adrenaline junkies, sure to think an Eastwood flick starring Damon, is some kind of \\"Action Thriller\\"!It is, however, a very thoughtful and peaceful story. I suspect you have to be over the mental age of 13 or 14 to actually understand this kind of movie.And while at times, it did seem to be a little difficult to follow... it was worth the effort.Damon did a masterful job developing his character's struggle with this strange talant.Ms. France's scene, in the restaurant, when her cad of a lover admits his feckless betrayal, was so real I was both moved and shamed at the same time. Moved in sympathy for her character... shamed because I recognized my own human weaknesses from experience.I would indeed reccomend this film to persons I think might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead to boredom","review":"The movie could have been much more but instead became a boring. I waited to see if the plot would escalate but it plateaued early and made it difficult to keep interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, lack of details","review":"The actors were fine, however the story was rather shallow. I feel they needed to go deeper into psychic phenomenon and not just portray someone who spews out generalities, which is such a stereotype. It made the tone of the movie unbelievable and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Talky Movie About Life After Death","review":"First, I admire Clint Eastwood's films. They are made with talent and are usually interesting. Second, he dropped the ball here. Yes, he did a professional job with fine actors but they were in the service of a boring, slow drunk hippo of a movie. It starts out well enough with a good SFX sections and then gets slower and slower and slower. There are 3 stories (at least) going on here. One of the stories could easily have been left out to shorten this film so we could get to the sappy ending. I wonder if Clint made this film so he could get a studio-paid trip to Europe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very crisp blu-ray strictly for those that believe in ghosts - Boo!","review":"Eastwood's tabloid take on the afterlife is just as trite as his sports movie about soccer; his bright, white-light scenario is Weekly World News material. It is not hard to see executive producer Spielberg's schmaltzy wishful thinking pervading this childish excursion into the phenomenon of psychic silliness. There is an audience pleasing tsunami sequence at the outset; but all hope of ongoing insights are flushed away just like the tropical tourist trap. It might work as a fantasy for adolescents, although they are unlikely to tolerate anything this slow, let alone subtitled sequences. Uh oh, gotta go, Mommy is yelling at me from heaven for giving this a bad review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many subtitles!","review":"Why would an American film contain so many subtitles?

The previews made it out to be this rip-roaring action film, combined with the paranormal and emotionally moving scenes of people coming to understand the meaning and purpose of life and to not fear death. What I got was a bunch of random nonsense that didnt amount to anything in the end. This movie was boring as hell. It was painful in the way it kept going on and on and going NO WHERE.

So much bad about this movie do not wast your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Crystal Ball","review":"Clint Eastwood has to his credit a long list of great accomplishments. This film, which he produced and directed, is not one of them. Oh, it has its moments. The opening depiction of a tsunami striking a populous shore and a few other touching scenes scattered throughout the film do little to balance what is a confusing jumble of disparate story lines. An egocentric French journalist, twin boys trying to care for a substance-abusing mother, and a young woman haunted by her abusive father stumble along toward a nonsensical conclusion.Matt Damon plays a genuine medium (oxymoron?) who is trying to break away from a lucrative career as a psychic consultant because of the pain it all causes. Damon is not convincing. Perhaps he should have worn some exotic headdress. A long beard that glows in the dark? A high-tech crystal ball?I predict.....a big disappointment that will take up about two hours of your future if you watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"US","review":"What a bore fest.

It's a movie that needed a better script and in my version at least - the english subtitles stopped working in the french scenes early on and refused to turn back on - so those scenes were so much \\"gibberish\\" to me.Save your money - read a good book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I'm really into the hearafter, life after death stuff, ghost hunter's etc. I loved this movie, it was perfect for someone like me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I normally enjoy Matt Damon movies and was looking forward to this one. I can be a very forgiving viewer but this movie was boring. It had the excitement level of watching grass grow. There were a few interesting scenes, in the beginning, but after that - it was plain boring. I gave it two stars instead of one because Matt Damon tried his best but could not save this sinking ship of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT CERTAINLY DID DRAG","review":"A tale that focuses on life and death with no fulfilling answers as the end but I think that was intentional. Overall, this film was introspective but it dragged too much. I was able to handle about 40 minutes before turning it off. WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011; MY GRADE: C to C plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor E","review":"For those who fear death, this movie offers an intelligent account of the possibility of an afterlife. It's neither religious nor preachy. Three separate stories are held together by the main character, a psychic sensitively portrayed by Matt Damon. The movie attempts to provide insight into what occurs after death, possible communications with the deceased, and a search for a departed loved one. Hereafter ends with an uplifting sense of life and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study in spirituality","review":"Very realistic study into spirituality. The acting by Matt Damon and C��cile De France is excellent. The script appears to move slowly and deliberatly towards the intertwining lives of three people who transition towards a greater understanding of themselves and life. This is a thinking persons movie. Not for action junkies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal to watch","review":"I rarely write reviews for movies, but I have to say, this one was just brutal to watch. I stayed tough and made it through to the end in hopes that somehow Eastwood could find a way to tie it all together, unfortunately, that was not the case. Other than the rare glimpse of the \\"hereafter\\", there was no substance to the movie. The character development was poor. I couldn't even find a way to like any of the three people this movie revolved around. This is not a spiritual movie, it is not a feel good movie, I'm not even sure what you would call it, but confusing and disappointing.I wish I didn't make the dvd purchase. I'll never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, often untelligible junk","review":"What a disappointment! I don't care who starred or who directed, this film isunbelievably shallow. AND I wonder what other reviewers expected from Eastwoodand Damon, in order to praise it so highly? Like life, I know it's all aboutour individual expectations, no?The separate story lines, one in the UK, in France, and, of course, in the US are just too messy. By that I mean that it's too hard to follow each, when they're not carefully integrated into the whole. For example, do you enjoy endless dialog in French with subtitles? I do not. Or Brits with mumbled and often too heavily accented lines? Nope.And all of that is before the downright silly, but primary relationship, if you can call it that, between the hero and his dopey brother. Substance, Mr. Eastwood, substance is called for and usually you deliver that. Are you just too tired to make the effort anymore? I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I figured by the ratings it may not be that good but it looked interesting, but turned out to be just disapointing. It had a great beginning, interesting middle and disapointing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Watch!","review":"THis was an absolutely terrible movie! The plot goes no where and the ending is completely unsatisying. I am a huge Matt Damon fan and this movie does not do him justice and he is barely in it in the first place!. A third of the movie is in French so I hope you are ready to read subtitles. The concept of the movie is great but they do not do enough with it. The best story line is definitely the small boy's. THis movie was absolutely not what I was expecting it to be and I would not suggest it to anyone.

As another reviewer accurately pointed out, the opening sequence is amazing and draws you in, making you believe that this is going to be one amazing movie. But it rapidly goes downhill from there. Slow moving scenes with mumbling, boring dialogue that never really reaches a valid point. Short scenes where Matt Damon's character is whining because he doesn't want to be a psychic anymore. And perhaps one of the most disappointing scenes is where for nearly 20 minutes there is nothing but French dialogue between two principle players in the movie and NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I was like, what the heck?? Really? The movie ran snail slow and never reached the level of excitement that the opening sequence does. I wanted to love this movie.

As for psychics and mediums, even we are becoming mainstream, as more and more people are on a spiritual quest and seeking our services. \\"The New York Times\\" bestseller list has had many \\"hereafter-type books\\" represented there, and so, I felt that this movie seemed already dated before it even hit the theaters.Cindi Sansone-Braff, author of \\"Grant Me a Higher Love\\"Grant Me a Higher Love: How to Go from the Relationship from Hell to One that's Heaven Sent by Scaling The Ladder of Love"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Me To Death","review":"I was stunned to learn after the fact that this ponderous, insipid, clunky, disjointed, irrelevant, ill-conceived, and tepid film was directed by Clint Eastwood.

As soon as you see the three main characters, Matt Damon, the French journalist, the British child, you know that at the end of the film they will meet and something 'meaningful' will happen.

Why do I keep watching movies directed by Eastwood? They are almost always much too long and a complete bore. This film, like many of his others, was supposed to have a hidden meaning, but I didn't get anything out of it. Eastwood is a legend and at this point can pretty much make anything he wants. Hereafter, even managed to get a decent cast, but the film itself is pure crap. Seriously, if anyone but a world renowned, Academy Award winning Director decided to make something like this, they wouldn't get in the studio gate. Oh yes, it is really that bad.

Then there's the woman who briefly experienced death while being overtakened and nearly drowned by a Tsunami. She then has visions of the little girl she tried to save. A boy, who loses his twin brother in a horrible accident, and has a drug addicted mom.The movie starts out great as the three stories are introduced. I was hooked and looking forward to all the possible angles, theories that could have been analyzed about death, dying, and our ultimate stop. It didn't happen. It was a story about how death affects three people and the emotions that go along with losing someone, even if that someone is you.Very slow paced, and the ending left alot to be desired. The last 5 minutes turned into a romantic love story, with our guy Matt practically drooling while he fantasizes like a school boy about kissing and holding a girls hand.I expected a little more from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie starts off well, and then peters out after the first 30 minutes or so.

It's simple, God sacrificed his only Son, Jesus, so that we may have eternal life in Heaven, knowing no pain, no tears, eternal joy and peace beyond comprehension.

This is not a version issue as I made a lot of effort to get older versions of WebObjects pre-Xcode to compile with as well as trying with Xcode.

While providing some useful information, its novel-like length and structure make it incredibly impractical for the average college bound high-school senior/junior. Most of use would rather NOT stay up until 4 AM reading a college guide when life and school are priorities. It seems incredible that anyone credits this book with getting them a \\"scholarship\\" to Harvard, which does NOT offer \\"scholarships\\", but only need based financial aid. In an case, a college guide should be concise and insightful, not long-winded and arrogant. To spend more time laboring through a guide than on writing or sleeping seems frivolous and senseless.

In fact, of the half dozen books I read \\"Get Into Any College\\" was the only one that provided me with actual advice and strategies that I could use to create a knock-out application. The book reads like a manual and when I was done I felt as if I had learned a whole new skill. The book reads so well that I finished the whole thing (over 250 pages) in one day - of course I didn't sleep until 4am! \\"Get Into Any College\\" was my constant companion for most of this year.

The characters all appeared very real and I felt I could relate to their situations. But then again another twist; the plot took a full right turn and captured my imagination!!!! This film has everything; comedy, tragedy, love, drama, and more comedy!!! And not to mention, the brutal fighting scenes'!! The animation is classic, and no fan should miss out on the rising era of anime! Please, I beg whomever is even CONSIDERING this film, to buy, rent, or even borrow it!!!

I didn't feel like reading the subtitles to this movie so I put on the English dub and the sound is terrible. I know the audio source is over 10 years old, but come on the Japanese audio (I don't think neither were remastered) which is about 16-17 years old sounds way better. I had to switch over to that and read it with subtitles to watch it. I mean, when they went through all the trouble to remaster the video (which looks amazing on DVD) why didn't they go through the trouble of remastering BOTH tracks. If you watch this on the new CE DVD please watch it in Japanese because I watched it with my new Home Theater DVD system and the sound was terrible for the English dub! The movie is really good though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with good satirical qualities","review":"This anime is very comedic and is often viewed as a satire of all anime up to that time. However, it does have a plot of its own.The main setting is an all-girls school where the heroine, A-ko, and her best friend, C-ko, is confronted by B-ko who wishes to break up their friendship and take C-ko for herself. Each main character has her own unique qualities, A-ko is super strong, B-ko is rich and a brilliant engineer, and C-ko is extremely cute (through the eyes of the characters). B-ko uses all her resources and goes to extreme measures to try and achieve her goal. This provides for some great action and comedic scenes. Meanwhile, there's another unknown menace that threatens them all.... Definitely, a great movie to watch.This is the first movie in the series of six Project A-ko movies.

As a study on statebuilding it is too narrow, but as a study of the development of bureaucratic autonomy it is a major achievement. In my opinion, Carpenter also shortchanges the antebellum era. It is an excellent compliment to Skowronek's book \\"Building a New American State.\\" For a different perspective on the 19th centutry American state, see Jensen's book \\"Patriots, Settlers, and the Origins of American Social Policy\\" and \\"Shaped by War and Trade\\" edited by Katznelson and Shefter."},{"rating":"2","title":"bureaucratic autonomy - before the New Deal!","review":"Carpenter's study of bureaucratic autonomy is innovative in a few respects. First, he takes seriously intra-country differences in bureaucratic autonomy. As he shows, some agencies are more autonomous than others. Second, he looks at agency autonomy before the New Deal revolution, removing that as an intervening variable. Finally, the book uses historical narratives of the Postal Office, USDA, and Interior. At times, the book contains too much a history of the agencies and not enough theory-building. However, the book does produce interesting theoretical arguments about how bureaucracies gain autonomy in large part through outside interest-groups and networks. Definitely worth reading for scholars of bureaucracies."},{"rating":"2","title":"booklet??","review":"while the item is pretty much what was described, i would have to question the validity of the word \\"booklet\\"(that was included).. id settle for \\"pamphlet\\".. the \\"booklet\\" is all of seven pages, with only two and a quarter of them in english.. when you do the math, the \\"booklet\\" actually can be pared down to one full college ruled page.. if you read espanol and francais im sure the whole thing gets kind of redundant.."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRUSTRATING!","review":"I purchased the Arnold Grummer medium kit a while back and have been using it without complication.

It is also the best book on training dogs and horses that I have ever read. Montague Stevens was an Englishman who took up ranching in New Mexico in the late 1800's. Among the problems he faced in learning the business of cattle and sheep ranching were Apaches, rustlers, and stock-killing grizzlies. While this book provides a colorful and highly literate description of ranch life on the western frontier, it focuses primarily on the methods he developed for hunting marauding bears. These, in turn, depended largely on his genius in training dogs and horses. For me, the most fascinating aspect of this book is the gentle creativity and the shrewd experimental approach he applied in working with his animals. His experiences are described with clarity, modesty, and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of the sun","review":"A must see DVD showing us what we must do to save the Bee's and with so little time before we lose them .

The map is set up in the format of a board game you must explore. In doing so you can lose the game simply because the board decides to take and scatter your characters dividing them and making it hard to complete simple tasks like killing enemies. Your weapons and gear take damage in this game and over time break. Broken gear is worthless, you also have Hps and life points and if you take to much damage to your life points from taking to much damage from your Hps you end up with game over. This game lacked a lot of polish. And I honestly have to say its darn close to unplayable.

There's no animations worth dealing with, everything is 2 dimensional flat cutout images in a pseudo 3-dimensional world. Exploration is boring. Interaction is boring.

The graphics were horrible, mainly due to your characters looking more like comic strip characters with ridiculous text bubbles coming out of their mouths. When your character left a town, you weren' t actually walking--it was more like moving a chess piece across a gameboard. The combat system was just horrible, you have to spin a wheel to execute an action. The whole game looked like something they had just thrown together. I think they were aiming to do something that would be different, but it just ended up as a mess.

I think Square was on a really low budget when they did this game. If not then they are playing a very bad joke. I wasted money. Other than that the game was great!

I had to return it, since such gaps made it useless :( Considering the rest of the reviews I decided not to order a replacement...."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute","review":"This pan bakes up a great 3D bear cake that will wow everyone. One thing that one should know before purchasing though is that it requires a pound cake, other cakes won't bake properly and will leak out. Also the clips that put the two pans together for baking are very easy to misplace and the pan can't be used without them so make sure to keep them in a safe place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent how much on this piece of junk?","review":"Putting it together before doing anything you can see this doesn't even come close to lining up. Spent over an hour with some tools trying to straighten this thing out. It wouldn't pass the water test. Tried a cake that ended up in a total disaster. tried to seal it up with duct tape and use it as a giant jello mold, even with all my work and duct tape, clasps... still leaked. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Shower Cake","review":"I purchased the stand-up cuddly bear pan set for a baby shower I was hosting. The pan came in exactly on time but the outside clips to keep the pans together was missing. I emailed the seller and they quickly sphipped out the clips and the instructions that were missing. The bear came out perfect and all my guest enjoyed the moist but unquie bear cake. The pans were not discolored or damaged so the bear came out the mold perfectly. IF you are hosting a party for a birthday,baby shower, etc... this is a good product to use. The instructions are clearly and helpful and you do not have to be a professional to create a magical eye-catching cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic novelty idea","review":"Love the concept. Great for kids, my grandsons went nuts. Had a problem with leaking when only using clamping mechanisms supplied from the manufacturer. Picked up 4 small c clamps at HD and solved the problem. Filled it with water first and saw spots it leaked from and clamped with c clamps and it stopped. Fun to decorate ,and even better the look on little childrens faces. All in all very happy. Thank you to the designer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I agree with all the negative things other reviewers have said about this book...interesting premise not executed well. A bunch of women who have nothing better to do but hang out in a knitting shop all day? Please. A white man who discovers that his grandfather was black and now must deal with the fact that he is an \\"African American\\"? Again, please. And the baby in question, of course, is fantastically beautiful with \\"golden\\" eyelids, etc. The people are one-dimensional and there are too many plot lines that are left hanging at the end. A really good novel about this topic would have been a treat. This is a throwaway beach read at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved \\"Family Tree\\"","review":"Other reviews have done a great job of outlining the plot of this book so I won't recreate the wheel here.

Good premise, but I had a hard time liking any of the characers. The knitting theme throughout the book drove me crazy. I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus two stars","review":"This book was written with a truly unlikely premise. It's about families who are shocked that there's mixed blood among them. Gimme a break, humans haven't been around for thousands of years without mating with \\"other\\" paramours. People next door, people in another tribe etc.And for you religious nuts, we're all related anyway, aren't we? The Adam and Eve story comes to mind. So then, why the shock, nobody can be pure anything.I was surprised to see some good reviews for this book. Surely you jest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I bought this book after reading a good book review on it. What a disappointment. The characters go on and on about the shock of the baby's skin colour, they argue, they moan, and it doesn't stop. I suspected what the outcome would be and didn't want to read thru the whole boring book, so I scanned the pages until I found my suspicions were right. Then i tossed it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Implausable","review":"Even when I read fiction, I expect authenticity. It is totally implausable that 3 generations away, the source of a great granddaughter's brown skin was her biracial great grandfather. According to the premise of this romance, no one along this line ever married a person of color either. I even asked a genetic counselor who concurred with me that the premise is implausable.Otherwise, I agree with Dera's review of the problems with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rip Off","review":"Normally I love this author's novels but, quite frankly and in my opinion, this book is a rip off of a short story written by Kate Chopin in 1892 called \\"Desiree's Baby.\\" I am amazed that the author did not have to give some sort of credit to this author by saying, \\"Inspired by the work of Kate Chopin,\\" or some such. I personally will not be reading any more of Ms. Delinsky's books. I have no problem with an author telling someone's story in a different way, but please give credit where credit is due. Would have given zero stars, but not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I'm only midway into this book but felt compelled to see what others thought of this book. So far it's a disappointment but unlike others who were disappointed in Hugh, I'm more disappointed in Dana who is just not to be believed. Actually everyone in this novel is \\"unreal.\\" The idea of this book was interesting but Delinsky just does not pull it off. The characters as someone else mentioned are not to be believed at all and yes, why are the characters who have the means to get answers dragging their feet and being so wishy washy. I'm a fan of Delinsky but she fails miserably in this effort. Nothing is believable about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Read","review":"Read it at the beach and leave it there for the next chickadee who's had too many mojitos.It's thin (to be kind), predictable, feel good and been done.When the half African American child chose two dolls for herself, one dark skinned and the other light skinned I wondered if I wasn't reading a book meant for my 9 year old daughter.Ugh.

A wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"The premise was interesting enough but the execution was painful. The characters were so contrived and the dialog so pedantic and heavy handed and false. \\"Did you know that it can be Difficult To Be Black Or Otherwise Different In the United States?\\" I mean, the level of condescension was unbearable. How stupid can these people be? Also, what's with the characters who suddenly decide they are \\"African American\\" because one ancestor was black and then they have to rethink their whole identity. They grew up feeling white, they don't have one single issue that African Americans have to cope with. Face it, just about every single one of us grows up with various ethnicities in our history, whether we know it or not, and it doesn't change your identity, it's part of who you are. I hated these people.Also, like another reviewer, the knitting plot bugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't particularly like this book","review":"I found the basic idea of this story as interesting and I was excited to read a story that dealt with racial equality, etc. However, I felt that the story was a little too far fetched and so many of the situations did not seem realistic or plausible at all. Also, during the short span of time that this story took place pretty much every character was having a pretty significant life revelation, discovery, exposure, etc. etc. I know the author was just trying to bring home the point of the book, but for me it was so extreme that it was not believable at all. There seemed to be many long dialogue passages between the different characters that said the same things over and over again. I wasn't really excited about this book, and the characters just did not grab me. I did appreciate the main idea of racial equality and thought about the things the characters said. This is my first book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engrossing and easy to lose interest","review":"This really sounded like a good concept. Interesting plot, etc. However, I found this book to be borderline boring and hard to follow. In fact, I found it to be very self indulgent and the characters unsympathetic.I could hardly finish the book and found myself wanting to skip ahead pages to get this finished. Despite the fact that they had a newborn, this was ALL they could talk about and seemed like they had discussions with random people. Seemed unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family tree","review":"What happened to the lady and the senator.

Even though I found the story predictable, with the solution to the mystery being telegraphed early on, I didn't mind. This book isn't really about the mystery of how a white couple's daughter came by her visibly black features, but is about the journey of self-awareness. Characters 40 years old through 80 learn that they still don't really know themselves very well and have to come to terms with who they want to be and whether their public image and their private lives can be reconciled. Not a knitter, I really enjoyed all the scenes about knitting and the community surrounding the yarn store. I could easily envision that peacefull setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Ugh. I very rarely give up on a book but I gave up on this one. Just couldn't get into it. The premise sounded interesting but something about the author's style of writing really turned me off.

It got such good reviews that I had to read it, but I did not like it one bit. The main premise of the story didn't grab me at all. It seemed that everyone was making a mountain out of a molehill in the worst way. Plus, there were all sorts of distracting subplots that I didn't care about, which was lucky since most of them were unresolved at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really contrived","review":"This novel was like a Danielle Steele novel without the \\"romance.\\" Completely contrived plot line, characters who don't seem real, and a complete disconnect between the premise and the follow through.

This proves that Hendrix was a master who could take any song and make it his own, and adapt to be one of the greatest blues guitarists. One of my favorites is \\"born under a bad sign\\" which makes the Cream cover seem pale and tame. The bass kills you on that song, and hendrix just keep pulling out a solo in a stunning opener. His acoustic work on here is wonderful also; every track is insanely good and this should be considered one of Hendrix's best works, on par with his Are You Experienced album. This might be one of the best introductions to Hendrix's music, but if you are already a fan of blues or Hendrix or rock in general, you absolutely need this cd. I promise you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate electric blues album","review":"This is the best electic blues album I have ever heard, bar none. Jimi Hendrix was a true master of the art of guitar. He could do (and DID) just about anything with a guitar. This is some of his best work of all time. He takes the classic blues from artists like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters and others and transforms them into screaming, voodoo tributes to the original artists. I really liked the inclusion of the alternate version of \\"Red House,\\" as well as the acoustic \\"Hear My Train A Comin'.\\" But the best songs by far are \\"Mannish Boy,\\" where he fuses the Muddy Waters and Bo Diddly, and \\"I Had a Woman,\\" a sloooow, rolling blues that expands as it progresses. If you're a Hendrix fan, you need this album. If you're a blues fan, you need this album. It takes the blues and rock, for that matter, to a whole new level of greatness and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legend will still remain through the years !","review":"Hendrix appears once more showing why he is the Electric Guitar Godfather .

HE WANTED TO BE a soul / psychedelic / fusion guitarist, and you can respect that right ALL CAPS BLUES BROTHERS.\\"Manish Boy\\" is the hit of this album in MHO; as well as \\"Bleeding Heart\\" & the\\" Red House Electric Church\\" are far above anything that was being played in the late sixties.

My first real experience with Hendrix was from a tribute album, \\"Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix.\\" That showed me there is a lot more to Jimi's music than the acid rock and Woodstock performance that he is most well-known for. After that I figured I should hear some of his original stuff. He was a student of the guitar and could do it all -- rock, R&B;, funk and as I learned on this album, blues.

First, there's almost no way to carry three bikes on this rack without incurring damage to the bike frames or spokes. Once could possibly partially diassemble the bikes and accomodate three bikes but that sort of defeats the purpose. Secondly, this is not a stable unit. Loaded with three bikes the rack tends to pull away from the vehicle (Toyota SUV) even with the straps conced tightly enough to flex the rack's frame. Even more troubling is the fact that the arms of the rack are secured with only two cheap spring-loaded pins which hold them into a plastic housing. On our rack, it was possible with just a little effort to jiggle and torque the arms enough to dislodge the pins. On the road that would result in the loss of all the bikes.

Well made, solid, easy to set up and holds three bikes very securely. The no-sway mechanism works well (this seems to be the primary upgrade from the earlier 962 version which now retails for about $105 without discount) and keeps the bikes at a slight angle away from the car.

Luckily it didn't cause an accident and hurt someone.All that the rack has is two rubber straps that stretch over a post with wings, to secure the bike. Nothing to lock the bike down to the rack with. I even double checked that the rubber straps were fully secured over the winged posts, before leaving and read the instructions several times before ever setting it up.

If the bars the bikes hang on were about two inches closer together and were totally straight instead of having a bend in the last couple of inches where they go into the trunk mount part; maybe three would fit.

Emerald's kids are precocious, her friends are strange, her ex-husband is a pain, and the ghosts are not what they seem. Quirky characters, witty dialogue, and the magical details of Emerald's world make this debut novel a fast, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I love mystery, fantasy, and a bit of romance. Honestly, this book was only so-so in all 3 categories."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is OK","review":"This is an OK book, but not great. Galenorn stumbles in a lot of places throughout the book and it's never clear if this is supposed to be a murder mystery or a supernatural thriller. It's too simple to be a combination of both.I give Galenorn credit for her descriptions of the supernatural elements, though -- they are quite good.I think the main problem I have with the book is that the main character is not a sympathetic one, and is actually someone who I'd never want to interact with. She has a lot of personality flaws that make it hard to care about her or what happens to her.Sex scenes in books are hard to write well. Galenorn's attempts at these come off as unintentionally funny.It did keep my interest to the end of the book -- I did want to find out how it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost of a Chance","review":"I really enjoy all of Ms. Galenorn's books. I will buy them as fast as they come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Working Single Mom Running a Successful Business, Solving Murders, and Battling Ghoulies","review":"As if a main character named Emerald O'Brien isn't intriguing enough. Emerald O'Brien is a working single mom who's getting used to raising her two children without much support from their father (her ex-husband). She owns her own tea shop where she also provides warm meals and tarot readings. She also sees dead people, but she's okay with that. Until one night a woman appears to tell her that she'd been murdered by her husband. The next morning, Emerald reads that a local romance novelist died of natural causes. Emerald enlists the help of her children, her best friends, and a new (and of course single man) friend. They battle live murderers, paranormal ghoulies, and a busy Christmas shopping season in an entertaining and sometimes downright scary read. Think twice before reading this one in bed! A fun read. I'm looking forward to more Chintz & China Mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I'm a big fan of paranormal romances, but this one fell flat. The main character, Emerald O'Brien, a single mother who owns a tea room and can see ghosts, SOUNDS interesting, but isn't. Her character is just too much single-Mom dealing with kids with growing pains, and not enough mystery-solving psychic. The other characters aren't well-developed or fully-formed, and I couldn't develop any real interest -- or belief -- in any of them. The Plot didn't hold my interest either. I think the author tried to do too many things in one story and, as a result, didn't do any of them very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series!","review":"First in the Emerald O'Brian Chintz n China Mysteries and it grabs you from the beginning. If you like a little fright with your mystery, you will love this series. This book got me hooked and made me crave more Emerald adventures and a nice hot cup of tea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't get your hopes up","review":"As others mentioned, I was really looking forward to reading this series, being interested in mystery, metaphysical & romance. The characters and mystery-solving angles were very poorly developed, despite potential for them to be. I have never read a book where so much time was wasted continually talking about junk food and espresso consumption. Is the author that obsessed with food? I already bought \\"Witchling,\\" so I'll hope it is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Paranormal Than Mystery","review":"Not a bad story, but readers should know up front that this is a book primarily about the paranormal, and not a cozy mystery as the name of the book might lead one to believe.Also, while the author obviously wants to make points about how a divorced mother needs to approach dating, the misgivings that the protagonist has toward her suitor -- while furthering the understanding that the protagonist is a woman who always puts her kids first -- has the (I hope) unintended side effect of making the reader feel like the suitor is creepy. In a book where good and evil are so clearly delineated, it's unfortunate that one of the main characters comes off as ominous and naggingly \\"there's something not right about this guy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Very much pleased with the condition my book came in. It's intreaguing, witty and is worth more than one read. I recommend it for anyone, you won't be wasting your time reading this book, unlike the recievers of those unfortunate letters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading THIS is a waste of time","review":"Robin Cooper thinks he is funnier than he is. Essentially a one-idea book, he fills page after page with puerile letters to recipients with names and/or addresses which are particularly silly or peculiarly British (or both). The greatest humour lies in the fact that these addresses are real, rather than in anything that his limited wit is able to request of the addressee. Added to that is the fact that none of the replies really transcends the bland, or takes the game up to him, and the whole thing is really a rather onerous affair.To call this adolescent is being grossly unfair to adolescents: read 2 pages in the bookshop and put it back on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see","review":"I don't see a step down transformer, does it includes one?

I am just using it to write this review.I bought this about 2 weeks ago and I am taking it back today. from the first time I installed it I had nothing but problems. When I first installed it the computer would not go to windows. Instead my monitor would show an \\"Out of range\\" message. After I finally got the card working it would randomly kick the driver out and refer back to 16 color 640X480. SO I would have to restart the computer. I finally found that if I remove the cover of my computer it would work a little better but still not the way it should. This card came highly recomended by the place I bould it from, a place I have been dealing with for a few years now because I am a tech. I can't say whether all of the ATI Radeon 9600s are garbage but the one I got is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I've only owned this card for 6 months and the cooling fan just started making a loud annoying noise. That's unacceptable for a $190 card! ATI won't send me a new fan so I guess they expect me to pay $10 to send it back in for repair, leaving me with no card and costing me more than just buying a new fan. I think I'll just unplug the fan, let the card burn up and then never buy ATI products again.The other ongoing problem is that if I just have my flat screen connected with the DVI connector, after win2k boots, my screen is blank. If I hook the DVI **AND** the VGA connectors to my flat screen, it works fine and stays in digital mode--pretty annoying. It also won't properly display 1600x1200 on the VGA port--my other systems work fine at 1600x1200."},{"rating":"1","title":"card","review":"Bought the card and it ran fine for a few weeks, then suddenly without any changes to hardware/software the card started to freeze in 3D games. I thought it was a driver issue so i tried ALL drivers... Still no stable system now i've finally been able to get my system stable enough for 3D games. With Fast Write of, AGP set to 4x. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CARD TO ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was very excited to find this book--there isn't much literature out there for adult children of sex addicts. But this book came up very short of my expectations. I did not enjoy the religious undertones of the book, nor was it well-written (there are even typos and grammatical errors throughout). I could not relate to a lot of what the author was saying. I grew up with a sex addict but am not one myself and the healing I was looking for was just not in this book. I've found more help by reading things about addiction and trauma in general--it's too bad it does not include sex addiction more than it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Little Mermaid Doll","review":"I purchased this doll for my granddaughter who is age 5. The doll isbeautiful, looks like Ariel in the movie and on TV, and my granddaughter is very pleased with it. I got it for her as a birthday present, and she was thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"Called to get a refund and they simply blew us off.Didn't want to work with us at all.DO NOT RECOMMEND.Had they just talked to us a little more or even provided a suggestion we would have been very willing to work them. Now we have this product sitting in the file collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing and unusual history, right in our backyards","review":"Many people don't realize that there were nearly 500 POW camps in the USA during WWII. One of them was in Northern, NH and had a special group of POW's housed there. It's been many years since I first read this book but I was able to see Allen speak again tonite about his book and was reminded of how touching and special the relationships were that formed between the prison guards and the prisoners. This is an unusual are rarely told part of history and worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACTUAL RETAIL PRICE IS NOT CORRECT","review":"THIS GUITAR DOES NOT RETAIL AT $1,200.00 and should be corrected by the vendor. False information to lead buyers into thinking they are getting a great offer. You can pick this guitar up for the price listed at many different shops, either online or local. DO NOT PURCHASE based off of the listed retail price! This guitar is good for beginner/intermediate players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generous Digital Art Over The Pages","review":"Length:: 0:46 MinsThis book had no storyboards, very little character designs but lots of digitally painted concept art. These digitally painted frames focus heavily on the sets and environment.These panels were generously applied across the pages, sometimes taking 1 to 2 pages for just one panel, making them very satisfying to look at. They were intended to bring readers into the magical world.Art captions explained the concept behind them, and the story it was intended to tell. Text copy were kept to a minimum and the typography used was huge, perhaps, for the children audience.This movie was made with motion capture but nothing in the book that showed you visually how it was done. There were few 3D renders or life sculptures, strangely.Overall, the book was a visual delight.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book & Movie","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer, because I thought this book was very worthwhile and mine was in fine shape. The pictures are breathtaking and it gives you a nice insight into how they made the movie. It's meant to be a coffee table book and one that you look at from time to time. It certainly will put you in the Christmas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent this book back to Amazon for a refund","review":"Although the content of the book is breathtaking, the book itself is very poorly constructed. When I received my copy, the glue keeping the spine together was clearly visible and beginning to separate. The continuity necessary when a single picture took both the left and right pages was completely destroyed by this pernicious affect. In the book I received from Amazon I could see the threads that held the pages to the binding. This is not an isolated incident. The copies sold at Barnes and Noble exhibited the same level of cheap construction.What is wrong with the publisher of this book? Are they completely insane? This is a great story with beautiful Christmas imagery that is more deserving than the debasement it suffered at the hands of an administrator trying to save a buck. Shame on you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of the Polar Express","review":"A must-have for all Polar Express fans! Beautiful artwork, including preliminary ideas that were made while making the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"Picking up and opening this book is a clolossal waste of time. Buying it is a colossal waste of money. If I had been able to rate this with a zero instead of one star, I would have. This book is nothing more than an advertisement for a movie. I do not know how anyone could possibly be interested in \\"artwork\\" from a computer-generated movie. Sad and pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good novel","review":"I never expected the events that happened in this book to actually have occurred. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend this book for those that are living a life they know they should not be living and are in dire need of a transformation. In other words, a reality check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Quality","review":"Although I am not a music officianado, I like good music.

I anxiously took my new CD home to listen and flashback to the days of my favorite music, R& B and Funk. When the first sound came from my Sony system I felt the disappointment. I skipped to songs three, then four. No improvement. The CD had the type of sound you hear on computer downloadeds. It was high pitched and ear offensive.
