This also is the spawning point of many good actors, Teri Garr (Tootsie) and Harrison Ford (The Fugitive).

Bore, bore, bore, bore, bore.Now, I'm not saying I wanted to see contrived, endless chases and explosions a la Michael Bay; but it would have been nice if SOMETHING would have happened...you know...every once and a while.If I had seen it in a theatre I probably would have walked out.

That's what I endured when I saw The Conversation. The sight of Gene Hackman being the most boring introvert on the planet is depressing enough that I couldn't care to fathom the reasons for him tearing apart his apartment at the end of the picture. Although there was a nice twist involved near the end of The Conversation, the picture remains a dud. It's basically about nothing, and the story revolves around a simple conversation that probably leads to something sinister, only that I stopped caring at midway of the picture. I was dying for the finish but ended up being bored stiff. As a thought, The Conversation should have been re-titled as The Sloppy Private Operator Who Can't Manage Himself. In so many words, The Conversation is an unbelievably boring, overrated junk that will appeal to the audience who thinks Dark City is the lord of film noir pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"what a a boring movie. not well acted by anyone. it was one of those dark movies, everything just solemn. why hackman, why did you make this crazy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the 70's ? \\"You Betcha\\"","review":"I sat down with Sarah yesterday to revisit (for like the 9th time) one of my favorite films from the decade that was the glorious 70's .

A smallish picture set in Coppola's stomping grounds of San Francisco, this film features a superior group of character actors, notably Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Robert Duvall, Alan Garfield (who's always great), Frederick Forrest, and a bit part by Harrison Ford.This film came about at a time when the general public was somewhat under informed as to the widening use of surveillance techniques in non-government applications, and presents a dark portrait of a man with limited purview who knowingly stretches himself far beyond his own capability. This film asks a lot of questions, leaving many of the answers to your own interpretation or ponderance.I am not onto this film with the fervor or superlatives of many, but I do like it, and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Film","review":"I had never heard of this film until I saw a preview on AMC. I rented the DVD and watched it expecting some great story after reading all the reviews. All I got out of it was that Harry was a paranoid nutjob. The ending was good. Harry found out his own apartment was \\"bugged\\", ripped it all apart to find nothing, never realizing that it was \\"bugged\\" by the same device he called \\"junk\\" at the wire tapper convention! It was right in front of him!UPDATE **INTERESTING FACT!**While watching Hackman in \\"Enemy of the State\\", he is asked by Wil Smith how he got into the NSA spy business. His answer is that when he was a kid he tapped a phone and enjoyed listening to \\"conversations\\" and knowing that no one knew he was doing it. Coincidence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Conversation","review":"The ConversationI normally love Gene Hackman's acting, so I began this film with anticipation. Thankfully, it cost less than $5.00 - or I would have felt really cheated.I know others highly praise this film, but I found it painful from the start.

Very Slow!","review":"I tried watching this for about 45 minutes, and turned it off!Granted Hackman's character study is interesting, but the film was so slow... it's like one of those Kubrick films where the camera focuses on the subject for a whole 10-15 minutes.Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.If you want to watch this, you gotta be be verrrry patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hackman; annoying movie","review":"Sorry, but with all due deference to those who liked this film, I found it slow, boring, and at times irritating (the constant replaying of the same tape segment, over and over, and over; Alan Garfield going on much too long with his annoying pestering of Hackman). The plot wasn't all that big a deal, nor was the contrived \\"twist\\" ending a terribly big surprise.Nonetheless, Hackman is terrific (as always) and the thing is well written and acted. Coppola is clearly using the film as a device to make a statement about privacy, but neither as entertainment nor suspense did it work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"Being a Coppola & Hackman fan, I was very interested in seeing this movie after reading all the excellent reviews listed above, and for me it was quite a disappointment. It's slow and dull, and annoyingly repetitious (the same sound clip plays over and over). And changes in technology over the last 25 years make the movie's look and feel seem unpleasantly out of date. I'd recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for a good film noir. Just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!!!!","review":"Man I thought this would be an interesting movie because of Francis Ford Coppola, was I wrong.

Gene Hackman's best-ever role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prequel to Enemy of the State","review":"Francis Ford Coppola made The Conversation between The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. This is a different kind of film: a character study that explores the morality of privacy, and for that reason it is as relevant today as when it came out just after Watergate.A great performance by Gene Hackman, presaging his character (at least the spirit of his character) in 1998's Enemy of the State. There's also an interesting early role for Harrison Ford. On the other hand, I didn't much like Cindy Williams or Frederic Forrest in it, but I suppose their characters are unlikable. Plus, what you hear them saying is the real focus anyway.Young or at least immature viewers probably won't enjoy this movie but that doesn't mean it's not still an undiscovered gem. Two commentaries, including one from Coppola, make this seven dollar DVD an easy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"He would kill us if he got the chance","review":"The conversation is one of the greatest movies ever made.Written,produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola[Director of the Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse now] andstars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul,a paranoid surveillanceexpert and a Great supporting cast.With the Beatiful piano music by David Shire and the photgrophyof Bill Buter watch this great masterpiece of 1970's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Overrated","review":"Maybe I just don't get it. The reading of all these positive reviews baffles me. Did I see the same movie everyone else did? The beginning of \\"The Conversation\\" showed so much promise. I liked it and was interested. That lasted only the first 15 minutes. After that I struggled to finish watching it. I watched the entire movie only to see if it got any better. It didn't. The person I watched it with fell asleep. I was bored almost the entire movie. If you base the movie solely on the way Gene Hackman played his character it was great. Gene Hackman did a great job portraying a very paranoid man. However, it is everything else in the movie that makes it not enjoyable. I was glad when it was finally over. I much rather watch \\"Enemy of the State\\". Now that's an exciting movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique masterpiece worthy of repeated viewings.","review":"This is a brilliant and engrossing mystery-suspense gem from writer-director Francis Ford Coppola (THE GODFATHER).

A superior little thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Character Study!","review":"Francis Ford Coppola's other 1974 classic (The Godfather Part II was the other classic). Great story of a moral man deteriorating at an immoral job. Gene Hackman gives a powerfully quiet performance that ranks among his best. The movie starts a little slow but then we begin to see how the character evolves and it becomes a fascinating journey. The last scene of Hackman tearing his appartment apart is among the most powerful scenes ever filmed. A great picture. Extras: spot the two 'American Graffiti' stars, and the two 'Godfather' stars. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting, confusing and annoying plot.","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Maryland. The movie was confusing, lacked suspense, and got very irritating. Gene Hackman was excellent, and so was John Cazale, but the other characters were very flawed and I can hardly remeber anything that happens with them. The plot was confusing. Why did the boss die instead of the two lovers? And what did \\"When The Red Red Robin Comes A Bop Bop Boppin' Along\\" have to do with this? Skip this one; it is too confusing and should be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice moments, nice scenes from back when","review":"There were a few things to like about this movie, the nerdy surveillance experts, the girls they pick up, somehow, at a surveillance convention, the tricks they play on each other as they try to figure out each other's methods, but the music was dreadful -- it was loudly overused to cue the watcher to feel apprehension or whatever emotion they wanted you to feel. Extremely annoying and loud at the end. The story itself is dull and the directing is also kind of obvious with sudden cuts to things meant to shock. It's dated in that respect. Modern movies do this much better. The main character, played well by Gene Hackman, is not that exciting and the filmmaker would have done better to accept that and let it be more low-key instead of trying to, literally, jazz it up with jazz and your basic Jaws-like theme. Very weird to try to watch a serious movie with that music!The Lives of Othersis the movie to watch instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bitter for my taste","review":"I love tahini and regularly use it in several recipes.

This album along with the very last one they did (House Of Music) was among the best they did together.The standout track was Anniversary without a doubt. Its one of those tracks that's as powerful today as it was in 1993 when it was made! Translation....it is timeless!The rest of the tracks range from okay (Tony, Toni, Tone) to good (My Ex-Girlfriend, Slow Wine) to excellent (If I Had No Loot) to timeless (Anniversary, Lay Your Head On My Pillow). In my view, no song on here is below a 3 star rating!Its also one of those albums I sincerely wished had an instrumental version because the music behind these songs is great too! I could bob my head to these pieces without the lyrics!Anyway, its a great piece of R & B to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drummers perspective","review":"Ugh drum machines! There may be a real drummer buried in there somewhere, then again maybe not. The time is too tight, horrible programmed drum breaks.

When Casablanca folded & was bought out by the Polygram family in 1980, KISS was bought out by Mercury Records, along with their catalog. In that case, Casablanca didn't own the rights any longer & all future albums were recorded & released by Mercury. I know this because I know 2 people who used to work for the company. Casablanca eventually became only an imprint by 1984 for Polygram, as it is now. As for Parliament, the same goes, only they stopped recording for Casablanca by 1980.

He has a deep and poetic lyrical style that is rare in popular music today. So when I saw his DVD of music videos, I was intrigued. Man was I let down. Maybe two or three of the videos are tolerable, most are bad and a few are outright terrible. I am pretty forgiving to low budget productions in most cases. Usually I can get passed the cheap sets and poor camera work on videos, if they are creative. But something about these videos' cheap production was just plain bad. If you like Nick Cave, stick to his audio collection and just pretend you never saw this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bad seeds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The bad seeds certainly! I liked Where The Wild Roses Grow, because the video is excellent. Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue are great in this one, but I figure that's just because I like Kylie and nothing else but Nick is good in this one! The only Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds video I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad seeds don't fall far from the tree","review":"Videos are, demonstrably, not a strong point for the Bad Seeds. Neither are they a point of interest for the band. If you are interested in inspired and objectively interesting videos, look elsewhere. However, if you like to watch Nick Cave dance around while Blixa Bargeld looks very pretty in the background, you've found your match. The commentary between the videos is entertaining and offers a glimpse into the minds of the otherwise taciturn Bad Seeds. This is a collection for the collectors, or the über-fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixed Bag...","review":"I love Nick Cave and his musical stylings and these videos are the best way to experience it beyond watching them live. Some of the videos here are better than others. Stagger Lee is great, campy fun, Red Right Hand is ominous and strangely creepy, while Henry Lee finds Cave and his former lover PJ Harvey giving themselves up to a one-take of visible passion and tension. Loverman (later covered by Metallica), is a loud hypnotic ride (literally) as the band gets filmed being put into a trance by a professional hypnotist.Other stand out videos include the behind the scenes road trip piece, Wanted Man, the live, I Had A Dream Joe and the beginning of the Mercy Seat shot in stark black and white. The rest are underbudgeted yet still worthy of a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pump","review":"I ordered the airbed from Amazon and it didn't come with an external inflate/deflate pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed Brummell","review":"This version of \\"Beau Brummel\\" is not from Warner Home Video (WHV) -- and it shows! It's from some outfit called Televista, whom I have not heard of. The keepcase design on the back is poor, with type very hard to read (colored type on a black background -- bad type color!, and a poor choice of typeface.)The print itself is lousy+. What is infuriating above all is that this silent film was projected through a sound aperature, which cuts off part of the top and lefthand sides of the frame (all of the inter-titles are off center, and the tops of most of the heads are partly cut off).I feel I spent way too much for this version, and I hope that WHV will come out with their own version. I suspect, considering the quality of this film, that it is a 16mm copy of a much-used 35mm print. It is hard to watch, with such low quality, and certainly no care was taken to put it on this DVD. Do not waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful print!","review":"My husband gave me this DVD for Christmas, and we both watched it last night. The acting is good, but, as other reviewers have commented, the print stinks! The quality is so poor that at times it was difficult to even distinguish between Mary Astor and another young actress.

Two complaints...1) it is leaking air, so if you pump it up at night to a hard bed, it is very soft or not sleepable by the am. 2) the area where it kinks up for a sitting up position is also troublesome when in flat position. There is a GAP there and you feel it when sleeping or should I say trying to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible terrible product","review":"..this is a worthless product.

This item suffers from significant problems. First, because of the way the bottom of the bed is constructed, there develops a large depressed area in the center of the bed making it very uncomfortable and unsightly. Second, the \\"back rest\\" portion of the bed has never folded completely flat so using the bed is again uncomfortable. And finally, after only three months the item is now leaking air making it worthless. I rate this $130 bed JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Bed Leakage","review":"Set up bed. Had trouble with the pillow part. It didn't go all the way down, suggested by the brochure.When we slept on the bed the first night, we kept losing air and the bed was slowly deflating. We checked for holes, and/or tears, found none. The air seemed to be seeping slowly from the valve. We inflated it every nite and by morning it was deflated again. Very uncomfortable, and frustrating, especially for my husband who slept on it. Since I have a back problem I slept on our 2 year old twin Aero bed which was like new.Don't know if I would trust another one! Fortunately we were in our new Condo not on a camping trip. Our bedroom set was delivered 4 days later so we got comfortable again.Got in touch with Wenzel and they told us to cut out the logo on the bed, and mail it back with an explanation as to what happened, and send a copy of the bill. We just did that and are waiting to hear from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed","review":"Due to the consruction of the top section, the edges of the bed stay firmly inflated, but the center portion does not and you \\"roll\\" to the center of the bed whether you want to or not. Also, this makes it difficult to climb out of the bed. The portion of the bed that you can raise is a good idea for someone who has just had surgery (which is why I ordered it), or for someone who likes to read in bed, but the manufacturer needs to work on the construction of the air chambers."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor choice","review":"I purchased this item for extra sleeping for guests coming in for Christmas.

Titan A.E. is a marville in its animation, storyline, and use of twists, turns, and humor. This is the kind of movie that makes you lean back in you seat and smile. There are some magical movies out there that give someone goosebumps. This is one of them. A spectacular adventure about a boy who gets seperated from his father as an alien species attacks the earth. The boy grows up but looses all pride in the human race. Tword the end of the movie he realizes why his father did what he had to do, and what he now has to do. You will not soon forget this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"A cool experiment, blending traditionally drawn animation w/ the latest & greatest CGI. Only problem is that the drawn stuff looks pretty bland in comparison at times. The CGI is incredible - maybe more believable than in other movies because one can accept a lot more, knowing that it's intended to be animated, rather than pose as reality. It's a fun & harmless (with some violence that may be tough for the youngest viewers - definitely PG13) story; nothing too complicated & easy to follow. The voices, on the whole, were adequate with the exception of Leguizamo, who's character & voice virtually made the show. Give it a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let yourself get into this Movie","review":"I've seen where people put this movie down a lot but let me tell you I really enjoyed it. If your one of those people who likes to sit back and pick apart a plot, then any movie is hard pressed to make you happy. If you let yourself be immersed in the universe this movie takes place in, you'll really enjoy it. I am a big fan of the post apocalypse genre and this movie is a refreshing new take on it. I'm not going to give you a synopsis of the movie but it is a good epic space opera worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Disney (more teen than kid)","review":"This show was great. The music was way good and so were the graphics. Lots bettter than Star Wars Episode 1. I think the moviemakers are starting to see and aim movies towards the teen audiences.

The storyline could have been tightened to avoid slow spots and predictability. Personalities could have been developed more.However, I am a nitpicky perfectionist and even if I made a cartoon myself, I probably still wouldn't be satisfied. The animation is great; there is some bare skin and a little violence (Earth blows up, a big roach gets zapped, and a weird alien gets chop-chopped), none of which really bothered me but might be inappropriate for younger kids. I liked Chicken Run better but enjoyed this 'toon as well. See it once, why not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth seeing","review":"A lot of the reviews here feature either glowing praise or acerbic criticism. I'm kind of in the middle. Titan AE was lovely eye candy, and the soundtrack is delicious. I liked the plot, but it definitely wasn't original. There are a few glaring science problems even with 'it's sci-fi' allowances.

This does a lot toward eliciting sympathy toward the characters. Each of the characters portrayed is important to the story; there are no extra characters carrying on slapstick while the story is played out.Our hero is a tinkerer frustrated by his job and position as outcast. An old friend of his father sets him on a course much like _Treasure Island_ in space. Finding humans like himself still exist, our hero vows to find the treasure which would save the human race from extinction. Throw in a race of aliens--who would like nothing better than to see humans extinct--and a sharp-witted love interest, and the story is a classic. For added interest, spice it up with fantastic, exotic scenes of other planets and cat and mouse scenes within mirror-like gargantuan crystals.This DVD is packed with a lot of entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like ''Star Wars''Only Totally Better!","review":"This Movie is the Best Sci/Fi Adventure I seen in years!It has more Action and more Adventure.I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have a sci-fi animation for adults","review":"Visually stunning and a story that takes you from one unique experience to another.

Sweeping space scenes simply immerse you in this well-crafted, dark universe. All this set to a really great soundtrack produced entirely for the movie. It's the animated space opera for which I've been waiting for a long time, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is hungry for a good story with an INCREDIBLE amount of duly impressive, hauntingly brilliant CGI work."},{"rating":"1","title":"animation good- story bad, bad","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the creators of Anastasia, where the background digital animation and characters seemed to fit better, but I was dissapointed in the effort (or lack thereof) in this movie. While many of the digital animated scenes are great, the somewhat crude character animation kept interrupting the great background work. The story itself VERY liberally \\"borrowed\\" from many other, better scifi films. The entire \\"orphaned boy saves everybody\\" has been done to death, starting with Star Wars, all the characters were stock cliches from other films, and the ending was taken right from Star Trek II- The Wrath of Khan. Anyone would be hard pressed to find any original ideas in this film, although there were moments where a good idea (even from someone else's movie) can come alive with the great digital animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit childish but still awesome","review":"I admit i did think John Leguizamo playing the voice of the turtle looking alien was a little bit disneyish but other than that the movie was cool. I thought Matt Damon,Drew Barrymore, and Nathan Lane were great in their roles. The storyline was very well done and the animation was very good. ... The story has it's originality. For Example, Aliens destroying the earth and a teen trying to save humanity. The Story and animation are very well done and the all star cast is great.

However, we picked up the video and really came to disagree with the mainstream reviewers. The animation is outstanding, the music is good and the storyline is compelling. Our 8 year-old son really got into the movie and it tapped into his general love of science fiction and adventure stories. It's a good movie to own or rent, and the language and images are suitable for the whole family, even smaller children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice animation , shame about the plot .","review":"I saw this a few weeks ago , and was extremely impressed by the animation . The soundtrack was standard punk-rock fare . But sweetness , the plot was so utterly lacking , predictable and formulaic that it almost became a parody of itself . There were alot of references to other films here as well . You'll have to spot them .Lurrrvely animation though - See this one just for the cg ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine movie the whole family can enjoy","review":"Titan AE is a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. It is an animated sci-fi film that features several sections that are set to contemporary rock music. The movie seems to move a little slowly at first but it has characters that you seem to grow attached to as the film progresses. While Titan AE has numerous effects, characters, and a story line that seem strangely reminiscent of other live action sci-fi flicks, it has enough original material to let it stand on its own. Parents with young children don't have to worry about language in this film, but at the same time the plot is interesting enough to keep the adults' attention as well. Its special effects are especially well done and the familiar voice talent does a great job. It's somber in some spots, very funny in others and even has a love interest. An all-around enjoyable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Heaven's Gate\\" of animation!","review":"It's hard to believe 20th Century Fox dished out 80 million dollars to make this movie (when they were stingy with a guaranteed blockbuster like X-Men). Anastasia was Disneyesque but only made a modest 60 or so million. I wish they would add to the DVD a videotaped pitch for this movie, it would probably be more entertaining than the movie itself. I always wondered how films like this get a green light. When was the last time an animated sci-fi film made money in the US that wasn't imported from Japan? If they wanted to attract teenagers, the film needed graphic sex and violence! Titan AE was a monumental bore with nothing new to offer that wasn't already used in \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Star Trek\\", or \\"Alien.\\" But the making of it may be something to see.

I just didn't see it being very \\"cool\\" at all. And contrary to what some people might think, I beleive that the CG in Blue Submarine #6 is better than this. It may not be as high quality but it is definitely blended better. Just how they integrated it was much nicer, In Titan AE, however, it seemed to have a real gritty feeling and it even looked like it had some slow down.........But whatever.

It was sacrilegious for them to mix the two together the way they did. I was actaully saying out loud, \\"either all CGI or none at all.\\" This was one of the factors that leads me to hate American (yes I am an American too) animation, the Japanese and Chinese do a much better job at it. I don't know which movie studio produced this movie, but if I had to guess I would say Disney... the movie was that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I loved everything about this movie. I wasn't sure at first, but after I saw it, I wasn't disappointed. Unlike most animated films, where everyone is very sappy. The characters had an edge to them. Cale felt abandoned by his father who promised he'd see him again. Akima wanted nothing more then have a home again. Korso drove himself hard to find Cale and keep him. It was a nice change of pace not to have singing in the middle of the movie, instead you have a great soundtrack. The animation was great. The aliens were different from what we have seen in other films. How many films have aliens with two knees and a bad attitude? I am a 22 year old woman who just fell in love with this movie. I don't think it's just for the little boys. You have so many strong character and you can only guesswork what they have lived through. I think Don Bluth did a great job. I can only say I was disappointed to hear they shut down the production of the video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This is a fun movie. The animation is pretty amazing. I only have two issues.First the hard rock video-like segments are embarassing to listen to. Not to mention pointless to the plot.Second, a sense of time is very much missing here; the entire plotline seems to take only day or two at most, but then there it seems like those would be an exceedingly busy couple of days. Personally, a comment or two along the lines of \\"Why did it take you a whole week to track me down and free me from these slave traders?\\" would have given me a better sense of pacing.However, these are minor complaints. I enthusiastically recommend getting your hands on a copy, especially cause you can find them really cheap; I saw a copy at Target for $6.99 last weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to traditional anime.","review":"I have to say that I am glad I rented this movie instead of buying it as I planned. Disney has nothing to worry about as far as competition goes. The storyline was well-defined but slow. Find the Titan, and what became of its creator, before the boy's enemies destroy it and him. Drew Barrymore had a few good lines, and quick-witted responses, but the people who did the voices would have been better served in a Disney remake of an old classic. Traditional anime is not afraid of nudity or violence, look what they show on Toonami on the Cartoon Network every afternoon.

It has little respect for its audience, as it clearly seems to aim squarely for the pre-teen age group. Everything about it seems to scream \\"MTV\\". The animation seemed cartoonish and very overstated, in typical American style. The movie seems to have originated from marketeers, interested in targeting a very specific demographic, rather than resulting from any particular inspiration or creative vision.I fear that the most unfortunate aspect of this film is that it will serve to reinforce the public's preconceptions about animation, which I beleive explains why Princess Mononoke did so poorly in the US, despite being a big blockbuster in Japan.I had low expectations for this movie, though not quite low enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"*barf hack puke*","review":"Never mentally fell asleep in a movie as quick as I did with this movie.

The special effects, while occasionally interesting, seem stilted and the animation seemed rather choppy at times. All the characters have a Disney look, even the aliens. Added to that you have an episodic script (which is what you get when more than twelve people work on a script) and some pretty stupid dialogue. Ultimately nothing can save it seeing that the effects will lack that big-screen dazzle.

Only problem is there are a few parts where the animation and the CG effects don't quite mesh. It's so obvious because the quality of the graphics for the most part are so outstanding that any dropoff in picture quality is going to stand out like a sore thumb. For the most part the movie moves along very quickly with some humorous if not somewhat forced dialog. Drew Barrymore is the poorest of the voice actors followed closely by Bill Pullman. Matt Damon is only adequate as the hero. The Characters that really shine are the supporting cast. John Leguizamo, as Gune, Janeane Garofalo, as Stith, and Nathan Lane as Preed, all deliver believable performances. Overall this is a really solid movie that I enjoyed enough to watch a number of times with my children. Especialy my son.

I needed the 98 version because 95 has poor USB support. My experience is that many applications run a magnitude slower under 98. There are also frequent freeze-ups of the system, sometimes I can't power down the system through Windoze (I have to unplug it), and sometimes the system refuses to recognize peripherals (depending on what software was being ran).

Unlike the Char-Broil Electric Patio Grill and the Masterbuilt Electric Grill, this Meco unit has proven you can indeed get a beautiful sear on an electric grill. The Masterbuilt would make a nice warming oven but not much more. The Char-Broil is clunky and awkward as you have to remove the lid and \\"hang\\" it by a little hook off the side of the grill. Not so the Meco. The lid flips up smoothly and you can also tilt the interior heating element to vary the amount of direct heat if you want to bake potatoes, for instance. My only criticism is that the temperature dial indicator is a tape decal. It would be much nicer if this was permanently imprinted on the unit. Otherwise, it borders on perfection. And, you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best electric grill for us yet","review":"We prefer an electric grill right outside of the house on our screened in deck over any other type grill for safety purposes.

In my opinion this \\"romance\\" is pretty tame, as there wasn't a lot of romance involved and maybe one steamy scene between the two main characters. **SPOILER** The scene in which Jocelyn and Garren finally sleep together is so glossed over, I had to go back and forth and reread because I wasn't even sure if they did have sex. It also irritated me how much Jocelyn was insecure about her body and how she had to workout all the time. I get it, she was overweight growing up and worked hard to slim down and is insecure, but the way it was written just did not endear her to me. The ending also felt very rushed.

Apparently he's handsome, but really, at the end of this novel, I didn't care. *yawn*The one positive was the unusual time travel method (heroine switches place with another woman), but if you're into time travel there are WAY BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE!

It starts off well enough, with another of Joan Wilder's romantic tales, and segues to real-life where Joan and Jack are taking the cruise they promised each other at the end of \\"Romancing the Stone\\". From there the tale is fairly predicatable, and there are some action shots that will make you groan (the scene with the jet fighter is a particular groaner), but there are enough highlights to make the effort worthwhile. Danny DeVitto is terrific in this film and provides some much-needed comic relief in just the right spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A prime example of Why Sequels Are a Bad Idea","review":"While I could pick at one or two points about \\"Romancing the Stone\\", there's no reason to; it was a positively delightful and enjoyable film in every respect. A real gem (no pun intended, of course).But \\"Jewel\\" had absolutely none of the charm of its predecessor. \\"Romancing...\\" ended exactly where it should have ended -- what a misguided thought it was to pick up the story after the \\"happily ever after\\" ending of the first film. Some stories just end where they're supposed to end; with Scarlett O'Hara losing Rhett; with Rick Blaine nobly giving up Ilsa for a greater good; with Atticus sitting up in Jem's bedroom while Jem sleeps. Sequels for any of these would be a travesty (sadly, it's happened anyway for a couple of them).

In the previous film, lightweight though it may be, there is no question that the chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner helps make it fun to watch. Not so here.

The sound quality when used as a regular phone is terrible and the speakerphone isn't that loud either (what can you expect from a tiny speaker).

I found it easy to configure and use. You can put 4 AAA batteries in the base station to keep it going through a power failure.

If the person you're talking to is speaking LOUDLY, then audio quality is acceptable, although there is some static. If the other person isn't loud, though, it requires a lot of concentration to listen to them.No doubt part of my problem is that I also have a wireless LAN, which shares the 2.4GHz frequency. If my laptop is on and communicating with the wireless LAN, the phone becomes unusable, even though the phone base station and the LAN base station are at opposite ends of the house *and* on different floors!I've been a long time fan of Motorola products, but this is one that I'm going to be returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Battery Life","review":"The phone is great except for the battery life.

I guess this is why they added the feature to transfer your call to another handset. Trust me, you will need it. I had never had a cordless phone that has such a short battery life.

Basically you could include or exclude the area code automatically which was a problem with my old phone. Big plus.Couple of issues that I didn't like are that the handset and the base don't really talk to each other. So if I check the caller id on the handset it still says I have a couple new calls on the base station. No biggie.The audio is fine. Not the best but its alright.For families it has the expandable capabilities and restricted phone books to a handset for privacy. Along with transferring calls and walkie-talkies. Nice.I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, lousy handset!","review":"The handset is no longer usable - the buttons simply don't connect any more - there doesn't seem to be any way to get a replacement handset! Still, I got two years out of my purchase which is long than some of the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"Great phone at first and then about a year later the buttons slowly started getting harder to press until they just no longer worked. I also had to replace the battery several times. I bought a replacement handset and that one went bad too. These phones are junk. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sleeper that will keep you awake","review":"A young man and his older brother get themselves cross-wise with the KKK during the years following the Civil War. This begins a long chase, an adventure to compare with Huck Finn, minus Mark Twain, that will keep you smiling and turning pages all the way down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, then to the Florida swamps. I think you'll love this one. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding our nests","review":"The Zookeeper is a remarkable gay novel - it is about a gay man who is a zookeeper, but it is also about our aging process and maturing in a complex,demanding world. The main character, Sam, moves from a self-suffering care-giver to one who takes care of himself and, consequently, is able to truly care for others. The catalyst of this movement is pain, as it is so often in our lives. But Sam grows through the pain and emerges more confident and well-rounded.The Zookeeper has a strong cast of supporting characters, all of whom are very well portrayed. I especially liked Laurel - Sam's best friend, who acts as a sounding board for him. Remarkably,she is a female friend, and not a fag hag - the kind of friend we all want and need.Kudos to Alex MacLennan for a thought-provoking and fun novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date","review":"I got this book not realizing it wasn't the latest version and ended up ordering the latest one after I received it.

Inexpensive, fairly easly to assemble, and with the proper amount of coal, is a great little workhorse. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great grill, but . . .","review":"This is my second Meco grill of this style, and I'm sure I'll replace it with another of the same kind when it wears out, but . . .--It was tedious and time consuming to assemble.--The grate that the coals go on is a problem. It's mesh embedded over a molded solid bottom, and I'm convinced that it doesn't allow enough air flow from under the coals to keep them as hot as I want them during the cooking. I'm going to either drill holes in the bottom or replace it with a simple wire grate of the kind I used on my previous Meco.--After a couple of uses, the paint on the basin is already peeling from the heat. Surely they could find a better heat-resistant paint.All that said, though, for a small, relatively simple grill, I get great results. The real key is the ability to raise and lower the cooking grid to three different positions. The two side tables are very handy, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, but poor hardware","review":"I like this grill. It has an adjustable grate and a removable ash pan. The down side is that the manufacturer decided that it would only furnish stove bolts and nuts for assembly. The hinges and \\"air-sliders\\" require acorn, or locking, nuts. I called the customer service number in the manual and was told that theydecided to eliminate the locking-style nuts, but assured me that they would send me the 13 nuts that I needed. That never happened, so I had to buy my own and ended up double-nutting the bolts that require movement. I'd have given 5 stars, because it is a real nice, value-priced grill, but the customer service/engineering fell short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice grill","review":"Right price for a charcoal grill. Took a couple of hours to put together. Wooden side shelves are nice but not sure if they will last. We will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Grill!!!","review":"Perfect for the money. It took me about an hour and a half to put together because I was trying to be very careful. I've hosted three bbqs since I got it and the paint is not starting to chip or bubble yet. In the bottom, the grate that holds the coals is removable so the next day, you can just lift the bottom grate out and dump the coals with no mess. Since the top grate adjusts up or down, it is perfect for every grilling technique from roasting jalapenos to searing flank steak. I also like to cook paella on mine. It adds such a smoky flavor. It is light and I was able to load it in the back of my car to take to a Southern Miss game. It looks so cute on my porch and no problems yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the bottom does not fall out","review":"I am very disappointed with this grill. After it taking forever to put together....I was impressed with the look BUT after I BBQ for the family for Easter the paint has started to peel off the bottom of the grill. I have never experienced this with any grills and I purchase a new grill every year. I would advise another brand name and staying away from the cheaply made Meco Series. If the bottom falls out I will be returning it because I paid way too much for this grill for it to look ugly after the first use. Very disappointed...especially during a Holiday"},{"rating":"2","title":"its all about the crazy videos...","review":"i was first introduced to hexstatics work in the mid 90's on the early MTV amp, and ive been looking for more ever since...if you like coldcut, youll love this CD. i would describe his work as low-key and technologically minded, with a heavy emphasis on well chosen samples. the cd-rom that comes with it is one of the main reasons i ordered this album...very cool, retro - roller-ball defenderage-electronics.... contains videos for every track on the cd, and some of them have a \\"interactive remix toys\\" which let you remix the videos themselves in a simple kind of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"These guys are simply amazing. Not only is the music absolutely top notch, but the videos on the second CD are nothing short of miraculous.'Ninja tune' does an absolute credit to the record label and, as a track, has got to vie with any of your back catalogue favorites. 'Robopop' is another one I'd pick out, but it almost seems silly to pick out individual tracks from a great album like this. My only gripe is with 'The Horn' since the initial laugh of the porn samples (which is a bit of a dance music cliché since most albums seem to have one) soon tires.The videos are probably the best in dance music, but that's just my opinion. Even if you'd disagree, the second CD isn't just some 'bonus disk' it's an integral part of the whole and well worth your time.I can't fit enough superlatives into this review so just go and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Since living in South Korea for the last 4 1/2 years, I found I understood the book a lot better than I would have before this but still found things that helped me understand the people better."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and Perfect for everydayday topics","review":"Even though these shows were made in the late 60's and early 70's it touches upon subjects that now a days people and other shows are afraid to even touch let alone mention.

And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I haven't seen it yet, since it hasn't been released.

There is no way to make episode 2 play when episode one is over unless you stop whatever you are doing to interact with the machine. From what I have been reading I understand there are some dvd players out there that may have a setting that can override this, but mine does not. It is just plain stupid and thoughtless that there is no menu option on this dvd that allows the whole disk to play without the user having to press buttons every 22 minutes. Can u imagine a CD that u had to press play on after every track? Disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This season was so damn funny!","review":"I love this season.

One of the best Annihilator songs right of the bat, but wait, it keeps going, Pastor of Disastor has to be one of the top 5 Annihilator songs of all time and Ultraparanoia, Awaken, Syn Kill 1 and The Box are all great. A Man Called Nothing really works well and it's definately a great song. I even dig Innocent Eyes, it's a great reflection of Jeff's honesty in his music.The album isn't perfect, the crappy City of Ice and Anything for Money really don't fit on this rather heavy album.Another Jeff solo project, but a definate improvement over King of the Kill.Definately add this to your collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good hsing-i book.","review":"For devout collectors this is a rare one, but it is not very descriptive on hsing-i.

I wanted to stop reading after part one because never before had I read such a perfect love story and I didn't want it to end. Despite the fact that several parts of the book were unrealistic, the emotions evoked by Debartolo were incredible. I went on an emotional rollercoaster throughout this book and I wouldn't have had it any other way. In a word, incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Kill A Good Book","review":"First, start with some cool characters, a fun setting, a great topic (who doesn't love rock stars??) Spice it up with an edgy romance. Toss in some reference to awesome music like Depeche Mode, the Cure, and Jeff Buckley. Then have your character do something completely unbelievable - for shock value, for plot enhancement, and not for truth of story. Congratulations! You have killed your book!Sorry, I couldn't look past the completely ridiculous plot twist that made absolutely no sense whatsoever in terms of character. Especially considering the themes of art and truth that ran throughout the book, this just couldn't be forgiven.The one good thing I can say is that if reading this book makes someone go buy a CD of one of the aforementioned artists, then I guess reading it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I LOVEDDDDDDDD this book!!!

I fell in love with this book the second i started reading it. If u love rock and roll or any type of music and know how it can have an effect on you, you will love this book.

It's a wonderful story with great performances by all involved. Being a technical geek on stuff like principal photography, I have to make note of the GORGEOUS cinematography. Priscilla was filmed in Arriscope and the anamorphic effect can be very extreme in some shots (example: shortly after they start their bus trip, they get out of said bus and gape at the road ahead of them. the camera raises above them and pans away revealing the degree of distortion on the sides of the frame - a terrific effect). THERE'S A PROBLEM THOUGH: It needs a SPECIAL EDITION!

As Three Drag Queens Hit the Road in Australia, to do a Show. On there way they face many hardships, and many trails, and make a friend along the way. If you want Laughter, Hot guys and Lots of Singing i suggest you See \\"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Altering and Delightful!","review":"Truly a film that will leave you with soaring spirits, and one of the best comedies of the 90's. Terrance Stamp gives perhaps the performance of this career as Felicia, the down-on-her-luck transexual drag queen, roped into a cross-Australia trek to put on a series of shows at a desert casino. The drag numbers are laughably bad but good humored, and the host of characters our heros (heroines?) encounter, not all of them friendly, make for a colorful and diverting romp. This is one film that makes you long to jump in the car for an adhoc road trip! Some of the less savory aspects of gay life (prejudice, violence) are touched on as well, giving the characters dimension as real people beyond their witty, sarcastic jibes. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always loved this movie","review":"I went to see this movie many times when it was at the theater, and I couldn't wait for it to release on DVD. I lost that copy in a move and went out and bought it again. It's hard to believe this movie was made on a shoe-string budget, and that they could get such an accomplished actor as Terence Stamp. Hugo Weaving, also a favorite of mine from the Matrix and Rings movies is hilarious. Guy Pierce is so believable in his role. The three combine for a hilarious and sometimes emotional rollercoaster ride through the australian outback. I recommend this for anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most realistic Bond with the most incredible car.","review":"One of my favorite Bond movies. Timothy Dalton does a fantastic job as Bond and is probably the closest to Ian Fleming's original characterization. The villains are somewhat underdeveloped, but the underlying Soviet-Afghan conflict helps construct a multifaceted plot. Russians allied with Bond, renegade Russians against Bond, Mudjaheddin (sorry I can't spell) fighting all the Russians, American arms dealers who are indifferent to Bond per say but are evading the CIA which is also allied with Bond. Not to mention that cellist who shows up, gets rescued in an unbelievable car chase with all the usual tanks, missiles, and lasers, and inevitably falls in love with Bond. A classic Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Dalton Outing","review":"My favorite bond in a fun movie. Heavy Euro and Middle Eastern scenes in fact none were set in America, which is a switch from the previous Bonds by Roger Moore. Good flck, although the villians are softer than previous and perhaps since. One of the vilians here appeared again in one of the later Bond movies with Pearce Brosnan. See if you can guess who!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine spectacle of adventure. TLDL is top-notch!","review":"Dalton is radiant in his debut as bond. One of the best in the series. A great pick up after its bland prdecessor, AVTAK. A good plot, a beautiful girl (Myam D'abo), and ,unfortunately, 2 annoyingly lackluster villians. Koskov is an immature snake-in-the-grass villian, and Baker is not the villianous type. Features the usual gadget goodies, and a thrilling cliff-hanger of a climax. The title song preformed by a-ha is great and my second favorite theme next to AVTAK. Dalton returns as Bond for the second and last time in the stone cold bomb Licencse To Kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but...","review":"The movie is really one of the best 007 adventures... I don't like this James Bond actor, because I think that he has not \\"this thing\\" that makes Bond invincible. Although he is a good actor and perfoms good throught this movie.

My brother bought this movie while I was logged in. The producers of these so called films have cranked out around 20 of these 2 hour pieces of crap. I suggest to annyone who has not been pleased with other 007 movies will not enjoy this one either. The plots are the same the only diferance between them is the scenery and actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fleming's Bond returns to the screen","review":"12 years of Roger Moore's version of James Bond had desensitized movie-goers to what James Bond really was by 1987. Bond is a hired killer employed by his government, a man with a larger-than-life job and an incredible amount of ingenuity that enabled him to stay alive in a job that pushed him to his emotional limit. This is the Bond that Ian Fleming created, and Timothy Dalton was the first actor to portray 007 that had the depth to play Bond the way Fleming designed him. For a fan of the books, this makes The Living Daylights one of the better Bond films. It features a relatively believable plot, some real romance, and some real tension and drama. And the prerequisite action and gadgets that are such a part of the films are still there. All in all, this is an extremely enjoyable thriller that takes Bond back to his roots, and reminds viewers that 007, while he is an exciting, dangerous, and gifted man, is still just a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at All","review":"The Bond series came briefly back to life with this film, the first to star Timothy Dalton. After years of that stick-legged mannequin Roger Moore, it was a revelation to see someone actually giving a performance as Bond. And there's a whiff of Ian Fleming in the beginning, before the plot goes off spinning in the usual directions (nice action climax, though). It's a pity Dalton didn't get a chance to grow into the role and use some humor; he showed that he had the stuff in \\"Flash Gordon\\" as the hero's Robin Hood-like ally. After this, the series died; whatever Pierce is doing, it ain't Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I liked this video much more than I thought I would. As someone who thinks 007 can only be Connery or Brosnan, I resisted Dalton and Moore until I had no choice. I'm still not crazy about Moore, but Dalton does a good job with the role even if he is somewhat more pedestrian than either Connery or Brosnan.Plus, I liked the story. It helped that they brought back the Aston Martin (complete with squeaky brakes). Even though Connery mentions a Bentley in Goldfinger, the Aston Martin is the original 007 ride. For reasons that are known only to the producers, they put Moore into an American Motors standard issue in TMWTGG (Did they think that because it had the same initials as Aston Martin, it was the same pedigree?), or a Lotus in FYEO.It also helped that Dalton's relationship with Maryam d'Abo actually developed over the course of the film making it more genuine.He may not be Connery or Brosnan, but you could do a lot worse (several times over) than this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad start for Dalton","review":"\\"The Living Daylights\\" is a disappointment for several reasons. The biggest reason is the surprisingly unengaging plot. The second reason is that Timothy Dalton doesn't seem comfortable playing James Bond. He's not a bad actor but instead of making his own interpretation of the character (like he did in the next movie, \\"Licence To Kill\\") he seems to be imitating Roger Moore. The reason is most likely that the script was written with Moore in mind. Lois Maxwell was replaced by Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny and she didn't seem right for the part at all.\\"The Living Daylights\\" was not a good start for Dalton. Luckily the series did improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dalton gives new life to the \\"Bond\\" character!","review":"Timothy Dalton has revitalized the \\"James Bond\\" character from the characature it had become in the hands of Roger Moore. Even more refreshing is the story treatment which departs from the agonizing string of self-parodies which were merely re-hashes of \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" This Bond is fresh, cool, cynical. We're treated to new locales; new gimmicks; and exciting new stunts. And, by the time we get to the Russian airbase in Afganistan, you'll discover something that's been missing from Bond films for a long time. A Plot! Yes, there really is a reason why James is dragging that beautiful girl (not to mention her cello) half-way around the globe. And, it's believeable! Although this is the first Bond film not based even loosely on an Ian Fleming novel, it will thrill \\"The Living Daylights\\" out of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Best Bond","review":"Dalton is the third best Bond IMO (Connery & Craig coming first). This one movie is better than the entire Roger Moore run. It's much closer to the books & Ian Fleming's original vision. The downside - it is slow moving & unnecessarily sprawling. The movie runs 2 hours 11 minutes - it could have been a tight 1 hour 45 minutes, IMO.Small quibble. Good script, great cast, excellent score, fun action. With a more mature tone than the Moore series. Recommended, especially if you loved Casino Royale."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS BETTER THAN THE BEST!!!!","review":"The Living Daylights is by far, the best James Bond movie. It's all here, from the awesome car chase to the border of Austria, the Bond girl with attitude, and a lean, mean James Bond. Timothy Dalton was DEFINITELY the right man to pick to replace the aging Roger Moore. And the title song by a-ha blows the others away. If you haven't seen it.......................... WATCH IT NOW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has trouble","review":"I liked this film mainly for two reasons. They are the stunts and Dalton's performance. Everything else is poor. Myram D'Abo is dull and very boring, Kuscov and Whitaker are spirited but not at all menacing, there is about no action, the script is very thin, the plot is very confusing, the settings are not exotic, and John Barry's score is his worst. The gadgets are okay, yet many other OO7 filmshave much better gadgets. If you want my to see some good OO7 films, check out From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, The Spy who Loved Me, GoldenEye, and A View To a Kill. Avoid You Only Live Twice, The Man With The Golden Gun, Moonraker, The Living Daylights, and The World is Not Enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME.","review":"This movie has two good things going for it, the begining and the end. Its the slow pace of this movie that just puts me to sleep. The opening scene, climax, and final fight between bond and the villan are very good, but every thing else in between is slow paced and boring. The title song was also a poor choice. This film was John Glen's a only poorly directed film, all his others are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD but didn't want wide screen","review":"The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good things","review":"The Living Daylights isn't a bad OO7 film, it just isn't very good. The two good things are the song and Dalton. Everything else, P-U! D'Abo is one of the worst Bond girlz, and the villains aren't good. This film doesn't even have a Bond feel,it feels like you're watching some big TV-made drama. The henchman is SOO bland, and the villains are FAR from menacing. The plot is so confusing that I finally figured it out after seeing it six times! If you want to see GOOD OO7, check out Diamonds are Forever, Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your eyes Only, Octopussy, License to kill, or Tomorrow Never Dies. Avoid The Living daylights, The Man with the Golden GUn, A view to a kill, Live and Let Die, and Thw world Is Not Enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and Stupid Just Like All Bond Films Are.","review":"Viewed: 12/11Rate: 312/11: Seeing The Living Daylights, I had to decide who gave the worst performance: Timothy Dalton, Maryam d'Abo, Jeroen Krabbe, or Joe Don Baker. They were all truly bad, and I've settled on Krabbe. The man cannot act at all. On the other hand, Dalton was a good looking guy back then, but we need to admit that he was terrible playing James Bond. He just came flat in everything he did, no matter what, even in his lines. I thought the story was all right and the film somewhat passable as well. As always, the best part of The Living Daylights was the opening credits. They sure knew how to make it stylish and cool to watch. All in all, The Living Daylights is a small improvement over Roger Moore's dreck, but they are all ridiculously bad just the same. By the way, Smiert Shpionam means \\"Death to Spies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"strong contender for worst bond film","review":"No wonder the franchise died out a bit in the 80s. This movie was absolutely horrible. It was literally painful to listen to the dialog in this movie; The actors could barely carry the terrible plot; all the class of a bond movie was replace with gaudy 80s pop culture. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film and had to immediately rewatch \\"From Russia with Love\\" as to not loose respect for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Living Daylights: It's everything a Bond film should be!","review":"I thought this was a great film! It had an excellent plot, and fabulous stuntwork. I also think that Timothy Dalton did an outstanding job of portraying James Bond. In fact, I understand that when Dalton recieved the part of 007, he reffered back to the original Ian Flemming novels so that he could bring the TRUE attitude of James Bond to the screen.(The way Flemming saw Bond!) Dalton's approach as Bond was dead serious. Which I liked a lot. And the overall film also had a serious plot,(not found since the days of Sean Connery)It really broke away from the slapstick humor found in the Roger Moore films. This was a good comeback. I loved this film, and I consider it to posses the same quality of characters and intense plot of a classic Sean Connery 007 film!

All I can say is that to really appreciate this album, you need to sit down quietly in a dark space and LISTEN to every note and every lyric. The lyrics resonate, the melodies give you goose bumps and Tim Booth's vocals are out of this world. This is one of my top 5 albums and one of my \\"desert island\\" choices. I have several thousand pieces of music from the late 60's to the current and few albums give me goosebumps from start to finish. I love all the songs, and as a couple of reviewers have said, I could leave out Low, Low, Low as it seems incongruant with the rest of the tracks.

It is worth buying the movie just to see her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Instinct 2, Basically BAD","review":"This movie was not a complete disaster. It did keep the character of Sharon Stone very similar to the first one, a good show of a Borderline/Antisocial mix of personality disorder (cluster B in general). However, the repetative sexual inuendoe's, the overall lack of suspense at times that should have been, and the in general poor script made this almost painful to watch. The script kept re-hashing itself every 20 minutes with sharon's lines. The whole risk addiction was poor. Also, this painted a really poor image of psyciatrists, which I'm not a fan of. This could have been a bigger mess, but the directors and producers did not do what other sequals have done, increase blood and increase nudity. They kept it at par, if not toned it down just a bit.

Although perhaps this DVD is selling well for them since they've went to the extent of flat out lieing to the consumer about it's content. Studio DVD labels make me laugh with their \\"Unrated-Uncut\\" sellpoint that always amounts to almost nothing interesting.. but this is unusual since the DVD is actually MISSING scenes. Tragic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Sharon Stone!","review":"This film was given a thorough cremation by a lot of critics. Nevertheless, I can't help wondering if people made up their minds without any sense of objectivity. The storyline was certainly not a classic but it was entertaining. Unlike the first one Stone made in 1992, this sequel relied more on a more serious storyline rather than mere sex.I felt it succeeded in showing a more watchable version. Personally, I thought it had just the right blend of spice and drama to captivate an audience. I have seen some rather unkind remarks about Sharon Stone in this film. In my humble opinion she looked fabulous. After all she had been through with ilness etc she deserved a lot of credit. Her acting was good, she looked stunning and her beauty speaks for itself. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Inbland and Boring 2","review":"This movie was boring, dull, dreary, listless, and very dead. This movie had no redeeming qualities at all and not even half the first movie was. It wasn't bad in a good way it was just bad. I'm wondering why did they wait so long to make this movie.Sharon looks good but very enhanced. The leading man in the movie was very stuffy,wooden and had zero chemistry with Sharon.

Catherine Tramell is back, better and hotter than ever. She is playing her mind games once again, and now I know she is the baddest bit** of them all, which is so fun to watch.This film has a great ending, it's very different and mind blowing.

Sharon Stone is relegated to a lesser character that's simply the focal point of the story that leads to Morrisey's downfall. What makes this film such a weak effort is that it tries to imitate the original with its ambiguity without the originality. In fact, I felt that the Sharon Stone character (Catherine Tramell) was nothing more than a caricature. It's the writing that hurt this movie. Once again we're left without a conclusion but it doesn't have near the believability of the original movie, everything seems forced & without real depth.Take your own chance with this movie, it's not as intriguing or original as the original.

Catherine certainly gets around: She manages to befriend the most unlikely of people, all associates or ex-wives or enemies of the shrink, and most of them end up dead. Is she trying to drive the shrink nuts, or does she plan to kill him?This movie makes little sense: It doesn't thrill or tantalize. And it offers Sharon Stone in an unflattering light, as a cold seductress with little to offer but mindless sex. But then that seems to be her best role, doesn't it?

Absolutely nothing. I was turned off by the film even before it was released, as i was watching interviews of Sharon Stone talking about the film (well, pretty much, just talking about herself). I wish self-centered actresses didn't get so much praise and attention just because they have a pretty face and had done one risque sexual scene that was done years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Dont watch this... why do you want to pay for a wizened sharon stone. if you want to see it rent it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharon Stone is too old to be in this role","review":"I watched 10 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off.

Then all of a sudden she rips her face off and she has a real hideous face with an ugly frown, fangs,and red glowing eyes. Suddenly huge tentacles come out of her and she starts destroying cars and buildings. She then breathes fire and kills the entire cast of the film just before entering her spacecraft to fly away into outer space.As she is flying her space-ship, Abe Vigoda see's her trying to escape and he pulls out a bazooka and fires.

No, I take it a step further - I dont know what powers were at play so that anyone could even get the chance to pitch the screenplay for this load of garbage to any Hollywood producers and execs. This movie is terrible - the plot is practically non-existent and whatever is there, just is ridiculous and lame, the acting is below sub-standard - because sub-standard at least implies a standard - the editing is terrible and the so-called sex scenes resemble soft core and - unlike in the first movie - are anything but sexy and erotic.

The film was for some unknown reason shot in London instead of USA and maybe that's the reason why this film lacks the excitement of the first film.

The first 60 odd pages have a straightforward basic description of the import/export process, after which the book goes into marketing, how to do business in foreign countries, what equipment you need..etc.. and all the other stuff you should actually know already as part of your life skills. Having lived in a number of other countries and learned some foreign languages, and having a good grasp of IT and telecommunications, I found the last 2/3rd's of the book pretty useless, but it may be helpful if you've been living under a rock your whole life.

Most ppl. forget that the GMAT is a simple test, not too complicated and the key is to think clearly and to not get hurried. This book seems to take that approach. Both Kaplan and Princeton, I think complicate the matter a bit too much. That said, I actually went through all three books. I would recommend this as a good starting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Tips, but better books are out there","review":"I thought the tips in this book were good, and they were easier to absorb, and more concisely presented than in the Kaplan book. However, they were the same tips the Kaplan book had. On top of that the Kaplan book had a wealth of tests on the computer (like the actual tests), and is a better buy than this book.I can't comment on the accuracy of the scores because I didn't take any full length tests from this book, but a really accurate score predicter is the free software (PowerPrep) you get when you register for the GMAT. They give you 2 practice tests that are basically identical to the real tests (as well as tons of exercises) that give you a score within 20 points of what you'll actually score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diagnostic test provides unrealistic results","review":"Before reading this book, I took the diagnostic test at the beginning of the book to get a baseline of my GMAT score. I made a 730, so naturally, I thought that I would do much better on the real test. I read the book and went through all of the math practice tests (my weakest area). On the night before my exam, I decided to take the PowerPrep test to see how much I had improved after studying for a few weeks. I made a 550. Imagine my disappointment!I decided to not take the GMAT test the next day and wasted hundreds of dollars.I haven't taken any of the other diagnostic tests in the other books, but they've got to be better than this one! Also, the questions on the PowerPrep exam were MUCH more difficult than the sample questions and practice questions in this guide.In short, if you do well according to this book, don't expect to do well on the GMAT!I had the 2nd Edition, btw."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book on the market","review":"This has got to be the worst book ever... I totally disagree with all the reviews. First of, the examples are horrible - nothing like the real GMAT.

I especially like the movies with S.P.E.C.T.R.E and super villans like Blofeld, ones that have unheard character names.

A MUST for all James Bond fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Bond movie! On second viewing its a lot better!","review":"A lot of people think this Bond outing is far too violent and a lot different than the others. And this is true. The PG-13 violence is uneccisary and it plays a lot different than a regular Bond movie. But if you don't really like it the first time give it another shot and you may find you like it. The plot centers around Bond's best buddy Felix Leiter who was maimed and his wife killed because Leiter and Bond helped capture a huge columbian drug lord, Franz Sanchez. Bond sets out to get back at Sanchez. His licence to kill is revoked and he sets out to kill Sanchez. Buying this DVD was a risk but i'm gald I did. Lots of fun. Dalton is great as Bond. He should have done more than 2 but he wasn't to popular. This Bond film marks several firsts in the franchise. Including 007's first PG-13 rating for violence and profanity. Q's extra large role is the best part of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool bond movie but vilont","review":"Timothy Dalton is a ok bond in this movie a drug dealer escapes from jail.Named Franz Sancez(Robert Davi).The plot is pure action watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bond Era Has Come To An End","review":"I started watching this movie on TNT one night and just about got sick! I love Bond movies (especially with Sean Connery) but now that they got this new guy Timothy Dalton the Bond movies are taking a downfall. This movie is just a bunch stunts and gun battles. Dalton is no where near as charming as the other Bonds were portrayed. It reminds me of MI2 which just came out. Gruesome and badly made. I'm sick of these new movies and wish they would just stop making them. They're an insult to well-made older movies. I can't believe I'm saying this but the movies made in the '60's and '70's are better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dark, Just Drab","review":"One of the bottom-rung Bond films. Dalton wasn't necessarily a bad Bond - \\"The Living Daylights,\\" his first flick, was fairly solid - but here he's let down by a dull, derivative script that lacks spark and flair. The look of the film is also drab - the colors, the scenery, the cinematography: it all has the workmanlike look and feel of a middling 80s television show rather than a well-financed entry in a traditionally polished feature film franchise. Add to that the fact that Daltons 007 era had one of the weaker supporting casts (the actors playing M and Moneypenny barely register here, and the villains and Bond women simply bore), and you don't exactly have a recipe for success. Basically, this film is only for Bond diehards - and even they may wince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low point in the series","review":"A lifelong Bond fan, I've watched this movie only once since it first came out. I eagerly went to see it when it opened in 1989, hoping it would be a solid follow-up to The Living Daylights, an engaging yarn featuring a largely-unknown but impressive, intense (and unfairly maligned) actor named Timothy Dalton. But LTC proved a disappointment. It was unexpectedly violent and dark (though that didn't hurt the excellent Casino Royale), had that weird silver/gray palette of the 80s, and included a number of elements that can best be described as cheesy, e.g. the gray morning coats and Ascot ties of the opening scene, several unfunny efforts at humor, Robert Davi's over-the-top villain, Dalton's hairstyle, and ... Wayne Newton?? Compared to its predecessor, LTC was an even bigger disappointment than Quantum of Solace (2008). This was a terrible waste of a decent actor (Dalton), who could have been the Daniel Craig of the franchise 20 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Licence to Flop","review":"Where to begin. This Bond move didn't even make any money. Most of the critics gave it a D+ back in 1989. Dalton as Bond is so lame and boring. The gadgets and actions is ok, but he looks bored with the role and takes it to serious. Plus, you get tired of the story lines of drug smuggling. Leave that to the private eyes, not for secret agents!!! I think Ian Fleming would have been very disappointed in this film. I am glad that this was Dalton's last film. He is better as a dramatic actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Them All","review":"Without a doubt the worst Bond movie ever made, for two reasons. The first is that the violence crosses the line from action oriented to gratuitous and disgusting, as we are treated to graphic depictions of the way the villains dispatch and maim their victims (including one particularly lethal case of the bends using a recompression chamber). If that were the only problem I probably could have dealt with it, but far worse is the story itself. It is what I consider a gross violation of the Bond character, in which he abandons Mi6 and defies his superiors in pursuit of a personal vendetta. Although we know James won't hesitate to break the rules when necessary, he would never throw his entire career away on a quest for personal revenge. It's no wonder the Bond franchise had to take a seven year hiatus after this bomb...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as \\" Bass masters classic \\"","review":"My faveorite James Bond of all time was Timothy Dalton and my fave bond movie was \\" The living Daylights \\".

The script is so cheesy. Timothy Dalton's performance is rotten at best. James Bond has his licence to kill revoked but that doesn't stop him. There's a shark in this. How many Bond films have sharks? The gambling scene was what makes James Bond, James Bond. It was written by two screenwriters. One writer captured bond well but the other didn't seem to know what he was doing. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're a major Bond fan and you want to complete your collection. Other than completing your collection there's no other reason to have this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"It's not one of the worst films made, but as a Bond fan, I feel compelled to give this 1 star, since I would consider it the worst Bond film to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond by a Landslide","review":"I grew up on the Bond series, reading many of the books and short stories written by Ian Fleming. I viewed my first Bond movie when I was six years old and have been an avid fan ever since. Until this movie was released. \\"Lisence to Kill\\" is by far the worst James Bond movie ever made, acting wise. The plot is ok, but the fact that Bond is so dedicated to queen and country makes this story about a personal vendetta for a man that he barely knows is utterly unbelievable. But that is ok. Its not like \\"Moonraker\\" or \\"You Only Live Twice\\" were believable, but the acting was ok. The acting in \\"Lisence to Kill\\" is the worst I have seen by far in a Bond film. Timothy Dalton's acting really isn't too bad, but it is not his best performance and his surrounding cast is absolutely horrid! I would not recommend that anyone purchace this film unless you want to complete the set, which is what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond the way it was meant to be","review":"After getting this DVD and watching it again I can only say Dalton should did more Bond movies. The two he did were by far the best of the series. It seems that in every other Bond movie he's saving the world That also makes daltons movies different A great plot with great action. Bond was back shame he didn't stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst Bond film EVER!","review":"After reading the reviews on here i went and rented this movie license to kill with high hopes and expectations. Needless to say that i was let down.This Bond movie is about one of James Bonds best friends get put in the hospital while his wife is killed. So James goes on a revenge rampage defying M and MI-6 to do so.I thought that it sounded cool but it was a drag. It started out GREAT with a lot of action and a solid plot. But as the movie progressed it got REALLY slow. And the end is so fake and hookey that it comes off as comical. This is the worst Bond film of all time! It isnt worth even your time.Now dont get me wrong i LOVE the James Bond series. And no-one can even come close to remotly compare with Shawn Conry! He is the only TRUE Bond! But the other Bond movies are all good. In fact this is the only Bond movie that ive seen that i didnt like.

First even thogh this movie is PG-13 and violent most of the action really isn't that good. It is not hair raising like in most Bond adventures. It also really doesn't play like a normal Bond. It centers around Bond out to get revenge. And most of the time 007 is nice to his enemy. Also I thoght that the tanker chase would be good, but it is not much of a chase. But still I liked this movie. I like Q's extra large roll and Timothy Dalton as 007. Also I like the ending song. This Bond adventure is much different than others. There is no mission and a lot more violence and profanity than most others, that earned it a PG-13. I would still reccomend this to a 007 or action fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, he should have been Bond for longer","review":"I remembered enjoying this movie when I was in high school but Timothy Dalton seems to have gotten a bad rap over the years as James Bond. This is cemented by the fact that he only got to do two movies so it has become almost common knowledge. I've been watching all of the Bond movies from the beginning, following along with the reviews on The Talk Show podcast on [...] and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Timothy Dalton as James Bond. He was especially refreshing after the level of campiness that Roger Moore had risen to near the end of his run. He added a seriousness to the role that had been missing for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR THE CAREY LOWELL FAN","review":"If you are a Carey Lowell fan,(as I certainly am) this movie is very worth while. Even the plot makes sense(whatever the show is about) as long as she graces the scene.

He loves all of the 007 movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dalton grows into the character","review":"\\"The Living Daylights\\" was a disappointment. But in \\"Licence to Kill\\", Timothy Dalton grew into the character and made it his own rather than trying to mimick Roger Moore. It's a darker James Bond than before, this time motivated by revenge. The story is less extravagant than some of the earlier movies - the villain is no super terrorist or megalomaniac but a South American drug lord - but the action is great. Robert Davi is a good villian and a young Benicio del Toro plays one of his henchmen. It is a pity Dalton quit after this movie. It would have been interesting to see more of him as Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change of pace for the series","review":"Robert Davi is one of the best villians in the series, the plot is well thought out and makes perfect sense for once, Dalton is convincing and the last 30 minutes are truly fantastic.Don't expect the usual globe-hopping and sophistication though, this is a gritty (often nasty) little flick.Q has his most involved role and whether you like it or not the action and stunt work is very imaginative and exciting.The big problem is the Mexican setting. Very drab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many","review":"The movie works well, but i was misled into believing i only bought one but i ended up with two and was unable to return just one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Movie Ever","review":"This has to be the worst Bond movie I've ever seen. On paper, you'd think it be the best; a realistic plot for a change and original ending. However, this is the worst Bond movie ever. First off, it is very poorly executed. Second, it drags out for what seems like forever. Finally, I don't think this movie was put out with any effort. It was kind of like the director rolled out of bed two years from the last Bond movie and said 'Okay, time for another Bond movie'. It just doesn't work. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action, but Dalton is wrong choice as Bond","review":"Dalton's second time as Bond is different than many other Bond films; unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it's better. This is a leaner, meaner Bond film, devoid of humor, and with a truly nasty drug lord as a villain, well played by Robert Davi. There's also a tough Bond girl (Carey Lowell) who has to compete for attention with the villain's girl (Talisa Soto). One thing I couldn't understand: Lowell's character is portrayed as tough and independent, yet at times, she's whining that she doesn't get enough attention from ol' James.The biggest problem is Dalton. Like The Living Daylights (which is the worst Bond film ever), Dalton is dry, and displays none of the class, style, or sly humor which Connery, Moore, or even Brosnan have displayed. This isn't a bad thriller, and the action sequences are terrific, but I can't say I was sorry that this was Dalton's last turn as Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I mean.............","review":"This film is just not Bond.He is suddenly some Bronson-type who always kills in cold blood.Many f the actors are good,but the villain is just all to everyday and Talisa Soto is a joke when it comes to acting.The producers also were foolish enough to place this film in South America.Horrible!Instead of something ecxotic we get this.File and forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"License Suspended","review":"This has to be one of the worst, if not the worst, film in the Bond series. Although Dalton never seemed to fit into the Bond role, the fault in this film is entirely with the script and the director. With this film it seems as if the Bond franchise finally ran out of good stories to write.Although the story of revenge against a fellow agent's murderer is good, the antagonist being a drug lord just drags the movie down. Moore's \\"Live and Let Die\\" was a similar problem. The villains in those movies just don't seem to be on the level of SPECTER and Blofeld, a Stromberg, Goldfinger, or Drax; they are, after all, just measely drug dealers.I saw this film only once and don't regret not having seen it again. An altogether very forgettable movie that isn't even worth renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bond in Years, but One of the Lowest Grossing","review":"Oddly, this film made less money than any other Bond. But it's far better than any of the Moore films. I saw it a couple of times in the theater back in '89 and found the story more cohesive and interesting than almost any of the prior outings since Diamonds are Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close but know cigar","review":"Although he isn't my favorite (actually that is bit of an understatement) Dalton does what he can with the otherwise unoriginal plot line. The grittiness of this movie is a slight turn off. It also hurts Felix whom is one of my favorite charactors( this was taken from one of the books where the exact same thing happens when he gets mamed by a shark). All in all the all out action scenes make up for the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Bond movies","review":"Licence to Kill is a great addition to the Bond series. The action scenes are superb and Timothy Dalton is excellent as James Bond. He acts like he does have a license to kill. The music is also great. The James Bond theme is excellent (with the needed Latin flavor). Also the semi truck scene at the end in the Mexican desert is awesome. Carey Lowell is verry good as a James Bond girl. Unlike many Bond girls, this one is tough! This is a must see for any James Bond fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best.","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't sure what it was that I didn't like about it. Now that I've seen it a few more times, I think I have it. The problem with this flick is that it isn't really a James Bond movie. Gone are the exotic locals, the world domination plot and even the supercool spy himself. Dalton seems more like a cop than a spy in this film. Same for the premise. Bond's friend dies, so he gets personal. What is that? Bond would never get personal. I think the \\"Cop Flick\\" trend of the 1980's got to the writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS BAD SIDE IS A BAD PLACE TO BE","review":"When James Bond's friend Felix is hurt badly be drug kingpin Frans Sanchez. James wants revenge and is determined to get his revenge. After his licence is revoked he is on his own. This is a good Bond film to own. Timothy Dalton brings a serious tone to Bond. It has great stunts throughout the film. The end stunts in the semi trucks are spetacular. For a Bond film that is completely different from the rest buy Licence to Kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite bond flicks","review":"This is one of my favorite bonds due to the fact they changed the story a little. Our intrepid hero finally takes a stand with his superiors, leaves the service to pursue the drug lords who maimed his CIA buddy & murdered his wife.

The acting is better then usual as well it is unfortunate Dalton left the role his a good actor saw other films with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"james bond","review":"i love collecting the james bond movies and watching them during the winter when there is nothing on tv ."},{"rating":"1","title":"License to be Horrible","review":"This is without a doubt, the worst bond film ever made.

Timothy Dalton surpasses himself as the worst bond to date (a distinction he should have left to George Lazenby). If you are even thinking of buying this film, please have your head examined.

That is not to denigrate his talent; it's just that he seemed ill-suited to fill the role.That said, however, I feel that this film is a fitting \\"sequel\\" of sorts to \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\". Comparisons are easy to discern: 1) Both have actors whose run as 007 was limited; (2) the story lines reveal a little more personal side of the British super spy; (3) the actor's respective interpretations of the character are somewhat closer in tone to Sir Ian's creation.On its own merits, \\"Licence\\" falls a little flat, but when paired with the Lazenby film, it is an acceptable entry in the Bond series."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG improvement over Roger Moore","review":"Moore simply could not make Bond seem real. Perhaps it was the appearance (blond hair) or his - how to say this politiely - advancing years in which some of the babes appear as daughters rather than gal pals. Dalton was great. It was different in that Bond was not on a government-sanctioned mission but a personal vendetta. It was exciting and yes, violent, but it did reinstill some much-needed reality back into the series. With Moore, everything - from plot to dame to prize - was a joke. Here one realizes that the spy game is more than a game - it is dangerous and dirty. Great villians but the romance side was rather weak despite the lurid (for Bond) scenes.Super performance by Wayne Newton!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond - License to Kill","review":"This Bond movie is my all-time favorite! Not that I've seen them all! I love Pierce Brosnan, too, but Timothy Dalton is MY FAVORITE BOND man! I wish he had done more Bond films!The opening of this film with Bond (Best Man) and his friend (Groom) floating down by parachute to a wedding, followed by Gladys Knight singing the title song IS my favorite part of this movie.I enjoyed watching Timothy's Bond because he didn't seem to be as womanizing as the others were/are, making him a LOT more irressitible!The Bond plots are always exciting, but my overall opinion is this movie was more about the 'inner' Bond as a person and not the agent, and I liked getting to know him better.-Marvette Cox"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album in the world","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. this is by far the most amazing album I have ever heard.

Every song on this album is a classic. Benny and Björn are one of the greatest songwriters and producers of the twentieth century who made one of the greatest pops songs ever and Agneta and Ann Frid managed to make them timeless with their amazing voices. If you are starting with Abba buy this collection it is fantastic. The only flaw is that it seems to be missing some of their hits like I Do I Do I Do but you can buy this one and more gold and then you'll find some of their songs that perhaps didn't become all time classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"As I listen to th music that is soo popular now with teens like myself, I can't help but puttinng on my ABBA cd and listening to real music.

However, the last review is wrong in stating 280 million records sold. This is wrong. No one has sold 280 million albums. If they did, this would be noted in books around the world, as the beatles have sold the most at a little over 180 million. That is so many records.

Often criticised for their lack of lyrical substance, this band has a sound that is pure magic. The gifted voices of lead singers Frida & Agnetha are truly a treat to any music lover, while the music & arrangements of these wonderful pop gems are timeless to say the least.

At least one of their kitchy 70's pop gems has to make you wanna bounce your head and sing along. Whether it's the irresistible \\"Take A Chance On Me\\" or the disco army-precision of \\"Voulez Vous\\", and of course, the classic \\"Dancing Queen\\", the Swedish super troupers had the uncanny ability to make each note melt your brain, and to make each beat throb unrelentlessly inside your head. Their melodies are like a VH1 Behind The Music special- intoxicating yet always making you stick around for more.

Listening to the songs, I can see how the musical could be such a hit. The songs are the right blend of 70s disco and 100% showmanship - fantastic vocals, synthesizers, great arrangements. I was singing \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" and \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" for days after listening to this CD. Listen to the background vocals and harmonies - They don't make arrangements like this anymore. Well-written and very well produced. A must for any 70s music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop 101","review":"Even more so than the Beatles, this is the template for pop music. Specifically, mainstream, streamlined, pop music.Lots of really solid songwriting. Surprised how current it still sounds. Some amazing synth lines that sit perfectly in the mixes. Everything is mixed perfectly. A little too glossy/unrealistic for me sometimes. Can't deny songs like Dancing Queen (brilliant, euphoric structure), Lay All Your Love On Me, Money, S.O.S., Gimme Gimme Gimme, etc. Lots of ear candy. Nearly every section of every song has something unique, interesting and catchy. Most of all, it all fits the particular song and makes sense. Cam get tiring after a while though.

As an adult, I liked the music but didn't pay much attention to it. Now with a resurgence of interest in ABBA with the ... covering ABBA songs, and the delightful show, \\"Mamma Mia\\" making its rounds across country, my interest peaked again...only this time making me realize what most of their fans already know. They made really good songs that stand up well. I went out recently and bought the cd and I've been playing it in my cd player ever since. From \\"Dancing Queen\\" and \\"Mamma Mia\\" to \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" and \\"Chicquitita\\", I'm hooked. This collection is 19 of their best known songs and worth having in your cd collection. If you don't have it, do yourself a favor and get it. And if \\"Mamma Mia\\", the broadway touring show, rolls into town, don't miss it. Long live ABBA!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"From the opening track Dancing Queen to the closing Waterloo, this CD is packed full of perfect pop songs. On the surface, the songs can sound quite simple and I think that is why ABBA have often been dismissed by critics. But have a close listen to the melodies, production, multiple layers of voices and instruments, and you'll hear the songs are far more complicated that what they initially seem. (songs like Knowing Me, Knowing You and The Name Of the Game for example). The two female singers Agnetha and Frida have beautiful voices and blend together perfectly. The only problem with this CD is you will want to go out and purchase the rest of the catalogue as I have. You won't be disappointed though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still as popular as ever","review":"This album is not a bestseller for nothing. People on the whole, know good music when they hear it and Abba is way up there when it comes to writing, arranging and performing. This album includes 19 of their biggest hits, and each one, I'm sure, will be instantly recognizable. And it is really not suprising that now, almost 30 years on, they are still immensely popular, and their albums still manage to be big sellers. Next time you listen to their songs, listen behind the vocals to the music...the arrangements are awesome. Other groups try to copy Abba's style, but there will never be another Abba.

The launch of Mama Mia productions and the movie enticed me to buy Abba Gold to hear all of their work. This CD sounds nothing like what I have heard from a multitude of media sources. As an audio engineer I knew there was something technically wrong with this CD remix. Digital audio analysis revealed a boost in the midrange centered around 3 KHz on all 19 tracks, amongst other mixing modifications. These mixing changes can be partially corrected using an equalizer, but what tin-eared recording engineer at Polydor thought this was an \\"improvement.\\" You can probably get a better sounding copy off old Abba LP records, if you have them and know how to create a digital copy on your PC or Mac computer.

So if you're a young reader and like sad, yet funny, books I recommend Ruby Holler for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"Okay, so I read this book right before 6th grade and I liked it and all, but its no \\"Walk Two Moons\\". Of course, after reading \\"Walk Two Moons\\" I set really high expectations for Sharon Creech novels not realizing how difficult it would be for anything except JK Rowling, Wendelin Van Draanen, and Meg Cabot to reach, but hey, I'm human - I make these mistakes all the time. Anyway, I really enjoyed this book and reccomend it to any Sharon Creech fan although I must warn you its not written in quite the same way as, \\"Chasing Redbird\\" \\"Walk Two Moons\\" \\"The Wanderer\\" or \\"Absolutely Normal Chaos\\" with the 1st person story. Its a little different. You'll like it just the same though."},{"rating":"2","title":"ruby holler","review":"Ruby Holler is one of the best books I have ever read.

But an old couple from Ruby Holler want to take separate vacations, and temporarily adopt the two to accompany them on their trips. The odds are stacked against the kids and the arrangement. Creech tells the story with humor, warmth, and insight. The cranky, wicked, bumbling couple who run the orphanage reminded me of Roald Dahl's adults. The kids are right out of Karen Cushman's Rodzina. But the wise, down-home, older couple are the characters that steal the show. This book is a gem for children nine and older, as well as for adults who enjoy children's literature. My fifth grade students agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unlike her previous books this is more for KIDS....... or am i just growing up!!!","review":"no offense this is a good sotry sweet and fun to read.........but it surely dint have that suspense and shocking element of her previous novels........anyways fun and enjoybale for kids..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby Holler","review":"This is a very good book. I have to admit the chapter numbers fazed me a bit, but...I stuck it out.The story is about twins Dallas and Florida Carter (I don't know how old they are), and how they have always ended up in bad foster homes, until this one elderly couple comes along that just may be different.This book is very lively and the imagery is wonderful. I would love to live in a place like Ruby Holler. I also think that the word \\"putrid\\" is quite funny.The thing that annoyed me was Florida and Dallas' attitudes; even after Sairy and Tiller were so nice, they still wanted to get on board a freight train and leave. Why the HECK would you want to do that? After they've shown that they do care?The ending was also blunt and unsatisfying...I just don't like it.

I remember waiting a while for things to get moving, but about halfway through I started to become more interested. The plot became more involving, the characters more lifelike. And then it ended. It ended so abruptly, in fact, that I wondered if while they were putting the book together they didn't just run out of ink. This is very disappointing, and even if she did come out with a sequel to resolve some of the many things she left unfinished in this book, I don't believe I'd read it. Ms. Creech, I hate to say it, but you let me down. As far as the two stars go, it's more like 1 1/2. You can consider the extra a pity half-star for the colorful and visually pleasing cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Read; Excellent Message","review":"Dallas and Florida are twins who have never been separated their whole lives. At the beginning of the book they are living in an adoption home with the evil Trepids who have named Dallas and Florida the 'trouble twins.' Dallas and Florida are frequently forced to go stay in the cold cellar for hours as punishments. However, Dallas and Florida are actually not as bad as any other kids. Dallas always sees the good in everyone while Florida is more of a pessimist. When an old couple, Sairy and Tiller, decide to take in the twins for a few weeks, no one knows what a dramatic change each other is going to play on the other's life. Going on a trip to two different places, both Sairy, Tiller,and Dallas and Florida, are separated for as long as they can remember.

Worked fine for awhile but then the ON button started getting flaky on one handset and then on the other. Eventually the ON buttons on both handsets stopped working altogether but by that time it was out of warranty. I tore the handsets apart multiple times to clean up the black disc on the back of the keypad membrane with a pencil eraser. This fixed the problem but only temporarily. Very odd, all the buttons on both handsets are fine except the ON buttons. Another issue is the one handset battery has always been bad from the time I purchased the phone, fully charged it only gave me about 20 mins of talking time before going dead. I was never really happy with the volume on this phone either, even turned up to max you could barely hear the person you were talking to sometimes. Overall this product has been a lot of aggravation and a waste of $100.

Some times when a call comes it it doesn't ring with the phone in the charger so it definatly has power and with it out.

This phone appealed to me in the store so I bought it along with an additional handset. It was easy to set up, that's about where its pluses ended. The reception was horrible. The person I was talking to kept fading in and out, and I was right next to the base. Next, the battery life is probably the worst of any cordless phone I've seen since they first came out, and I let it charge for 20 hours before its first use, so I know it was fully charged. I took it back already, Best Buy was very quick to take it back and give a full refund. Avoid this phone, as others have stated, its worthless. I would give it less than 1 star if Amazon allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PHONE EVER","review":"I can't even begin to explain all of the issues with this phone.

The base failed yesterday. Motorola's only solution is to have you ship it to them (you pay for shipping - and you deal with having to buy another phone in the meantime, or go w/o).Here's a plug for OfficeMax though - I had initially thought my husband had bought the phone there, and when I called them about it, they said just bring it on in and they would replace it immediately. Circuit City, however, sucks royally. I was on hold for 30 minutes (on my cell phone, of course), waiting for the manager, as the adolescent sales rep who initially spoke with me was mentally challenged by the concept of a replacement phone. Finally after a long wait (and being hung up on once), the manager told me that I could bring the phone in for replacement.Final words? I'll never buy a Motorola phone again. I hope I can deter a few of you also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this phone","review":"We have (had) two of these phones (purchased at different times and stores) -- and along with the range and battery life issues mentioned in other reviews, now the keypads on both units have failed.

It's tedious to sit and wait for something to happen. The supposed scares were lame, at best.

But I must admit that the taste is NOT BAD and it mixes out well with a spoon unlike other protein shakes I've heard about. A co-worker used another protein shake and the moment he tried mine he said he was going to switch. Maybe he should be writing this review. One thing I appreciate about the product is that it tells us when to use it i.e. if you want to lose weight, it outlines when the best time is to take it. However, one disadvantage is that it doesn't tell me how many times per day it should be taken. As far as I know, too much protein is not good for the body so my fitness instructor told me to take it only when I am working out which is twice per week.

Most of his discussion is still relevant today. There is a very extensive discussion of the technical aspects of foil fencing. Other sections discuss tactical aspects of footwork, distance and tempo with far more detail than most books.The line drawings of the various actions show a great deal of detail. As a beginning fencing coach (and a fencer of thirty years), I appreciate how much information has been packed into this book.The level is for fencing masters and senior competitive foil fencers (the more you already know, the more you will understand) but it is clearly written and was very well translated. My copy is an original from Corvina press."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"i was not happy because i was sent the wrong model and i can still not find the set i need? i need a set for a 2003 f-150 short bed stepside 4 door can you help me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this jamming up-and-coming bundle of talent","review":"If you've ever had the privilege of seeing these guys perform live you know just how awesome they are.

This is a double CD-set you can enjoy over and over and never get bored with, each time discovering a new layer you missed the previous listen.Definately worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense, but comprehensive","review":"The content of this book is extraordinary. It follows closely the circumstances of black women from pre-Civil War through to the 1980s. It does this without romanticizing their lives and without trivializing their struggles. However, the writing is dense and can sometimes be hard to get through. At several points, I found myself skimming through pages where I felt like I was being told the same story/information for the second, third, multiple time. At that point, some of the anecdotes cease to have impact and begin to feel preachy. Despite this, the book closely examines the lives of black women throughout American history in a comprehensive, highly academic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction and explanation of software engineering","review":"Overview of Software Engineering, with a brief explanation of software process and project management.

The summary on the back page anticipated an interesting reading. However, what I found was a very dull book. What was described as the story of two old friends meeting after 40 years, was in fact the monologue of a resentful old man who waited 40 years for an opportunity to tell his former bestfriend that he was guilty of all his sufferings. The poor guy has to listen to all these of accusations and remains almost silent for a hundred pages (and I say 'almost' because he adds sentences like 'Please, go on' or 'Yes, I'm listening to you'). Sorry, but couldn't he have had a more decent role? Did he defend himself in sign language? Or is this what the 'geniality' of the author is about? Maybe I missed something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to find this one","review":"This band is amazing i'm only 17 but I happen to find this band through I friend that is a year older and fell in love with every song especially let it ride and take it like a man.

Having the usb integrated is very smart technology as it not only enables you to download the pics right to your puter w/out a reader, but you can download it in anyone's else's computer as well, which is great when on vacation visiting family. When I purchased it, I did not see that the PLUS came in a 2gb as well, I see it does now, and if i could do it over, that's the way to go.

It's extremely convenient to just \\"snap\\" it in half (it folds with little hinges) and plug it into any USB port. I get consistent ~8MB/s upload speeds when importing photos to my computer. I'm giving it only four stars because the hinge mechanism to fold the card in half seems somewhat flimsy, and I question how long it will last. The good news is that SanDisk has a lifetime warranty on the card, so no worries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Works great ... for a while!","review":"I bought this SanDisk Ultra II Plus 1GB SD card in December 2006 and it worked great for about 5 months.

So I try to use a USB cable whenever I can, and use the card directly only when necessary.Still, no one's complained about that yet, so maybe I'm just a little paranoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for card reader","review":"I love this card due to the fact that I don't need a card reader, or carry around the cables to connect the camera to your PC.

I highly recommend this card!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy","review":"I've had mine for several months and it works flawlessly. I use it in my camera, my mp3 player, and laptop. In my opinion this is better than having a thumb drive. Its smaller, fits on a keychain better, and can be used as both a thumb drive and a SD card. If they make a bigger one, I will most definately upgrade. The keychain holder looks cheap when you get it, but it has held up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Eject From Canon PowerShot SD1000","review":"Sandisk's website specifically says this is compatible with the Canon PowerShot SD1000. While it will record and upload pictures, the SanDisk Ultra II SD Plus USB card WILL NOT EJECT from the camera. There are several other reports of this on other web sites. The divot by the right hinge on this card catches in the small A-shaped retaining clip just inside the Powershot's SD card receptable. The only way to get it out is with a very thin knife! Buyer beware! PS: Camera and card both less than 1 week old. Tested camera w/other cards and normal cards (without the hinge) work just fine. Would have tried the card in other cameras but I am taking it back before it gets stuck someplace again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great card - watch out for the free keychain","review":"The Sandisk 1GB Ultra II Plus USB has been just as fast & reliable as my plain old Ultra II. And the snap-open USB connection is a great innovation - goodbye, SD-to-USB adapter!But beware the free keychain card holder that Sandisk may include with your card. It's designed to hold the card, but the cover that protects the card doesn't snap closed very tightly. As a result, dropping your keys (or letting them bounce around in your pocket for a while) may result in the card popping out of the case. Like a previous reviewer, I found this out the hard way. Luckily I was able to find my card on the ground by the rack where I had locked my bike.

Without ruining it for others- I loved it all except for the end where things began to get a little too 'zombie' like.It did keep me turning pages though and if you enjoy mysteres and thrillers I believe you will like this one as well/Over all I would recommend it as a good page turning read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read.","review":"Have you ever been on a lonely dark road at night and even though you \\"know\\" that ghosts arn't real the hair on the back of your neck begins to rise?

When the daughter of Susan Young get kidnapped and the strange voice on the end of her telephone tells her to follow a specific route from her childhood home town where she has to pick up the dead body, that she assumes is the corpse of a man she knows was killed many years before.The trip is an chilling trek from one town to another that only darkened and little known history has written a horrific connection between each of them.A must read for any supernatural or horror fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrifying","review":"I was really amazed by my inability to stop reading this book.

I'm not sure I've ever seen a film with so many of the hoary old set-pieces: generational conflict, angst and exasperation caused by the old-school immigrant parents, stressed young man hitting a career wall, cross cultural love, follow your heart, don't give up, and, the worst of all, the mysterious stranger with the solutions to all of life's problems, who blows into town, teaches the kids to dance or the adults to be tolerant, and then disappears, leaving his words of wisdom behind among the forever-changed acolytes.Not a bad film, no, not at all. But one done many times before, without anything to distinguish it from its innumerable predecessors. (And the notion that non-cooks can be brought into a kitchen and resolve a chaotic world is pretty silly.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"After waiting months for the dvd due to delays in the release I was hugely disappointed.

Amy writes movingly of the difficult decision to forego medical intervention in favor of \\"comfort care\\" which would keep the baby comfortable until death came naturally. She tells of the \\"strange twilight of grief\\" they lived in while waiting for Gabriel to be born. The story of Gabriel's birth and his few hours of life surrounded by loving family, is a testament to the power of love.The author is very compassionate and respectful of those parents who decide to opt for surgery).

I've also had a Norelco and Remington. This is the best razor I've owned by far. But then, all of the others where near the entry level models. The razor gives a close shave and moves smoothly across my face. And I don't have to go over my face a billion times to get the missed hairs. I have a dimple like Kirt Douglas and this razor cuts the hair and not my face. While my other rechargables required weekly charging, this one easily goes for a month.

Where is the cartridge (also not sent), supposed to go-without the stand? Amazon sent me a second shipment, and it too was missing the same items. There is clearly a communication problem between amazon advertising and amazon shipping. My one star is based on the fact that I did not receive a complete shipment, and can't use the item.

Since the new razors were costing $29 I decided to buy this factory reconditioned Braun. Some people have said it looks like new. No it does not. Battery life is good, excellent if you shave daily and beard is not grown for more than a day. But, still after shaving you can see some hairs on ur shirt and on top of the foil. Norelco scores full marks in this department, not even a single hair is left outside. And if I don't shave for a day I wouldn't try Braun the next day, its horrible with whiskers. The Norelco is also easy to go around the chin area.But, since my Norelco still works excellent on whiskers I still use it and use this Braun for daily shaving. Considering it price as compared to a new unit its an average deal considering that the reconditioned Braun does not come with the cleaning unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I replace an aging Braun with this reconditionned 7526. I'm very pleased with its power even when I used it unplugged. I always used it until the red light flashes then recharge it, probably every ten days (5 minutes a day). I clean it myself and don't need the fancy cleaner that only comes with the brand new shaver. The cut is not as close as a mechanical shaver but I'm very satisfied. The trimmer works great and cut correctly unlike the one on some cheaper shavers. Overall an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as ordered","review":"I didn't not receive all the self cleaning parts nor did customer service want to help much over the phone. The text has been changed since and so I had to fight them on what it said when I ordered. If it hadn't been for the other reviews I'd not have gotten my point across. Thanks guys! This is now the second problem I've had with Amazon. Are they not trying as hard? At least they gave me a 20% refund for all the hassle.The actual shaver is great, works well, but now I have to find a cleaning base to complete it. Feels much better then my old Braun which lasted many years. It is a great shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"After reading a number of reviews, I decided to give this shaver a try. I use an electric shaver as a touch-up for evenings out when I don't want to show the 5:00 shadow but don't want to pull out the razor.I shave in the shower -- and frankly, nothing is better. I tried to go all electric when this unit arrived -- but I just can't get the shave I'm used to. I'm sure I did not give my face enough time to adjust.I wasn't sure how I would like the pivot head -- but it's great. All in all, this is an excellent shaver for my use.Of course, it goes without saying -- Amazon is a delight to do business with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Heavy Beards","review":"I have always used an electric shaver. This product is my first Braun and it is large enough to fit my hand. Even using preshave, it takes more than 7 slow storkes to get most of the beard, more than 12 and still a slight stubble remains. It did not come with a charger-cleaner base. I find this is not necessary as releasing the foil & running for 5 seconds clears the cutters. Every third day I remove the foil & cutters, rinsing under hot water & gently brushing, then setting aside till dry.

Fortunately I took the time to read it! I have always had problems with sensitive skin in the past. I have tried just about every razor out there and nothing has helped much. I was a little skeptical that the Braun 7526 would be any better, but for the pice it was being offered at, I figured it was worth a try. I can't beging to describe how happy I have been with it! For the first time in 19 years of shaving, I can get a close shave on my neck without getting even the first sign of irritation. It's amazing! My only complaint is the same as most other customers giving reviews here. It is that the original description of the razor led us to believe that it came with the clean and charge base. It would have been nice to have. They've fixed the description since I purchased mine, so that people know they aren't getting the clean and charge base, and they've increased the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this ripoff prouct","review":"Beware it doesn't include the base. Amazon sells it without metioning this point. I have seen these exact same reconditioned model sold on ebay etc. and they all point out that fact. I emailed Amazon and they said it was too big of a problem to fix eight weeks ago. They still haven't updated their site to state that this does not include the cleaning base like a braun 7526 should. Truth in advertising is very impotant on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"reconditioned but call Braun if....","review":"I ordered this reconditioned shaver several weeks ago and figured that it would take me a few weeks to get acclimated to using an elecric shaver instead of the Gillette Mach 3 razor that I have been using. The shaver is great except, for me, it did not shave my neck thoroughly. I finally called Braun and they could not have been any more pro-active. They sent me a brand new cutter block/foil at no charge and it arrived in 3 days. I now get a very close shave and am very happy with my purchase. If you find any minor problems with your shaver, I suggest that you call Braun customer service as they seem eager to make sure that you are happy with their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not match Norelco Performance","review":"I have been using Norelco since past 3 years. I tried to go for Braun 7526 after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was not good.Pros:++ Little bit closer shave then Norelco.++ Good Price. Amazon rocks!!Cons:-- Need to clean every 2-3 days where as Norelco can be cleaned every 2 weeks.-- Unit was not very clean as described.-- Difficult to shave 2 or more days of growth.-- More noisy then Norelco-- Very Low Durability. The foil on my shaver is broken in just 3 months and it is not covered under warranty. So, I need to spend about $30 to replace the foil and cutter as they come together. I will rather discard this unit all together.-- Customer Service at Braun not upto professional standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shaver for the money","review":"I was replacing a very old Norelco unit, and I haven't kept up on the latest advancements, but I've been very pleased with this shaver.

I ended up buying a 6610 freeglider which I loved so much that I went out and bought there top of the line freeglider the 6900.My son just turned 15 and was ready for his first shave. I bought him this 7526 for his birthday. He loves it but he realy only has peach fuzz but does have a small mustach. I wanted to se how the razor was so I put it to the test. I used it a few times and have to admit that I think the razor is stronger than my 6900. I find it weighs more than my other shavers but it feels better in your hand. The shave was better and faster than my other shavers. I liked it so much that I bought another one to give to my brother in law for his birthday. For the price you can not get a better shaver and IMO you won't find a better shaver even if you were to spend twice as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refurb? I can't tell...excellent product","review":"I got the Refurb Braun 7526 about 2 weeks ago. My 1st shave was a bit irritating but all other shaves after felt great. I never saw any scratches of defects on this shaver, it's in perfect working condition. One charge lasts a really long time. I usually don't shave every day, and this shaver is able to cut through 3 or 4 days of beard with no problem. It however like all other foil shavers cannot shave under my neck cleanly, I still have to use a razor under my neck. I have found this to be the case of all foil shavers. This shaver is a great deal for the performance. $50 well spent. I hope braun makes a water proof version of this shaver in the future, this shaver cannot be used with wet shaves. This shaver feels great in my hand, nice size and weight. Excellent 2 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deal!!!","review":"Bought this reconditioned shaver after much debate.

This was the finest one for about 2 years. By now it stopped shaving. It became noisy and takes forever to get anything but a close shave. I noticed that the cutting block has a huge play. It has probably reached the level when it does not move through an entire hole in the foil any more. I do not think replacing the block would help since the hole in the plastic part that tranfers the motion to it got enlarged. Looks like it is a design flaw.

Ultimately, the problem was the cheap little plastic ON/OFF switch. Move it up and the shaver turned on. With much effort, I finally got the switch to slide up higher to the \\"clipper\\" mode. Problem was, it stayed stuck in this mode and would not budge downward. When I finally did get it down, the thin metal element beneath the switch was damaged. What a cheap, crappy switch Braun decided to use! Why, who knows. Amazon promptly refunded my money. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reconditioned Braun 7526 Shaver","review":"The shaver performs very well and provides a close shave.

Again the returned shaver works well and we are very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptic to Advocate in One Shave","review":"As with other reviewers, I had not used an electric shaver for 15 years and was never satisfied with the shave. The reconditioned Braun was selected as a trial run back to electric shaving without significant investment. From the first shave, I received a close, irritation-free result. I was so pleased that I searched the Web and found a source for the cleaning unit and promptly ordered it. The cleaning unit was also a great convenience in maintaining the Braun shaver (and I would encourage Amazon to make this unit available to their customers). My total investment was still less than half the cost of a new unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shaver at An Awesome Price.

Factor in the price of this refurbished model, as opposed to what you'd pay for a brand-new one, and you'll feel like a genius if you buy one of these.

Even right after shaving I can't get my lower jaw or neck as smooth as a twin blade could. And how's this - it takes LONGER to shave in the morning than it used to!So why am I still using it?

It shaves quite closely, and the battery has been going strong since the day I charged it, nearly two weeks ago.My experience has been great. I admit I had some trepidation about the possibility of blood-borne disease on the blades. But as any doctor or nurse can tell you, HIV (likely the worst-case scenario) is a very fragile virus and doesn't survive long outside the body.

However, now the power cuts off to razor whenever you add any pressure to the front (the side where the power slide-button is located.) This also happens to be where you hold the razor when you shave.

Von Glasersfeld very carefully builds up a conceptual notion of how humans acquire and modify their internal concepts of the world. After a careful summary of some leading historical thought in the area of meaning and constructivism, Prof. von Glasersfeld clearly shows the internal workings of how meaning is built up from experience and how we understand our meanings through continual negotation with the external world.This is one of the few books that I have seen that actually discusses the idea of \\"re-presentation\\", or how one's memories are stored and re-presented when triggered by a stimulus, such as a word. It is definitely enlightening to think about the transfer of meaning in this way and how it informs about the inherent limitations of computer intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock's greatest pinnacle on Four Amazing CD's","review":"All I have to say about the career of Steve Winwood is that he has never let anyone beat him.

Being able to crop, resize, add special effects (such as making a picture an animated gif or putting 3D into a picture), cloning parts of an image, erasing/adding areas back into the pic, and adding text are just small examples of how I continue to use this product.

I'm surprised MS has given up on graphics programs, I'm sure PhotoDraw would rate an easy 5 stars if they reintroduced it without any changes to the original, depending of course on price.

I would definately recommend this CD not only as an introduction to the delights of irish music but as a joyful experience on its own, and not only for children.

I then heard that Siouxsie & Budgie would continue with The Creatures.Wow.Okay, this is not Siouxsie's best album (I'll reserve that for Tinderbox), but this is exciting, interesting, and heavily textured music. Still following along the not-quite-Goth,not-quite- Punk, not-quite-Pop line, this album rolls off the presses strong and just keeps moving.Anything involving Budgie directly is going to have interesting percussion work and this album proves the tale. But above all else it is Siouxsie Sioux's voice that captures. After a quarter century (think about it) of singing, her voice is still strong, haunting, dramatic, and, well, sexy.If you have not tried them yet, give The Creatures a run with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep exploration","review":"an electrifying, thoroughly entertaining exploration of sound by true innovators.

I was so excited by erasercuts that this let me down. I was very elated when Hai was released!! There's the creatures I love (feast, boomerang and now Hai) and i cannot wait to see them next month!!! This compares (anima animus) to Superstition in the Banshees collection ...uninspired and commercial sounding, sterile and dull...and just as unlistened to by me as superstition.

Siouxsie has only been guilty of a few letdowns and even those can be pleasant compared to the majority of pop music today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Siouxsie and Budgie, back with a vengeance","review":"This is definitely their most solid work since the early 80's. Those disappointed by the lacklustre records the Banshees had been putting before their timely demise should give this a try. And don't be fooled by the opening track's (\\"2nd Floor\\") dance beat - Siouxsie's lyrics are razor-sharp. The album reads like a descent into obsession, desire, pain, loss - one song flowing seamlessly into the next, all shards of the same broken mirror. Budgie's drums lead the way, as in \\"Turn it On\\", where the thundering rhythm perfectly underscores the Siouxsie's stormy words. Other outsanding tracks: \\"Say\\", with its broken feelings and lost friendships, and the Apocalytic \\"Exterminating Angel\\" (\\"There are just Black Holes / Where the stars should've been...\\"). At one point, Siouxsie asks: \\"Are you happy now?\\". YES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's been missing...Here they come again...","review":"This pair, has always exuded a peerless, sexually charged charisma, that remains unchallanged to this day!

She's a versatile and ultra-modern animal: works in the car, on the dancefloor, in that dark, dank leather-bar on the outskirts of the red-light district (hurt me)! The choice is yours. From sublime radiance to fits of fury, there is enough here to meet or beat any mood. Plenty of catchy hooks blended with Sioux and Budgies'inimitable take on life, and all that makes it so interesting.My only sorrow is that it comes and goes too quickly...no doubt, exactly what these wicked creatures had intended all along!

Of the 26 songs, 9 were previously unreleased. Interestingly, the first four were from his psychedelic days when his lead singer was Charlie Daniels. Just an amazing guitarist who should be rated on the same level as SRV, Clapton, Page, Hendrix and so on. Some astounding covers of Down By The River, If Six Were Nine, Green Onions, Hey Joe, and Turn To Stone but the original stuff is just as good if not better, especially The Messiah Will Come Again which I used to always hear late at night on WBCN.

I intend to make a claim to get my money back to buy a Norelco.My previous shaver was a triple head Norelco.

Used them to secure items to a roof rack, hitch mounted rack and also used a couple to bind 4 camp chairs together for easier transport. You do have to make sure you feed the strap through correctly (there's an arrow etched into the buckle). The direction you're supposed to go is kind of counter intuitive and if you're backwards, you won't get a tight hold. I found that feeding the strap from below the buckle works best but is harder to do, so I just made sure I didn't pull the strap out completely when unloading. I also have ratcheting tie downs and while it's easier to get a really tight cinch with those, these are generally easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works VERY well","review":"Worked for foam boards, large storage bag, etc... has not let us down yet... much more secure than just using a bungee cord!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The lady definitely owns a Doberman","review":"I thought this was a great book.

In Black Storm Comin, we get an insiders look not only into the Pony Express but also the challenges faced by the bi-racial rider. And the horses! Wilson can write about horses like no one else - she's taking over where Marguite Henry left off. This is a great read and I look forward to her next one.

First off, the magic section makes very little sense with regards to the drain and mana system, and the aspected magician isn't explained at all. Secondly, the Matrix uses overcomplicated rules for even simple tasks. The technical jargon used was quite confusing.

It is a difficult book to digest - endless esoteric/multi-lingual comments, an ok plot with a somewhat predictable ending, and a hero who loves to spout off, but does little talking about why he is innocent of all the crimes of which he is accused. Obviously some people have loved it, but the one word that I would use to describe it, besides challenging, is oblique.

Never have I been so utterly bored by a book. Dunnett's highly self-conscious, thick-as-molasses writing \\"style\\" reads like a very bad first draft. The most painful of Dunnet's many instruments of torture are her action sequences; rather than racing along as an action sequence should, Dunnet turns thoughts, words and deeds that should be happening in a matter of seconds into a page or two (or three) of thick, glutinous, unreadable mess.As for the hideously mangled and unnecessarily complicated multiple plot lines, if anyone has read this book and claims they can remember from one page to the next what is going on, they're lying.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game of King's","review":"Could not get into the story due to a million references that I had no idea what their meaning was.

Above and beyond good, it had me reading so fast that I could hardly keep up with myself. It is increadible- the plot, the charachers the writing......Usually my favorite charachter in a book is rarely the main one, but Lymond possesed so many different twists and turns- now cold, now vulnerable, always witty- that it was impossible not to love him. And impossible not to love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few first novels are superb, but Dunnett did it","review":"I began reading the Lymond Chronicles when I was 18, and read as much of the series of six books as I possessed at least once a year (sometimes twice!) until The Ringed Castle was published when I was in my mid thirties. Difficult, challenging, wonderful writing, plotting like unto the Gordian Knot, and a protagonist that brooks no comparison. The challenge for me with Game of Kings (with its wondrous first chapter!) is that there is a predecessor book \\"understood\\" before it which the reader must write in her/his own mind, as well as the overarching \\"book\\" of his parents' love story. This is reading for grown-ups, and smart ones at that! Dunnett is the best historical writer I know, with the funniest, most tragic, most graphic eye and ear there is. Read it, and the others; give it to the people you cherish. Game of Kings will introduce you to characters that will mystify you, awe you, and challenge you to out-think them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premeire of a Great Series","review":"The Lymond Chronicles are the most amazing series of historical fiction I've ever read. And I've read a lot of historical fiction. Dunnett does a brilliant job of developing a complex story line that you can read over and over and still discover links in the chain.Game of Kings introduces us to Lymond, the brilliant young Renaissance man who is always trying to explain himself to people who not only don't understand him, but that don't understand how his mind works. But Dunnett does a masterful job of both keeping us in suspense about Lymond's motives while at the same time creating a sympathetic character.Read this book--it won't disappoint. Then read the rest of the series--they won't disappoint either."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sure sounded good","review":"I tried, I really did, but after about 65 pages I knew I had lost much of this story. The author weaves other languages into the characters dialogue and with the number of characters it gets confusing.

It requires all brain cells to be active, and a degree in languages wouldn't hurt. Bravo to those who got through this for it seems the reward is a great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the anguish","review":"Although I have a great appreciation for historical fiction, I am really floored by sentences such as: \\"Twelve crowns for a teazle o'Tay sand and chopped henbane and a week's rakings from the doocote!\\" (page 37) Excuse me! Writing like this-probably a fine representation of the Scottish dialect of that period-is still painful to trudge through and turned a relaxing read into a headache!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for this book to get good","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who have rated this book poorly. It was so boring. I truly kept waiting for the book to get good because I really wanted to like it. I finally put it down with 50 pages left -- at that point I knew it was not getting any better. I was actually relieved to start a new book. The Game of Kings is not worth the time, money, or painstaking effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"still struggling on...and on...","review":"I am still strugeling through the second or third chapter and I feel dumb! I am an avid lover of historical works, but this is just beyond me. Dunnett's writing is so convoluted and lengthy I can't tell what is going on from page to page. At one point Lymond and his sister-in-law spent two pages on an argument, I had no idea untill the end when the woman feels bad for their fight, what fight? where? This book only suceeds in making the reader feel inferior, I'm constantally left with the impression that major things are going on and being said, but I just don't quite get it... I'm giving up and going back to the real Scottish hero...Jamie in the Outlander Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be a polyglot to enjoy this book","review":"Although Ms. Dunnett clearly understands the time period in which this story takes place, her ability to use her large knowledge base to make an enjoyable reading experience for the reader is lacking. The writing is so full of arcane French, Latin and Olde English references that she may be the only person who can fully understand it. It was so annoying to have to keep skipping over these long rambling passages and conversations. I have a postgraduate degree and am an avid reader of historical fiction and still found that I simply had to ignore a great deal of the book. The only explanation I have is that Ms. Dunnett was attempting to impress the reader rather than entertain him. I have no intention of reading any of the remainder of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree: \\"Huh?!\\"","review":"I'm a historical fiction buff, and I got so excited by all these rave reviews of the Lymond Chronicles, I bought the whole series. I'm less than 100 pages into \\"Game of Kings\\" and I believe I've never read anything more bo-ring in my life. With all the flowery language and multi-lingual quoting, I still haven't a clue as to WHAT is going on, and not one of the characters, not even the infamous Lymond, has been able to hold my interest. I'm going to stick it out with \\"Game\\"...but I have a feeling I'll be trekking back to the post office with the other five books. Oh well. Can't please everyone. Vive la difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history, nuanced characters","review":"Dunnett's book is a tour de force of the mid-16th century social and political tumult plaguing Scotland. The real strength of this piece is the nuanced characters, who are passionate, believable and sympathetic. Dunnett gives equal play to the lords and the lackeys, demonstrating that history isn't just about great battles and great men. For any who enjoy gritty history in the hands of a sophisticated, thoughtful novelist, this book is for you.Aesthetically, the cover treatment is exceedingly well designed; unfortunately, it's not matched by the print quality, which is variable at best. Shame on Vintage!In sum, Dunnett's book is a keeper; one that you'll want to pick up again in a few years. I look forward to seeing the softcover publication of Dunnett's Niccolo series in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort","review":"This was the first Dunnett I read and there was at least one moment when I thought I wanted to give up, or at least put it aside for a while. But I stuck with it and am very glad I did -- I will definitely read the rest of the series. The writing is complex and a bit \\"old-fashioned\\", and I don't get all of the literary references and foreign-language quotes --but I found that \\"digesting\\" only 80% of this book is still more fulfilling than 100% of most others. (And it's nice to leave something to discover for the second read!) Wonderful plot twists, exciting story, historically and geographically accurate as far as I know, well-developed characters (even the minor ones) -- I can't ask for much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"I don't like to give bad reviews but... I couldn't follow this book- and I gave up about 30% into it. I read other reviews that said not to give up, it gets better, so I tried...but I just couldn't spend anymore time trying to figure out what the heck they were talking about. I got frustrated and quit. I'm not sure who I could recommend this series to but if you can follow it, I envy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lymond is back\\"","review":"I'm officially addicted. Francis Crawford of Lymond is the most intriguing and intelligent protagonist I've ever encountered. Written beautifully (sometimes difficultly, with multiple languages, but don't let this discourage you!), and the plot is absolutely engrossing.I found myself breaking lunch plans, or leaving a friend's house early, just to get back to this book. I have no idea why the goodreads description classifies it as \\"romance\\" -- nothing in this story would warrant that label (maybe in the later books?). I've already rushed to the library to pick up the second book in the series and I can't wait to get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting....if only I knew what was going on","review":"Well, I've just about given up on reading the Lymond series. I've tried each book about three times, and still don't know the precise plots in each. These books must be the hardest to comprehend...and for a law student who has to read through numerous complex cases, that is really saying something about the intricacy of both Dunnett's plots and prose. As soon as I think that I've managed to understand the plot and innuendos behind all that fancy language, the next few pages soon leaves me stranded in confusion. And, the amazing thing is, despite all this headache, somehow, I still like the Lymond series!!! They really make you think, it's worst than studying a textbook (almost). And one day- eventually- I'm sure I'll manage to understand everything that happens in all 6 books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The books that have traveled the world with me","review":"I have been reading Dorothy Dunnett for well over 30 years and her books have been my mainstay while living in 5 countries.

I have read some of the more critical review that find the books \\"heavy and boring\\" while I find her use of words as musical. As to the quotes and poetry in other languages that others found pretentious, I found challenging and in character with a well educated noble of Scotland at that time in history.

To those critics - Obviously you would be happier with a Danielle Steele novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T STOP READING","review":"Don't stop reading after the first few pages! That's exactly what I did when my sister gave me this one to read. When she asked me if I liked it, I told her I couldn't read it, the main character was just too horrible! She laughed and told me to keep reading, and it is by far the best book I've read in my life. The only books I like as well are those in M.K.Wren's \\"Phoenix\\" trilogy, which have their own unique style, purpose, and tempo.A word of advice, though: Keep a dictionary handy, at least an English one, if not French and Italian dictionaries and a set of encyclopedias.

Do not even bother to buy one book at a time you might end up without one to read and get very frustrated. It is simple I couldn't put it down and wish there was more books like that. When Dunnett described a place I knew, I was stunned about her exactitude and precision. And enjoyed to still learn more.

At the time I was young and unfortunatly very much convinced that the government had solutions to our problems. This book made me realize how much I had been duped by the socialist propaganda of mainstream media. Don't get me wrong, I did not become an instant \\"right winger\\". In fact, it made me conclude that I did not know much and needed to start from scratch and throw out all my old assumptions. I decided to subscribe to The New Republic(left), The conservative Chronical(right) and Reason (Libertarian). After a year of reading these publications from cover to cover, I realized that the Libertarian philosphy actually held the answers our society desperatly needs to actually succeed in resolving issues like environmental neglect or abuse.

The sound is generally very poor, Harris' vocals are shaky and hoarse and overall I'd suggest even fans of the post-Gram Parsons Burritos should avoid this.For a far better document of this lineup, invest in 'Live From Europe' instead, which sounds much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"On a good night (and with a good lineup), the Flying Burrito Brothers can be one of the most dynamic and entertaining bands in the business. Unfortunately, however, this particular set is not one of those. This is another of those lineups put together by Sneaky Pete in order to make a few quick bucks on the concert circuit. Greg Harris, Jim Goodall, and Skip Battin round out this version of the FBB, and they are simply awful. They play a mix of FBB and Byrds standards, and play none of them particularly well. This is probably the only FBB album worse than the dreadful \\"Close Encounters to the West Coast\\", which at least featured Gib Guilbeau. This one, however, is pure .... from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"The good folks at Relix Records seem to feel that every possible FBB concert should be released on CD, regardless of the quality of the particular performance (rather like the Grateful Dead). There is nothing about this show which makes it worthy of having been recorded, let alone released as a CD. Neither John Beland nor Gib Guilbeau were around for this one, so we have Sneaky Pete, Skip Battin, Greg Harris, and Jim Goodall slogging their way through a mixture of Burrito and Byrds numbers and a few old country standards, doing justice to none of them.

Suffice it to say, you will probably find yourself reading and rereading some pages to understand her well. In spite of that, her work has been incredibly important to the new-age and metaphysical movement. When you read this you will come to find out why the \\"new age\\" isn't new at all and that the topic of metaphysics has been something that has endured for thousands of years.I am suprised that so many modern authors (like Tolle) avoid mentioning her work.

Music: 1/2 starI don't even know why they bothered with music- it's boring and repetitive.2. Graphics: 1 starThe DS is capable of a LOT better graphic than this game has-take Mario Kart, for example.3. Controls: 2 starsA little touchy, but I suppose they just take some getting used to.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the riders look pretty good, and you can customize them a lot. But other than that, the graphics look like Majesco tried to make them in a week. Seriously. It's really pathetic. I highly advise you save yourself the agony of this game and go but something like Mario Kart or Castlevania (good games!) because ATV Quad Fury is an insult to gamers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst game I have ever played","review":"I would actually rate this game at a 1/2 star, it is that bad.

I just used it as a sleeping aid. I still thought it was dreadfully boring even 20 someodd years later.

However, this is the most boring movie I've ever watched. So the guy can run. But when does his superb srinting ever get exciting? So he falls down and gets up again (and somehow wins). Uplifting. So they run through water in white shirts. They're not women. If you want a running movie, try Prefontaine, which isn't even that good either. The music is the only thing halfway decent in this film, but I have lots more fun tuning into Van Halen on my iPod. The guys behind this movie should've known that running is boring enough as it is and you really can't make a movie about it, be you British, preppy, or fast. Want a sports movie: try baseball. Field of Dreams, The Natural, Major League. Basketball: Hoosiers. Boxing: Rocky, Raging Bull, The Hurricane. What can be a more boring sports movie than one about running?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sports Tale","review":"Chariots of Fire is an excellent movie for the fan of a good dramatic film and an open minded sports fan.

It is a story that enobles all in it, dealing with religion and principle and commitment and social class in truly insightful and inspiring ways. Because it is one of my favorites, I quickly bought the movie when I realized it was available in DVD without reading the technical specs closely. Alas, it is currently only available in standard format. That's a pity, because the wide screen views would have been magnificent. To the manufacturers, I say, please, release this in wide format and I'll buy another copy. This movie is worth it.

They created this wide-screen version of \\"Chariots of Fire, Two Disk Special Edition\\" by chopping off the top and bottom (or just the bottom) of the old full-screen version of the same title. In other words, the old full-screen version has more screen to watch.I don't think they even bothered to remaster this from the original tape, because the old full screen version is actually sharper on my monitor screen than this wide screen version if I watch them side by side.

Many people complain because the DVD isn't widescreen. It's in Pan & Scan because a widescreen version does not exist. According to the \\"official\\" Internet DVD FAQ (relating to this dvd, among others):\\"Some titles are available only in pan & scan because there was no letterbox or anamorphic transfer made from film. Since transfers cost $50,000 to $100,000, studios may not think a new transfer is justified. In some cases the original film or rights to it are no longer available for a new transfer.

We often hear of rock vocalist such as Paul Rodgers or Glenn Hughes who have great range and can hit any note in any key; Michael is there counterpart on the guitar. He can play loud, soft, fast, furious, with finesse, plugged or unplugged (the VH-1 soon to be obsolete term). This acoustic release show a kindler, gentler, but no less masterful side of Schenker's playing. It is a must have for any Schenker fan. Most importantly the album invites repeated listenings.

If making it accessible to more music lovers grows the opera audience, it can only be good. Having grown up with an Italian Boheme,I did occasionally wish for the liquid vowels.

It's not La Boheme but The Bohemians. I have no desire to hear an opera sung in any language other that the one is was composed for. Not snobbery; the sound of the words are matched to the music and it's ruined unless it's sung in the language it was written for. Amazon might have been willing to refund my purchase but I don't penalize others for my mistakes. Besides mere money couldn't have replaced the sheer satisfaction I got from taking my pliers and other tools and reducing both the disk and the container it came in to small pieces which now reside in my trash can.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best method book...","review":"Been wrestling with the guitar (acoustic & electric) for longer than I want to admit (like the saying goes, it's an easy instrument to play---badly!) but I have fun so what the hey. Anyway, along the way I've amassed a variety of guitar books/dvd's; IMHO this is probably one of the best method books and a good place to start. I like the structure of the lessons, how they progress and how they build on each other. It encourages basic sight reading (there's no tab). For the most part, I liked the varied selection of songs used. The availability of the DVD makes for an OK supplement. Maybe add in Alfred's Basic Guitar Method - Complete, then supplement them with something like Teach Yourself Visually Guitar, a Dummies book, or the Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Guitar cd-rom. Or, if you like the Beatles, throw in Hal Leonard's From Liverpool to Abbey Road-A Beginning Guitar Method, and there's plenty to work with and maintain interest, but best of all, to have fun with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar instruction","review":"This is a great instruction book. I have some experience playing guitar so the beginning instruction was a little basic, but it still has a lot of good material. This book is perfect for the beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"good at showing the chords .the cds were not helpful at all no explanations just music nothing else no notes or pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series!","review":"This is a great system for learning the guitar. The instructions and photos are clear and this gets you reading music and playing tunes quickly. (Includes TAB in the second book) - since all three volumes of this serires are bound in one terrific spiral binding - this is an excellent value. I am a pianist and like this system because it gets into reading notes immediately. I tried another system that did not explain what notes were where on the guitar and found it frustrating since I knew where they were on the piano, I wanted to know where they were on the guitar - not just where to place my fingers. This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hal Leanard Guitar Method","review":"My 9 and 7 yr old boys are both taking their first guitar lessons and it seems ok....the CD is a bit confusing..I couldn't tell what music it was corresponding to at first because it was going too fast. It should say \\"now we're doing sample #1\\" etc. I like the idea that all three books were together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing method, finally I am making progress","review":"I was so furstrating when I start self-learning to play guitar after getting some lessoons from a teacher, but I am really making a progress by using this book as I start playing music notes gradually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Beginners","review":"I have found this book to be very helpful in teaching myself how to play the guitar. I already knew how to read music, but if you don't already know this book does provide instruction on those basics. I like that it comes with a CD so you can hear the songs in the book being played. This is really helpful on some of the songs I am not familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we needed","review":"My 11 yr old daughter was required to get this for her beginning group guitar class and it was exactly what she needed. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"The book had, and has everything I was looking for. It has a steady learning curve for reading both music and tabs, and only a week into learning the guitar I can already play a few songs. Great product, and anyone seeking to learn guitar or simply better themselves at it, should have this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled by the high reviews","review":"I could not wait to get this book. I wanted to learn the guitar, or at least get to the point where I could take lessons and have some prior knowledge of the guitar. I should say that I have no musical education and never played an instrument. The book goes into musical symbols and notes. If you never read music you never will following these instructions. By page 12 he has you playing Ode to Joy, please! Your lucky to know which hole the music comes out of.After going to other book stores I can say there are much better sources to teach you the basics of playing the guitar. Also, you and go to the internet and find much better ( free) lessons that will giver you the very basics that will get you on the way.Don't make the same mistake that I did, pass on this book if you are looking for a beginner instructional book. If your a music teacher like some of the reviewers are, then maybe this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I bought this book for my daughter's guitar lessons. She has been taking them for two months and she has been doing very well. Unfortunately, pages 15-30 are missing from her book and we just now realized it since she just got to page 15. We are passed the point of being able to return the book, but now I guess I have to buy another one and hope it has all the pages. I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap","review":"i cant believe so many people rated this book so high, the book gives very little explaination, has the most boring sounds ever played in the music business. this book is a joke. this book will guarantee to want you to take up piano. save your money and buy the guitar for dummies and enjoy your guitar, an the cd that comes with it 99% of the sounds on it sounds like a cat on crack in a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindling for your campfire jam ...","review":"All these positive reviews make me want to vomit. It's wasting the time and money of so many students. Why this is such a popular method I'll never understand.This book does nothing and goes nowhere. Each page is so contentless that you'd wonder how it ever got published. To put it into perspective, Mel Bay's \\"Method for Modern Guitar\\" covers more ground in 48 pages (still at a comfortable pace ... it's the one I use with my students) than all three volumes of the Hal Leonard series. That's sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"music lessons","review":"Great book/lessons,I just recently started teaching myself guitar,so I needed an updated set of lessons,could not be happier with this choice !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap book!","review":"the price on this book is well worth it. i'm a beginner and the book & cd's are great. i can easily follow along and learn the notes and chords. i especially like that there are tracks from the cd to reinforce my learning of the notes and chords."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start","review":"A very nice logically laid out approach when it comes to learning guitar. It teaches with sheet music so you learn how to read as it builds upon previous lessons. I'd recommend this one to those looking to learn how to play the guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have fun learning and getting well on your way!","review":"I love this guitar course and think that it is exceptional for the beginner because even at lesson one, while you are learning a few notes and open strings you are playing along with great, fun tracks that will teach you rhythm as well as how to read the notes on the guitar. So many people jump immediately into strumming chords on songs, but when you don't get the proper and correct foundation in music you are going to be limited later on. I can't recommend this course enough! Who knew that learning the \\"basics\\" could be so much fun?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to learn guitar","review":"I originally got book 1 in this series becasue it was the book that my guitar class used but i decieded to go ahead and get this 3 in 1 addition. When i first started this book i never thought i would even get threw ode to joy but praticing, this book and buying a better guitar have helped me. The class is still on book 1 but i have allready done some of the stuff that is in book 2 and 3. What really helps me is to write done the sting and fret about each note. A big plus about this book is that it teaches you to read sheet music so you can look at sheet music and play it. Most of the dvds out there dont even teach you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Value","review":"I already had a copy of the first Hal Leonard Guitar Method when I purchased this combination of all three books with the CDs. The CDs make all the difference. Don't buy without them. I struggled my way through the first book without the CD. I'm now reviewing everything from the first book with the CDs and it makes 100 times more sense to me now. I own a bunch of Hal Leonard titles, and they are all well written and easy to understand. You can't go wrong with Hal Leonard and this combo deal is a steal. For the price you can hardly buy one book with the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"best guitar book","review":"I never played guitar before and I was able to learn a lot with this book and the 3 CDs and all this come at an incredibly low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Between the Two","review":"I also have Alfred's Guitar Method - First of Three Books...... Hal Leonard's Guitar Method - Complete Edition, gives you a lot more for a lot less and I think presents the subject matter in a much better way.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar book!","review":"I originally started with another \\"learning guitar\\" series, and I hated it. The songs were boring. This book was way better. The songs were more interesting and fun to play. Plus there were more topics covered - different key signatures, strum patterns, and tablature. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am learning.","review":"I initially purchased the first book/DVD and was very impressed. This led me to purchase the Complete Edition. I honestly would like the Complete Edition better if there was another DVD for books 2 and 3 and more tunes that I am familiar with. The 1st book had many tunes that I alread knew and could feel my way through the learning a bit better.I do find myself moving ahead into more challenging material and still have much more to learn. I think the complete edition also provides a great general overview of topics that can be further built upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars from a beginner","review":"I've always liked guitar music and wished I could play. I finally bought a guitar and the music shop recommended the Hal Leonard book one. I bought it and worked diligently (almost). It seemed to be just right to learn from. The skills weren't too easy, nor too difficult, and the progress from one to the next was smooth. I also enjoyed playing songs, most of which I was familiar with (folk, religious, blues). So, I purchased the three book set from Amazon and am playing the guitar! Not well, mind you, but it's satisfying to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hal Leonard Guitar Methad","review":"Just started but so far good - however could used a little more vedio instructions on proper way to fret and pic/play the strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches Notes, then Chords","review":"This book spends time teaching how to read treble clef music and then moves on to chords. Good approach for well-rounded musicians. But, students who want to start strumming right off the bat will be disappointed with having to learn to read notes at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy completo","review":"For beginners is great, is very thorough, takes you to the most basic to more advanced, understandably, very good the cd with the tracks, generally excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for a good start","review":"- A really nice book. At very first u might think that why its so confusing. But if u know how to read music, its so easy and interesting. I will strongly recommend to go to a guitar teacher and tell him to teach u using this book. After very first lesson every thing will seem so easy to u.Good luckNauman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives teachers a head start!","review":"I've found that the years of experience Will Schmid has have given me a head start with understanding how to teach my new students the basics of guitar playing and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good series","review":"This is a very good series for a beginner, or for someone self taught who is looking to go back and fill in the gaps in their knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backfill Please","review":"This is the poorest effort yet in the post return to Earth of the Starship Voyager. Chakotay as a Captain is as bad as he was as first officer. Sprinkling in Janeway, Kim and Paris can't save this mishmash of Skyspirits, Changlings and Cardassians. Please Voyager writers, go back and fill in the years Voyager was under the Captainship of Janeway still lost in the Delta Quadrant."},{"rating":"1","title":"First grade writing and reading","review":"Let me start off by saying i love voyager, the series and while the homecoming books were okay, i still enjoyed them. These two books were so simply written it almost made me feel dumber while reading them. Yes, I found some pleasure in reading them because I\`m hooked on Voyager and wanted to see what everyone was up to but the storyline was stupid. The whole part with Chakotay and his native american powers? The cat coming out into the real world? Where was Christie Golden going with this? It was just ridiculous.So, I guess I can say that if you want to keep up on Voyager and you\`re a fan, read the books. You\`ll finish them both in about an hour. But don\`t be looking for great writing and a profound storyline, like the Deep Space Nine books. And Christie, if you\`re reading this review, step it up a little in your writing. More original ideas and write for adults, not third graders. We\`re capable of a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corel Wordperfect 8","review":"This is a fantastic book. I am a college instructor and am currently using this book in my beginning and intermediate class. I have used the previous versions that this author created for Wordperfect and my students loved them. It is easy to read and understand without being simple. The first half of the book is for a beginning class and the second half is for an intermediate class. A student could learn this program without an instructor if they used this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent parenting resource","review":"Anson provides both a philosophical framework and practical suggestions for enlisting your kids as partners and sharing the responsibility for every-day chores, as well as teaching them larger life lessons and living skills. Very easy to read and with helpful ideas for specific kinds of problems such as organization and keeping the bedroom clean. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rationalization for slavery and slaughter","review":"The book that spawned the deaths of over 100 million people in the 20th Century is, ironically, only a boring litany of economic fallacies. The poverty of the labor theory of value, the absurdity of economic progress without a price system, and the necessary terror that accompanies socialism are all exposed in detail in George Reisman's CAPITALISM. All of you poor proletarians with computers out to read how effortlessly a real economist dismantles your dogma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grooving Hard-Bop, nice tunes and solos","review":"Some of the best recorded music of the late fifties happened, when Donald Byrd and Jackie McLean were playing together. They really formed a great team, each of them plays as a sideman on the other one's recording dates, so imagine, if you might do a blindfold-test, it would be quite hard to guess, who of them is the leader. Donald Byrd wrote beautiful swinging tunes for this album and everybody plays great, so hard-bop fans will really enjoy that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got Broiled","review":"I had one of these grills for 14 years and the bottom finally rusted through causing the need for replacement. Because of the features: adjustable grilling surface, vents and side tables I purchased the same model again.I knew the assembly difficulties but was willing to accept them. When I started assembly I could tell immediately that all the steel parts are a lot thinner than the original one. The lid does not have as tight a fit to the bottom half as the original and overall quality is a lot less. Also, while I understand inflation the original only cost me about $35 while the replacement including shipping was more the twice the cost. Next time around I will definitely look at other brands with the same features."},{"rating":"1","title":"goldenbear","review":"i buy one of these grills every 4-5 years. i really like the style and convenience of it. however this year meco has cut the quality. it rattles and the nuts and bolts fall off often having to be replaced. if you tighten them too much, they inhibit the operation of the lid...shame on you meco...i'd rather pay a little more for the older quality...good thing i still kept my old grill, which i use more than the new one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be fair","review":"I'm into action and adventure, the more going on the better. I found this a tad dull, I enjoyed the cast of characters, and even the story plot. But it was slow for my taste. However, it works for a rainy afternoon's entertainment. A bit of violence and language is about as risque as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crep !!!","review":"I'm watching this right now on cable and it is an unbelievable piece of holy cow! The long review below is right on, so many plot holes! I found myself making MST3K comments throughout the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So delicious!!! Not a guilty snack, either.","review":"These are so good. One of my favorite snacks. I don't feel bad munching on them either. I think I will try some other varieties from Sahale now. I first found these at my local health food store and was very excited to find them on Amzn because they are cheaper here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these nuts!","review":"I never liked almonds until I tried these! They have a wonderful glaze that really makes them tasty. Great healthy snack throughout the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, hard to find","review":"These are my favorite blend of almonds. I've had a really tough time finding them in stock anywhere.It's a great combination of flavors with apples, cayenne pepper, balsamic vinegar and almonds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other flavors are good, but not Barbeque!","review":"I bought 3 different flavors as I'm gluten free and they seemed safe. The PB & J was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good. The Almonds w/Cranberries is pretty good too! The Barbeque I didn't like AT ALL, they taste strictly like Chipotle, you cannot taste any Ranch, or Barbeque taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overloaded with sesame seeds and too chewy!","review":"The overload of sesame seeds ruined the taste for me. The nuts were chewy instead of crispy and it was mostly nuts, not many cranberries. Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and \\"chewy\\" nuts ruined it for me. They may have been stale but the lack of a expiration date made that unclear so I trust Amazon wouldn't send me expired goods although they have before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sahale Valdosta Blend","review":"If you like it hot, this is te snack for you. It has great content but it was too peppery for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting taste","review":"I got this product as part of a six-flavor package. It turned out to be the only Sahale product that I have tried that is bad. Worse than bad. Terrible. Disgusting. How did this stuff get past the corpoate taste tests? It is even worse than Emerald brand dry roasted almonds, which are awful because of the garlic and onion added. I love plain salted roasted almonds, and thought Sahale could find a way to make them even better tasting. Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange texture and taste","review":"I bought these several days ago from our local supermarket and was very disappointed. The nuts were chewy and slightly soft..is this normal and yes they were months from expiration. Yuck at the softness, however. Then there was a strange texture of hard, little bumps on this softened nut..another yuck. The taste of the flavors blended wasn't my thing either..all wrong in my opinion. I gave it a two because it was edible but will never repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is one nasty product","review":"I ordered some of these and some pbj sahale snacks. The PBJ is great! This product though it honestly tastes like vomit or something of similar taste enjoy if you like that taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was planning to buy Mr's May's Almonds and Cashews but they were out of stock at amazon so I decided to buy Sahale's Sing Buri and Soledad. Did not like the taste of either of them. Highly Disappointed. Will wait for Mr's May's to be back in stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I really like several of the Sahale products, my favorite being the Valdosta blend (almond/cranberries). This one, however, is not going to be one I'll buy again. Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do. While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple. I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me. I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I bought 3 different flavors as I'm gluten free and they seemed safe. The PB & J was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good. The Almons w/Cranberries is pretty good too! The Barbecue I didn't like AT ALL, they taste strictly like Chipotle, you cannot taste any Ranch, or Barbecue taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Sorry, but I really thought these were awful. My husband didn't like them either and he's really into natural foods. It wasn't the spice & sweet mixture that we didn't like - it just didn't taste good at all. One bag we got was very stale but the others seemed fine. I ended up selling them on ebay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Snack!","review":"I really enjoyed this item. It covers sweet and salty cravings in one delicious snack. I plan to order it again and try some of the other items they have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Thing to Do to an Innocent Cashew","review":"I tried these after enjoying the Valdosta and Ksar blends (which, I realize, are not glazed) - but to me, the combination of vanilla and cashews renders them both bland. Also, the pomegranate is a little thin on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent snacks","review":"Not boring, interesting taste and combination of healthful food items.

They are definitly not bland which is why I like them, some have a bit of kick, love the lemongrass in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrumptious!","review":"Just bought my first pouch today at my local Publix and they're already gone! It's hard to describe what a treat these are with the combination of sweet and savory, salt, vanilla, and pomegranate flavors. I just wish it was an organic product, but flavor-wise, no complaints! The price on Amazon is 20% less than at my grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice for a snack","review":"These are really a great snack and the pouch size is perfect to share. Everyone I have had try them, loves them! Not too sweet, just enough for when you have that craving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible and Incredibly Addictive!","review":"I love these Cashews. However, they are evil! I can not open a bag when I am alone because then I end up eating the whole bag by myself in one sitting. They have just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. I gave two bags of these to my paw-in-law and he couldn't stop raving about how good these were. (I earned some points with him) I would recommend these to anyone who likes cashews, pomegrantes, and/or vanilla. All the flavors are represented and compliment each other very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is grand, really really grand!","review":"I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!Scrumptious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive? Yes!","review":"Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too salty","review":"Looks good but this is too salty. They can reduce salt without making it less tasty. Hope they make this change."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET AND SAVORY","review":"The Chipotle and Ranch almonds is by far my favorite flavor. It's savory and sweet at the same time. I was sad when Starbucks stopped carrying these. Good thing Amazon have these available.

It amazes me how this company comes up with so many mouth watering flavors, especially this one. The combination of pomegranate, vanilla, and cashews is fantastic.

Turn the volume up to at least 7. Stand back and observe, sipping your highball as if you already knew how to relish the good life. And look at the little monkeys!

As far as I know no one was impressed with it and had many problems with it.First, Foltz starts out speaking of religons that hardly anyone in the class had heard of as if we are supposed to know all about them. He does explain them later, but in the first chapters he refrences them without giving any backround information. Most of us were relativly inteligant and felt as if Fotlz were making fools of us.

Knowing what rare fish look like is nice but not helpful for most novice collectors. In most pet stores these exotic fish are not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough but out of date.","review":"Book is from before 2001 and was missing key fish now widely available for purchase for a freshwater aquarium. Book arrived in fair condition, Not bad considering it was on old Library copy. More pictures than information.

This book is a fascinating account of architect Burnham's personal and professional life, and is bound to be interesting to students both of architecture, history and human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first mobley album","review":"Great playing from this underappreciated tenor. Yes, this session is perhaps another blue note blowing session with not much in the way of memorable tunes....although the soloist are strong enough that you just don't care. I first heard this recording about 15 years ago ( my first exposure to Mobley ) and am glad this has been put out on CD. I have a good number of Mobley discs in my collection and this as well as Roll Call are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal arrangements and playing!","review":"I've read (not on amazon) some critics reviews of this album where they called it overly complex. Well I don't know what album that they were listening to. The rhythms, syncopations, and timing are so well orchestrated and flow so easily I don't know how anyone (with a good ear) could have anything but praise for this fabulous disc.Although I only own 3 of Hank's albums this one is by far the best that I own to this point. The first time I heard it in a record store I was like 'What is that?' Man it just really grabbed me and now it's probably one of my favorite Jazz discs. And that's even beating out stuff by Miles, Dizzy, Coltrane, ...Its' sugar for the ears"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sink divider protector w/ built in spot for dish sponge - it really works","review":"i had one of these for years but finally the suction cups quit working.

The single piece of tape that was place on top of the package came off; the post office wrapped the package with some priority mail tape. The muffins were put in a box that was to large and the stuffing did not work. I received an email the same day the package was delivery saying that the post office was unable to delivery the package to me and that I would have to pick it up at the post office. The post office did delivery the package to me and has delivered packages in the past without me having to pick them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great contribution by one of the best experts","review":"Sabrina Petra Ramet is by far one of the most respected authorities on the subject of Balkan politics. Her skill as a political scientist and her sheer knowledge of the area and the topic come through completely in this volume. That this book got a glowing introduction by Dr. Ivo Banac - another great authority on the 20th century history of the Balkans - is a testament to its value to the literature.In reference to the previous reviewer - this is an account that is not at all biased. And Prof. Ramet can hardly be blamed of warmongering. If lamenting the indecisiveness of the world community to react to attrocities and war crimes not seen since WWII is warmongering, then I don't know what isn't. Prof. Ramet is spot on in her analysis. I warmly recommend this book to anybody who wants to really learn about what once was Yugoslavia and why it fell apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor understanding of historical facts","review":"By the way, Serbs did not really annex Kosovo in 19th century. If so how would the author explain the existence of so many historical buildings that date from before the invasion of Turks during Ottoman Empire and were being built over centuries? Has the author looked carefully into the history of Southern Slavs from 7th century to the time before 1918? Further, there is a major difference between Chetnks and Ustashas in terms of their motives for the atrocities both did. The former were brutal political opponents, killing in the name of King no matter the nationality. The latter were brutal nationalists, killing those of other ethnic origin or religion.And so on, many details are distorted to fit the author's prejudice. It is important to look at all the facts before writing a fact book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad in taste","review":"Even though the pack says \\"Whole Cashews\\", inside the box are mostly halves, pieces and crushed cashews.The pack says they are good until 10/2008; still there is such a severe smell of oldness we are having to throw the whole case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read S. Elliot's 1-star review","review":"With so much glowing praise over the vibrant colors and picture quality of the new transfer to Blu-Ray, I was excited to watch this on my 60\\" plasma TV. Oh so dissapointing. I thought for sure that I had a bad transfer, until I read some of the other 1-star reviews which clarified the situation. The entire film--except for some brief moments after they get to the Emerald City--looks grainy. It's especially noticable during the sepia bookends and whenever there's a closeup of Dorothy (you'd think she had smallpox as a child). My wife never noticed it until I pointed it out during the closeups, but it was obvious to me the entire time. I haven't seen many BD films, but I was impressed with the color and quality of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and was hoping for something at least equivalent with the Wizard of Oz.If you're a videophile and have a large TV, you'll probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Worth Following","review":"Who can forget \\"Follow The Yellow Brick Road\\"? The transition from black and white into technicolor was quite a feat back in those days.

You won't be sorry you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc 2","review":"The movie Wizard of Oz was wonderfuls. I've always wanted it in my collection.

Come hell or high water, when Oz was on TV other activities and chores were out the window. This DVD is packed with extras and out does nearly every other DVD release. That is some feat considering how long it has been since this movie's original release. A classic for all ages, the Wizard of Oz on DVD will take you back to your childhood and the disc will open up new windows to the past with its numerous special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing an Award","review":"I have seen the MGM version of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. From the first time I saw it, a spell was cast on me, that made me want to see it over and over, and over, again. Few films have cast that same spell on so many people. Each new medium has been used to its own full potential. The Blu-ray includes ALL the bonus Features ever made for this version. Thanks to the restoration \\"The Hanging Munchkin\\" story will be around for at least another decade. I could see why people thought the BIRD was a hanging Munchkin. I got to relive the change to color, and it felt like the first time I saw the film, at seven. There should be an award for \\"Best Release\\" every time a new way to watch film is created, though \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" would win every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"wife loves it","review":"My wife is a big Wizard of Oz fan, so I bought her this to add to her collection.

I was looking for it for the step-grandchildren as they had no idea about the magic of this movie (and neither had their parents!). It was a wonderful DVD, the colors, the clarity, the sound. It took me back many years and was thoroughly enjoyed by not only the grandchildren who were mesmerized but also by mother, dad and granddad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old standard","review":"This movie must have been quite a shock in 1939 when it switched from the black and white of Kansas to the technicolor fantasy of Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd scratched","review":"The blue ray disc was scratched...which we cleaned and it still skipped once.

I was shocked that it held her attention when it was on t.v. so I had to buy a copy. When we received it, she wanted to watch it four or five times a day! I had no problem with that, there are worse things she could have been watching and it was fun for me to watch with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WONDERFUL Wizard of Oz","review":"I really enjoyed this movie not only because of Judy Garland and her magnificent voice, but it also has a plotline that is still relevent to today's society. The Wizard of Oz is always and will be a classic for all Americans who believe in finding a place for them. This movie teaches the moral that family is always there for you even when you think that an alternate place is better. Basically if you are looking for a feel-good movie with a few songs and a nice moral-of-the-story ending then this movie is the choice for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic!!","review":"Wizard of Oz is a family classic, highly recommended to anyone looking for a great family evening.

I bought every format the movie came in that I had equipment to play it on. I purchased every anniversary edition. I find the blu ray disappointing. The \\"black and white\\" is more reddish brown. The audio is horrible. In the beginning when Dorothy runs down the dirt road to talk to Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, you can hear the chickens clucking better than the voices. I was expecting more from the Blu Ray release and wish I would have saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed","review":"The remastered movie was great but the \\"extra\\" video stuff was either boring or not of interest to me. There was a whole two-sided CD of the history of MGM - sort of an ad really. The other CD, besides the actual movie, was all about Baum and his life, background, early productions, etc. I would have liked to see info on the stars and the shooting of the movie, maybe outtakes or \\"never before seen\\"s. The written stuff was okay along with the other fluff. The watch was kinda cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for Oz fans!!","review":"I'm a HUGE lifelong fan of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and wanted a copy of \\"Dreamer of OZ\\" for years now.

He gives it a one-star for this, but as most of you know, the film was shot in COLOR! Yep, beautiful color in 1939... this was a remarkable achievement - and the film used the wonderful color to take us from the 'sepia-tones' on the great depression to a colorful world of dreams. The DVD image quality is a tribute to the incredible cinematagraphy from that era. The colors are true, vivid, and a critical element of this classic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of OZ DVD","review":"This product is what I expected, aside from the Korean language on the exterior of the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This is a must have for any Wizard of OZ fan.

If so, I'd advise everyone to buy this edition as this wonderful TV movie has never been released separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE","review":"I don't know about the other reviewer's copies, but my single disc blu ray from Amazon is poor indeed. There is a flickering/jerking quality to the whole movie which is quite distracting, trashing the whole viewing experience. I don't know what happened here, but this is not good. Average detailed resolution, jerky, distracting picture. I haven't seen anything else like it. The effect is what you'd get shooting film at 20 fps, or thereabouts, slightly jerky, but not quite as much as old silent films. Be warned on this disc. For the single disc version only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow The Yellow Brick Road To The Best Movie EVER!","review":"If you have never seen THE WIZARD OF OZ you are very weird.Anyway the movie will get you off your chair and make you dance like you are really in the movie. If you get scared a little things you would maybe only want to watch the beggining of the movie. Judy Garland is the best actress ever. She can sing a lot better then any 1 else these days. When you decide to watch this funny and great movie just sit back relax and put up those feet and have some popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restoration Over-Hyped","review":"Got my copy yesterday and quickly ran through each chapter on the blu-ray disc and then did the same with my copy of the 2005 \\"definitive\\" restoration. Running on a brand new Sony ps3 connected via HDMI to a Sony KDL-46W5100. Yes, there is a difference, but is it a $50.00 difference? I don't think so. After all, the movie is 70 years old. If you want the tchotchkes spend the $$, otherwise, if you have the 2005 version-you're OK. For everyone who would hype the glory of blu-ray they would do well to remember the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. I think there is a good reason that blu-ray is not as ubiquitous as DVD.Just noticed: Amazon has clumped all reviews ever of this movie here, pay attention to whether it is blu-ray or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality Is Terrible","review":"This version has such poor quality picture, it's unwatchable.

I have watched this movie hundreds of times; I even have copy of it on my DVR at home. However, I wanted to own the DVD. Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray that I received is very poor quality indeed.

There was a hand-written serial number at the top of the cardboard cover, and the plastic wrap covering it was very shoddy.The DVD itself was dirty, but I cleaned it and played it to see if that was the extent of the damage. It wasn't. The sound goes in and out--with long periods of silence--during the 1979 interviews with surviving cast members Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, and Jack Haley. The rest of the behind-the-scenes extras seems to have been spared. I haven't watched the movie itself yet, so I'm hopeful that at least the movie is intact. If not, I'll return the DVD and wait for the October release of the Oz DVD package.The film is a classic, beloved by million and millions.

It is not much better then the DVD Wizard of Oz, plus there is no real menu screen or good pop-up screen to pick chapters of the movie.The menu is nothing but a list and the movie starts right up as you put it in with no menu. This disc is setup very basic no extra nothing really, This Blu-ray should have been $5.00 because they give you nothing extra from the DVD but a very little cleaning of this movie. Sorry, I got it.Don't throw your money away just wait for a better version on Blu-ray. Blu-ray is still new and they will redo the movies a 100 times before the format dies and we move too something new. I think they did Wizard of Oz 4 times in the USA on DVD, So Blu-ray it will be done 8 more times before the format is die. lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic - Viewed in its Original Aspect Ratio!","review":"It would be an awful shame if someone missed adding this classic to their library because they didn't realize that this version of the Wizard of Oz is in fact being offered in its original aspect ratio! It was filmed in the Academy aspect ratio, prior to the introduction of the widescreen ratio. Televisions were, in fact, designed to fit the Academy aspect ratio. You won't be getting a pan and scan even though this film is listed as having a fullscreen aspect ratio. The Letterbox and Widescreen Advocacy Page specifically mentions this film in its description of the Academy aspect ratio and how such films cannot, by definition, have a widescreen version. So add this gem to your collection, and enjoy watching with the knowledge you're seeing everything the original audience saw in the theatre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I agree with most of the reviews on here about this being a great Blu-Ray release. There is only one thing that annoys me, it's the fact that this is presented in 4:3 instead of 16:9. Every TV being sold today is HD and widescreen. Why would anyone put out a 4:3 Blu-Ray is beyond me since Blu-Ray is an HD format and all recent HDTV's are 16:9. No one still watching a standard definition TV will get any benefit from Blu-Ray!

TV success: Bravo!High irony: the didactic and gold-plated Message that \\"there's no place like home\\" takes more time to deliver on the bonus material of the DVD edition than the movie itself. Some bonus! Of course this message, like all \\"Messages to Wayward Children,\\" is beyond any child's care or understanding.This is not a film for children, rather, one for the \\"child inside every one of us.\\" One might well subject this inner-child to serial viewings (\\"Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first\\") in a fruitless attempt to hammer home the Message.

Well, maybe in 1939 it was great, put today in 2001 this film is just toooooooooo outdated and hokey. Judy Garland plays Dorothy (like you didn't know) but she gets really obnoxious after a while. The whole movie Dorothy's complaining about going back to Kansas. Urgg! I got so sick of hearing her whine and complain I almost turned the movie off! The cowardly lion is annoying and the man who plays him (his name escapes me) just can't act. He either over-acts or under-acts. The Tin-man was O.K., but I felt he was wasted. All he ever did was rust up. The Scarecrow was probably the only character I didn't hate, oh yeah, and Toto. The Wizard of Oz is over 60 years old and it shows it's age. It's a slow-moving and tedious film and I find it endlessly boring. Thank you for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible film translation of a classic story","review":"I find this movie to be an abominable mess. Having grown up reading the Oz books I have been waiting for an acceptable film version of my favorite book series. Wizard of Oz is garbage in my opinion. The worst part is how the film makes you think Dorothy dreamt of her trip to Oz!!! If you have read the books you know this isn't true. Also her shoes are supposed to be silver, not ruby. Read the books and trust me, the movie will seem like trash. Or buy Return to Oz, which is a MUCH better book to film translation than the VERY unforgettable Wizard of Oz. L.

Either way, you're not missing much. Obviously, there are a lot of people who really enjoy this movie. But since Amazon.com decided to \\"recommend\\" it to me for no good reason, I have decided to say how much I hate this movie, and why.I hate this movie a whole lot.I hate this movie because it really isn't all that good. I'll accept the fact that it was revolutionary for its time. I'll even acknowledge that it has a special place in many people's hearts, because they remember watching it as a kid, when their lives weren't so miserable. However, my life is NOT miserable, and I don't have to watch bad movies from my childhood (rather, my parents' childhood) to feel good about myself. If your life is joyless, then perhaps this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it.","review":"There's something about people breaking out into song and dance for every insogniffogant thing that really bugs me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"this film has been known to be a the best clasic movie of all time but in my oppinion its the complete opposit i think it was a horibal film my resons are its completly off the book and also a good part of the acting was bad but i would say garlands acting in this movie was the worst of her career so its hard to understand why people like this in reading some of the othere reviews on this movie i saw one by a peson called LMBbaurfan fan one of my freinds and if you wish to leave comments on my review please do so"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wizard of Oz","review":"I wish I could review this product, but as of 12/8/08, I still have not received this item.

It is rating, rather, the entire boxed set. Outside of the movie itself, the special features are not captioned, and as a hearing impaired person, I cannot enjoy or easily follow what's being said. I was especially disappointed about this because I've waited years for \\"Dreamer of Oz\\" to be released on DVD. Anyone with a hearing loss is better off saving his or her money and purchasing just the movie alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"view online/ and new remastered version","review":"The Wizard of oz has always been a favorite movie of mine. I feel that the most remastered version has been remastered so much it has lost some of its charm. For instance the black and white is now sepia.The reason for the 1 star is not regarding the movie but the view online option. I purchased the movie as a gift along with an opportunity to view it online. This did not work. Throughout the viewing it played the soundtrack twice. One time was about 0 seconds before the soundtrack that went with the picture.

It is not widescreen and the quality is no different than the regular DVD version. They did nothing to enhance the image nor the sound. You cannot change the aspect ratio and the extras are only worth it if you are really, really into that sort of thing. Even then I would still hesitate to pay this much for such things. The other goodies in the box were of no use to me. (I would have returned this item but it was given to me as a gift and the giver would have known I returned it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY: The score has arrived!","review":"The greatest thing about this DVD is that it includes nearly the entire original score of the film (background music.) Many people own the classic Wizard of Oz \\"original soundtrack\\" which was a quick-paced, heavily edited assembly of dialogue and songs--cute, but certainly not what folks have considered a \\"soundtrack album\\" for the last 3 decades. The ACTUAL musical score -- a serious work of art in its own right -- has never been available, to my knowledge, until 64 years later with this DVD. Words cannot describe what a revelation it is to hear Harold Arlen's score naked in its unedited form. Its thematic intricacy is shocking even if you think you're familiar with the score already, and the marathon endurance of the performers in the orchesetra is incredible as you hear take after take. To any serious Wizard of Oz fan this is required listening -- exciting enough to merit it own CD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wizzard and Wicked","review":"I've seen The Wizzard of Oz nearly every year of my life (going on 61). One of the truly great films ever. No need to describe all the brilliant pieces of this film.Did you ever wonder how these wonderful characters became who they were. The answer is WICKED the Broadway musical. See how scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion came about. You get an understanding of the relationship between good (????) witch Glinda and the evil (?????) witch Elphaba.If you're a fan of the Wizzard I urge you to see Wicked. Your opinion of Glinda and Elphaba might change. Mine has.

The disc of extra features played just fine. This is the first time that I have ever had a disc that would not play. The seller's service was prompt, & the discs were in very good condition.

It was about $10 or so for a special edition. It didn't work on my DVD player when I got it. We have a blu-ray player, so I thought maybe that was the reason. It did work on my computer, so I resigned myself to watch it only there. I watched it maybe, three times on my computer. Today, 10 months later, I tried to watch it again on my computer. It wouldn't work. So, I checked the disc. It was clean. I restarted my computer, tried another disc, did everything I could to make sure everything worked properly. It was the DVD. I even contacted the seller. I realize that it was a bit late, since I had bought the DVD in January, but all I wanted was a little help. I really love this movie & was going to watch it with my mother today, but no. Today, I got no help from them & all I got was a broken movie. Do not purchase movies from this seller. The DVD itself, the packaging, all looked legit- but buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of Oz 70th anniversary edition blu-ray","review":"If you are expecting a crystal clear picture as if the movie was shot within the last year or so, this edition of the Wizard of Oz might be disappointing. I was pleased with the total package, however. And the actual movie is a nice addition to my collection, even if the movie was not filmed with High Definition, blue-ray television in mind. I have and will recommend this movie to others if the price remains as it is on Amazon or is reduced to an even lower price. The description of the extra features is listed elsewhere, but I was pleased with the small hardbound book featuring each major character in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blu-ray Wizard of Oz","review":"I watched the Blu-ray version hooked to a 1080 HDTV and then popped in the last Standard Def version release on DVD to compare. The Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic. The clarity and beauty of this restoration is truly wonderful. The last DVD, although upconverted playing on the Blu-ray, looked soft as it naturally would being SD, not HD. This was my first Blu-ray disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Child","review":"This took me back!! For awhile, I was 10 again (54 years ago).

Fans should own this, hands down, no questions asked about it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAVORITE MOVIE","review":"This is my favorite movie along with the new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is almost exactly like the book except for they don't put stuff in that was in the book. I liked the movie, but the ending was kind of dull. It got kind of long, too. but something about gets you addicted and you watch it over and over and over again.Dorothy (Judy Garland) had a beautiful singing voice and made the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" famous. My mom and I both agree that no one sings it better. All the other characters were good too but I like Judy Garland. I do think you should read the book after the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Oz","review":"Even as a jaded adult I can still enjoy the movie The Wizard of Oz. When I was a kid, each year it came on I eagerly anticipated watching it. The story of Dorothy transported to the strange Oz and her encounters with the munchkins, the Wicked Witch of the West, the Tinman without a heart, the Scarecrow without a brain, and the Lion without Courage and their ultimate quests to find the Wizard in Emerald city against in the face of the Wicked Witch continue to be magical.The special features are great, especially the story of the real munchkins in the movie. They were quite a set of characters.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Fantasies are fun. Everyone likes a mysterious story well-told. The writing, acting, visual effects, and other elements of this film all add up to make a classic that has entertained generations of audiences since its debut in 1939. With each repeated viewing it is like going back to childhood and seeing familiar friends. There's an innocence in the way the characters relate to each other. Good and evil are clearly delineated. Ambiguities and gray are lacking in this era when sides were distinctly identified.The sets, the technology for the time demonstrate what its like to do work that endures. The plot unfolds in such a way that you're captivated, although you know what is going to happen next.This is good, clean, family entertainment. Good wins, bad fails, and Dorothy wakes up in her own bed in Kansas in the end. All is right with with world. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say...","review":"It is a classic!

Then explain to me WHY the string swishing the lion's tail in the KING OF THE FOREST song is now no longer visible? Especially when it's been EXTREMELY visible in every other incarnation?Yep....the string is gone...and, yes, it's probably the type of thing they would have removed in the day...but they didn't...and changing it NOW....is changing the film.Why stop there? Why not correct Judy's changing hair length? Or redub the \\"little bug\\" line?Great color....but leave it alone. Ever since I was a kid the string on the tail tickled me...and removing it is removing a small piece of Hollywood history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked \\"FAKE\\"","review":"Tricked this copy of the Wizard of Oz is a \\"FAKE\\". The box and Bluray case looks real but the bluray case didn't have the normal plastic wrap and the security tape that holds the case together. the Disc's look good but two of three disc's are empty which means that they don't have anything on them. My bluray player kept kicking the disc's out. The third disc played but it was fuzzy not high quality like something I could transfer from VHS to DVD. As I checked the Disc they look clear like my empty CD's I checked my normal DVD and you can see that the disc has been scribed these two \\"FAKE\\" DVD's have not been scribed. Now I have to figure out how to get my money back. I'm so pissed that I got tricked I should have checked the one stars first.

When I watch a movie I usually think it is just another movie. I never think of where it came from. It is always nice to hear where the story comes from. In the special features of Wizard Of Oz they talk about the director of Wizard Of Oz, Victor Fleming. But that's not all. They also talk about Frank Baum. Who wrote the Wizard Of Oz books.There is a short movie about Frank and his family's life in the special features. The movie tells you how he started the book and how supportive his family were. There is also a short black and white play that was made in 1910. Along with a color cartoon made in 1933 in the special features. I think if you are going to buy a Wizard Of Oz DVD this is the case to buy. It has a great movies in each disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic art","review":"This movie is a wonderful, classic piece of timeless art.

The only engaging performances (other than Garland's singing) were from the Wicked Witch of the West and Toto (and I guess the Wizard, to some extent).

The monkeys catch the lion, the girl, the scarecrow, and the tin man. Find out what happens when the monkeys catch them.The part when it was the most terrible was when they got massages, and then they do nothing after that. It was so boring! \\"Come on!\\" said my mother. Then my dad said that this was the worst movie ever for him. I fell asleep, and my mom said that I should go to bed.I would rather get twelve shots from the doctor than watch the Wizard of Oz again. It is a waste of your time and money.

I grew up on it. I was the little girl that every one had to call Dorthy Gail or I'd have a hissy fit. It was the movie my Dad watched the night his little sister was born. I don't know any one who hasn't seen this masterpeice of a film. Why wouldn't you want to see us. It gave us the dream that some where over the rainbow there were little munchkins, ruby red slippers, and talking scarecrows. The Wizard of Oz is a must have for any home collection. If you don't have it you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I enjoyed this movie not only because this is a classic, but because both my 10 & 8 yrs old met Dorothy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review through the eyes of a 5 year old","review":"My grand-daughter received this movie for Christmas. I asked her last evening if she liked the movie, and she did. Her favorite characters were the \\"fairy godmother\\" and the Cowardly lion. She liked Dorothy, and really wants a pair of her shoes. She was a little scared by the witch and the flying monkeys, and commented she never knew monkeys could fly.The magic of this movie is still there, with yet another generation to enjoy it. And she loves the music too. Would highly recommend this classic. Looking forward to watching it with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Not much to be said here. Probably the best kid's show ever. As a child I used to anxiously wait for the once a year showing of this on TV. I'm happy that I can give my children the pleasure of watching this at their leisure.A few interesting extras, but the movie itself is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not working....","review":"I recently bought this dvd The Wizard of Oz 2-disc Edition and sent it for my niece in London but she was so disappointed as Disc 1 is not working.

I was a bit unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of OZ","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, along with some ruby slippers, because she loves this movie. I purchased this version because it was actually chearper than the 1 or 2 disc setup at the time. It has some interesting bonus materials and the movie quality itself great. It is clearer and more colorful than I ever remembered it, but than again I am now watching it on a much better TV. The colors are not over done though as sometimes seems to be the case as these older films are updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that will endure forever!","review":"This movie was ahead of it's time with regards to it's special effects and imagination. Nowadays most fairytale stories are done with cartoons and computer animation (except for the movie, Princess Bride, which I enjoyed). Although some people may be annoyed that it wasn't done in widescreen, I felt it looked even better in full frame (like a giant story book on my bigscreen tv). My 2 year old daughter enjoys watching this movie continuously as will my 2 month baby boy when he gets old enough to watch! There's no place like home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fine video update of a classic movie.","review":"The movie has been seen a zillion times, even by the kids, but we were astounded by the quality of the video reproduction offered by the DVD version.

The cover had scratches all over it leaving behind silver markings everywhere. The wrap that it came in had holes in it too. Plus the corners were all bent and looked like it had just been thrown in the package with not a care in the world. I'm returning it now because that's just ridiculous. This was suppose to be a Christmas gift, but there's NO WAY I would give it to somebody in that sort of condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"This is one of the best classic movies that I have seen.

Nothing that hasn't been said many times before - a truly great film from Hollywood's Golden Age.This DVD version is excellent and has very nice additonal features for background and \\"making of\\". Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVER THE RAINBOW","review":"I hesitated to spend the money on this 3 disc set. How wrong I was! This is THE set for \\"Wizard of Oz\\" fans. The movie looks gorgeous and the special features have something for everyone. I found myself grinning so much at some of the features that my face hurt afterwards. It's great to hear and see the homage given to this film. This is one DVD set that invites repeat viewing of all the discs and you will gladly accept the invitation again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand kids love it!","review":"Our 8-year old granddaughter asked for it for Christmas.

Her 5 year old brother likes it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all there","review":"If you are looking for a restored visual of the original movie, you will be missing some things. THey have taken out the song, \\"The Witch is Dead\\". Not sure why it was taken out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!!","review":"I can't see how anyone could not like this movie. Can't tell you how many times I've watched it in my lifetime and can sing every song (at least when no one is around) It plays often on TV but without commericals is 1000 times better. I purchased the DVD so that my German S/O could watch an American classic. I am always referencing quotes in the movie (like someone should drop a house on that woman) and now he will now where it came from. I miss old musicals and wish the new ones could capture half of the magic this one and Mary Poppins or Sound of Music were able to do so easily"},{"rating":"2","title":"The good ole days of film!","review":"This is the ultimate classic in film. This is the movie that you fell in love with as a child and keep falling in love with every time you watch the film, no matter how old you are. This is the film that helped you see how dreams can come true and how you can appreciate your life, wherever you may be.Judy Garland does a fantastic job as Dorothy. The ensemble cast works amazingly together. The Wicked Witch is fantastic. You just love to hate her! And what about Toto?!Be transported back to the good old days when you didn't have a care in the world. Watch this movie again and own it for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic movie that will live on forever! :)","review":"This is truly a classic movie! I've seen it when I was a little girl, about the age of 2 or 3, and I loved it. I would watch it 24/7, and couldn't stop singing \\"Over the Rainbow.\\" I'm 13 now, and I still love it! Judy Garland is excellent as Dorothy Gale, her dog Toto is SOOO cute! The rest of the cast is great too, so are the song's. I recommend this movie to any movie fan! After 60 years, The Wizard of Oz is still one of my favorite's! BUY IT NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family","review":"I've been watching this movie since I was a baby! I would watch it 2 or 3 times every day. It is a wonderful and magical experience and I love it. It is still my favourite movie!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic!","review":"I watched this movie very Thanksgiving growing up. (that was before VCRs, DVDs, etc, so you had to watch television in real time. It was only televised around Thanksgiving). Judy Garland was just fabulous- what a great voice! No wonder she became an icon! The movie is inventive and so entertaining. Another movie we have seen so many times that we know all the songs, and all the dialogue! The fact that the 5 year old in our family loves this movie, and watches it repeatly, shows how timeless it is! This should definitely be in your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wizard of Oz","review":"Excellent quality and quick download. I bought it and was watching it in five minutes or less! I will be buying many more movies from Amazon instant video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wizard Of Oz","review":"This is a classic and I will always cherish, this movie is one of my favorite, and still get excited about when it going to be on television, now I can watch this without having any commercial interuptions, except to pause it long enough to fix more popcorn,other munchies or a bathroom break. Some people dread it. I, myself think it should be watched at least once a year. Thank You for letting me write a review on such a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loved it","review":"When my wife un-wrapped her Christmas gift of the OZ collectors set, it was fun to watch as her eyes lit up with excitement and amazement. But her fun didn't end there. As she began to then open up the boxed set, her joy only continued with everything that was inside as she went through it piece by piece loving everything that was included. I am very happy that I bought it for her, and I am absolutely sure she is too. now she can look forward to years of enjoyment watching the DVD set whenever her heart desires, and my daughter too who now also loves to watch it, and the sing along? I can see it now her and my daughter and her friends during sleepovers the fun will go on and on for them. I am so glad I bought it for her and made her so very happy (for years to come too). It felt good for me too. It's well worth its price for someone who loves the wizard of OZ and the traditions it brings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding box set!","review":"I am a huge Wizard of Oz fan and I loved this!!

I was impressed and pleasantly surprised. The color are sharp and vivid. I especially liked the digital copy for my iPOD; it looks just as beautiful as the blue-ray edition.

So it was totally worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray is HORRIBLE","review":"This is without a doubt the absolute worst transfer and a terrible travesty. I have laserdisc (75th anniversary...wonderful) and DVD (anniversary) and both are SUPERIOR at every single level to this absolutely disgusting travesty. Not worth a cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why standard format only??","review":"Yes - a wonderful, timeless movie. But why standard format?? The original widescreen is needed to do this classic justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of oz","review":"Wizard of oz, what must I say, but its a classic, as a kid I loved watching it growing up, and now that I have kids myself, it was an easy decision to purchase for them too. What else is there to say???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete order","review":"I would like to give a good review but I cannot since my order was incomplete. The extras 9 photos/postcards, etc) were not included,, only the DVD. I was very unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere over the rainbow","review":"Another flawless classic that withstands the test of time. Most people have forgotten that the movie starts off in black and white, then turns to color when Dorothy reaches Oz. This is the way it was shown originally in 1939, and that's the way this import version presents. The only minor distraction is the default foreign subtitle. But that's what the DVD remote is for. Click the \\"subtitle\\" button a couple of times, and the subtitle is completely gone. Heck, what could be easier. The best thing about this import is it's a lot cheaper than the domestic version. Same quality picture, and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Wizard of Oz!!","review":"I never thought I would want to buy WoO on DVD because it's on TV so often, but I'm glad I finally did. I don't know which I'm happier about: the crisp and beautiful picture and sound or the lack of commercials! The box is beautiful and the paper extras in the package are interesting. I haven't watched the DVD extras yet, but everyone who grew up watching WoO and being scared witless by the WWW should buy this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great DVD!","review":"The box is covered in Korean characters, but don't let that scare you from buying this DVD. It's the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie that we grew up with! Even Judy Garland's name got goofed up as \\"Jody Garland\\" but still, the DVD is clear, crisp, beautiful and sounds wonderful. And it's a lot cheaper than the the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" alternative DVD's. You only get one DVD - just the movie, no extras or games or behind the scenes information. But I didn't want any of that. I just wanted the movie.When you pop this movie into your DVD player go first to \\"Set-up\\" and under Subtitles click on \\"none\\". The movie is in English since it's the original and there is absolutely nothing about it I can find to complain about. I loved it! Though it took a few days longer for it to arrive than I expected, it was well-packaged and the plastic case is as good as any other DVD case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful edition","review":"This edition is beautiful. Interior has thousand wonders. I would recommend to any lover of collecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other \\"Green Monster\\"","review":"Theeeee most wonderful family picture of all time transforms into a real life DVD so clear that you can see my nose extension in various shades of green. Remarkable clarity and plenty of special \\"extras\\" are the top reasons to purchase the DVD. Cowardly Lion provides the humor, and Scarecrow the fancy footwork. But Wicked Witch really steals the show, and makes the kiddies shake and crumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"Fast shipping and the movie was packaged well!! My kids love it. Thanks for great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"This was a Christmas gift for one of my 3 granddaughters. It was a request from her and she is so happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set aside modern expectations and just enjoy a classic","review":"When I was a little girl, I used to scream when the witch shows up in a cloud of green spoke. I got over that as the television networks played the film over and over again for about the first 15 years of my life. Now you very very rarely see it on tv so if you want to introduce your child to Oz or watch it yourself, you'll have to buy it or rent it to do so. I'm sure you've heard that the cast we see in the film is not the intended cast and yet it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing these roles. Most of the music you know but if you watch it again you'll note some clever theme work throughout the film. Let's hope they never colorize this -- that is part of the artistry of the film itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true family classic","review":"Like most Americans of my generation, the annual television broadcasts of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" were a part of my childhood. I still remember the delight I felt as a child when Dorothy would open the door of her cabin and step into the land of Oz--suddenly the screen would explode with color. This was a family film that wasn't afraid to be scary--I was terrified by the scene in which the flying monkeys captured Dorothy and Toto and attacked their friends, tearing the Scarecrow to pieces in the process.Years went by and I fell out of the habit of watching \\"Oz.\\" Of course, I was aware of its status as a pop icon. However, what surprised me upon a recent viewing is how well the flm holds up. This is truly a film that has something for all ages. Now I can appreciate the wonderful performances, the classic songs, and the well-written script. This truly belongs on any list of essential American films.And those flying monkeys still scare the hell out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome in BluRay!","review":"This movie is a family classic but done in BluRay just makes it more colorful and crisp!

I just purchased the three disc bluray set. I must admit I am terribly disappointed in the quality. It looks very grainy. Just a little better quality than the DVD. I've seen other old films put to bluray and they look great. But this one looks aweful. I'm very surprised I haven't read any reviews that pointed this out. Very much surprised that people are happy with the bluray. The DVD is horrid, and the bluray isn't much better. What happened MGM?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter's need of the wizard of Oz","review":"My 9 year old daughter is in drama and needed the movie to practice a part to audition at school.

Anniversary ultimate collectors edition Blu -Ray )","review":"You either like this stuff or you don't it's a matter of personal choice, personally I do. All the extras can again add to the film or not, I generally prefer them, on the greats, Casablanca, the African Queen and so on. Now what makes a great film is again down to you.I got the collectors set for not much more than the price of the standard set so it was a no brainer for me. One thing that could have been so much better was the watch which showed a complete lack of imagination, cheap looking, it should have been designed to look contemporarywith the film, slightly aged and with a gold ( not real of course) case it would have been wearable. I thought I saw a customer photo somewhere of the watch looking like it had a gold case, must have dreamt it. Anyway if you like OZ I recommend this set get 'em while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"excellent!!! judy garland is one of the all time best actress !!!! it's a occult movie, a lot of illuminatis symbols!!! check out on the net!!!! it's frightning!!!! still one of the best movie ever,i don't like the lion song(stupid)!!!for everybody!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I loved this technicolor movie. Hey parents if your kids have not seen this one I reccomend you to take them to it. It would fun to watch with your kids. It is magical and would make you watch it over and over again. Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr and awesome in this wonderful. Although it is old it is still magical for everybody who watches. Most people would watch over and over and over again and some don't. But when you see it, it wants you to watch it over and over again.

If you wish to have a nice set and still save some money; I would go with the next step down. With this box set you pay extra for a couple copies of actual playbills, tickets, photos and other paper-like things that come in little sleeves. All the extras on the extra DVD's were nice to watch, but I think with the other series (the next step-down) there were similar DVDs that were included in that set as well. I would have done that to save money, but oh well, Like I always say about money \\"Here it comes, and there it goes.\\" Overall, this is a great addition to any movie library. With a great classic like this movie it is worth getting a nice polished one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!","review":"If you are into the Wizard of Oz this is a great purchase.

The clarity is unbelievable, the image is nice and sharp all cleaned up and restored. The sound also got a boost from the original mono track to stero, and the special features have me intrigued.

For one thing, I don't like to watch things with witches in them, especially if one of them is portrayed as a \\"good witch\\" - that's an oxymoron I can't reconcile with. For another thing I don't like Judy Garland's breathless diction or Frank Morgan - The star I give this goes exclusively to the Tin Man, who was always my favourite and still is. But I can't stand sitting through this movie just to watch him, though I might if I could fast forward the other parts. It's all just such fantasy fluff, and I like something that has a bit more reality to it. This falls perilously short of the mark.

If this was remastered, which I doubt, it should be recalled and Warner Bros. should be honorable and freely exchange the new clean Blu Rays for the ones they offered as 70th anniversary. The colors are amazing, but the movie at times appears a bit fuzzy. It is also bothersome to find that some of the special features are on 480p standard definition - the whole set should have been in 1080p high definition, specially in view of the extra cost. I suggest to wait for the 75th anniversary to see if they can remaster this movie correctly.

The DVD transfer is sub-standard. Picture quality is acceptable, but not better than VHS. Turn off your surround decoder or the whole movie comes through the center channel. I realize that this was a mono movie made in 1939, but surely a little time could have been taken to give it an AC-3 soundtrack. No extras on the disc worth mentioning. One more note: original theatrical presentation doesn't mean widescreen in this case. The original aspect ratio was close enough to 4:3 that the DVD was pressed as 4:3. Buy this disc if you don't mind your kids playing with the DVD player, otherwise wait for Ted Turner to broadcast it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"Original, Classic Full Length Presentation)","review":"So I received the DVD in the mail and while it doesn't say \\"Jody Garland\\", I wouldn't be able to determine that if I wanted to...all the writing is in Korean characters.

Although many young players have fallen into a HardBop loop that seems to go nowhere, modern jazz appears to be headed in a very progressive direction. Minimalism, Classical voiceings, rich color, and emotional expression are all part of this album; simply put its Beautiful Music. Now $20 is an unjustified price for any CD, considering it costs only two dollars or less to manifacture, but this music is just too good to pass up!! Listen to the audio samples and decide for yourself, I think you will agree. Cheers Jazz Lovers- jb.p.s.

It was neither snowy or rainy. It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality. I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed. But if you can get a normal quality pair, they are great.

I have not even had them for 2 weeks and the metal is already worn through the heel, mind you I am 5'11\\" and thin. I have shoes from Target that are better made than these! The heel looks chewed up and the bottoms are almost worn. I am not on my feet a whole lot so I can't see why these shoes would already be as worn as they are, except for being cheaply made. Other than that, the out side of them looks nice...but if I could return them I would. Not impressed BCBG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite pair of heels","review":"I decided to write a review when I saw all of the negative reviews these shoes got. I must say, I tend to have a hard time finding comfortable shoes--I love heels (the higher the better!), but most of my shoes (even the flats) are uncomfortable b/c they pinch something or dig into something else. However, with the exception of my sneakers, these shoes are the MOST COMFORTABLE pair of shoes in my closet. I am sad that they don't come in more colors that I like b/c these are my go-to shoes at all times. I find them to be true to size, fit very snugly but don't pinch, and my foot does not slide inside the shoe. I do a lot of walking on cobblestone and very uneven streets, and even under those conditions I can still usually dance the night away in these pumps. If you are looking for some comfy black pumps, definitely give these a try.

The only reason I give this four stars is the main handle (say you need to pick the bag up to bring to your office-room rather than leave it right by the front door :) ), is not in what I think is the most optimal position. For the wrong person, I think it could cut into your neck just a little. But I do find the backpack comfortable, it holds my 15-inch laptop (Dell E1505, of which I have a different opinion) and several notebooks and/or books easily.

You will seldom encounter prose as polished as this, as surgically precise, as accurate in observation. With his epigrammatic style, Crisp almost courts comparison with Oscar Wilde, but to my mind, Crisp is the more daring writer, more honest, more personal, more astute too. Telling a story is not Crisp's strong suit; he loses track of his narrative, sometimes it seems by distracting himself with some amusing detail, sometimes as a way of drawing a veil over events soul-crushing or violent or both. But never has such a dismal tale of wasted human potential, talent and love been conveyed with such startling (and often hilarious) aptness.The three books taken together stand as a kind of social history of sissies in the mad, bad twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Sham thinking?","review":"Geez was this horrible .

Instead, the program is padded with close-ups of ordinary beach waves, better suited for a surfing documentary. This is not only disappointing, but scientifically inaccurate, since tsunami rarely appear as conventional waves, but usually as tumultuous floods or walls of water. I continue to be puzzled at the seeming dearth of video documentation of this fascinating natural phenomena. After all, National Geographic sends intrepid photgraphers to the rims of volcanoes, chasing tornadoes, and flying into hurricanes. There are warning systems that can predict potential landfall for tsunami, so why don't scientists wait for them in helicopters with video cameras?

Compared to other electric grilles ( Weber, patio chef etc.) that I shopped for at the box stores there's no difference in what they all can do & Meco quality is as good if not better than most. The Meco takes a while to heat up (approx.10 - 15mins) but does a good job after it has. The drip pan is finicky to get out & not easy to clean as everything really gets baked on. Covering it with heavy gauge tinfoil solves that problem. As well the shiny side of the tin foil helps in the pre-heating process & cooking. The porcelain grille needs to be sprayed with a cooking oil as, again, things really stick to it due to the proximity of the cooking element. It's not as good as a gas grille but what electric grille is.

The drops should be held in your hand for a few minutes so they are not cold entering your ear. After 5-8 minutes, use the bulb with body temp water to flush the ear and don't fear to add a bit of pressure here as the EMO used quite a bit of force with their water bottle sprayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"INDIAN ROMANCE AT ITS BEST","review":"Morgan is a bitter drunkard, a half - breed who feels that he has no reason left to live.

Over all what I have seen of the first two discs the story lines are well written and I see where some of today's science fiction writers have gotten their ideas from. Some great reminiscing, as I was very young when the series originally aired so I really did not catch to many of the original shows.

One would expect more from a company like MGM releasing a set like Complete Outer Limits, but the content of course is great, 51 of what would have been hour long episodes, each one like watching a full length 60's scifi movie, over 2500 minuets of content at a current Amazon price of around $30 Best Buy can't match. The set is quite simply a must for any collector or fan of the 60's scifi genre, it practically defines it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD set is wonderful - great for old time sci fi fans.","review":"I received The Outer Limits DVD Set as a Christmas gift. The DVD set is wonderful - great for old time sci-fi fans. Many now well-known actors appeared in The Outer Limits such as Robert Culp, Leonard Nimoy, Ivan Dixon, Martin Landau, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman, etc. It was funny seeing The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Illya Kuryakin/NCIS's Ducky with a huge head. This set has brought back many childhood memories although the series was short-lived. I had no problem with the DVD's playing and they loaded well (at least the first DVD). The packaging is not good at all. The DVD's are not marked and the box is very chintzy. I don't expect the box to last long even though I take good care of my things.

Why can't this very important series that has countless followers and fans be given a presentation on freeze-free single-sided discs? This is an historically important tv series featuring quality writing, directing and acting. Is someone just being stupid here or are we all re-living a lost episode?If this series was ever re-issued properly on SINGLE-SIDED discs that actually play, those knuckleheads in charge of this fiasco would be surprised by the amount of sales that would be generated.

The have been digitally remastered and fit on HD wide Screen TV's, video and audio quality is excellent! The DVD's are double sided, this was a bit of a downside because they are not labeled, they are only numbered, you really can't tell what's on what side of the disk until it's loaded in your player.Other than that, if you are a fan of classic SciFi this is a great addition to your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper to buy individual series","review":"I'm going to hold off buying these until they're properly remastered.

Watching the Outer Limits in the 21st century as an adult was definitely a completely different experience than what I remembered from having watched it as a child in the 1960s. However, it was thoroughly enjoyable both times-although for different reasons.

BB had this new single set priced at a savings of 50%.I was impressed with crisp clean EZ to use menus. The B/W video and Mono audio quality was excellent.I did miss bonus extras, and the lack of closed captions for those of us with less than perfect hearing was also sorely missed.Others have mention problems with the double sided discs. My toshiba DVD player had NO such troubles.

After about six months they start skipping and freezing. One just failed tonight. If you look at the surface of the DVD it is perfect, yet it skips and freezes. I take care of my DVDs. I don't have any problems with any other DVDs, just these MGM Original Series Outer Limits DVDs. They have failed for me on many different DVD players.

I must say that these diapers are definitely not worth the extra $$ and I'll stick with just plain ol' Pampers from now on.My complaint is not with leaking but with the dye that is used to decorate the outside of the diaper. The dye rubs off onto my baby's skin and the inside of her clothes. Unfortunately, it is hard to remove from her skin without a bit of scrubbing (which of course, I hate to do because her skin is a bit sensitive).

'Full House'' is a diamont of a CD, it swings from the start and Wes plays so melodic and clean, seldom heard, ...and ...you can't be fooled with 'le nec plus ultra' in jazz land: Johnny Griffin, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb!

I have had my fill of books, articles and movies which portray the horrors of the camps. However, this book is different. These stories would stand by themselves regardless of the setting.

Don't be fooled by the 19mm width, it rides much tighter around corners, and grips well on wet roads as well.If you ever see a negative review for this tire, it's because the rider of this tire just had bad luck or buyer's remorse.

The worst album in history, perhaps?These guys stink now and they stunk on this record. What's scary, however, is that this is probably Bon Jovi's best piece of work.

I find each one amazing and refreshing in it's own way, except 7800 degrees Fahrenheit. Although \\"In and Out of Love\\" was a decent song, most of the album falls flat with inconsistancy of the music and lyrics sadly devoid of the talent displayed on Bon Jovi's other recordings. So unless you're determined to collect all of their albums, I'd say you could skip on this one and go straight to the good stuff, meaning just about anything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!","review":"First off, let me just say I'm a psychotic, for lack of a better word, Bon Jovi fan. I have been for many years now.I've wanted this album for such a long time and was so happy to finally get it. In my opinion, its one of their better albums. I find it hard to believe that the band thinks its one of their worst. What made me want the album the most was the song Only Lonely. Others I absolutely love are The Price of Love, The Hardest Part is the Night, Always Run to You, and Secret Dreams. Personally, I think all those should have been released as singles because they are just that good. Although, their next album Slippery When Wet was more mature, 7800 was just as good.But their subsequent albums were awesome. I throughly enjoyed this album, I've listened to it nonstop since I got it. The song quality is amazing.I LOVE THIS ALBUM,I hope you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"For all you Bon Jovi lovers out there this is a great cd to start with. Their first cd was extremely good material but this cd seems geered more to their style.

The best part is that instead of focusing solely on Chakotay and Voyager, the book moves from veteran to veteran: Janeway, Paris, Blanna, Doctor, etc.While most Voyager books read like an episode, this reads like a movie with great timing, interesting twists, and more.

I'm not sure what books Golden has done previously to the Voyager Re-Launch but it had to have been Romance Novels, the feel of the writing is just that sloppy. This was a dismal affair. Plot points tossed together that have nothing to do with each other, slow pacing, and then the realization that you have 10 pages left and NOTHING has happened worth mentioning!

I like the facts that 1) the book is well written and easy to follow, 2) examples are plenty and to-the-point, 3) checklists or numbered procedures are handy for dealing with real problems.But for \\"immortals\\" (or smarties, or professionals) who earn a living on designing databases, this book may be too simple. First, the book is not concise and may be distilled into half less without losing any essential concept. Second, serious stuff like normal forms may be added. Third, maybe an expanded chapter on special situations like analysis- or performance-centered design. But this will change the title of the book, which is not what the author intends to do, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and dogmatic, just like database should be...","review":"This is the BEST book there is for learning about DB design from the ground up. It moves very quickly from theory to how to practically implement a robust DB design. It assumes no knowledge, but by the end of the book you WILL be able to sit in discussions with MIS and understand and contribute to the discussion. I don't want to leave the impression, however, that this skips the hard topics: far from it. It covers Business Rules and even has some excellent forms that you can copy from the book and use in your information-gathering sessions.Bottom Line: Get this book and get the big picture, then get the specialized book for your DBMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better books out there","review":"This book is adequate but not great as an introduction to designing databases. I agree with other reviewers that it's quite repetitive and goes to extremes on details like field specifications. I suppose if you know nothing about DB design this book is OK - but you'll need other books and lots of practice designing your own databases if you truly want to become proficient. A much better general intro book to databases and simple design is 'Inside Relational Databases' by Whitehorn & Marklyn. Novices should look at 'Absolute Beginner's Guide to Databases' by John V. Petersen first.Once you've mastered those 2 books then get the best available book on DB design/modeling: 'Case*Method: Entity Relationship Modelling' by Richard Barker. It's excellent.Two other options for university level/advanced modeling: 'Database Modeling & Design' by Toby J. Teorey and 'Data Modeling Essentials: Analysis, Design, and Innovation' by Graeme C.

I started with the other 'how to' books (Access 97 Bible, eg) but kept drawing a blank when it came to the most critical part of building a database: the design! This is NOT a guidebook for navigating dialog boxes; you already know how to do that. Mike leads you through lessons in how to think about the data you're trying to track. Once you start organizing your data along these lines, everything else just follows. I also bought ISBN: 1565926269. Most of that book is oriented towards VBA programming, but the first few chapters gloss over a few of the ideas that Mike covers more thoroughly. Start with Mike's book; it'll make more sense for the critical early design phase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant book for database beginners","review":"This is the best book so far I've come across on database designing. It assumes the reader of no prior well-grounded knowledge of database designing. Unlike many other similar books out there, the text is concise and highly readable - no complicated equations or diagrams.I find this book very useful for beginners to database designing like me. Especially the examples that follow every presented design step make the fundamental concepts much clearer to grasp. The book also provides guidelines on overcoming the tricky parts of the design process.Highly recommended for people who are feeling \\"lost\\" in database designing or just starting to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Database Design for Mere First Graders","review":"This book does a good job of explaining how a relational database works but has its downfalls.

I purchased the book with the intention of brushing up on rusty DB skills. When I completed the book (after skimming) it seemed I didn't learn anything new. When completed with this book you will not be equipped with the basic skills to build a sound database. You will understand the principles of a sound database but you will not be equipped with the tools to build one.

Unfortunately, it does not live up to its hype. While it has some useful information, they are few and far between. Too often, the author repeat the same point over and over and over...without shedding any new light.If you want a database design book that has information you can use (like normalization, supertypes and subtypes, etc.), you won't find it in this book. Instead, I recommend two other books: \\"Data Modeling Essentials\\" by Graeme C. Simsion and \\"Database Modeling & Design : The Fundamental Principles\\" by Toby J.

Where it could just give you concepts and syntax and an explanation of database structure, it goes on long-winded life lessons about how to interview people and other non-technical stuff. Maybe I am just partial to technical references over process books, but there is almost nothing of technical value in here. Written by a Microsoft guy, it continues the Microsoft tradition of hiding the computer from you instead of just teaching you how the computer works. It's like trying to teach someone tennis but not letting them know they have a racket in their hand. It describes how to swing in laborious detail, when it would simply be better to show you what you've got in your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introductory DB design book.","review":"This is a book based on concepts rather than details.

I digested it in one day, and it confirmed much of what I knew while it more formalized it, and also introduced and explains some very useful concepts. An absolute must to creating databases.My only small critique is the advice on naming tables and fields is slightly dated. Steve Wood, in his Alpha 5 Developers forum, posted a great guide to database conventions. He suggests to abandon naming tables in the plural; really a table defines a thing, just many of them, so Person not Persons. Hernandez says this tells you that it is a multirecord table, but they almost all are such; instead, name the rare single record table as such: \\"System Parameter Record\\".More significant is naming of fields. Since we now access fields by the table.field nomenclature, it is redundant to prefix field names with the table name, use \\"Name\\" instead of \\"Customer Name\\".Otherwise, terrific guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best database design books out there!","review":"This is one of the best database books I own. The author does a good job of explaining the basics and he guides you through the entire design process.

The design is great, the software is easy to use, the interface to iTunes is excellent, but without decent reception it all for naught. I have a number of inexpensive radios (clock radios, \\"walkman\\" types, table radios, etc.) in my home. All of them, except the RadioShark get good reception from a number of local stations.Unfortunately, my RadioShark is plagued by horrid interference that seems to be coming via the apparently unshielded USB cable. There is no facility for an external antenna. Supposedly, you can orient the RadioShark to get acceptable reception. I have not been sucessful. Once or twice I thought I had been successful in getting decent reception. However, when I subsequently listened to the recording, it was intermittenly unlistenable. Very disappointing.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor AM reception makes this mostly useless except for NPR","review":"I bought this hoping to record talk radio shows from AM radio. Big disappointment, as has been stated by others. If you want to record music, get something like Stream Ripper for Mac OS X and grab songs from streaming radio stations. That way, the song name and author, etc., is saved with the song. Radio Shark is not a good tool for that. And due to poor AM, it obviously doesn't help much for AM talk show junkies like me. I will use it just to record NPR (national public radio on FM radio), as its FM is passable. Its interface is very nice.Documentation is pretty poor. There is a jack on the Radio Shark but the docs don't say what it is for. I hoped it was for an external antenna, but attaching an AM antenna to it did not good. The docs also said nothing about suggestions for improving AM receptino. I would just stay away from this for now, unless recording NPR is worth $65 to you. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Record radio shows for your iPod","review":"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. I was concerned at first after reading other reviews about the antennae reception, and also compatibility with the PC. If you raise the RadioShark so it's elevated and away from other wires or the monitor, the reception is as good as any radio. The AM and FM stations came in crystal clear. Better than the stereo for AM. The RadioShark records in WAV format on the PC, and there's no preferences to import it into iTunes. But if you go into iTunes and add the WAV file from the menu, it will synch your recording into iTunes so you can copy it to your iPod. This is a nifty device for radiophiles, it's like Tivo for the radio. They also have a feature where you can have a buffer in recording live radio, so you can pause or rewind the program while you're listening to it's broadcast!

So satisfying to actually get a gadget that lives up to its promise that I had to share it.Radio reception is fine, btw.The UI is easy and intuitive.

I live in a remote area and get very little in the way of radio as it. The shark picks up everything that my stereo does without any issue.Minor complaints are that the mute option is not button/toggle on the GUI, but instead a menu item. There's also is no \\"power\\" button. I kind of expected one to allow me to listen to my iTunes, yet schedule recordings with the shark. I guess mute would have the same result. I also had a problem with scheduling recording at 12:00 pm in 12hr mode. I changed my prefs to 24hr and that fixed it.

I also tried attaching my rooftop FM antenna to the headphone jack as suggested on the Griffin web site, but it made no difference. That antenna provides excellent signal on any other radio. I guess I have a nice USB-powered night light.Too bad, since I have several other Griffin products, and have always been satisfied in the past. Next time, I will read the reviews first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty device","review":"I bought the RadioShark to record radio programs on NPR and AM talk radio that I can't catch at their regular times. From other reviews, I understand the reception on this device is hit or miss. I live in the city, and FM stations come in and record perfectly, and sound great on my iPod. AM stations are not as good, but most annoying background noise can be improved with the equalizer. I'm pleasantly surprised with how well it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reception","review":"POOR RECEPTIONI've never owned a radio with reception this poor.I'm using Radio Shark on Mac Mini with version 2 beta software. I live in a major market with dozens of radio stations. Only one comes in clearly. I've tried plugging many cords into antenna jack. I've tried USB extension cables to change the location of shark.It does record on a schedule. ACC Recordings land in iTunes and transfer to iPod without human intervention. Unfortunately the software can't record MP3 format. There are several utilities available to transcode the recordings to MP3.My next step is to crack the case and solder on a real antenna jack. Hopefully a real antenna in my attic will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This product is garbage. Reception is poor, even in a metropolitan area. The software interface was written by a monkey. If I had the opportunity to return it, I surely would.Very disappointing, and expensive for being garbage. While it says it records .wav files, I can't get it to do so, and I've been in the computer business for over 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, works NOT","review":"This is such a great idea but it does not deliver. It all comes down to reception which is terrible even in ideal locations with strong signal strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I was dissapointed with the product. It's usability is really poor, required lots of work just to get it to play radio. The inclosed manual leaflet was not very helpful, I had to search the answers from the net. And still I haven't been able to get any recordings done, pressing the REC button just doesn't seem to make anything happen. I don't succeed to record live radio, not to talk about scheduling the recordings beforehands, which was the reason why I bought it in the first place.Additionally, if you think you can use it for recording net radios or pod casts, forget it. The recordings can be done only from from AM/FM radio programs (well, I haven't been able to do even that yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7","review":"Below is the transcript of my help chat with tech supportRadioshark: Welcome to our real-time support chat.

It was easy to install and worked right out of the box. The software has a few minor glitches that are annoying but not fatal. The fatal flaw in this product is the radio reciever itself. I live in the San Antonio area and can only pick up one station with enough clarity to record. On any other radio I own there are a dozen stations that come in very clear. Fornutaly for me the one station I can recieve is the one I wanted to record so the product is working for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So promising, SO disappointing","review":"The AM / FM reception of this device is HORRID. PERIOD.I am a radio amateur for 30 years, intimately ramiliar with the workings of all types of radios, and this one is a horror.Even after connecting 25 feet of line into the 3.5 jack provided on this \\"Shark\\" tail, the reception was marginal at best, and still noisy.For the money, all it provides is an option to input AM FM broadcasts and record, time shift, or schedule record shows onto your computer.However, the only way I am able to do it is to use an FM transmitter RIGHT NEXT TO THE SHARK, and then broadcast the AM FM shows from ANOTHER radio, through the shark and into my computer. BTW, this is a good way to record streaming audio, however you will need two computers to do it, or you will get a severe echo.Lotsa work to get the desired result, IMHO.Griffin should worry less about the catchy \\"Shark\\" and \\"Rocket\\" hip hop Mac designs, and get down to engineering a receiver that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Got this thing for my mobile clinic and it cannot even get the local 50,000 watt AM station (static). It cannot receive FM transmitter from XM radio 7 feet away without major static.Okay- so I brought it in the house- two different rooms where I have radios and OS X macs- the 50000 watt station was barely audible. Who would want to record?I too would like to know what the jack in back is for because it needs an antenna. Another waste of money.Oh- the software seems okay but it is moot when you can't get a decent signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor AM performance","review":"If you want to record AM stations, avoid this.

First - It is not as elegant as other best of category Mac software like Unison; Acquisition; or Delicious Monster. 2nd - the whole method of seting up shortcuts is poorly implemented. 3rd - it does not work with the User Switching mode in OSX meaning anytime you actively switch users on the computer the applicaton records dead air."},{"rating":"2","title":"improving","review":"v.2 of the software running with OS X tiger runs much better, without the freezes and failure to sleep etc. that plagued earlier versions. I plugged an old pair of headphones into the antenna jack and now get better reception & more stations than on my stereo, which has a 6' t-shaped wire antenna.I got this free for pledging on my local NPR station, and I'm not sure I would have paid the full price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behaves Like a Prototype","review":"I've had huge problems getting this thing to actually record a useable file. It apparently saves 5 files as it records, then combines them into the final AAC file. Unfortunately, mine usually leaves the 5 files (3 .mov files and 2 .m4a files) unfinished and uncombined, but NONE of these files can be played by anything -- they all return errors.Of course, this is just one of several issues with this device. The software is crude and limited, the manual nearly useless (\\"troubleshooting\\" amounts to little more than the equivalent of \\"did you turn it on?\\") and there is no supplemental troubleshooting material on the Griffin website. The tuner sensitivity is poor -- I get better reception from a crappy boombox and a $5 flashlight/radio! In fact, I often get crosstalk from other stations.Frankly, this thing stinks. I consider myself burned and probably won't ever buy Griffin products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very week reception","review":"Unfortunately Radio Shark has problems picking up only but the strongest signals. They do not provide hookup for external antenna either that could improve some station reception slightly. Even in the open, it picks up very few stations. The interface needs some work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"the radio shark not ready for prime time","review":"I sent the Radio Shark back because it is not yet ready for prime time. The first obvious thing to do, is to turn it into an ingenious, cheap parabolic antenna on a swivel mount. That way you will get exceptionally good reception for a particular station -- the one you are trying to listen to. We humans can only listen to one radio station at a time. Only an idiot would try to make it look like a Cadillac tailfin.Secondly, it has to be user friendly. The people designing it need to test it on people they don't know, and who are unfamiliar with it (or anything like it) -- and don't blame its faults on the people who are trying it out. Blame it on yourselves. If you want to cheat, reverse engineer an iPod. The iPod succeeded because it is user-friendly and the others were not. If you don't want to put the effort into it, then do something else -- but don't design rocket guidance systems. You might hurt yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept.......poor software and reception","review":"I bought this to record lectures that were broadcast over an in-house fm signal. I've done this before with a portable mp3 recorder and had fine results but thought I could set this up to do it automatically and have the files saved on my computer. I was disappointed that the recordings I made with the radioshark had static in them so the reception must be very weak. Also the software left alot to be desired. I ended up returning this product and went back to setting up my mp3 fm/recorder manually to do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a pretty paper weight","review":"I really wanted to like this product. It was a great concept. TIVO for radio... that's all I want. Unfortunately the engineers at Griffin probably all came from design school and know nothing about radio circuitry. I live in a high-rise in the city and usually get great reception. This unit has no isolation from the computer and just picks up CPU noise. I tried two different computers. The PC software is extremely buggy, freezes often, and actually crashed my computer once. The manual is written in such a relaxed style that it reminded me of an annoying store clerk who tries to use humor to compensate for their lack of knowledge. I am returning mine and will be trying out POGO radio instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Radio Reception","review":"As with other people's reviews, this is a great idea. Unfortunately I can't use a great idea if it can't pick up the radio station I listen to. All other radios in the house can, and Griffin's advice of plugging in headphones to act as an improved antenna only helped slightly. Also had a few minor software problems. All in all, disappointing and will be returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Shark is TERRIBLE","review":"I bought this product a bit ago, and was surprised on how poorly it performed. I hooked it up to my computer, and it only got 1 radio station!!! The radio shark itself is one of the worst receptors I have ever had any experiance with. I have a crappy little alarm clock close to my computer(with no antenna), and it picks up like 15 or 16 stations. So unless you live very close to your most favorite radio station's tower outpost, I would not recommend this product for anyone. You will be very displeased that you wasted all that money...I guarantee it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible software makes it a worthless desktop deco","review":"I bought this gadget in the hope of recording off-hour radio broadcasts and be able to hear them on my mp3 player later.The problem with the device is its software: it has a significant memory and CPU footprint while running (as a service process, which means all the time!). And it almost always crashes when woken by the scheduler for the 2nd time.Furthermore, it records in iPod's format, to convert it to MP3 can literally stop my desktop. Nor does the software allow you to create a separate folder for each recorded program. The reception is meager to say the best. But unlike my tuner, I can't even attach a UHF antenna to it.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another FM tuner for your Mac or PC","review":"This was probably the worst investment I've made for my computers ever. The signal is weak, and if you're more than one wall indoors, forget about getting anything worthwhile. Unless you try one of the many hacks for increasing the power to this device or have an external power supply/antenna for it, you won't catch too many radio stations.My advice: Stay Away from this product. There's a reason why it disappeared from store shelves so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception, even in the heart of Seattle (but worth a try)","review":"The most basic capability of this device is receiving radio signals, and in this area it gets just 1 star out of 5. In Seattle (Eastlake Ave, Lake Union area), I get just a couple FM stations, and 2 or 3 AM stations. Luckily NPR (94.9 KUOW) comes in very well, otherwise I'd have returned it.The user's guide is informal but clear, and the set-up on a Mac/G5 was easy and quick. The software is quite good (no problems at all). Griffin follows Apple's iTunes shortcuts, which is nice attention to detail.If only this device would receive more radio stations (seems pretty basic - how long have we been doing radio?!!) it would be a winner.I'm glad that I have this - and will keep it - since it gets my #1 favorite station.It's a worth a try, but keep the packing materials as chances are high you'll need to return it. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea poorly executed","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I give this tuner very poor marks for reception. Even the strongest FM stations are a bit noisy and otherwise strong AM stations are all but unlistenable. The software interface is nice, as is the hardware. But it's basically worthless for its core function: radio reception. The EQ function flat does not work. As soon as you enable it, the audio gets garbled, even when using the \\"flat\\" preset. I only purchased this because of the easy return policy, which, unfortunatly, I'll be using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Junk","review":"I installed this on my office computer & could not pick up a single station on AM or FM band, I tried re-installing it, re-positioning the device & all I ever got was static. I took it home & tried to install it on my desktop & laptop---nothing but static. My $9 clock radio works fine in the office, but not the Radio Shark. I live in a major urban area with plenty of stations within range & even plugged into an external antennae this junk would not work.

This hat does both jobs fairly well and it looks good too. I have a pretty big head [size 8-8.5] so hat fit is extra important. The small percentage of spandex in this hat really improves the fit. It also has something invisible that supports the front of the hat by stiffening it, which I think really helps it keep its shape through wear and washings.The price [$12.99] is a real bargain for a decent fitted hat, while the bright color and cool appearance only augment the hat's value. These hats seem to hold up pretty well over time too. I'm not sure whether the material is Scotchguarded, but the material doesn't stain and the color doesn't fade -- definite pluses in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and almost useless","review":"I tried to save money, and made a bad decision buying this off-brand cartridge.

All in all if you can handle that kind of crap then give it a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful movie, but had some HILARIOUS parts","review":"As a whole, this was an absolutely terrible movie. However, with that said, a few parts of the movie were funnier than anything I've seen in a LONG time. One part in particular had me laughing so hard, I had to put it on pause and laugh it out for 5 minutes.About half of the movies/jokes didn't go over very well, and ended up being filler in the movie, even though that wasn't the intention. Unfortunately, with a film like this, part of the humor is the people's reaction to Bruno's antics.The shock value in this movie is through the roof. I've read other reviewers say it and I'll say it as well: Bruno isn't for the easily offended, or for kids. There's a tremendous amount of male nudity, and even some female nudity.There were a few bright spots, like I said before. Some extremely funny moments, but as a whole, the movie didn't deliver the goods. But if you want a few HARD laughs and not much of a movie itself, watch this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Although this movie has gleaned some astonishingly favorable reviews here on Amazon, my opinion differs signficantly from the majority. In short, this is a boring and empty movie that tries to be funny through deploying bad taste to the extreme but ends up looking like something a 10-year-old might have thrown together. Whereas Borat was genuinely funny in many places, Bruno is just dull and flat and empty. Not worth the price of a rental - in fact, not really worth the time taken to read the title sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"Dull, boring and sorely lacking in shock value. In fact, the pre-release hype and publicity were much more funny and exciting than this insipid film. I fail to see the appeal. Moreover, there is something of a cruel and sadistic streak to ambushing, intimidating and provoking innocent onlookers into becoming unwilling participants in a humorless farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Harrasment is not that funny","review":"If you need to expose yourself in order to expose bigotry, you're really just provoking it. And thats all the Bruno character does. The movie tries to win a few laughs by trying to corner heterosexuals with an overdose of homosexuality. If you laughed at certain parts of this movie then you think sexual harrasment is funny. Poor taste, the movie is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast forward","review":"i very often watch evey movie I pay for.............couldn't do it.this movie had NO plot that made anything funny.

It is one of the most shocking exhibitions of comedy I've ever seen. That doesn't mean it's the funniest thing I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most outrageous. I have got to give credit where it is due and SASCHA COHEN will do anything for a laugh or shock value. He is one person in Hollywood I would NOT want to be. He has to do way too much to perform his craft, but I guess someone has to do it. Unfortunately for him, he's the best and most sought after at what he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some rehashing of Borat, but just as hilarious and wacky","review":"Borat and Bruno have much in common: they are foreign idiots who cannot comprehend the U.S., yet travel all over it in an attempt to get to know the people better and to become famous. Sacha Baron Cohen outdoes himself again as Bruno, the hapless, flamboyant Austrian who fails at fashion, then at acting, then in several other ways before cutting a hit single for charity with such stars as Bono, Elton John, Slash, and more. On the way to that, he learns a lot about American homophobia, gay conversion ministries, test audiences for TV pilots, the perils of interviewing celebrities, and more. The funniest bit involves O.J., an African baby that Bruno adopts, in a sense, after trading an iPod for him.This is not for those who are easily offended or those for whom satire is over their heads. Otherwise, rent it and laugh like crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.","review":"It's kinda funny. Not nearly as much as Borat, just rate it as ok.

Certainly this is in the build up of Brüno's character but it stops being funny and becomes painful. Seeing how its best parts and cleverly paced humour can be so good it is hard to see such potential wasted.At the end it doesn't come close to Borat and the 18 classification is deserved.Possibly a watcher (not for the faint of heart nor if you object to homophobic humour) but not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money and time","review":"It's not about the money so much.

The big difference is that Borat's character actually had at least SOME endearing aspects about him-he at least attempted to do good for his country. Bruno is basically self absorbed and is willing to do just about anything to get famous.My opinion: uninspired, forced, and not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Arcade games at its best.

First, the intro of the video seamed to be a home video of some sort and then, all of a sudden, one of the Ricky Martin videos comes on, right on the middle of it! There are ONLY 3 Ricky Martin videos that are played over and over again 3 times. It is very disappointing! (it has only the videos of, She is all I ever had, La vida loca and Shake your BON-BON, that is IT!)

I have to sweep my hardwood floors BEFORE I vacuum because even the smallest little piece of paper or other household fluff gets left behind.

The attachments that come with the vacuum are only designed to work with either wood floors, tile floors, or linoleum floors. You will be very disapointed if you buy this vacuum thinking it will clean carpets. If you have just a few oriental rugs and minimal carpeting, you might consider going for the Miele Antares.If you have all bare floors, you will love the Miele Carina for years to come. There durability are the best in the industry. Customers tell me that you can even listen to music when you are vacuuming, it's that quiet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not powerful enough","review":"I have had this vacuum for about 3 years now. I wanted to love it so much (especially considering the price!) but my final verdict is: Disappointing. Pros: Elegant design, lightweight, easily maneuverable, works great on hard wood floors, quiet operation so as not to scare the pets.Cons: TINY dust bags CONSTANTLY need replacement and are EXPENSIVE. Doesn't have enough power to really clean carpet (even with $129 addition of Turbo Brush), doesn't do a good job on pet hair on couch.So in the end I have to say it is not the vacuum of my dreams, and I will not be purchasing another of this type. Maybe next time I'll try one of those Dyson contraptions, if I can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I purchased the Miele Carina vacuum to replace a Kenmore canister vacuum that is falling apart.The Kenmore, even in its dilapidated state is a better vacuum for the same price as the Miele. The controls for the Miele are on the canister itself which requires the user to bend down every time he or she wishes to change the setting. The floor/carpet switch on the head is hard to switch and again requires the user to bend down.It is OK for use on a floor, we have saltillo tile and it works OK. But on low pile carpeting it was incredibly hard work pushing the vacuum around.I'm sticking with my old Kenmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slob in love","review":"I love having a clean house, but I hated vacuuming with my old vacuum, some cheap-o upright.

And it's so quiet - I am amazed. But seeing as how I own so many German made products already, I shouldn't be surprised. The quality, ingenuity, and engineering excellence make this product a pleasure to use. The time it takes me to vacuum is cut in half, that's how effective this product is. I share my home with two large dogs and it picks up all their fur in no time. The parquet floor attachment I bought separately cleans the wood floors wonderfully even under the sofa and armoire. I am so glad I bought it; I only wish I hadn't wasted so much money on the Hoover's, Eureka's and Dirt Devil pieces of junk that I've had in the past and just hated. YAY!!!

A Civil Contract is the one Heyer book I know of that allows the main characters to develop, grow, and mature. An excellent read for anyone, anytime.

I love the swashbuckling air of Georgette Heyer's more usual Regency romances: the controlled, half-concealed violence of her Duke of Avon and her Earl of Rule--the lace and steel. I also love Georgette Heyer's usual clever dialogue: those heroes' biting irony and their wicked wit. It just happens that 'A Civil Contract' is not like that.Here, instead, we have an essentially gentle story, with a hero who, though a soldier, never speaks an unkind or angry word. Financial adversity forces Lord Lynton to give up the woman whom he loves with a passion, and who idolises him as a dashing soldier, and to make a marriage of convenience with the daughter of the rich but unspeakably vulgar Jonathan Chawleigh. But despite all that it is a nice and eventually happy story, in which everyone ends up getting, not perhaps what they want, but, better yet, what makes them happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my Father","review":"I bought this audio book for my father, Percy Wood because it is narrated by Phyllida Nash, my long time friend from St.Clare's in Oxford.My father met her and adored her,years ago.

The first and most important problem is that the topic and main subject of dialogue is an anachronism. Interrational relationships used to be an issue and the original film was a smart approach to tough subject matter. It opened the issue up for discussion among the masses. Because it is a dead issue this remake attempts to inject a dose of humor. The result is campy mess. There is little in this DVD to be entertained by, let alone challenged. Bernie Mac is funny and offers a couple of lines that produce a chuckle. He should be in more true comedy films. Ashton Kutcher is unwatchable, i.e. the new Adam Sandler.

It was very funny in certain parts and had a good overall warm and fuzzy feel to it!!!Definite chick flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like this, not much at all.","review":"This is a rehash of Guess Who Is Coming To Dinner, but it has oppsite qulities to it, It has Ashton Kutcher take the place of Sidney Poiter and the plot is that Bernie Mac and his wife expect their daughter to bring home a rich, wonderful, black man, but she brings home a white \\"boy\\". The jokes were stale, and reminasint of Meet The Parents. They really fell flat on their faces, Bernie Mac outacted Ashton in practically every scene, hands down. He was getting most of the laughs(or chuckles) out of me. He was really showing off his comedic talent, while Ashton was not. I thought that the title of this movie was ridiclous, and didn't tell us anything. The racial jokes were not that funny at all, and I found some offensive, even to blacks and whites. There are more better choices out there than this movie. I recommend you go to those."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER BERNIE CLASSIC","review":"I'M SO GLAD THE QUALITY WAS GOOD IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BERNIE MAC IS NO LONGER WITH US, BUT HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Movie That's Just For Laughs","review":"Guess Who is a funny movie. I think that Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher worked very well together. They are both two very funny guys. This is a comedic spin on the movie classic, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? It's just for laughs. Nobody needs to get uptight, just sit back, relax, laugh, and enjoy the movie.I can say that the only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the dialogue between the two sisters when they were referring to Ashton Kutcher's character's sexual abilities. That was toatlly unnecessary. For that I took off a point and gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that, Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious & touchingly good film","review":"\\"Guess Who\\" is one of those films chosen to just plain enjoy a calm, light-hearted, fun and romantic movie. Bernie Mac shows true acting talent coming across as a sincere protective father, besides the fact that he is hilarious. The actress Zoe Saldana who stars as the daughter to Bernie Mac's character is both a beautiful and gifted actress. The end of this movie was warm, romantic and funny. I would definitely see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"With such a strong cast, I was expecting more - a lot more!

I have to admit it wasn't a bad movie.I liken it a lot to Meet the Parents and that type of humor, with the additon of a good story behind it. Yet, the story the director chose to portray could have been fleshed out much better if they would have focused on some things. I know this is meant to be a comedy (and there are certainly some funny moments), but anytime you bring the race card into play there are some things that should be discussed.Don't get me wrong here, this movie is a good popcorn flick to watch with friends. If you are looking for a deep moving movie... this isn't it. If you need to kill about 2 hours give this shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate Commercials, They Make It Look Good.","review":"I hate those reviews on tv that keeps saying, BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, TWO THUMPS UP, they're saying it so much I wanna get violent. I'm watching it pure basely on the commercials and probably the actors. That guy seems to be only THAT good on the 70s show. Outside, ehhh, not so great. Bernie is like one of those black guys you don't ever wanna argue against, big mouthed and full of bs. Only knows how to argue back.Even so, the movie was sort of funny, but still, failed miserably for how I expected it to be. I remember when movies were about quality and not so much about the $$$.

Everyone I know who saw it thought the same thing, but we all liked it nonetheless. It was still funny, and I always like a happy ending even if it's predictable as hell! After all, it is a remake!Ashton Kutcher is growing on me, as I'm not currently a huge fan of his. He just always seems so dorky, no matter what role he is playing. It's fitting for this movie, and I think he did well. Bernie Mac did well in his role of the girlfriend's intimidating father!

This is a humorless, predictable poor excuse of a movie. For a comedy, this doesn't have much of a comedic set up either. Plus - Ashton Kuchner hasn't appeared in a movie I liked yet.

Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher, who play the father and the girl's love interest, have wonderful chemistry as each try to prove to the other they are looking out for the girl's best interest.This is really one of my favorite Ashton films as the script is beautifully directed and the leads give standout performances.Like many Ashton Kutcher romantic comedies \\"Guess Who\\" (loosley based on the 1967 film \\"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?\\") was an enormous success garnering over $100,000,000 at the box office.The DVD includes deleted scenes, gag reel, commentary by the film's director, and the featurette \\"Love is the Melody: The Making of Guess Who\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"U can watch it a few times","review":"I bought it to watch it when I am travelling.

It's difficult to sit thru this film in one stretch. Much of the humor is infantile and not funny at all. The only funny scene in the film lasts for around ten seconds and features a taxi driver who's not even a part of the plot. This is by far Ashton Kutcher's worst film. I thought Butterfly Effect was simply amazing but with \\"Guess Who\\" he fails to make a faint impression. This is easily the most skip worthy film I have seen in a while. It lacks humor and falls flat on it's face as far as acting,direction and screenplay goes.Watch this film if only you must see every Ashton Kutcher film out there for some reason transparent to me. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great funny movie","review":"I love this movie. It's quite funny and my 10 year old son enjoys it as well.

It is getting old. Yes, you can always come up with a few new jokes but that does not mean it has any redeeming qualities. Bernie Mac's acting has completely gone done the drain along with Ashton Kutcher's who has been down for a while. Those two must have been paid a lot. The jokes are so predictable I almost turned it off. I think one of the points the movie wanted to make is that interacial couples work out and that was carried across very unclear. People reviewing this product have to stop saying it's good just so they get more Yes than No and start saying what is true....which is that this movie sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song Question?","review":"Okay, maybe someone can help me...I hope! Alright at the end of the movie, right around the time the fireworks go off. There's this pretty instrumental song. The piano sounds very pretty and I really like it.

The down side of it seems to be that my taller than average 4 year old has to turn his head to one side when we make a turn in the direction it's attached to, to keep the stroller handle from hitting his head.

His detective skills are uncanny. Each episode is a story all its own. It doesn't leave you hanging from one episode to the next. Tony Shalhoub is the perfect actor for this part.

Many of the same elements that make Akira such a classic, are present an Domu, without following the story, or formula. Domu is a classic story of an pure, innocent, goodness, fighting against a powerful evil, who won't give up his realm without a fight!As for the artwork, it is gorgeous. It's drawn in a simple black and white, like many other graphic novels. It's very well drawn and really fills out the world they live in. The angels and perspectives really draw you in.

His stuff makes everyone elses manga look like crap. Also, while Domu isn't as intensely violent as Akira, it's still not for young kids, it does have quite a bit of violence and lot's of people get killed, including a few little kids.

Katsuhiro Otomo is definatly one of the best names in manga in anime, and lives up to that name, originally set with \\"Akira\\", with this extremily compeling book. \\"Domu\\" is definatly one you should pick up, sci-fi, manga, fantasy, and just about in form of fiction fans alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Domu is fantastic!

He's hardly in any of the episodes and when he is he's there for only 1 or 2 jokes and then leaves.

Eventually the element will burn out but not before the control unit has a loose connection and burns wires loose on the element. It happens every time! I have been repairing the loose connection with some soldering effort to make the element last till burn out. No more. I am trying the charbroil patio model. The replacement elements are cheaper and I hope they don't have a connection problem on the control unit.

Speaking of the stove, this electric grill makes everything taste like it was cooked indoors on my stove.

The only thing I could compare it to are the small, handheld transistor radios that were popular in the seventies. The charger dock works fine but will not charge my ipod with a protective rubber sleeve on it. It also has a cool blue light that shines behind your ipod when the unit's power is on.

I LOVE this book though!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeny Tiny Mini Edition","review":"Please look carefully at the product specs, especially the size: 5.3 x 4.1 x 0.4 inchesI bought it because I loved this book as a child and the large version was way overpriced, but this mini book was not worth $4...maybe $2. It would make a nice stocking stuffer or Easter basket goodie but it's not really sturdy enough for children to use, and the type is too small for a early reader to comfortably read.I was so excited about finding this book that I overlooked the size. I absolutely love this story, just not this copy! My kids sat on the floor around me and I read this to them, and they could barely see the pictures because of the \\"mini\\"ness of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Story","review":"Kat is torn between her stubborn pride, the man she loves, and her dreams of her own success. Can they all come together and bring her happiness? Will the culture of her times permit her to be her own person? The road to success and happiness isn't always easy, and not always the same road. It is also a question of how many can stand the tests along the way.A must read! This is a remarkable story full of history, adventure, suspense and romance. Kat is an enjoyable character. She is strong despite what she is faced with, and the author's ability to paint her portrait as well as those of the other characters in this book is remarkable.I truly enjoyed this book from cover to cover, and have nothing but praise for the author who knew the history of the era and place the novel was set in, as well as how to portray it all in a very convincing and capturing manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"When my kids dragged me to see this movie I thought there was nothing I would enjoy. To my surprise, what I enjoyed most were the songs! They reminded me of my youth! Most of these songs are remade classics. Some are even better than the original songs! My kids are singing the songs with me and they can't believe that I know the lyrics too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lizzie, Gordo...no Miranda??","review":"First off I got to say is that the only reason The Lizzie McGuire Series is popular is because of the 'things' they go thru, in which many people can relate to. But also, the fact that there are three best friends who stick together....The Lizzie McGuire Movie was an off the bat Hit in the big screen. I don't know any Lizzie fan who didn't watch this charming movie. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the corny line, the one where Paolo tells Lizzie she looks like something (I think the sun?).In the beginning Lizzie says to Gordo that Miranda is on Vacation (Mexico City). But I think if they had them all...it would have been much more...whats the word...edgier. I don't know...I am only a critic.Well, thank you for the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"damned opening,good ending!!!!!!","review":"for the first time i saw it,3 words lived in my mind:bored,stupid,cheap.........but then,at the end of the movie,i think different:it's a sweet movie(just at the ending!!!!)so i don't like hilary duff too much,she's too fat&her; voice got something like britney,she's try to be like britney........i don't like this movie,it's not real for teen even it's have a little bit cute....so if you are want to have real movie,real romantic,you must watch what a girl wants movie!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie of all time, right by all Disney Movies","review":"This is the worst movie of all time, well, i say that about pretty much every Disney movie(Exept Pirates of the Carribean).Hillary should stick to doing... ummmm...well... what does she do good at? Well i can tell you that it is not acting or singing for SURE. I only watch this movie when i want to fall asleep, but i stopped because it kkept giving me horrible nightmares. This movie was just a huge, crappy publicity ad for Duff. And i'lll guess she is gunna be the next Britney spears, I'll give her 2 years untill she starts swearing and wearing skimpy Clothes. So basicly we have all had enough of Hiliry Duff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is the BEST!","review":"I LOVE this movie. Hilary is such a good actress and I can't wait till it comes out on DVD and video. I wish they had the \\"Lizzie\\" series on DVD. That would be cool! I also like her songs. My most favorite is \\"What dreams are made of\\" I think she sings good and dances great also.At first I didn't even know that the series was even on. I actually never heard of it. Then I was at my friends house and they had the disney channel on and Lizzie was on. I think that was the first time I knew about her. It was interesting for me so I started to like it but wasn't so crazy. I didn't have cable @ my house at the time so I couldn't even watch it. When I finally got cable, I found out that I had the disney channel and I started watching Lizzie. Then when I heard the movie was going to be out in May, I started watching the series even more and after I watched the movie, I became a big fan of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Lizzie McGuire Movie\\" is the best movie I've seen ...","review":"I'm a fan of the \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" show, and I was excited when I heard they would be making a movie. I will admit, I went to the movie theater expecting a funny and even dumb movie. What I got was a great, feel-good movie with a good plot and a great lesson to be learned. As it turns out, Gordo and I have a great deal in common ... shy, somewhat socially challenged, and willing to do anything to help a friend. He is my favorite character. Hilary Duff is talented and very beautiful ... she will go far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate Ending","review":"We saw this movie in the theaters because my daughter is a Duff fan. It was far more tolerable than I expected it to be, though I won't give it 'good' or 'enjoyable'.When it came out on DVD, Disney advertized an alternate ending. My husband endulged and we now own it. The alternate ending is a 30 second tacked on bit in the plane home in which Lizzie exclaims, \\"At least I got to keep the clothes!\\"If I can keep just one person from buying this movie, my time here will have been worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I nominate this movie for the worst movie of the year award!","review":"If there was an award for the worst movie of the year The Lizzie McGuire Movie would win with out a doubt. A monkey could have written a script with a thicker plot. The movie from the beginning was very predictable and cheesy. It had no substance. Anyone who liked it only liked it because Hilary Duff was in it. The movie itself was nothing like the show Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie's best friend, Miranda, was not there, Kate, Lizzie's enemy was nice, and Ethan, Lizzie's not so smart crush, was actually acting intellectual. All in all I would rather watch grass grow than see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder Faye Dunaway wants to slap the crap out of her!!","review":"This so called \\"actress\\" thinks she can play \\"Bonnie\\" in \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\"?I wouldn't blame La Dunaway to reprise \\"Mommie Dearest\\" and beat Duff with a wire hanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lizzie McGuire....How Disapppointing","review":"I am 16 and I was very disappointed. Lizzie was a brat in this. Kate was incredibly nice, and Ethan was smart. I think it was really mean of Lizzie to totally ditch Gordo for the cute popstar. Some parts were ok but the plot was dumb. They were nothing like the TV characters people love. I think if you see this movie you are bound to be let down, because of its slowness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but not perfect.","review":"The \\"Lizzie McGuire Movie\\" is in all a cute movie with a few flaws. If you go expecting a great caliber movie, you'll be disappointed. It's just pure fun with beautiful Rome as a backdrop. Ms. Hilary Duff is the big problem with the movie. She seems not to be able to act with another person without seeming like she is on a different planet and not all there. The supportive cast provides the laughs. Alex Borstein is great and provided funny antidotes. The Italian characters are played by Americans and seem to be the to provide comic relief as bumbling fools. They even pronounce Italian words wrong. Paolo always pronounces Franca as Franka. Also the color of the film is different the TV show (as many TV to movies are) It is first annoying but you finally get used to it. In the end \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" is a cute little family film, once you get past the little flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUX!!!!!!!","review":"Ok, all my friends agree with me on this, this movie was horrible, not to mension I fell asleep in the movie theater while watching it. The plot is stupid and you just know what happens. I don't like Lizzy McGuire but I saw it one Friday night just becuz I was bored, I'd rather be washing a ton of dirty dishes than watch that movie! So don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie SUCKED!","review":"I HATE this movie. This movie is one of the WORST and BORING movies of all time. Hilary Duff CANNOT act OR sing! She's a freakin' poser for God's sake! And the movie is SO unrealistic. A high school trip to Rome?! PLEASE! The whole movie was horrible, not funny, and just plain boring. Hilary Duff should give up acting and singing for the sake of the world. Even better, work at McDonalds, Hilary!! LMAO. All in all, this movie sucked, and is a TOTAL waste of money. (I gave it too my older sister who's obsessed with Hilary Duff :P)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"What a great movie!

Herbie the Love Bug is one example of how bad these movies can get. After watching 10 excrutiating minutes (Believe me, thats all I could take before the nausea kicked in) of this dreck, I was wishing for a Herbie the Love Bug marathon.Duff can't act, sing nor does she have any on-screen appeal. She is just another pop star clone created by Disney and her publicist, stamped with a \\"safe for kids\\" label. Don't worry parents, your 14 year-old Ritilin addicted daughters will love this waste of film due to the mindless dialog, music video styled, rapid-fire camera work and the fasion show scenes.Plus there's no trace of true romance to be found in Duff's boring, sanitized world. To make things worse, in Duff's Italy everyone speaks English. Children should not be subjected to this much stupidity in one film; steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Experience Ever","review":"I rented this movie on Saturday with a very open mind. I watched it on Saturday night and thought it was the worst movie ever! The acting is mediocre and the plot is equally bad. I normally like the show so I'm not a Lizzie McGuire hater, but this was an extreme disappointment. If you want to have respect for Hilary Duff do not watch this movie. It is so horrible it will make you want to cry. The plane ride to Rome was the highlight of the movie and the clothes were pretty cool. Oh, and how Lizzie ignored Gordo the whole movie made me annoyed at her, but I guess the end for them is as good as it's gonna get because it's Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"ivbrokenmyfingernails!!!igottafindsomethingtocoveritupbe4pro","review":"m tomorrow!

It will appeal to Mary-Kate and Ashley fans.PS: she has a disastrous voice, although shes really pretty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney movies are ruining the world!","review":"What I hate about Disney movies is how they give a false sense of reality. In Disney's world, there are no such things as corruption(Disney), terrorism, racism, violence, hatred, greed(Disney), or anything that is constantly plaguing the human race. In this movie, Britney wannabe Lizzie goes to Europe and suddenly becomes a pop star! This movie is not funny at all; in fact, none of Disney's movies are funny. If you found this movie funny, or if you find any Disney comedy funny, I feel sorry for you. Lizzie is encouraging child molesters to molest children(something Disney enjoys to see). Boycott Lizzie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of the series","review":"This movie completely ignored the developments of the tv series. Lizzie seemed to forget she realized Gordo liked her (the costume party episode and the series finale). Instead of using this movie as a great opportunity to delve into Gordo and Lizzie's relationship, its wasted on some random Italian popstar. Furthermore, Lizzie appears very un-Lizzie like here as a shallow and rude girl. What made her character great - the insecurity, the sweetness - is lost here. And the fact that Miranda is not here so Kate is the friend is bizzare. And no Tudgeman!!!!!! Clearly this was a vanity project to show off Hilary Duff, not a way to end the series. The ending is nice on the rooftop, but too little too late, the movie should have focused on Lizzie/Gordo."},{"rating":"2","title":"gordo=hot","review":"this is a really good movie, and most people would rag on me for saying this, but gordo is HOT. lol but anyways, bac to the movie... ;) Most people say that \\"this movie is sooo unrealistic\\" or \\"that could never happen\\". Well, maybe not, but whats the fun in going to the movies or renting a dvd just to see a bunch of footage of \\"realistic\\" situations. i mean, my friends and i would never pull that off in rome, or ever even go to rome for that matter, but its fun to imagine, ya know? just hope this helps give support to my fellow \\"lizzie\\" fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film ever","review":"This film is one of the best I have seen. It really relates to what I want to do and who I want to be. I watched the Lizzie Mcguire series and really enjoyed it but this is even better.

First off,every actor is in desperate need of acting lessons, or, in lieu of acting lessons, a punch in the throat. Yes, the acting was that bad. The opening montage sets the pace for the rest of the movie, assuming you consider \\"Hey look, we're in a city, why are my ears assaulted by the screaming of demons?\\" to be a pace. This movie was horrible, and Disney has disappointed before, but this is one of their absolute worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy and lacks acting skills","review":"The whole movie was completely pointless with hillary duff dancing around like some maniac. There is only like one scene in the whole movie without hillary and the plot is completely unbelievable. The only highlight of the entire movie was the extremely HOT italien rock star, Paulo Valisari, who in my opinion is the only one that can act. Yet, the only decent character turns out to be evil in the end! I guess fans of the series will enjoy the sometimes romantic parts of the movie. On the whole, the movie was bad, but if you like hot foreign guys and hillary duff, i guess u may enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of Duff!!!","review":"Two words: Bad Movie.It was what I expect from a Hilary Duff movie, and let me tell you, I wasn't expecting much. The movie was bad. Not terrible, but bad.The whole movie was about a girl who goes to Rome(?) for a some school trip or something, and winds up meeting some famous Italian boy singer who's partner left him. But amazingly, Lizzie McGuire looks exactly like her, so the boy wants her to be his partner. She accepts and then has to fake her way through doing the work she should be doing for school (Naughty girl!!) to secretly meet with that guy.I recommend these movies instead....What A Girl Wants (Amanda Bynes) PG.....Way better!!! A great girl-power story!Agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) PG.....Not a girl story, but still awesome! Hilary Duff is in this one, but not as a main character.Miss Congeniality (Sandra Bullock) PG-13.....One of my favorites! About a tom-girl cop who investigates the Miss America Pageant by going undercover as contestant. Hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary! Get the MEM-O!","review":"It's over, Duff!!!

Well, youve played Lizzie Macguire and um, also...Well, gee, I guess thats it. One stinkin character and you played it to the ground. Your movie tanked and there wont be another one, not because your manager mommie wants more money, but more like nobody CareS!!! So take a hike, Duff.

But that's ok b/c I love Gordo- but they should have at least made out at the end- one kiss- come on- that's pitiful, the guy covered for you the whole time Lizzie...I hope the alternate ending has some smooooching ! Love ya Gordo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap imitation of Amanda Bynes","review":"This movie is based on a show on the Disney Channel, called The Lizzie McGuire Show. It is clearly a cheap imitation of The Amanda Show, a show that aired soon before The Lizzie McGuire show did. The Amanda Show stars Amanda Bynes, and actress with talent. Hilary Duff (who plays Lizzie) has absolutely no talent whatsoever, and is constantly trying to be as good as Amanda Bynes--BUT SHE NEVER WILL BE!!!Amanda Bynes then started to star in movies. In 2002 she starred in Big Fat Liar, and in 2003 she starred in What a Girl Wants. Isn't it very cooincidental that soon after these movies came out, this crap-ola movie came out? I suggest that customers avoid this title, and buy something better from amazon.com.Well, finally the Disney Channel fired Hilary (Hilary actually expected to be paid as much as a real star LOL). They'll show reruns, but for now, Hilary Duff is out of the Limelight. There will also be no sequel to this movie. (YES!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Girl","review":"Why, look. She's gone from voiceing an ugly, gawky drawing on a dumb cartoon to having her own live-action moive. Another overblown child star. Please.

What an excellent role model. Did someone say role model? She's like a living store display. Her first song is \\"So Yesterday\\" -- who came up with that title? A ten-year-old? Oh, wait. She did. It's my idea that if you can sing, you probably can't act (Madonna), and vice-versa, it's just too many talents for one person. You can badly voice what's just another ugly, cheap, meaningless, and badly-done cartoon, what a good reason to think you can have your own wannabe CD and cheesy movie!

It's funny with disney chanel-type humor. However, I hated the movie. The plot could have been thought up by a 6 year old, it was the cheesiest, most predictable movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It stars Hilary Duff as Lizzie, and she goes on a field trip to Rome. While in Rome, she is spotted by an Italian pop star who thinks she should join him in his performance at an awards show. How realistic is that? Yeah, this movie was horrible. The plot had a lot of holes in it and it didn't have the same humor or even all of the characters as the show does, Lanny and Miranda were missing. Where were they? Don't see this movie, it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD case in pieces","review":"When I received this movie the case was destroyed.

Not to mention that a lot of girls from our area went to a Hilary Duff concert not too long after the movie released. This show/movie brings back a lot of memories! I am considering purchasing the DVD to watch strictly for nostalgic purposes. I'm not saying that you should buy this movie for your teenager, but I am saying that I really enjoyed it as a child and I'd watch it again to reminisce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break!","review":"I'm not really a fan of Hilary Duff, so I thought that this movie was kind of lame. Hilary isn't that great of an actor, she's kind of fake; like Marykate and Ashley. She's all sappy and the good girl. None of that could ever happen to a normal teen. I wasted my money on this movie. Duff fans would really like this movie. But if you really want great movies get the Lord of the Rings series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents, Think Twice!","review":"The only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the Natalie Holloway case, about the girl last summer that went on that school trip, went off with a boy and disappeared. In this movie, Hilary Duff's character is on a school trip to Rome, meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around Rome. I felt so bad that Disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of Natalie Holloway. In this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they didn't even show that part. Young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie. Hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear(1 and a half stars)","review":"As I was reading other reviews, my mouth dropped open.

Its breezy and predicatable3 Despite the plot problems, they put in too much sap and goo and morals. It's sick4 The Italian charecters are fake sounding with wierd accents that don't sound Italian (and I have been to Italy)5 Some side charecters seem out of placeOverall, the only reason to see this movie is if you love Hillary.

Thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lizzie spin-off proves to be worth 5 stars","review":"I was a huge Lizzie fan. But extremely disappointed at the end of the show. I didn't see why Lizzie's years couldn't continue through high school, but I guess Duff and Disney hit heads on that one.The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a \\"spin-off\\" to the show Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie (Hilary Duff) has decided to embark on a field trip to Rome before her freshman year. Gordo (Adam Lamberg), one of her best friends, comes along for the ride, as well as some other classmates, that devoted viewers will remember from the show. Miranda, as it is put, is off in New Mexico visiting relatives.During the trip, Lizzie bumps into a Italian young man named Paolo (Yani Gellman) and HE realizes she's identical to his former pop partner, Isabella.

Much more thoughtful than your average Christian examination of music, which is, \\"listen to this song backwards and go burn your records!!\\" HB2 is compassionate and produced at an extraordinary level of excellence. The ultimate goal of HB2 is not to get you to hate rock music, but to get you to realize that the art you are on a steady diet of, usually reflects a heart condition, and that has much bigger implications than we are usually aware of.

These worked on a 13 dress shoe with rubber sole, but not a walking shoe, both Ecco. When fits the shoe snugly will be too hard to pull on and off. It's the back edge on the heel which requires a larger dimension going on than after on. The only way is to have it loose on the shoe.

Instead, slip these bad boys over your shoes and they are perfect for snow, mud, etc. They seem tough, they travel well and roll up easily.

To my surprise, I had to use a tremendous amount of effort to stretch the rubber overshoe over my Rockport casual shoes. When I tried to take the overshoe off, it took my entire shoe off my feet.

Daly's definition of heterosexual relationships as being instigated only by men towards women is not only incorrect but insulting. One could almost accuse Daly of being heterophobic, and isn't bigotry supposed to be wrong?

While Mary Daly certainly has all the rhetorical flair with which her disciples credit her, this gift of the gab is too often used to justify an essentially close-minded viciousness which leaves any attempt at actually useful philosophy in the dust. It's strange that Daly so consistently castigates the rhetorical abuses of the patriarchy (which are, I absolutely agree, often horrifying) while failing to perform any better in this, her answer to male-determined language. Worse, while she claims to represent all *true* feminists, her argument for this claim is to simply recategorize any feminist who dares to disagree with her as a 'fembot', a brainless casualty of patriarchy. She appears either unable to get over the very paradigms of violent hierarchy which she claims to oppose, or else is somehow under the gross missapprehension that a cycle of violence is somehow to be prefferred to actual progress for feminism or society at large.

They will however supply the answers to half the exercises in a companion CD called their Cyber Classroom, but that's an additional cost.

It moved me as no other book about Africa can. If you loved the little Bushman on \\"The Goods Must Be Crazy\\", you must read Laurens Van Der Post. The underlying motive in this work is to give you the very great gift of intimacy with the little people of the Kalahari. Van Der Post is so taken with them that his life and life works center around the African Bushman. He leads you to believe that our civilization and each of us personally is missing unbelievable magic in our lives -- magic that is a natural posession of the mystical Bushman. I remain entranced with a new awareness and a deeper sense of our potential, if only we could find our way back to our natural selves. \\"Story Like the Wind\\" should appeal to almost anyone, from hunters and adventurers to thinkers, romantics and fantasy lovers. If you read it the world will be better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read.","review":"This book and its sequel, A Far-Off Place, have it all.

The familiar is the growing of age of a young boy. The foreign is the African setting with its rich native culture. The tension between Western beliefs and values and those of the indigenous people is neatly drawn through the eyes of Francois, a 13 year white, who has grown up in both worlds. Layered on top of that is the seemingly senseless turmoil and blood letting among African tribal groups.

As one reviewer noted, there's just too much Zee adoration and Joshua junk. There is very little excitement. Like Martha's Vineyard after the tourists (finally!) go home.

J.W. makes enemies with the state's top environmentalist, and when he finds a dead body, the police put J.W. on top of the suspect list. So J.W. starts using his old police skills to do a little amateur detective work for his own good. Meanwhile, Hollywood seems to have discovered not only the island, but photogenic Zee.

I started off not being all that impressed. I purchased it for my middle school library and when I started reading it I felt it was not really appropriate for this age group due to the drinking and sex in the beginning. The more I read though the more I enjoyed the book. Although I would not suggest it to the younger middle schoolers, I think it would be a great book for students 14 and up. It would be especially appropriate for anyone who has dealt with adoption.It is a beautiful story of family and finding one's self. It also does a great job of including lessons on Judism without turning the book into \\"Jewish Book\\". The story brought me to tears without being morbidly sad saccharine sweet. I would give this book a 4 1/2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very highly recommended addition to personal and community library audiobook collections","review":"A Brief Chapter In My Impossible Life, definitively read by actress Mandy Siegfried, and brilliantly authored by Dana Reinhardt, is the engaging story of sixteen year old Simone. With nothing too special or unique about her, Simone is aware of her being adopted, yet it comes as a very peculiar shock when she receives a phone call one day to discover who her mother was, causing great concern and introspection for Simone, and interesting all engaged readers/listeners. A Brief Chapter In My Impossible Life is a flawless recorded, 5 hour, 30 minute, five disc, very highly recommended addition to personal and community library audiobook collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Bashing","review":"This book amounts to Christian bashing. The only Christian in the story is a fanatic. Everyone else is either agnostic, atheist or Jewish and they are all portrayed as intelligent, insightful and balanced. When a Jewish character recites Jewish prayers and sings religious songs, the atheists are awestruck. Meanwhile one atheist character spends two full pages explaining that Christmas is no longer a Christian holiday, but a secular one for everyone to celebrate. Perhaps Reinhardt is assuaging her own conscience for indulging in the joys of a Christian holy day that celebrates the birth of Jesus.I don't see how it is acceptable to bash Christians and Christianity when the equivalent targeting any other religion would not be tolerated for a moment.I will not recommend this book to any patrons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kawaii!","review":"This volume takes off exactly where the last left off, and doesn't disapoint the reader.

Dusk puts his own spin on The Beatles' \\"Please Please Me\\", creating an introspective, somewhat remorseful tune, working with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Along with originals from Dusk, he pays homage to jazz greats of the past with a crisp rendition of Bart Howard's \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\".

His notes are accurate and consistent, but never quite impress. There has to be an emotional connection with every song, a story being told, a drama that the artist creates and shares with the audience every time. Matt is technically smooth, but I don't know what he's feeling, if anything. I love jazz music and standards, but this album is just a snoozer all the way through. I can find five different versions of any one of these standards that I know would awe me, touch my heart, and blow my mind.

He makes the songs sexy because of his one of a kind voice and he gives the songs his own little touch.I definately recommend this album to anyone is enjoys the sounds of smooth sensational music."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR from Sinatra","review":"I really don't know what the rest of you are listening to but,he sounds NOTHING like Sinatra whatsoever. His voice is neither WARM nor smooth. I'm glad I didn't buy this album (borrowed from a friend), it was a complete let down. I was expecting more genuine feeling and emotion expressed in the music but found NONE of that. What I did find was a second rate, over engineered boring lounge act that caught a lucky break on a reality show.[geez...was that a synthesizer I heard in there?!] Peter Cincotti is just a notch below Dusk in the wannabe crooner catalogue. If you want to listen to a Canadian crooner with real talent and vocal ability, try Michael Buble whom I've grown to love...something hard to say after being an avid Harry Connick, Jr. fan for over 16 years. Please save your money and don't by a Matt Dusk album...it's not worth the jewel case it came in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Matt Dusk","review":"While this CD is well-done technically, both in terms of the music and singing, there is a haunting hollowness to Dusk's singing. Through simply attempting to emulate Sinatra, he rarely finds his own voice and his own feelings, hence the hollowness. In the creative arts, strict imititation (as we have it here) is not a form of flattery, but simply reflects a lack of a creative self... This is more about music industry marketing than the music, which is truly sad. My advice: Digg out some real Frank Sinatra or Ray Charles or explore some authentic modern singer-songwriter artists (e.g., Ben Foulds, Bruck Cockburn, Elliot Smith). Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no life in this cd.","review":"I gave this cd many chances. I really wanted to like this cd. I'm a fan of Harry Connick Jr., Jamie Cullum, Peter Cincotti and Michael Buble. From what I understood, Matt Dusk was cut from the same cloth.Wrong.Matt has a good voice. It's pleasant enough to listen to (think Frank Sinatra meets Steve Lawrence), but it sounds like he's holding back any energy he may have. He's much too subdued. He comes across as spiritless.I know the cd credits say there's real live people playing on this, but it does'nt sound like it. The arrangements and performances by the musicians are not bad per say, just.....bland. The whole cd just sort of plods along. All the songs have about the same tempo. It NEVER swings.The words drab, flat, tame and uninspired all come to mind.Matt needs to breathe some life into his next recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martini, Straight up!!","review":"This CD has taken me and placed me in a place so intoxicatingly beautiful. Matt has created a secret place for me to escape to and be lost in. His smooth vocals, and ability to bring the songs to life and touch my soul, are not without merit. Applaud this young man for a style and sound not duplicated. I can think of no better way to spend an eveing then in a little black dress, a martini straight up and this CD, whether alone or with someone special. What a phenominal release, easily enjoyable for all music lovers of every genre. A must addition to your collection that will time and again, uplift, transport and please all ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall in Love with this Crooner","review":"I first heard Matt Dusk sing on the hit show \\"The Casino\\" and I instantly fell in love with his voice and demeaner. I immediately bought the cd and was taken aback by the maturity that this 24 yr old emits. If you're a fan of the sounds of Sinatra then you must check this cd out. Matt brings a sense of class and style that you would normally have to go back to the days of the Rat Pack to find. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for high quality music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Copying Frank Sinatra. Stop the cheese!","review":"I love to hear old standards and such. But I like to hear people who put their own take on it. I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe. Where are the male versions of Nora Jones? Tone down the cheese! We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall. But what can I expect from the music industry? Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention. So, hmmm, nevermind.

His message (and he comes from a pedigreed MIT and Princeton scientific background - with a little eastern mysticism mixed in) is that we all need to learn about this \\"force\\" and use it for GOOD.I respect the Dr.'s education and intelligence, but he is unwittingly serving the \\"god of forces\\" spoken of Daniel 11:38 and helping pave the way for the coming One World Religion. One does not \\"use the force\\", rather the \\"force\\" uses you. This is the same \\"force\\" found in Kabbalah and Freemasonry. A more valuable investment would be the King James Bible, with the Gospel of John, Ch. 3 providing you the path to the only real power capable of overcoming this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Frontiers","review":"Dr. Swanson is a highly credentialed physicist that has done a remarkable job of making sense of a myriad of anomalous paranormal phenomenon. While most scientists avoid offering explanations for subjects such as remote viewing or ESP, Claude is not only comfortable discussing these subjects, he shows us that they may be connected on the frontiers of modern physics.The Synchronized Universe is written in an easy to read style and includes a number of fascinating examples that call for a new look at our present understanding of the world. This is a timely book and sure to spawn a greater debate on the nature and physics of consciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sychronized Universe ; New Science of the Paranormal","review":"Dr. Swanson is obviously that rare individual in our society, a scientist with an open mind! His book, The Synchronized Universe; New Science of the Paranormal, is a refreshing & long awaited work that succinctly addresses the fundamental questions humanity faces. In light of the current \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" view of reality that is fed to us by mainstream science. Dr. Swanson boldly steps beyond the boundaries of the compartmentalized, scientific paradigm and offers a theory that sheds light on the true nature of reality. Highly recommended by this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite book ever on science & the paranormal","review":"This is a book I purchased several years ago, and I have probably read it over 3 dozen times. The pages are worn out on it from me reading it so many times. Dr. Claude Swanson, a Dr. in Physics, delves deeply into the possibilities of all aspects of paranormality-The collective consciousness, prophecies, ghosts and the afterlife, remote viewing, parallel realities, levitation & teleportation---the list goes on and on. He tackles the issues from a scientific standpoint proving that many of these \\"myths\\" are nothing of the sort-they have been PROVEN time and time again to be REAL in a scientific laboratoty setting. This book is absolutely mind-blowing, and Dr. Swanson is to be commended for having the courage to step forward and go where many scientists refuse to.FANTASTIC book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deals!!","review":"Entertainmet books are a must!

Although Highet shares a few practical principals of teaching, such as suggesting that effective teaching involves clarity, patience, and responsibility on the part of the teacher. The majority of the text is an exercise in verbose accounts of ancient teachers and teaching styles. I am certain that when this book was published in 1950, it did apply to teachers who dealt with classrooms where very few behavior problems existed and students worked quietly without questioning presentation or authority. However, in today's classroom, this text has very few applications unless you are looking for tried and true ways to lecture to students."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Teaching","review":"Highet is more impressed with his large 4 syllable vocabulary and knowledge of ancient history than he is in writing a practical guide to teaching. What he says in 250 pages, he could have said in 20. His opinions consist of very out-dated, simplistic methods that don't even address the reality of a classroom in the 90's or \`00's. In his opinion, women hardly exist except to bear children and stay in the background! His statement, \\"Men, we can still learn, even from our wives.\\" shows how narrowminded his views of the modern world are. Very little of this book, written in 1950, would apply to today's students or their needs. Not recommended for anyone seriously considering the teaching field or wanting to know anything about how to teach (unless, perhaps, you are a college professor who teaches by lecture only, and has nothing more to do than wade through 250 pages of Highet's pompous meanderings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamentals of Good Teaching Never Change","review":"I am distressed by some of the reviews posted concerning this excellent book. Since when did thorough preparation, ever-increasing command of subject matter, and relevancy in the lives of students fall out of disfavor with some of my colleagues? Highet presents, at least in the first half of this book, the absolute fundamentals of good teaching in a clear and precise way. The examples, while perhaps sounding quaint, are still relevant for good teaching today. Highet makes it clear that good teaching is a way of life rather than a way to make a buck. We need this kind of reminder, and my fellow teachers and I need to get back to the basics of great teaching that Highet outlines. In an age of flim-flam techniques and razzle-dazzle entertainment passing as good teaching, this book is refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fast shipping, no real problems","review":"The only problem I had was I little scratch on disc one.

The book is a good insight to the fundamental approach of selecting and weighting handicapping factors, although today's techniques are more rigorous.

Does it have a better picture than the restored version? Does it have a better soundtrack than any of the other versions? Because if there is one thing this movie suffers from it's a lousy soundtrack. I've heard six different soundtracks, and they're all terrible. Does it have bonus features not found elsewhere? Tell me, why should I drop up to 15 dollars on a cheap dvd-r when professional dvds are available at a lower cost.

My advice if you want to know the truth, read the bible and let the Holy Spirit show you the truth and be prepared for whatever way the future turns out.Anyway, do we really need another end time prophecy book? Let's face it, no one knows how the future will turn out but God and most prophecy books are just speculation.The Rapture Ready message board is also a very censored board and does not allow different opinions to be spoken, only the ones that they agree with. Different views are quickly suppressed. Too bad, it could have been a great Christian site to share the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"Book is biased to the authors religious views, is not an unbiased presentation of information on the subject and is a shameless promotion for their other fictional novels as it contains numerous excerpts from the Left Behind novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if it isn't a convenient time to Rapture?","review":"This book fails to answer a basic question many Christians have: what if it isn't a convenient time to Rapture? For example, everytime I sit on the toilet, I say \\"Please, God, don't take me now! I've been constipated 6 days, and here on the 7th I'm about to lose 10 pounds, so don't take me flying until I'm done\\". Other people ask about what happens if the Rapture occurs while they are having \\"marital interactions\\" (there is no sin in the marital bed). I can't picture my wife and me floating up to heaven naked and intertwined like pretzyls! I think the book should have given us more tips on how to be ready for Rapture, and whether God will make allowances for sitting on the pot or on our wife's face! We do keep rain coats and umbrellas in all rooms and in the car, in case we are Raptured during a winter storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this count towards my frequent flyer miles?","review":"I picked this book up by accident and I loved it. Crazy people are funny. But they're even funnier when them seem to take themselves seriously. This is the sort of book that you'd buy if your looking to laugh at someone else's stupidity. That people believe they'll be lifted up to the heavens to spend an eternity with Jesus - wait 'till they find out he's not white! - is emperical evidence of P.T. Barnum's \\"fool\\" maxim.

I chose it because it has some of my favorite oldies including \\"Laisse tomber les filles\\", \\"N'ecoute pas les idoles\\", and \\"Nous ne sommes pas des anges\\". But with 23 songs on one CD, it is apt to include some so-so songs, too.

That's how much I like this stuff. Yeah, there are some real duds (eg \\"Sacre Charlemagne\\"), but they are easily redeemed by the rest. Creative, inventive 60's pop, perfect arrangements, and delivered in that little girl voice that some people just hate. Her pitch is a little off (noticeable because she uses no vibrato), but her sense of rhythm is impeccable. If this is 'ye-ye' music --and that's very debatable-- then it's time to rehabilitate that label. Okay, the Gainsbourg tunes are among the best, but what a shame not to look any further! (Interesting: not a single cover version here, in an era dominated by adaptations of the Anglo-American top ten.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Delightful","review":"It was so much fun to discover this innocent sounding, sweet voiced singer just recently. I am not a big fan of music that's not in English, but France Gall is a joy to listen to. I tried to listen to some other Ye Ye singers of the 60's, but none measured up to France Gall. These are fun, enjoyable songs, even if you don't understand the words. Suggest you watch a couple of her videos on You Tube to see what she is all about. I especially liked La Cloche and Ein Bisschen Geothe, En Bisschen Bonaparte, both which unfortunately are not on this album. There are plenty of other good songs here though. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toffee Peanuts--Emerald Universally Lousy","review":"I can see the appeal of these honey roasted peanuts since they have 3x the salt and sugar of other brands, but for me the salty-sweetness was excessive, leaving a burning sensation in my throat. These peanuts contain almost 30% sugar by weight, and the sugar and corn syrup annihilate the honey flavor that I appreciate in other brands. I also found several small and one large chunk of peanutless coating in my container, forcing me to watch out lest I end up with a mouthful of sugar. While these might be a replacement for a candy bar, the low peanut content (only 3.2oz) makes them expensive, and the chunks of coating make them defective.A two-star product: I over-correct for the perfect reviews of the sugar-fiends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent record by the excellent Taste, Rory Galligar's first band. On the Boards runs the bands sound through all kinds of blues; straight twelve bar and more jazzy excusions. The space jazz on the title track is particularly interesting.At times this album tends to be scattered, but each track is excellent, and you have to admire the bands willingness and ability to twist the blues into all kinds of facinating permutations.A definate buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I love Steve Niles work, and became interested in his stories after reading 30 Days of Night. I found Dark Days to be an excellent read, picking up the comics as they were released. Niles tells a great story revolving a survivor from Barrow trying to convince the rest of the world that vampires do exist. While character development may not be great, for a comic its good enough. Besides, most of the character development was done in 30 Days of Night, and doesnt need to be rehashed here. Templesmiths artwork, as always, is great and lends itself well to Niles storytelling. If you enjoyed the first book, I highly recommend this sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 30 Days of Night Stories","review":"Of the four 30 Days of Night Trade Paperback and Graphic Novels, this is my favorite one. The first 30 Days of Night story felt a little bit light on the characterization, and Dark Days definitely did a better job of exploring the universe and ideas created from the first book. I generally find Steve Niles' writing to be serviceable at best, but this book was actually pretty good. As usual, Ben Templesmith's stylistic art is visually appealing, although at times it can be confusing. Nevertheless, Dark Days probably had the clearest narrative of all the 30 Days of Night books. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This item is marketed as a \\"book\\" on this site, and although technically it is a \\"book\\", it's actually what is called an \\"illustrated book\\", or a \\"graphic novel\\" - or in other words, it's actually just a longer comic book that has been bound as a regular paperback book.

(but still ugly)","review":"I have to say, I have hated these shoes for years. They are really ugly and obnoxious. But I finally ended up trying a pair, I work in a veterinary hospital and wanted shoes that are easy to clean off and that I don't have to worry about staining. I ended up getting the mary janes because they aren't as clown-like as the regular crocs, they are much slimmer. I have to say, I absolutely love them. My feet NEVER hurt at the end of the day. Sometimes I'll wear my regular, comfortable tennis shoes and my feet will be soar after a few hours. They are easily cleaned off and when you rinse them with water, they dry very quickly. The straps do stretch quite a bit so if they are a bit snug when you first get them, I would wait for them to stretch instead of going a size up. At first the little nub where the straps connect bothered me but they stretched quickly and aren't a problem anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wore them all summer long!","review":"I never thought I'd enjoy wearing a Mary Jane style shoe in the summer months but I wore these almost every day all season long.

I live in a climate with snow, and so I don't wear them much in the Winter. However, they have been AWESOME summer sandals. When I got pregnant in 2007 my feet swelled horribly, and these were just about the only shoes that still fit. They stretched with out pinching I lived in them that summer. Also, if you normally wear a \\"half\\" size, I would order a size down. The Navy color is a good neutral with my \\"mommy uniforms\\" of jeans and a tee shirt.Four years later in the Fall of 2010, they are quite worn down at the bottom.

The book has quite a bit of technical information on many of the aircraft used by this special organization (such as the Fw200) and discusses Hans Baur, a WWI ace who became a devoted Nazi and Hitler's personal pilot. The book is very well illustrated and has some great photographs but it doesn't discuss the actual organization of this specialized unit at any length. Nor the book have any maps showing bases that the squadron operated from, although it did include a layout of the Bunker (!) which Baur lived in for a while but was otherwise irrelevent.An excellent book within a very narrow spectrum of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good Thriller!\\"","review":"Kurt Russell, J.T.

It is really gripping your guts in more than one occasion !!! The actors are all doing great, many of them playing nasty villains ; just one thing seems absolutely unreal to me: the fact that Jeff lets his wife go away with a total stranger, in the middle of nowhere, without even noting the plate number of the truck or the name of the driver - at that time there were no mobile phones, so it was not easy to send signals out !!! - maybe that can be explained by the fact that the couple was under heavy stress due to the breakdown under a scorching sun, and that the truck driver initially appeared as a \\"very nice guy\\", and a \\"savior\\". Apart from that, the rest of the intrigue is great.This movie also features a whole gallery of pictures of the desert around San Diego."},{"rating":"2","title":"EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THRILLER- TENSE!!!","review":"I recently watched this movie and really appreciated it. My grandmother had to turn it off once because it was to tense for her. But, everything about this movie is just like no relaxing what so ever, lol. You are always on your toes, and this is what makes this movie a classic thriller. Great acting by Russell and Walsh. Walsh is such a vicious villian, one of the top villian roles I have ever seen.

They don't seem to be actors at all! J.T. Walsh is especially effective as the film's #1 villain. This should be in everyone's video library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably lame","review":"This movie was preposterous, an unbelievably unpleasant film. The idea that this roving gang has the wherewithal (and the organization) to terrorize people passing through makes no sense. Kurt Russell is fine and Kathleen Quinlan does what she can with a thankless role, but I found the movie got sillier with each passing moment. For instance: if they are trying desperately to remove all evidence of Jeff and Amy, WHY do they take Amy to the basement under their barn rather than tossing her body somewhere? Only to have Amy and Jeff live happily ever after, of course. And was the guy at the bank in on it? You'd think so - you'd think some stranger coming in every week or so to wire money to their bank would tip someone off. The ending just got on my nerves. This movie was a train wreck. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK WE ARE?","review":"If you were a man whose car broke down in the middle of nowhere, would you just allow your wife to get in some stranger's truck to get help while you stayed behind with the car? Doesn't it make you suspicious when someone else's cell phone (the bad guys) works in the middle of the desert but yours (the good guys) doesn't? So, so, so many unrealistic and stupid things happen in this pathetic and worthless film. Kurt Russell is horrible and the script makes him look like an incompetent idiot who can barely take care of himself and then loses his wife to a group of amateur con-men. Kathleen Quinlan as his wife is not much better. She can do a lot better than this. The only decent part is JT Walsh as the diabolical truck driver and mastermind of the plot to kill Russell and Quinlan. And after their characters' stupid behaviour in this film it is no wonder that they are good prey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakdown","review":"This movie was sent to me.

'Duel' similarities aside, the fear inspired by 'Breakdown' is all too human and realistic.J. T. Walsh could have stolen this movie from a lesser actor than Kurt Russell. His souless antagonist is cold, calculating and very creepy. In a word, EVIL! The other baddies make great villains as well, which is one of the main reasons this film is so effective. The other reason is Kurt Russell himself. He's very much a victim as the conflict comes upon him, but the character finds a courage, resolve and a maniacal intensity that lets him do what he must. The viewer can't help but rejoice in that crazed triumph with him.I sacrificed my nails for this movie, and was rewarded with a thrilling, terrifying and immensely satisfying film. Kurt Russell's performance in 'Breakdown' is one reason to see anything he ever does onscreen again. See this! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can you trust in the middle of nowhere?","review":"Kurt Russell is excellent in this high octane thriller as Jeff Taylor, a man whose wife mysteriously vanishes. Even more suspicious is the unwillingness of the locals to aid in anyway. The scene at the bank was the part that really had me on the edge of my seat. After seeing this movie, it's a scary thought to be stranded on a desolate highway, having to rely on the \\"generosity\\" of a \\"kind\\" stranger. Kurt Russell has been great in practically every film he has starred in, and this one is no disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Some of the good things about this movie, among others, are 1) it's very believable, 2) it doesn't have all those overly done, mind-blowing, hi-tech action sequences, 3) the acting are as good as it gets, 4) it keeps you on your seat without slowing down the pace.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECORD FOR ANY ROCKER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi","review":"I give Bon Jovi real good credit they lasted, not many people stay around more than 5 years. New Jersey is a great album, \\"Bad Medicine\\" is my favorite. It topped the charts for 6 weeks and sold 7 million. If I were to suggest a band that would last another 20 years I would say Bon Jovi."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bon Jovi's finest","review":"Simply put, this cd is excellent. The first three tracks, \\"Lay your hands on me,\\" \\"Bad Medicine,\\" and \\"Born to be my Baby\\" are all incredible and show Bon Jovi at its best. Other great tracks include \\"Wild is the Wind\\" and \\"Blood on Blood\\". Of course, there really isn't a bad track on here. I'm not too big on \\"Living in Sin\\", because Jon does sound kinda like Springsteen, and Springsteen's music pretty much went to hell in a handbasket starting in the 90's(In my humble opinion). All in all, though, this is a killer cd. No Bon Jovi fan should even consider passing it up, and if you're new to Bon Jovi, this would be as good a start as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi's \\"David Copperfield.\\"","review":"For those of you who don't know this, Charles Dickens' \\"David Copperfield\\" (1851), does not have the popularity of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" or \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Nevertheless, Dickens said that \\"David Copperfield\\" was his 'favorite child' (best creation). I would not be surprised in the least if Bon Jovi said that this was his 'favorite child.' The music differs in type (some country, some medium rock, some heavy rock) and intensity throughout the record, but the flow never seems to be upset. This is one of those rare records where it sounds like the artist was writing and playing what he felt were his best efforts without worrying about how it would be received. (Personally, I feel '7800' is his absolute best.) But I really do like this record that seems to constitue Bon Jovi's purest efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to New Jersey!","review":"This is one of Bon Jovi's better albums with songs like Living In Sin, Lay Your Hands On Me, and Bad Medicine. It was it's post success from Slippery When Wet. I have a soft spot for Jon Bon JOvi and the band because I'm from his hometown. The album is a great tribute to New Jersey but the album cover should have a picture or a map of the state itself. It was one of the first times that I was ever proud to be from New Jersey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Royalty","review":"i have been a fan of Bon Jovi since 1986 and had New Jersey on Vinyl so while i knew most of the tracks there were a few bonus tracks on the CD that were exceptional!!!

Two years later,this album brought big hits such as BAD MEDICINE,LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME,I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU,LIVING IN SIN and BORN TO BE MY BABY(the latter two were not recycled for the CROSSROAD compilation). RIDE COWBOY RIDE was recorded in mono. That's because the song was originally recorded on a monaural cassette recorder. All the other songs are good. NEW JERSEY is where all 5 Bon Jovi members hail from. In fact,I'm a NEW JERSEY native myself. Two years after this album was released,frontman Jon Bon Jovi(Bongiovi) recorded and released BLAZE OF GLORY for the movie \\"Young Guns II\\". That song would appear on the CROSSROAD compilation released in 1994. The group would release their next album KEEP THE FAITH in 1992,which was not a big hit like NEW JERSEY and SLIPPERY WHEN WET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but could be better!","review":"We bought this for travel to Guatemala when picking up our 14 month old adopted son. We were leaving without a baby and coming home with one! I wanted to check the umbrella stroller on the way down and this seemed like it would do a good job of keeping it from getting too beat up and it did. Even with the extended handles we added on to our stroller, it fit with plenty of room in the bag. One small issue I had was that in the picture it seems like it has hard or formed sides and it is actually soft like a duffel bag. It is extremely durable and I am sure it would last many trips. One other issue is I am not sure if you would need it if you were traveling with your child. You can easily gate check your stroller and have it waiting for you when you get off the plane, so with the exception of my unique circumstance, I'm not sure I would use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for so don't expect much","review":"I got this for my son's stroller for our trip to Asia.

She clearly is very talented, but that talent does not extend to Beatle songs.Her version of the 1964 classic, \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\\" was horrendous. That is an excellent song and Murray's gross mistreatment of this Beatle classic was upsetting."},{"rating":"2","title":"gems! somebody's waiting for next release!","review":"excellent to have two of her best together in one package. don't miss \\"moon over brooklyn\\", \\"easy love\\", \\"you set my dreams\\", \\"good old song\\", \\"you've got me\\", \\"why don't you stick around\\", \\"french waltz\\", \\"lucky me\\" & \\"somebody's waiting\\".

I could not understand why they considered this country so repressive. After reading 'Lost Rights', I understand. My European friends could see our government for what it was and now Mr. Bovard has exposed the truth for the rest of us. Upon concluding Mr. Bovard's fast paced work, one must ask, \\"has the great sacrifce of life by the men and women who died to create and later to protect our Constitution been in vain?\\" Unfortunately, if the trends outlined in this well researched and extensively annotated volume are not soon reversed the answer will most certainly be a sad 'yes'. It should be hard for anyone to read this book without mourning our Nation and wondering how much more abuse of the Constitution we will allow before taking steps to reclaim our \\"lost rights\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Very Favorites","review":"James Bovard is an excellent writer.

The bulk of the book is spent, appropriately, on the Peninsula campaign, although there is adequate discussion of Wellington's experiences in India and a fairly lengthy description of Waterloo. The book is well written and the author goes to some lengths to dispel her subject's reputation for coldness. However, although the author does not claim that Wellington is perfect, it appears that he never made a mistake if Ms. Longford is to be believed. Notwithstanding this minor reservation, this book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible abridged edition","review":"This is an absurdly abridged edition of Elizabeth Lonford's magnificent biography of the Iron Duke.

This new CD is deceptive in her first release Sunrise you can her the bluegrass influences in the still somewhat jazzy recording. After purchasing the album you discover that with the exception of a few tracts ,\\"Don't Miss You At All\\" and \\"Those Sweet Words\\", it is a bluegrass album what I found enjoyable but not at all what I wanted when I purchased the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a one-trick pony","review":"Norah Jones absolutely surprised me with this album. I don't own, but have heard her first album and thought it was decent. It was a good jazz record. This one blew me away. Here we have a contemporary young artist doing good music! It's more country flavoured than her first and with the wailings of Dolly Parton it is an awesome listen! It's a quiet sunny Sunday afternoon listen. The highlights are \\"Sunrise\\", \\"Creep On In\\" and Tom Waits' \\"Long Way Home\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Change Of Pace.","review":"Norah has really changed pace with this album, moving from her trademark Jazz-Pop mix that had critics and the public hooked.As usual her voice is so unmistakeable and unique.But what really grabs you is the quality of music.Her vocals will hold out forever but her skill in songwriting and piano playing is amazing and well commended.You really have to like this album because of its sheer beauty.She draws in a few big names: Dolly Parton and Jesse Harris but thats not the thing its that she blends with them well and dosen't overpower or is outclassed. From start to finish it is perfection, it seems she can do no wrong with her albums.Her singles are not commercially successfull but they could be.If she went more poppier that would wreck the beauty but would sell.I think America hasn't re-accepted the ballad commercially as a single yet.Its still hip-hop, but Norah Jones is a getaway from mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and Real","review":"This CD reminds me of sitting on the front porch of a home \\"down south\\", sipping ice cold lemonade and just \\"being home\\". I love the music she wrote, and there is one song she sings by Tom Waits that really makes my heart ache down deep.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Feels Like Home\\" doesn't make me feel at home.","review":"\\"Feels Like Home\\" doesn't make me feel at home. \\"Come Away With Me\\" is a much better CD. Why? The lyrics are more touching, the rhythym calms you and relaxes you on \\"Come Away With Me\\".Norah didn't even spend the time to write most of the songs and I'm kinda disapointed. None the less, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is still better than most mainstream artists' CD's (Britney Spears' \\"In the Zone\\" anyone?) \\"Feels at Home\\" is still soothing though.For me, grunge, punk rock band Nirvana have something in common with Norah Jones believe it or not. When lead singer Kurt Cobain screams, it gets you through rough times. I find the same thing with Norah Jones, except she doesn't scream.If I were a beginner Norah Jones fan, I would get \\"Come Away With me\\" out of the two albums. Still, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is a decent follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I loved Norah Jones's first CD \\"Come Away With Me,\\" and I have been waiting ever since for her second album. \\"Feels Like Home\\" to my delight, is a great follow up of \\"Come Away With Me.\\" I am not sure if it is possible to top an album such as her first, but I think \\"Feels Like Home\\" is definitely worth listening. My favorite songs of this album are \\"Creepin' In\\" and \\"Toes.\\" Both songs are fun to listen to and the lyrics are meaningful. Her sultry voice is pleasing to the ears and extremely relaxing. I do agree with some reviewers who felt that this album is less \\"jazzy\\" and more country or soulful. However, I don't consider it as bad as I think Norah Jones has her unique style which is what makes her songs/albums so special. I do however have a small criticism of this album - I feel that most of the songs are very similar sounding. Regardless of that, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is still a great CD - definitely relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from Come Away with Me, but...","review":".... it grew on me. When I took my first listen at this most coveted CD, I was strangely disappointed. The style was a wee bit different from her debut.

This new collection of songs, both original and remakes, is the kind that shows you the diversity of a true musician!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, musical sound; great songs","review":"I was in a mood to find some new artists, and indirectly heard of Norah Jones. Amongst the other albums I ordered, I was very surprised and pleased to find this one. Norah's voice is very cool -- the songs are a little jazzy, a little bluesy and a little rock. They are all pleasing and complex without being too much, too loud, etc. I find myself listenging and discovering new aspects of the music each time and this has become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album by Norah","review":"I think that the reason that many people have mixed feelings about Norah Jones's albums are that she is so different and her voice is almost like an acquired taste. While FEELS LIKE HOME isn't as goos as say 2002's masterpiece, COME AWAY WITH ME, it is a very strong album. My top song picks are \\"SUNRISE\\", \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", \\"THOSE SWEET WORDS\\", \\"BE HERE TO LOVE ME\\", among other good hits with a mix of jazz, folk, and country. It isn't the most exciting album as say a pop, rock, or R&B album would be, but it certainly has an eclectic sense to it and it is a strong album. I highly recommend FEELS LIKE HOME to anybody. Good job again NORAH!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always delightful.","review":"This re-release is very good, some people may say that it is not worth enoght to buy but I think that every re-release is for the fans or people who really likes the original version.The difference between this Deluxe edition with the original are 3 bonus tracks and a bonus DVD with the videos of \\"SUNRISE\\" and \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", live versions of \\"IN THE MORNING\\", \\"THE LONG WAY HOME\\", \\"CREEPING IN\\" and \\"SHE\\" which doesn't appear on this cd or in her first one. This live videos were taken on her show in Barcelona. Finally you get a 20 minute interview of Norah.\\"FEELS LIKE HOME\\" is a great album as Norah's first, \\"COME AWAY WITH ME\\". Her music is very relaxed and her lyrics are very good also. This album contains a duet with Dolly Parton. The song leaves a bit behind Norah's jazz/pop music to a country style. Very good actually. Check the tracks \\"THOSE SWEET WORDS\\", \\"SUNRISE\\", \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", \\"TOES\\" and \\"BE HERE TO LOVE ME\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why settle for less?","review":"I don't even own this CD.

This \\"music\\" is so boring it would put coffee to sleep. It's just that regular morons dislike to be challenged when listening to music and prefer to never get any smarter. This crap is just plain watered down. Why listen to Norah Jones's version of Duke Ellington's Melancholia (intelligently renamed \\"Don't Miss You at All\\") when you can listen to the original, which is 10 times better and 10 times more musically advanced.

I was sadly disappointed. The first had no weak or throw away songs, the second seemed to be the left overs not good enough for that debut. I strained to find something that was likeable and easy on my ears. Memorable songs that made me feel good. This album seemed to be either rushed to cash in or simply uninspired.I continue to listen to the first and have filed away the second as a bad investment. Her mamagement could learn a few things from that of Tierney Allen, the silken voiced jazz and standard singer who has yet to come into her own with a major following.Ms. Allen's music always is up lifting and easy to listen to on \\"repeat\\" on my CD player.

I find the back up group rather lame! Her new CD back up music is so vastly inferior to her performance with The Peter Malick Group. In that CD Norah's voice combined with the groups superior performance produced a very special sound. If you are into POP like Celine Dion, Dianna Krall etc., I guess Norah's CD ok.

It sounded to me more like a CD of the out takes that were not good enough for the first album. The sound is very similar to her first album, but the tracks here lack any life. This leads to a bland bland noise/sound.So do yourself a favour and save your money to spend on another album you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Pretty mediocre compared to the first album. Basically more of the same, but less clean and the lyrics are awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Marketing Job","review":"Good marketing, Good product positioning, Good product launch, ... BAD CD. It doesn't even deserve to be on the top 100, not to mentioned being the best selling album!!!I bought both her CD's just to find out what people were talking about, and after listening to it three times, I have retired it to my coaster section. She has a good voice, but every song on both CD's sounded too much alike, making it a touture to listen to both CD at the same time. Before you go out and buy this, borrow it from a friend who has it, and if you can listen to it more than twice and like it, than buy it, otherwise, save your money, or buy any of Diana Krall's CD instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm convinced","review":"I don't understand the people who are bored with her new album (or first for that matter). It is a refreshing change from the one size fits all \\"rap-crap\\" or \\"diva-dung\\" that most folks are listening to now days. You who find it unappealing can keep your Snoop Dog or Bratenie Spears . . . give me something where the words mean something and you can understand them. Give me a Norah Jones ballad anytime. Why do you think she won the Grammys last year? Like Come Away With Me, this one will just get better and better each time you listen to it.

For those of you who can't get enough of Norah Jones, listen to her track on the Dolly Parton compilation (Just Because I'm a Woman). Norah sings \\"The Grass is Blue\\" and it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down follow up cd.","review":"I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as \\"Just A Jazz Singer\\" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 \\"The Prettiest Things.\\" I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis \\"Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that any way 'Come Away With Me' too good?","review":"The better the first the harder it is to get a better second isn't it? This album will not get any Grammy but it's not a crap too. It's just not as good as the first and the first is so great.May be because I love anything jazzy, my threshold of greatness for them is a little low so this album is still among the best!Keep striving for more Norah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Music","review":"It's hard to tell where to begin. Norah has a beautiful voice and can sing country music. The music I heard was not country it was just bad. The song's lyrics were beyond bad. The arrangements were more than jazz inspired(they were jazz). If you are going to sing country, sing country songs with country arrangements. It's all rather simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"disappointing I must say - I was one who imagined all of her success came from one track on the last album anyway tho - I have much respect for Norah Jones - just not sure I would buy another CD....after I listened to the full stream here at amazon I decided NOT to buy this one. only came back to see what other reviewers had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"Come away with me was a rare find and is one of my favorite CD's. It is very seldom you find a CD where you actually love all of the songs and don't do a lot of track searching.After much anticipation and excitement,Feels Like Home finally arrived and it definitely needs a vacation. This CD lost soul along the way; actually about half way through the first track. I searched and searched for a song I actually liked on this CD and disappointingly didn't find one. I also was very disappointed when I was surprised with Dolly Parton's contribution. If I wanted to hear Dolly Parton I would buy one of her CD's and yes there is a huge difference between blues and country. This CD probably will be a hit with the country music fans. Norah go back to what you do best !!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"i think it is ironic that there are so so many great women artists out there yet for inexplicable reasons sometimes one gets alot of attention. and it has little to do with talent. this artist is one big yawn, and will be gone soon while the industry will continue to look for the next best/newest \\"thing.\\" if you look hard you can find alot of great women artists new and veteran who have real inspirational talent. i like etta james for a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD SUCKS","review":"This CD sucks hugely.

I hope she gets to be front-and-center again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Norah","review":"I should have it rated 4.5 because it's just a tad lower compared to the first album. I think the recording was better sounding. Despite I was already a biased Norah fan, I admit that it was ho-hum at first but the longer you listen to it, the songs just become so endearing, tugging at the heartstrings. This is very Norah, I didn't get hooked on the first album until I gave it several tries. \\"Humble Me\\" is very touching. I encourage those who rate this album poorly to give it more tries, for your own sake! It's to your lost. To the one who criticized the material used in the liner, it's called \\"style\\". That was the style that the album designer chose to use to be unique. Glossy paper is not used necessarily to every liner. Overall, this album is a winner. The singer and the instrumentals, in their own style, is very classy and definitely not cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A departure, solid but unremarkable","review":"Every song on this album is well-crafted, well-performed, well-chosen, and enjoyable. Yet somehow the album doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. It lacks anything that stands out, or anything that connects its parts together. It's certainly no \\"Come Away With Me,\\" but if you liked that, you will find this worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah Jones is home","review":"Norah Jones on this album does what music is supposed to do, cut out the world and just listen to her voice, her words and her music. \\"Feels Like Home\\" gives me the feeling of being at home in comfort and not wanting to leave. I will listen to this album over and over and keep it forever high on my list of most favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah perks up a bit...","review":"This sophomore effort by Jones shows much growth and an overall sense of energetic propulsion not seen in her first CD COME AWAY WITH ME. While her previous effort was a bit weighed-down by a languid, lazy approach, here Jones clings much more to a country/western style which actually infuses her voice with a new found energy. The duet \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton is a highlight, as is the opening track \\"Sunrise\\", penned by Jones herself.It's nice to see Jones injecting some much needed adrenaline into her overwise laid back style. As far as sophomore albums go, this one totally avoids the \\"slump\\" other artists have encountered.It makes me look forward to her 3rd CD..in the hopes she will only add to her energy and enthusiasm for new styles and ranges.The voice continues to mesmerize, not with power or flashy vocal stylings, but with a sort of lazy afternoon infusion. But while her first album made you sleepy, this one keeps you plugged in and wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow-up . . .","review":"Norah Jones' latest is quite a departure from her debut album. The expressive piano is still here as is the soft and smokey voice, but many of the tunes are more playful and complex. It's an interesting change of direction - and portends well for her continued growth.Why 4 stars? She's young and still developing her artistic voice. I'll reserve the 5th star (and judgement) for her next effort.By the way, to the reviewer who slammed Ms Jones and recommended Kylie Minouge . . . Well, I guess if 15 year old techno-pop melodies, simple lyrics (Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow. . .) and a voice reminiscent of a mature Brittany Spears is your thing, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great CD","review":"Of course the 1st CD was incredible. This one is really good too, but I am still a little partial to the first. If you are not a bluegrass or country fan, this CD is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too country for my tastes...","review":"I loved Come Away with Me because of the jazz feel and Jones' voice. I still like the voice, but this album is waaaay more country..."},{"rating":"1","title":"recording does not do Norah justice","review":"I love Norah, but the quality of this recording is a crime against her music. Do yourself a favor and get Not Too Late with her own songs and a decent recording from Blue Note, and wait for the remaster release of this recording. Yuck. Jeez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unlistenable","review":"I know she's the media- and popular culture darling, but this album is so boring and lifeless that it's almost unlistenable. Jones' vocals are listless and delivered as if she were busy thinking about something else while chewing on a piece of hard candy. Her pronunciation is so affected that it's disconcerting. The songs themselves are musically strong, but the lyrics sound as if they were written in 1976 by a high-schooler (i.e., obvious and unsophisticated). The only highlight of the album for me was Dolly Parton's appearance on one track - it was the only time I felt any emotion behind the singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"music without impact","review":"boring beyond belief. beautiful voice? yes. recorded well? yes. is it moving in any way? absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down beer?","review":"Reminds me of watered down beer at a night bar - as opposed to the night bar itself.

It will be difficult for her to recover from this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep inducing","review":"Much of what made Norah Jones's first CD interesting is missing from this follow-up CD. Perhaps too many of the songs were written by or with Lee Alexander; (Jesse Harris, who won a Grammy for his \\"Don't Know Why\\" on Jones's _Come Away With Me_ CD, doesn't appear)there's less of a jazz-aware sensibility and more of a country - not exactly sure sensibility in this one. Her next effort needs more musical exploration, more tension, and more feeling, or listeners are going to start believing that they've got all the Norah Jones they need."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge dissapointment!","review":"I have her debut album and it was a great album to listen too and I enjoyed it for a while!But I just got this yesterday and I am very disapointed the songs are all plain and have a very boring sound to it!If your gonna get an album from her you might aswell get her debut one its more worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels Like Forever!","review":"YAAAWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNN!!!!......Oh is the CD over yet??I can't believe how boring this one is.

It can really make you feel peaceful. It took me a while to get used to it but now that I have, I think this'll be one of my favorite CD's of 2004. There is a broader range of songs where we really get to see Norah at her best. \\"Come Away With Me\\" was awesome and I love that CD,. This one is definitely a more mature sounding Norah and like she says, it's a snapshot of her life and that's what I love about her music. There is no fakeness, even when there is no beat, her voice is just lovely to listen to. My favorite songs are \\"Sunrise\\", \\"What Am I to You\\", \\"Humble Me\\", \\"The Prettiest Thing\\"....oh heck I like them all. I strongly reccommend this CD for any Norah fan and of course, people who haven't yet converted to her music. It's such a great album. Just give it a chance. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold HDCD is a FRADULENT CD! as per EMI Record Company","review":"I found one on a google search from a small company in Portugal. The sound is bad and at times scratchy as though they re recorded using a regular cd as a master. Anyway, the fellow at EMI Records in NY who handles Norah Jones emailed me back to let me know that they never made a HDCD for Norah Jones and that this one is Pirated and that they are now investigating the matter. Gold CD with extra tracks and 24 bits... too good to be true! Jody Koval"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than the first, but just as good","review":"This CD was an unexpected, pleasant surprise. I was expecting \\"Come Away With Me Part Two\\" but instead, Norah Jones delivers a very fresh and new approach that heralds another winner. Norah brings in some country and folk influences and adds them to her smooth, breathy jazz, and the result is something a little more kicky and fun. Still, there are plenty of ballads to enjoy and it all still goes down smooth. Norah remains true to her vision, and this CD won't alienate any of her fan base. I really enjoy \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton. Norah and Dolly ought to do an entire CD (and tour) with each other. Their voices sound so sweet together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"This CSW was nothing special. I enjoyed her first CD, but this one is a little more \\"blah\\". I was hoping she would use her sultry voice and continue with the bluesy type songs. This album leans more toward country, and is really not her style. I wouldn't recommend this album. Keep listening to \\"Come Away With Me\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Her first CD was calming, sweet, jazzy, and nostalgic. I listed to \\"Come Away with Me\\" too much, but I still like it. So, I was excited to get her new CD. It's terrible; there's not a song I like on there. I still listen to her first CD; her second CD is lost somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Had Ms. Jones not recorded. \\"Come Away With Me\\" this album would rate four stars. Unlike her previous recording, this latest effort lacks the poetry, lounge-jazz, hypnotic, startingly beautiful lyrics, soft country,and slow tempo that made \\"Come Away With Me\\" the all-time winner for recordings you DONT play in your car.I listened to this recording once and it was very annoying. The lyrics were annoying; the tempo was too upbeat; there was not a sense of the emotive or evocative; every song sounded just like the other. If you must listen, this is the CD for the CAR; her previous one is for rainy nights in the woods, resting languidly on your sofa, Ms. Jones'lyrics quietly guiding you down the tributaries of sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone has GREAT taste!","review":"It's so wonderful to see someone with a great new spin on Townes Van Zandt's \\"Be Here to Love Me\\".

Norah's voice is just lovely and the music is melodious and beautiful. I really enjoy listening to this album, it soothes me after a long day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the positive reviews are lukewarm","review":"Two stars because it isn't a bad album. It just isn't very good, either. The gushing male DJs on our local \\"jazz\\" station can't get enough of her, which means that the CD is heavily overplayed, and this is not a work that takes to being played very much...before it's played out, simply because there is so little depth to it. She makes the most of her meagre voice and uninspiring piano playing, but she isn't going anywhere with it on this particular effort.Good for people who want some unobtrusive music whittering away in the background, or by \\"pack listeners\\" who buy what the media tells them to, but no originality here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step back for her","review":"This is pretty ordinary girl singer stuff.

In Norah Jones's case, however, does the backlash really matter? Sure, some people may complain about her and say that she isn't \\"real music\\", but really, does any of that matter? Norah is a class act and people can say all the negative things about her they want, but just take a look at this album's ranking on the Amazon sales charts and you will see that this backlash against her means absolutely nothing. This album has already sold millions of copies and you can bet it will continue to do well, especially at Grammy time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Music, Poor Recording","review":"This disc could be fine entertainment if one could listen through the awful distortion to appreciate the performance. Appears Ms. Jones and her success has gone the way of all good things to create a market for Norah Jones, not her (abundant) talent...a shame and a poor reflection on Blue Note, I'm sorry to say.

I had hardly been through half of it before I fell asleep and slept like I've never slept before. Her lyrics are very boring. Her voice is the worst (it is melodious but it doesn't catch your attention. I'd rather listen to Britney) Why on earth did this female get 8 grammies? In my opinion she deserves half a grammy. Just the base of it probably.I borrowed my friend's 'Feels like home' just to see whether she's improved. I saw no difference at all and I hope she doesn't get a grammy this time.What's more, when I borrowed my friend's copy, she took my copy of 'In the zone' by Britney Spears.

She had one hit, got the Grammy, and evaporated in a vast sea or mediocre singer/songwriters. There's just nothing there to justify her 15 minutes of fame. No range, no power, no emotion. Just one cheesy, mildly catchy single.

I am extremely disappointed in this offering. The sound quality is awful, awful, awful. It stinks. Next time, rent a studio...Too country. Enough said.No snap. No zest. She's like 23? This album sounds like she's already bored with the whole singing career thing....In summary.

My conclusion is that it's her voice alone that makes her such a great artist. That may sound like a weird statement, but that's exactly what I mean. Many artists are compelling because of the songs they sing, their performance strength or style, their looks, etc..... In Norah's case it's just that VOICE, and I guess I can't get enough of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Good to me","review":"\\"Feels Like Home\\" is really a pretty cool album. Every song is good. Norah Jones has put out a very nice CD that is easy to listen to and enjoy. There is really nothing heavy here. But that's the point. Just lighten up and let it move through you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah's just so easy :-)","review":"OK, so this CD is not a challenge, but it's a breezy summer accompaniment that's worth the bucks.If you didn't like Norah's debut, you won't like this one. But if you did, it's like a second conversation with someone you enjoyed the first time. Fewer revelations, but more familiarity, and a great deal of ease.And to be tiresome, her success last time apparently won her permission to write more of this one, and somehow insta-fame didn't ruin her, or apparently turn her into a Mariah-monster.

Thank you Norah."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Certainly Does","review":"We Norah Jones fans can all breathe a sigh of relief -- Jones is back and \\"Feels Like Homes\\" certainly does. Although not as completely successful as \\"Come Away With Me\\" -- there are two or three tracks I'm not crazy about -- there are some absolutely gorgeous songs that rival, if not surpass, those on that album. And, once again, Jones' voice is a marvel, smokey and smooth at the same time. The arrangements are fantastic, and who'd have thunk that Dolly Parton, of all people, could blend so marvelously with Ms. Jones. All in all, I'm so happy with \\"Feels Like Home,\\" happy for us fans, and happy that Ms. Jones didn't hit a sophmore slump. Brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Having a great sophomore year! :)","review":"Like everyone else, I loved Norah Jones' first CD and I was excited to see that she had released a second. I bought it immediately. I love all her songs. Her lyrics are very uncomplicated and honest. Other singers who are trying to switch over to songwriter status try way too hard with their lyrics that they just sound ridiculous. I know saying she's easy listening isnt' exactly a compliment at times, but this is the perfect CD to put in when you're just lounging around on a Saturday afternoon. When my husband was at work one Saturday, I had the house to myself and I popped that CD in. Norah Jones and me laying on the couch with a pint of ice cream made for a perfect Saturday. :)Favorite songs include: Sunrise, What Am I to You?, and Humble Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act","review":"Norah has done what seemed impossible. She brought music that some would describe as serene into the mainstream. Her style is traditional and her voice is solid. Kudos to her manager and producer for having the courage to push such a powerful (yet deceptively low key) talent into the upper ranks of modern musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Effort for the Second Release.","review":"Not quite in the same league as her debut album,but nonetheless it is a stellar performance from Norah.Do not know what all the hoopla is over the Bandlink as I never use a PC to play CDs. Have a mega buck CD Player and have found the sonics of this album very good indeed. If you play CDs on lackluster gear then you deserve what you hear. Tired of hearing all the carping on playing CDs on other than quality CD Players. If you really enjoy music then get the gear that will really show off that capability.Would have preferred more of Norah playing the piano, but thats just me. This is a serious release and will help to forever establish Norah as a musical force. I believe it will gather at least one Grammy perhaps more. One thing about this CD the more you listen to it, the more you will like it. For me it is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Norah Jones Fan","review":"Norah Jones sings wonderfully in her new CD however, the songs all seem musically sparse compared to her last CD. There are some good songs on this CD but overall I think it lacks the soul and intensity found in \\"Come Away With Me.\\" If you like Norah Jones I would recomend buying this CD but don't expect any revalations. If you are new to Norah Jones I would suggest starting with \\"Come Away With Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"I just want to say that from her first recording (Come Away With Me )I have been entranced by her voice. I am able to touch my own emotions when I listen to her music. I am very suprised by the negative reviews she has been given. I absolutely love her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good.","review":"Norah does nice work again. What a pleasure it is to hear voices like hers. My appreciation for this style of music has grown.

The music is unbelievably boring. The only decent song is the duet with Dolly Parton. The rest of the music lacks any real substance.

I want more jazz.She should have stuck with what made her famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"BATTLE OF THE JAZZ DIVAS","review":"Norah vs. Dena. They both sing, play piano, compose, arrange so what is the difference? Norah is BORING. and Dena is EXCITING. I stacked my CD player on one side with Norah's's latest Cd's and the other side with DENA'S AND HAD MY OWN JAZZ IDOL COMPETITION. AND THE WINNER IS DENA DEROSE HANDS DOWN. Compare song samples here, and you decide if I was right. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU WON'T BE BORED WITH DENA. I have played Dena's albums 3 hrs. straight and was never bored. Can you say that about Norah's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sedation!","review":"Norah Jones latest release \\"Feels Like Home\\", proves to be a very sedate and uneventful cd. Just like her debut, Jones comes off sounding like a piano lounge singer at best. There is no risk taking in her music at all, as she maintains a constant recipe of boring muzak, that will not tax her vocal chords anytime soon. Roberta Flack was a similar soft piano chrooner, who was very successful, because she had superior voice and material. This latest release is riding high, thanks to the popularity gained by her first release, but there is nothing earth-shattering or groundbreaking here to warrant 5 star reviews. If you want groundbreaking, from a female piano vocalist, I suggest you revisit Carole Kings Tapestry! That is what I call a monumental album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't feel like home to me","review":"I don't know, but Norah Jone's just doesn't do it for me on this album. Every single track is very slow and very relaxing. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE slow and relaxing music. That's more my style, so of course, I LOVE Norah Jones and her soft voice. But for some reason, the songs weren't up to par on this album. Her voice is just as great as Come Away With Me, but the songs are so slow and boring! I couldn't even listen to the entire cd. The only good songs are Sunshine and Creepin' In with Dolly Pardon. I suggest that if you want soft, easy listening - buy Mindy Smith, she does it much better than Norah this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nora Jones Southern Strategy CD","review":"I loved Nora's last CD with it's warm, piano jazz flavor. This CD has a few similar songs, but mainly sounds like Nora's record company selected her songs by focus group: \\"Let's see, in the last CD, the South didn't buy enough Nora Jones CD's, so let's add some steel guitar, and an Opry star to some songs. That should even out our sales.\\" Let's face it, Dolly Parton goes as well with Nora Jones as Alice Cooper goes with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Maybe Ms. Jones will take a more active role in her song selection next time. I'd like to see her research some of the jazz classics and New Orlean's standards and I hope she finds her voice and her style without relying on a NASCAR pastiche to please everbody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, not again....","review":"I think maybe Ms. Jones needs some help -- with her voice -- maybe voice lessons? With her musical style -- has she heard about vocal range at all? With her choice of recordings -- her first cd was mediocre -- this one is just awful....I noticed there were an awful lot of \\"1\\" stars -- I've never seen so many being \\"awarded\\" a Grammy winning vocal artist -- what are we missing? There are so many beautiful voices and talented singers out there --- I wonder if Norah's popularity will continue...."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd has spywear that will mess up your computer","review":"The music is not bad, not too different from her previous album. The CD contains stuff to mess up your computer if you listen to it there. It is like a telemarketer that calls when you are having candlelight dinner with your date. I would not recommend buying it because of this problem. Norah should fire her managers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TO COUNTRY!!!!!!!!","review":"Not at all like the 1st CD! The whole CD has a country sound. Too much of her back up singer in this one. Might as well be listening to Dolly Pardon! If you want to listen to country buy it. If you're looking for another CD with the sound and style of Come Away with Me, then keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"How could Norah, of all people, let us down like that? Me and my wife were enourmous fans of this blossoming young artist's debut album, and anxiously awaited the next one. But this is crap! It is pure country! That's okay, I guess, but this is taking it too far. We were hoping for another Come Away With Me.It makes me sick to think that artists like Norah don't give a hoot about their fans. They just do what they wanna do. Me and my wife feel like Metallica fans must have felt when the band turned alternative. Please, at all costs, stay away from this one. It is not worth anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is wrong with the world?","review":"im not going to write a lot because, looking through the reviews, i see that many are negative. i just want to point out that this is not music. talking sexily and playing piano one key at a time does not make a song, an album, or a musical masterpiece. norah is probably the sexiest TALKER that i have ever heard but that does not mean she should get a record contract and brainwash people into thinking her \\"music\\" is calm and refreshing. its not music. even worse, its not music and its boring. i am astounded. i thought making albums was saved for the musically talented. i guess i was wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"wholesome","review":"I just don't understand how some prople reviewing this CD can say that this is not good music. For me this is music at its best, it's unpretentious (unlike some other artists at the moment), decent and wholesome. Its sounds efortless, just as if Norah Jones had sat down at the piano or with a guitar and stared played some of her favorite songs. It's soufull and at times thoughtful while remaining simple.I am also pleased that she has been able to include some country undertones in the songs, that is obviously what has had am impression on Norah during her life; the duet with Dolly Parton is fantastic! A definate 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated female vocalist of all time","review":"I simply don't get how on earth this singer gained so much popularity. With her 'average at best' voice, painfully dull and mediocre arrangements, lyrics that say a whole lot of nothing (most of which she doesn't even write)...what is there to like? And what clown ever classified her as a jazz singer? She's really closer to worn out dive bar singer at remote casino on an Indian reservation somewhere. This is a classic case of alot unwarranted hype heaped on a low talent artist in order to sell albums...what a sham!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit while you were ahead","review":"Glad I didn't shell out money fot this one.

Her first was so good, so please quit while..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah Bores","review":"This album is a musical exercise in dullness, no zest here, no vivacity what so ever. I don't understand all the buzz about this girl. She's good, but not in this setting. Disapointing, because here first album is much better.Warning: Do not listen to this album while driving a vehicle, may induce drowsiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love Norah","review":"Many seem disapointed with this new cd, but I love it. It does lack some of the raw passion from the first, but if you like Norah and her style, I reccomend that you buy this one as well. One song does have a country flair, but it's fun and doesn't bother me. 'Sunrise' (1st track) is hauntly good. It is a beautiful fresh song that sticks with you all day! Great artist, great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I'm glad I didn't take too seriously the many reader reviews that were disappointed in this follow up cd. I think it is far superior to the first cd, more complex and nuanced and far less sleep inducing. Highly enjoyable. Norah has the smoothest voice around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah - what were you thinking?? Spyware!","review":"In a nutshell, a great album. Thank goodness she was allowed to experiment!Am most annoyed and highly disappointed in the \\"Bandlink/Spyware\\" addition to the CD. Just when you think you've found an independent, one-step-ahead Hollywood singer, you get smacked in the face. I play all my CDs on my PC and it is really annoying having the Bandlink download interface popup every time I want to play the CD. Is there anyway to turn the darn thing off??Otherwise, I highly recommend the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grew on me","review":"This cd took more than a few listens to grow on me. Now I think it's a very good cd. Songs like \\"sunrise or Humble me\\" are perfect night time songs. Feels like home has more of a country feel to it and is very consistent in quality. It's cool to finally have a young muscian who has talent. It's very rare these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first one","review":"The first album had more great songs, but this one has more good songs. If you liked the first one, odds are you'll like this one just as much.Funny to see negative reviews from people who say 'go listen to Spears or Minogue instead'. Well, duh. If you like music for 13 year old girls, you're not going to appreciate Norah Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tolerable misstep","review":"Norah apparently likes country/bluegrass music, all fine and good. The problem is that she hasn't learned how to or simply can't let her voice shine in that genre of music. Her voice has this rare intimate quality that works best in jazz or blues, or music with those types of hooks like \\"Those sweet words\\" and \\"What am I to You\\". But listen to \\"Creepin In\\", she gets blown out of the water by Dolly Parton (who I don't even like) so much so you don't even want to hear Norah sing again. So it goes with most of the CD until the last \\"I Don't Miss You At All\\" a jazz standard that although she heatbreakingly missinterprets, comes out fine. Norah is a young singer who I'm sure is completely unaware of what it is about her voice that is so special, therefore she doesn't nurture it and it hurt her on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul food","review":"It's amazing how her music becomes part of your soul...whether in a quiet place, in the car..it doesn't matter..I become immersed..and that is awesome..to be totally taken in...it's a welcome reprieve from a very busy world...she takes her time releasing albums..but they're well worth the wait...I am not surprised how much I like this cd...and will treasure it for years to come..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah proves she's no one hit wonder","review":"Norah's first album was a surprise hit. \\"Feels Like Home\\" picks up where \\"Come Away With Me\\" left off. Very good songs, but no stand out hit song. An overall solid album. Highly recommended for lovers of quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"music from somewhere else","review":"This cd is brilliant. Maybe it is in contrast to just how bad the \\"music\\" is these days that has taken over pop radio stations. Most of the popular music today sounds more like the crap that was out the year before...just slightly more [bad] lyrics. Anyway, Norah brings her talent to the forefront on this disc. The songs are deep yet simple, and Norah's hushed voice fits the mood perfectly. I like the fact that she doesn't chase trends yet sells lots of albums. The only reason this album didn't get the perfect 5 stars is b/c of the dolly parton duet. She scares me, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Like Come Away With Me","review":"Norah Jones - Feels Like Home (Blue Note, 2004)If you loved Come Away With Me, then you'll love this album too because it's practically the same album, just not without a noticeable hit like \\"Don't Know Why\\". Similar to India.Arie's sophomore album, don't expect a significant growth in Jones's songwriting and performance because it's only been a short time between this album and her last. This album still has highlights aplenty like \\"What Am I To You?\\" and the Dolly Parton duet, \\"Creepin' In\\". Norah Jones has bypassed the sophomore jinx with this one. -EJR"},{"rating":"1","title":"It goes downhill past song #5...","review":"Norah Jones' latest effort was dissapointing to say the least. I felt there was potential to her when I listened to her first album, but after listening to this album certainly I am not \\"feeling the same way.\\" The first few songs stand out, but in general the album is (yes, you've heard it before) booooring and repetitive. It's hard to put your finger on almost any song after the fifth track because they all sound very similar and, in a way, dull. \\"The Prettiest Thing\\" and the closing Ellington song \\"Don't Miss You At All\\" are the only other songs that stand out in the second half of the album: the rest I can totally live without. Granted I loved the use of electric piano on some of the tracks, giving them a bit of an edge, overall I don't see this as more than a two-star album. I recommend Jacqui Naylor's 'Shelter' -far better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mmMMmm","review":"I loved the first Norah Jones (Come Away With Me)and was afraid that she couldn't repeat it. But this has just swept me up! The bluesy voice is what I sign on for, but the bit of country with Dolly Parton was startling and enticing. I think that if you like Norah you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"way to go","review":"I started to love Norah when I listend to her show in New Orleans on TV . Then I realised - star was borned ! She had it all- amazing angelic voice , songwriting talent and beauty of simple girl next door . I bought her 1st CD and it was amasing I just couldn't get enough . Now it's happening all over again - this album is also amaizing . All songs are amaising and even duet with Dolly is not that bad . Norah didn't change her music style , althogt it has more country flavour . Her music stays beautiful and sophisticaded like before .One more thing - cover is verry nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't feel like home","review":"I was very dissappointed in this much anticipated release. Each piece on \\"Come Away With Me\\" was distinct and memorable and could stand on its own merit. On this CD, the selections blend together, in a not very appealing way. I found myself getting bored and skipping to the next track to see if there was a pleasant surprise waiting. Usually, there was not. The tone of the CD was rather downbeat. \\"Sunrise\\" is nice, but even though I'm a Dolly Parton fan, I did not like the duet \\"Creepin' In\\". There was just too much sameness on this CD, and nothing seized my attention or emotions. Also missing was much of Norah's distinctive piano playing. My recommendation is to stay with the first CD and wait for the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost on the edge of Country But Very mellow","review":"I was surprized that this CD has lots of bad reviews the first time I listened to it it seemed very mellow to me but it really grows on you there are a few great songs on here and the rest are very good. Its on the edge of folk/country reminds me a bit of Nancy Griffith and Michelle Shocked It is a very good CD It is mellow but her voice is much matured on this CD its different yes But Very Very Good ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usual Fare","review":"New albums or books by an artist or writer who've had a rave review for their previous effort always make me wonder two things1. will it be as good as the old one?2. are all the raves i see for the second time just an obligatory rave influenced in part by the hype from the old albumI wouldn't call this album anything to rave about really. Its her usual method and style, just like in the past album. Peaceful, calming and soothing. In a way, in our hectic world, filled with screaming music, it does make her album stick out, in a good way. Its a good album to come back to and unwind, just before bed, or if you've had a particularly frustrating day. However if you thought her first effort was undeserving of all the Grammy's she won, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect the expected","review":"In a word, tepid. Record labels and big-time publishers spend tons of money to tell us who to like. You'd think they could afford to find the best of the best, but instead we get a halcion cover act like Norah Jones pushed on us in every outlet store, every bank, dentist office, funeral home, you name it.As expected of a multiple Grammy-winning debut phenomenon, Jones is joined on her sophmore release by a bunch of hacks (including one of my former heroes, Dolly Parton) who for whatever reason are routinely convinced to latch on to the new so-and-so like so many algae to so many fungi.The result? A dreary, mid-tempo exhalation of dead hits, re-worked in the style of wonder bread soul. I have nothing against Norah Jones' music, save its Big Brotherly pervasiveness and its exhausting lack of originality and charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible home to live in","review":"I really appreciated her first album but 'Feels like home' is a bunch of horrible crap.

Her 2nd CD shows how emberrasing it can be to release an album with BORING, ordinary lamea** songs!! They are such uninteresting material, and a bit too country!! Some songs sound like kindergarden songs!! Not even her voice can carry this one.The production team obviously didn't want to mess with a winning formula, but why burn it to the ground??I've read reviews about the other EP album she did with Peter Malick, which was clearly recorded before she reached stardom. I happen to like it more than this 2nd album. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I bought this CD impulsively -- it was on a rack near the cash register at a store I was in.

Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointed Fan","review":"I was a devoted fan of Norah's. I have all her albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee. When I counted all the reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album, I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz. I was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals I attended. Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Norah is not. \\"Love's Holiday\\" is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing. She has an outstanding backup group that she has organized. DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disappointed jazz fan of Dena Derose. Win me back Diana.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialization kills a star","review":"When I bought her \`Come Away with Me' album, I enjoyed the non-commercialized rich jazz-like music she produced.Unfortunately, she has now entered the world of pop stardom and this reflects in \`Feels like Home'. This offering has ventured too far towards \`country' to be called jazz / soul. I'm sure it will still sell a couple of million copies based on the expectation one had following \`Come Away with Me', Next time, I will first listen to the CD in the music shop before buying it.

Now it's different; her albums sell in millions all over the world and I am totally dumbfounded.I can't really understand what's so unique about her music. It's even not good. Her music is just irritating and boring. Among the best reviewers on her albums are those who liked her music at first but then realized that it IS meaningless and boring.

Ms. Jones returns to the music scene with nothing new to offer her fans, which isn't surprising.

Norah is catering to a new segment that subjectively is beyond me - country. Some people may think of a duet with Dolly Parton as artistic, but hardly do.Hopefully in her next album she will return to the spirit of thought she evoked before - that of a wistful loneliness, of the murky depths of a dim nightlife, and build on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I REALLY loved \\"Come Away With Me\\" and eagerly awaited Jones' next CD.

I usually play it several times a night - usually along with others of hers, especially her \\"Come Away With Me.\\" Besides her unique voice and instrumentation, I am fascinated by her play with words. The way she uses rhyme delights me in child-like entertainment. I only regret she doesn 't live in my neighborhood - on the otherhand. I'm afraid I would get few of my responsibilities completed.

However, after 9 months, through rain and muck, the ringer mechanism has already rusted and broken. So it's no longer a bell.

Despite its original focus on the artist Barbara Bodichon (a close friend of the author George Eliot) the essays included provide a comprehensive overview of the issues all female artists faced in acquiring education and social acceptance, as well as well-researched insights on their work as critics and feminist activists. All essays are by top scholars in the field and complement more focused studies such as Deborah Cherry's 'Painting Women: Victorian Women Artists' (1993), and Pamela Gerrish Nunn's 'Canvassing' (1986). The collection's only notable drawback is the lack of a summary bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"by Aaron Edelheit","review":"I am a 11 year old boy who loves to read biogrophys the first time I read this book was when I was 10 and I did this book for a book report. take my advice and read this book I promise you you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of great info","review":"My 10 year old son enjoyed this book and learned a lot about this amazing man!

However, I found the information being sparse. It seems to cater toward young readers with a passing interest for these vehicles, not serious enthusiasts. Each year of the Ranchero is presented with a brief description. The writing is quite dry with much of the material disclosing options, color choices, dimensions, and sales figures. Photos are all in black and white. Mays shows little objectivity in his writing and throws accolades at every Ford or Ranchero product. In quite a few places, he mentions the superiority of the Ranchero over the El Camino. I remembered reading some absurd piece of writing that mentioned buyers flocking to the Ranchero in 1973 because of the energy crisis! This book, even at the discounted price of 18.96, is too expensive. Only get it if you are a die-hard Ranchero fan or want to complete your automobile book library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is an excellent book in many ways. First, it does a good job of teaching what it proposes to teach. Second, it contains pertinent examples to help the reader. Finally, unlike most computer books, it has a CD that is actually of value. The book also contains a dictionary of all the elements in the VB Add-In extensibility object. This alone is worth the price of the book.

The playing is traditional bluegrass, a banjo lover's feast. You will find subtlety in the instrumental arrangements, but even more in the vocal harmonies, with the several voices effectively playing off one another. What I like best, however, is the exuberant and almost brave mix between secular and gospel, a strong belief in the religious cornerstone to life side-by-side with odes to ramblers, be they people or rivers, and child brides. The song selection on the latter half of the second album is a little weaker overall, especially Yellow River, insipid as a pop tune, insipid as a bluegrass tune. But that quibble is more than overwhelmed by such wonders as How Long Have I Been Waiting, Happy on My Way, He Put A Rainbow in the Clouds for Me, A Touch of Pennsylvania, Georgia Girl, Til the Rivers All Run Dry, and Poet with Wings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Real","review":"This book reveals the feeling of the dominatrix as a person.

I am not talking about the subject matter either. I am talking about how bad this book is.This had to have been self published. I can not think why any publishing house would actually waste money on publishing this book. It was written like a high school term paper. Very amateurish. I am not saying that I know all there is to know about alternate lifestyles, but there are things that just do not jibe right in this book. If anything it should be filed under fiction, very uncredible.Luckily, I only paid three dollars for this dretch. I would not reccomend this to anyone. The only reason it got one star is because Amazon does not have any lower rating than that, but if they did it would definitly get it.Do not waste your time on this book.

A very interesting book. I don't think Shawana is ever going to be a soccer mom. A teenager with a very steely reserve. I admire she used what resources she could. Being thrown out of the house at such a young age and making a go to better herself is admirable. I wonder though, if seeing such a seedy side of men will skew her for life. I wish her the best of luck.This book certainly was incredible and very funny in many spots. As she said, she never did anything to these men they didn't want. One thing for sure, there are certainly many more kinksters out there than just me. I've never understood the whole Dom thing but to each there own. I'm glad she had limits and didn't cross the line into prostitution. Would it be fun to spend an evening with her just to listen to her stories.

They say never judge a book by it's cover, but the title got me on this one.If you've surfed the web enough and have seen a good deal of sexual fetishes out there, you're not going to be in for much of a shock with this book. It was pleasantly surprising that the author maintained a conversational tone through out the whole book. Just as it says it the description, there are moments where you feel it's you and a friend (who happened to be a dominatrix at one point) just chatting over a cup of tea.All and all, nothing very life changing from this one - but an interesting and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony SNC-RZ50N Review","review":"The Sony SNC-RZ50N is a very good camera, high quality images, great zoom control, preset viewing positions, powerful zoom. It will send e-mails, FTP file transfers, and take snapshots if it detects motion or if it detects a left object. It also has the ability to play a recording through speakers upon alarm. I love the camera, but I wouldn't buy another. I'd buy the Sony SNC-RX550 instead. The SNC-RZ50N will not take a port address for automated SMTP (e-mail) file transfers. It only connects to the default port, 25, which very few modern e-mail servers use. The SNC-RX550, with the latest firmware upgrade, can use any port address. I'm using the SNC-RZ50N with the optional SNCA-CFW5 wireless G card in a protective housing at the beach. Works great, but the opaque instructions are not for the meek."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"After years of only seeing the war in Iraq through our television sets, \\"For God and Country\\" provides a unique view from the eyes of a Navy Chaplain who lived and served with Marines who were there.This is a story of our U.S. Marines fighting to defeat a determined enemy, working to help the Iraqi people, and struggling to protect each other on a modern-day battlefield in an ancient land. This is a story of the spirit of the American fighting man.Brian Waite's account is uplifting and compelling. There is something in this book for everyone. It talks of God and War, violence and compassion, and life and death.

And he did all of it by hand!!!The system is pure and, if combined with other indicators, moving averages, etc. can be powerful.The book is full of technical information.

A good start would be Tom Williams' Master The Markets book, but (keep in mind that) this book is very disorganized and does not cover all of Wyckoff's concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about trading","review":"When you start educating yourself on the stockmarket, you start a journey to what really happens.There are hundreds of books out there telling you the same thing, but its not what you need to learn.The Wyckoff Method is about price and volume. And what you can interpret from it.This is what you need to know to compile a trading plan that will stand up to all types of markets.From this book I can now compile a trading plan in relation to volume spread analysis.(VSA)In the pursuit of knowing what a market will do tomorrow, The Wyckoff Method points you in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyckoff was a genius","review":"I never heard of Mr. Wyckoff until I bought Robert Dorfman's Hedge Fund Trading Secrets Revealed...which was great also...who speaks highly of his books by saying the ideas presented by Wyckoff are timeless. Dorfman was right. Basic Human Psycology in action which will never change no matter how technologically advanced trading gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Nothing New","review":"I need someone to enlighten me why other reviews gave this book such high ratings. This book has several shortcomings. It was first written in 1986 so many things are outdated. As another reviewer has pointed out, this book needs to provide examples to illustrate its points. The writers might be good traders but are lousy writers; they have failed to explain many key points. The content adds no new information than what most people already know: low volume on rallies, drawing trendlines, breaks of trendlines as signals for change in direction. I gave up reading the first author (Hutson) half-way through. I jumped to the third author (Weis) because the chapter titles seem hopeful, but I found the same shortcomings there (not enough examples, lack of explanation, etc.). My conclusion is don't even bother with book. I gave it one star because I don't know how to rate it as zero star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy delivery","review":"This battery was a replacement for a camera I own.

Make sure you check who it is sold by. When you search for the product, the results show only the cheap one, but if you click on it, then look on the right-hand side, \\"More Buying Choices\\" - you should choose the one offered by AMAZON.

This is a much stronger and polished effort than her first cd and I pray that people will take the time to listen and be blessed by the well-written songs.

With the exception of about 2 songs, this album is really great.

But on everything if she goes back to singing with destiny's child next year. I'm no longer going to support her. She is so comprising the gospel. Her cd is excellent as far as production. She has ced and vic C and angie winans... she has dawkins and dawkins, solange and beyonce. Plus J. Moss. she has all the right people producing her album. the tracks are hot as far as beats, melodies and back up vocals. you just have to adjust to her different voice.

It's actually a sweet book in many ways: a romantic comedy, with some urban profanity. A portrait of a time and place, and a coming of age novel. Contains virtually no violence.

Although the desire for revenge is an understandable response to the brutality suffered by the two main characters their reaction is not a credible one. Few people act on an urge for vengeance but even if we accept that they do on this occasion it's hard to believe they would be this extreme. What is this movie trying to tell us about a lust for violence? Well, nothing really, except that some people have such a lust. Now, I like a good gory horror flick, but in such films the violence is not posited as real. Here, however, we're supposed to accept these sadistic acts of retaliation as plausible, and we're left feeling a little grubby for having witnessed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This album, as far as I am concerned is the best album ever made!

The valve stuck way too much, even after lubricating, causing a reverse affect where you could not breathe even when you didn't have water in the tube.

For the lower volume user who has the time to double-check what's coming out of the printer to make sure it's all there, it's probably not a big deal. I've had much higher priced machines with far worse issues than this.One small complaint: I don't know if this is the norm for lower priced machines, but I dislike the way that print quality gradually erodes as toner is running out.

I've compared it to the output of a much more expensive HP Laserjet 8000 and it is as good or better.The only downside is that I'd like to do duplex printing, but then again I don't know of a laser in this price range (sub $200) that can.I figured my long term ownership costs (paper and toner) to come in around 2.7 cents a page compared to an inkjet with per page costs somewhere around 9 to 20 cents each.

Yet the author spends 80% of the book explaining the *business logic* (not the ActiveX-specific issues) of this silly example.

I suppose face in the crowd will never be my favorite by leon, but i do like it now. So hard to say goodbye-down in the flood,and the devil started talking are the best songs on the cd . The time element of 11 yrs amazes me-but i believe i will enjoy this cd for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of my Leon Russell CDs","review":"This is by far the worst of the CDs I have of L.R.

I considered keeping the table and fixing it, but as I began to put it together I realized that it is glued with small dowels in most places and the hardware provided wouldn't be enough to withstand a child getting on and off the seat for very long. Also, the box arrived looking fine, but once opened it revealed that it was not properly packaged to withstand shipping and the packaging material was insufficient which led to damage to the table top.

It could not have gotten that wet, yet it began to act funky later that evening, the buttons were all doing different things than they were supposed to. For a while it only tuned on when it was plugged in and you hit the on button about five times, eventually it wouldn't turn on anymore. Because it was considered water damage the warranty wouldn't cover it and I'm out a camera.

About the card that comes with; its way too small and i'd advise you get atleast a 256mb card for it, inexpensive yet big enough to handle the number of pictures that you'll want to take.It is also just about the right size. You can choose to stow it in a bag, purse, or even a roomy pocket, yet it is not so small that you'll be concerned that it might be too fragile because it isn't; compact and sturdy, well built.Overall, great little camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"V10 review","review":"Fujifilm Finepix V10 is a very nice camera and the display is great.

My reason for the low 2 star rating is when you power the camera up, the lens moves out and a plastic protective cover opens up.

Also, the LCD is enormous, and she has appreciated being able to use it even in the sun without problems.The fact that you need xD memory cards is a bit of a pain since they are less common, but even that problem is quickly remedied if you pick up a cheap one from Amazon when you get the camera.All in all, this was the perfect gift for our colleague and is a great little point and shoot camera.

Yogins and yoginis are a tight-lipped bunch, to be sure (regarding their experiences on retreat etc.) so some of that can't be helped. What was substituted for Tenzin Palmo's experiences was the author's infusion of American feminist thought - not a problem in and of itself, but not why I bought the book. I would recommend that anyone looking for an objective biography of Tenzin Palmo look elsewhere; for those looking for a feminist paean to Tenzin Palmo, this book is for you.

I think anyone who is isolated and starves over a period of time ANYWHERE will start hallucinating -you don't have to go to a cave in the Himalayas to do that.Besides while she was busy trying to find 'Enlightenment' other people had to work hard not only for their living but also to offer her 'her plane tickets,their houses,food,transport,money,so that all her physical needs are met.This is how she says it should be.' Now that's a great way to get enlightened !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once in a Lifetime","review":"This is one of the most inspiring books I have read in years.

Despite the authors fairly prolific output in matters of buddhism/spirituality I found the content bland, trite, rambling and uninspiring.I am not normally so critical of a book, and this is my first review, but this book incensed me because it completely mangled a fantastic story.It's only worth reading if you are particularly interested in Tenzin Palmo, I would never bother reading it for anything other than gleaning the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"AM A MOTHER OF A 2YR OLD AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT CHAVO DEL OCHO HAS BEEN IN FAMILY SINCE IT CAME OUT.

This first one broke in about a month so the store replaced it. Now the second one has stopped working just a few months later. I think we stopped using it for a while and it still did not last more than a couple weeks. The batteries run down in just a few days. Those type of batteries are not very cheap. I would never buy another collar from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product for Price","review":"I felt this product is good for what it is. It get's the dog's attention in the mannor that is intented, and is a great aid to training. Batteries are not that expensive to replace, and it is not intended to have left on the dog for extended periods of time. So to save the battery life, you need to be in tune with your dog while you have the collar on the dog and turned on. Then you will find yourself replacing the batteries less often. Read the literature that comes with it, it is very useful before you begin training your dog with this collar system."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"we purchased 2 of these at the same time, when they arrived the batteries appeared to be run down , i guess where they had been on the shelf for some time.anyway i went out and purchased new ones for both the remote and the collars, and after following the instructions about setting the units up, (pairing them) they made the necessary clicking tone noise when the button was pressed, but as for any shock value it was a waste of time.i managed to shock myself but the only way this was possible was to press down as hard as i could against the 2 probes that shock, the only way i could have got any shock value to my dog i would have had to had the collars so tight on the dogs neck it would probably have choked him before zapping him.i have returned both of these for a refund, which will hopefully come through ok, you wont be able to return in as new condition as you have to cut open the plastic packaging to get to the units inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work out of the box.","review":"This Innotek device did not work out of the box. All setup instructions were followed, all confirming light signals were noted in sequence, but when the signal was sent there was absolutely no charge on the probes at any setting. I tightened the probes, double checked the signal light sequence that tells you all is well, but the little grimlin in the box who is supposed to deliver the shock was not at home. Also, Amazon has this device paired on the site with what one would assume are replacement batteries. The extras paired with this device have nothing to do with the Innotek device. The extra batteries are flat coin batteries and the Innotek uses cylindrical batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay too much for replacement batteries","review":"This one has a relatively short range, but it is a good product.

We keep it on the lowest setting and have had great results with him not doing any of the bad habits that all other training techniques failed to take care of.

I haven't had much luck with the collar responding when the dog is more than 15-20 feet away, but for around the house where we intended to use it, I have had no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the petsafe version instead!","review":"This was awful! Went through the setup and it worked perfectly. Testing on the dog and it didn't work. Seems to have a range issue. Changed batteries and tested range with device sitting upright on table.

Dog is running much less and listening much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Innotek","review":"We've purchased several of these Innotek brand dog training collars over the years with the same results--they either broke or drained the batteries quickly. The craftsmanship of these units is flawed and they only work for a few months if you're lucky.You'll be happy initially because the collars do work for the short term, but you'll be constantly buying batteries because they run down so fast.I have decided that I will never purchase anything from Innotek again because of the poor quality and design of all their products. Not worth the price even if they're on sale, which by the way, they often are because word gets around about the horrible performance of these devices.In short, stay away from Innotek and save yourself some money and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the CD","review":"I don't know a whole lot about Brazilian music, but I really enjoy Elis. Since I don't live in a very diverse place like say New York City, I am happy with whatever Brazilian music I can come across. But the Pacific Northwest is becoming more diverse. Having said that, I think this greatest hits is a great way to sample the Billie Holiday of South America. She is so intense and emotional in a way that fills you with awe at how somebody can open their hearts so much to the public. They used to call her the little hurricane and it wasn't for nothing. It is a shame that Elis' career was cut short because of a drug overdose, but her musical legacy still lives on.

It took about an hour to assemble but it was relatively easy. It's a good size (you could easily grill a couple of steaks on it) plus the rotisserie feature is nice. It heats up quickly and cooks the food evenly. The grill itself is sturdy and thick and leaves nice grill marks on the food. It is removable and easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher. The side trays are also removable and are a heavy duty plastic that can be put in the dishwasher. If you choose to you can put some hickory chips in the bottom of the unit next to the heat coils, then close the hood and smoke the food, which gives the food a great hickory smoked flavor. There is a drip tray at the bottom of the unit that is easy to remove and clean. I like the fact that this grill is environmentally friendly and I never have to worry about running out of gas halfway through my cooking.

It is neither an ego trip nor is it filled with endless pages of tables which serve no useful purpose, other than to make the book seem better value.He makes plain, that one has to find a trading style to suit oneself, and is not overly proscriptive.All of his ideas are well laid out and easy to verify and equally applicable to stocks and commodities.He gives a number of formulae in the book, and these are easily translated into action, in say TradeStation, by seasoned professionals and beginners alike.In short, this book is excellent, and I hope it will take it's place on the traders best sellers list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But Not Great Book","review":"Learn B Bands from the man who invented them.

The quality of the sound and picture of this movie were not very good and the acting was poor. It is odd that this movie is based on a true story because I find it very hard to believe that the kid's deafness didn't effect him more.

First of all, the Pandora/Amazon link was wrong, and there is no Junior M.A.F.I.A. here. No big names. Instead, you will find one too many songs by unknown amateur rap-star wannabees imitating the masters' flow (Jay-Z, 2Pac, you name it).There are some proteges of the big names too, but don't get excited- they're no better than the amateur wannabees.

When I saw that Willems was releasing two new pigeon books, I was very excited and ordered them immediately. Perhaps if I had waited, I would have seen that these are \\"board books,\\" i.e. only a few \\"pages\\" long. Instead of a book demonstrating multiple pigeon emotions, as I expected, we touch on angry, sad, then happy, all in the course of less than a minute of (slow) reading time. I guess it's a cute enough book, but know that it is just a \\"smigeon of pigeon,\\" not a full book."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love the 'Pijja'","review":"This book is not as long nor as adorable as 'Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus,' which is definitely a favorite in my house. But I must say, this little board book *definitely* taught my 16 month old daughter about emotions. She loves when we read this book to her- and she copies the emotions that 'Pijja' (what she calls the pigeon) experiences- making sad faces, angry faces, happy faces along with the little guy. Even in this smaller, board book version (which is actually a much smarter purchase for younger toddlers than the hardcover books that they easily tear...) the pigeon is a character that small children can relate to, learn from... and as my daughter does, laugh with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Pigeon books :(","review":"Very short book.

I don't generally buy board books because my students are too old for them, but I thought I'd make an exception. I was disappointed.

This book (as opposed to the other Pigeon books which we really enjoy and read a lot) - has been sent to the closet and we do not read it any more. Why? Because the pigeon is cranky without an explained reason and it doesn't seem to be teaching children anything good. It seems to say, \\"I'm cranky and I don't want to be nice.\\" Well, that's not what I want my daughter to learn.There aren't a lot of pages, there aren't a lot of colors, there aren't a lot of things to look at on each page.

The smoker body came out of the box slightly flattened on the sides even though there was no visible damage on the box.

For example, stirring tea leaves in a jar with a pencil to simulate a hurricane on Jupiter.Only one experiment sounded interesting--a sun dial that can act as a compass. But wait!

The description is misleading. The hood is not attached and no way for the hood to stay in place on the shirt. With that said the material is too short to tuck in the hoodie. The pic shows the waist sash long up to the boys knee. The longest fabric is only enough to double tie. My son is 6 yrs old 44inches and only 40lbs. The ties around arms, legs keep sliding since the fabric is a slippery type fabric that pilts. The face fabric does not hold up. It slides so I had to put Velcro on it to stay put.

The zombie make-up ranged from mediocre to rubber mask. The people seemed to know that only head shots killed zombies, although that was something that was just done and not learned. The box hides some of the \\"mystery\\" of the plot by describing the girl as an \\"assassin's daughter.\\" The writer, director, producer, and editor are all the same person, Jeffery McMichael Bookshire.

It should not be available to buy.The script is straight out of a bad 1990s comic-book. The directing is amateurish. The acting is amateurish. Although I will admit Lindsey Morris is hot. Her hips are amazing!) The camera-work is bad and the quality of the recording is barely watchable. It was all a dirty washed-out brown. You couldn't even see everything you were meant to. No, not like Night of the Living Dead. This was bad looking.I bought the movie from Amazon as a part of the 4 movie Midnight Horror Collection very cheaply.

Curious, isn't it? The 5-star reviews have to be from people connected with the film and who have an interest in it's sales, because no one else would honestly give this amateur effort more that 2 stars, and that many only from those viewers who'd give an amateur film maker credit for the effort.

Now after a few months I'm looking at replacing it with another brand.I really hate to write a bad review of this bag as I always loved it, but it appears that Samsonite's QC has taken a turn for the worse on this product.

Actually the person who said \\"well he was murdered wasn't he?\\" (= after the funeral of a rich relative;Richard Abernethie) is found brutally murdered with an ax the following day. And she was known for such statements, (true, and/but embarrasing). Anyway Hercule Poirot is 2 investigate the case. The plot is very exciting, interesting, and the end unexpected and chocking.

In this book the family patriarch dies suddenly. He has been ill, and no one questions the death until his youngest sister says \\"He was murdered wasn't he?\\" at the funeral. Then the next day this sister is found brutally murdered in her home. Enough for the family solicitor to call in retired Hercule Poirot.

She told a wonderful and gripping story in the Witching Hour. This installment paled in comparison. I usually love Rice's rich detail and the epic scope of her stories, but here it just dragged. If you like Anne Rice, you probably will not hate this book, but there is little here to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech! Not Even Tim Curry's Sexy Voice Can Redeem It!","review":"This story starts off great with a bizarre tall quasi-human (Taltos) character, who's a glamorous NY businessman, haunted by his idyllic homeland and destroyed past. Then, Rice goes on for hours about who knows what happened when like a court stenographer's printout, with nothing remotely interesting happening until the very end where they lope off into the sunset in a pure cheesy cowboy romance. Not too horrible for falling asleep to--I used these tapes to combat insomnia--but definitely poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly mesmerizing, haunting, story that you can't put down.","review":"I was given this book for my birthday. Not knowing who Anne Rice is or that there were books preceeding it, I read it from start to finish without stopping. I was completely mesmerized.

I was hurled into their lives...I could feel their pain, pleasure, and misery...I cried when they cried...I laughed when they laughed.

Lasher was a great follow-up. Taltos was a big disappointment. I began reading the books back in the early 90's, found out I was expecting, and quit reading. Old Southern folklore--don't see or read gore! This is too ingrained in me not to believe! Anyway, now I have plenty of time to read and wanted to finish the series. Somewhere along the line I think Taltos lost the stream and the action wasn't as immediate and did not link back to the immediate family. That being stated, would love to do the series as an intensive book study focusing on genealogy and the significant part it plays in our characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of crap","review":"I loved the Witching Hour. I thought Lasher was okay, and The Vampire Lestat as well as Queen of the Damned and Cry to Heaven remain books that I keep handy to reread. But Taltos? What a waste of paper. The Mayfair witches were fascinating. But this Celtic hoo-haw with Henry VIII's bastard son emerging as some persecuted non-human race. Good lord. In Lasher and Taltos Rice began to show that she really needed an editor to trim things down -- and after Memnoch the Devil (which I bought in Germany because I was so excited I could not wait to get an English copy from the States), I lost faith in Rice's ability to write coherently. She's an amazing story teller but went off on a weird tangent here that has become even more apparent of late."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should never have been written.","review":"Ms. Rice tantalized and mystified us with probably the best work since the first two \\"Vampire\\" books when she wrote \\"The Witching Hour\\". Following, \\"Lasher\\" could have, and should have, been the conclusion. Nothing more need be said about Rowan, Michael, and the Mayfair family. The climax had been reached and passed. We were entertained by horror and mystery well in keeping with Rice's best. But, for some reason, the author felt compelled to write an encore where none was needed. What was mystery turned to absurdity; what was enticing and teasing became tedious and dull. Ms. Rice needs to know when to leave well enough alone and move on"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I didn't have to buy it","review":"Unlike other books by Ms. Rice, I found Taltos to be tedious, ponderous, dull, and in need of editing for both content and context, not to mention grammar. Come on, I stayed up late to finish a book that fell completely flat.Ridiculous, rushed ending. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Rice's best","review":"I love Anne Rice. She writes in great detail and creates rich, beautiful characters with the Mayfair Witches as well as the Vampire Chronicles. This book is not one of her best to say the least. I'm not that sure it's even an ending the Witches series because the ending leaves you in the air. There was less excitement with this book. I suppose that is due to the fact that the treachery in the Talamasca is resolved very early in the book, leaving little to become excited about in the remaining chapters in the book. I feel that she tried to do too much in this book, resolving past issues from the Witches series and going into more detail on the Taltos species. All in all, it wasn't a bad book because Anne Rice is such a superb writer and it is entertaining to read but in comparison to The Witching Hour and Lasher, this book falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"The end of this story of spirits and incest, and some back story on the whole Taltos development.

Darnit, there isn't. Oh well, there really could be, the way Taltos left off. But I enjoyed reading all of the books. All the history in The Witching Hour seemed a bit much at the time I read it, but as I progressed through the series, I came to know it's purpose. A really great read, they may as well have been one huge book, the way I read them, going directly from the last page of one to the first of the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Spellbinding!!","review":"I totally loved this book!! Im a huge fan of the Mayfair witches and of Mrs. Rices literature. Being 16, i was completely enthralled but the complete setting and the characters in the Mayfair witch Trilogy. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Mrs. Rices other literature and tales of the occult & fantasy! It was a really great read, but there were a few slow part but they were short enough to trudge through! Keep Reading See ya!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally I love Anne Rice, but...","review":"Rice was definitely at her worst while writing this novel. I usually find her descriptions rich with her abundance of details, but here, I found it just plain boring, tedious and excrutiating to read. I felt as if she wrote this novel because she had to, not because she wanted to. Don't bother to read this book unless you like to be tortured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"Having read and enjoyed both 'The Witching Hour' and 'Lasher' I found 'Taltos' to be mediocre, at lease compared to the first 2 books of the series. Mr. Ash's character is incomplete and he seems to be placed there just to justify the need for a 3rd sequel. This makes the whole book boring and in general ruins the great atmosphere created in the first 2 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I wasted my time!!!","review":"I enjoyed the first book of this series and praised it to all my friends. I liked _Lasher_ as well, but _Taltos_ is just plain bad. It is way too long and the dialog is inane sometimes. Only Anne Rice would write a paragraph to describe a color. Sometimes scenes were halting and seemed to be thrown in just to set up another, bigger scene. And the \\"I love you, but I hate you\\" idea was already old by page 100. I found I didn't care for the characters as I did in the other books. They were just *talked about*, not really explored as before. After reading 3/4 of it, I gave up, threw the book on the night stand and started reading _The Meaning of Quantum Theory_, by Jim Baggott. I found it much more interesting *and* exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh....","review":"I fell in love with \\"The Witching Hour\\" - the first book of the trilogy. \\"Lasher\\" was fast-paced and afterwards left me highly anticipating \\"Taltos.\\" However, with this novel being the conclusion to the previous two, I was disappointed. Rice's focus of the novel is not on the Mayfair Family. By the last 50 pages or so...I kept thinking...\\"how is she going to end this?\\" I was left with that terrible feeling that nothing was going to be explained properly and this story was not going to end as I had anticipated. As another reviewer has mentioned below, the ending is very rushed - this is very true. If you have enjoyed \\"The Witching Hour\\" and \\"Lasher\\" you will of course want to read this book...but be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice shouldn't have written this one","review":"Its a pitty... a story written by Anne Rice with a happy end ????? Not only that, but I saw it already coming when I had only read 50% of the book. What I also want to say is that I think it is a pitty that the mystery of Lasher, the gost, is broken down to the mystery of a biological being in the book 'Lasher', and that with this book she also demystifies the specie itself : the Taltos. Anyhow, I'm happy that I've read the book (just to have read the whole serie of the Mayfair Witches), but on its own, the book certainly can't reach the level of the other two books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Anne!","review":"Taltos takes you to a special make-believe historical record. Ash is as or more compelling and sympathetic a hero as Lestat. His story makes you want to root for him & have him become part of the Mayfair story. He explains how Lasher came to be & makes you truly feel for his race. Anne can present any subject & make you suspend disbelief. I hope this isn't the last of the Mayfair series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in detail","review":"I was introduced to Anne Rice with the advent of \\"Interview with a Vampire\\", and she does not disappoint. \\"Taltos\\" is beautifully detailed, rich in prose and very thought-provoking. When a book leaves you wondering \\"Gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if it were possible?\\", then it has made a definite impact. I have not read any of the other novels in the series as yet, but this book stood alone, with no puzzling gaps to fill. I had a problem with Mona and Michael (call me a prude, but I do believe that 13 is a bit young! ). Other than that, the novel was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I adore \\"The Witching Hour\\" and dashed out to buy \\"Lasher\\" at the earliest opportunity. I was horribly disappointed. But I thought well, maybe Ms Rice would redeem herself with this one, but alas no. To put it simply, don't bother. The first book is spectacular, the rest a spectacular let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifull written","review":"I've read this only once but I do remember loving it. Along with The Witching Hour and Lasher this trio is a truly one-of-a-kind read. If you are into dark fiction with a hauntingly beautiful twist, you simply must read this and the other 2 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and imaginative","review":"Although I find this to be the weakest of the three books in the Lives of the Mayfair Witches, Rice has undoubtedly mastered the art of characterization and reinventing history. The history of the Taltos left me wishing that they actually did exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!! I WANT ANOTHER ONE!!!","review":"i have read all three mayfair books, and i love all of them. TWH was my fave. but i never wanted any of them to end. I fell in love with Michael, my fave. character, and wished for a man as handsome and sensitive as him.

I don't like her. she a snot and a little whore. at first i loved her independence, but in the end, i wanted someone to just slap her. i loved everything about these books, and i hope and pray that there are more about the mayfair witches. i fell in love with everyone!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introductory French book.","review":"The watercolor pictures are a nice size, easy to see and to recognize.

But I've synced several times each way, and at least this PCMCIA firewire cardbus is *slower* than USB2.0.Plus, the iPod battery is recharged during a USB/USB2.0 sync, but *not* during a firewire sync. So not only does the firewire sync take longer just for the music, and not only is additional time (and a connection) required to recharge the battery, but the battery also drains *during* the firewire sync, making it a triply long process.I'm returning this, and going back to USB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage of Reggae and Electronic","review":"Pretty good CD all together. A little more on the Reggae side than I expected but I liked the Noiseshaper cuts on some of the Late Night compliations so I thought I'd give it a try.

But, it's ot a disc where every track is a masterpiece and you should be a fan of Reggae in general before parting with your cash of this disc wjust won't appeal to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwelling in the Past","review":"The Light Years (Cazalet Chronicle, Vol 1) by Elizabeth Jane Howard. Climb aboard as three generations of the Cazalet family (and assorted relatives and servants) prepare to board the WWII Train that is threatening to pull into the station. Many, many characters, some lovable, some not. The children and their irrepressible adventures and clever dialogue are my favorite, followed by Hugh and Sybil, who don't quite meet in the station for trying to please each other. Of course Grandfather, with his inane invitations and muddling but very cunning schemes, is a dear. This series seems a place to dwell, become one of the family, with the reader being able to have the perspective of seeing within each character. No, there isn't a beginning and ending or \\"plot,\\" but the reader will find humanity and joy and family. Volumes 2,3 and 4 await this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"very like Waugh","review":"The dust jacket of The Light Years, the first in the Cazalet series, compares the book to the \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" television series from the BBC. And there is a certain resemblance, of course, as there would be with any upper-class English family of the early 20th century. However, Elizabeth Jane Howard's book is more like Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited or Jane Austen's Emma -- a leisurely stroll of a novel where the character development is much more important than any plot line. You'll find you really care how each of the major characters changes and grows -- whether adults or children.The Light Years also made me realize for the first time how constrained women's lives were, even as late as 1937.This is a book that will sneak up on you. If it were a movie, it would be disparaged as a \\"chick flick.\\" However, you won't realize how much you like it until you've finished the last page and feel cheated that it's ended. I immediately ordered the next book, Marking Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this book. The Englishness of it and the family with all their secrets, hopes and dreams. The characters just leap of the page. Some I love, some I despise. It is gossipy, tragic and funny. The descriptions of life in wartime London, so interesting to know what life was like then, with all the shortages of food and clothing. I really didn't want it to end as I felt a part of the Cazelet family. I would heartily reccomend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"different perspectives","review":"I really enjoyed the Cazalet Chronicles, for many reasons. Much of it came from a child's/young person's perspective which was unusual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we really need to know all this period detail?","review":"I found this a tough book to finish and did not enjoy it. The wealth of presumably accurate period detail is certainly impressive and adds some verismo. However it is really only wallpaper and did not paper over the very significant dramatic cracks in the work. Events are in very short supply. We have inklings of adultery, incest and lesbianism but there is little true development of these themes beyond introduction and elaboration. One yearns for confrontations, conflicts and resolutions but there is only the cloudy malaise of pre-war England. Mrs Howard is clearly fascinated by the world of children and we have endless descriptions of their emotions and play. Actually the depiction of childish thought process is very well done. But at the end of the book little has happened other than the birth of a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I Read This Book?","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. The characters were undeveloped. The story is painfully slow. Please spend your time reading something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cazalet Chronicles - great reading","review":"Have just started on my second read through of this wonderful series. The writing is superb, the characters are totally believable, and as a previous reviewer has said - you love most of them and hate a few. These books have me crying one minute and laughing the next. Impossible to put down, they give an accurate and enthralling picture of what life must have been like during those years around the second world war in London and that small, southern part of Britain. I am almost through Marking Time, and can harldly wait to get to the next two books in the series. Then I will be distraught that I have finished once again.

Upon receiving this game, I was immensely excited with my anticipation of being reunited with the classic Mortal Kombat II. The game looks great. The controls are there. But the one huge turn-off is that this game is so unplayable in 1-player mode. The CPU opponent is so ridiculously cheap and difficult that you are lucky if you can even get passed the 3rd fighter. I used to beat the old arcade and SNES versions of MKII, but cannot barely pass the 3rd or 4th opponent.If you want to play against other people then the game is great. But if you plan on just enjoying the game for yourself and want to play the CPU? Good luck.

It did a better-than-fair job of portraying the established characters, puts them in a situation that is novel and moderately interesting, and has them interact with a fairly interesting and well-thought-out alien culture. And if I could have done without Data being an annoying twit, that's pretty much par for the course; he was no worse here than he was in many of the TV episodes, especially the early ones. Still, somehow despite all of the positives that I have to say about it, it just didn't grab me enough to rate a five-star review; on a purely subjective basis, I drop it a star. Still, it was a pretty fair read.Of course, if you don't like Star Trek stories in particular or genre fiction in general, you won't want to read this.

There are definently better bands out there that have way better, and more positive lyrics. I recommend Killswitch Engage.

Being a scientific lab junkie, I really do love the shape of this and find that the insulation does work rather well. I also am happy with the glass funnel and reusable filter, so no paper filters are required.

As I was sitting at my computer, about 10 minutes after the coffee had been prepared, I was startled by a loud \\"pop\\" and spent the next 10 minutes picking up glass, not drinking coffee.

I can use it to pour coffee from a french press pot and reduce the sediment a bit. If I'd paid more, this would be going right back to Amazon. Such a disappointment from an otherwise great company- Bodum.added Dec 2008: The decanter didn't last long either. At least is was deeply discounted at the time of purchase.

The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home. After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods. In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!

The circular scratches could not be removed. I was able to remove some of the sticky grease by using dishwashing liquid, warm water, a soft cloth, and plenty of elbow grease, but what developed thereafter were permanent white spots all over the disc.In the end, I was left with two damaged discs and a lot of wasted time.

Plato's conception of how the earth was created is just an atavistic whirlwind of different origins and primary forces, none of which are explained or tied together into a coherent framework. He starts out with a foundational idea and then when he can't develop it any further, he just throws out another one and insists that it's somehow related to the previous one. That being said, this is a hugely important dialogue because in his examination of first origins Plato briefly calls into question the problem of understanding what being and becoming are, but he just as promptly drops them, refusing to go into further detail. It's the starting point for Martin Heidegger's project in Being and Time. The Timeaus matters not because of what Plato discusses in it, but because of what he actively leaves out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Translation","review":"I have a big green book with all of Plato's dialogues and it is gibberish compared to this translation.

There are also some large free mod's for bf1942 which can extend the usefullness of the game. I recommend getting a joystick (I use a saitek evo) for use with planes and helicopters. You can fly without one but it helps.If you are thinking of buying this and more time has passed, you might try to use gamespy or xfire or some online tracker to see how many servers and players are still playing.

The game is more realistic than most because you never make it through a whole mission as just one person. The only bad thing about the game is when you get stuck without a vehicle on a large map.

The derivatives Mr. Leeson was trading do not seem particularly sophisticated (don't compare this to LTCM). But you wouldn't learn much about them from this book. I got the sense that Mr. Leeson was grappling with very basic financial questions. As a consequence, the book tends to be repetitive in a description of losses getting out of control and the soap opera building around that. You also have a nagging feeling that you never get the full story. However, the book is interesting where it describes the complete breakdown of financial and management controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real life thriller","review":"A great summer read.

Wood has been hanging out with country stars since Willie Nelson had short hair and visible signs of ambition. While lesser reporters asked their questions, got their stories and went home, Wood stayed on to ride the buses, drink the whiskey and share the hangovers. Wonder of wonders, he kept notes on everything! Neither a muckraker nor an apologist, Wood views his subjects like an unobtrusive documentary maker. But he displays a wicked sense of humor, a virtue he sorely needed when he found himself trapped on Conway Twitty's grim and rule-bound bus. My favorite story, though, is the one in which he, Jimmy Buffett and Jerry Jeff Walker get drunk in New Orleans and ill-advisedly hop a train to Nashville. From then on, it's Hee Haw meets Animal House. Virtually every country star who's emerged during the past 35 years finds a place in these thoroughly absorbing pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but dated in many ways","review":"This edition has some interesting aspects of model rocketry for the hobbyist who is ready for some new ideas and directions.

It arrived and was in new condition. Have used it several times to remove hose clamps on my truck. Will use it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and utter nonsense","review":"I cringe when I think about the picture that the Non-Indians must be getting about India after reading this garbage. The things the author describes in this book DO NOT happen in India, might have happened when my grandmother was 16 (even that, I am not sure). The author has no clue, absolutely none whatsoever, about the mentality of Indian parents or the arranged marriage system. I feel like suing the author and the publishers for printing this rubbish. And all those who feel that you are getting a glimpse into the Indian marriage system after reading this, please wake up. This is NOT what happens, this is NOT how indian parents are, you are getting a glimpse into NOTHING except the author's idiotic imaginations."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I read the reviews here and purchased the book. Felt cheated, it is a waste of money and time. Utterly boring, and fake. The protagonist is supposed to be from India, but her descriptions of India sound like it is her first visit to an exotic land."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-d12e83a9"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/10.md","filePath":"guide/10.md"}'),z={name:"guide/10.md"},j=Object.assign(z,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
