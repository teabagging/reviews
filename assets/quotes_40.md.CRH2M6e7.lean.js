At the very least it should list the recording date for each song (or at least the release date), along with which album it is on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last train for glory","review":"Some of the music here has dated, like the humorous Alice's Restaurant and Motorcycle, but the rest remains as beautiful and poignant as ever. Much of it has travelling as a theme, like Coming Into Los Angeles, Last Train, City Of New Orleans and Last To Leave. The Steve Goodman song about a train called the City Of New Orleans is a true classic of epic proportions but my favorite on the album is the soulful and moving Last Train with its poetic and spiritual lyrics and its sensitive treatment. It sounds like a gospel song and I would love to hear someone like e.g. Nina Simone interpreting it. Darkest Hour and Last To Leave have also stood the test of time very well. Although he emerged out of the 60s folk wave along with Dylan, Baez and many others, Guthrie's sound is refreshingly distinct and he has his own unique appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a really cool movie. Stunning set design. Like nothing else I've seen. Very original. Good story. Yeap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wierd and trippy, but great","review":"This is definitely a French film. It's very surreal and the first time I watched it I had a little trouble following who was doing what and why. After a few more times though I've got it all straight and, believe it or not, it does all make sense.I'm a big fan of Ron Perlman (as is anybody who's seen Hellboy most likely) and he's wonderful in this. The entire cast is compelling and a joy to watch, even if you're confused. I especially loved Daniel Emilfork as a very sad bad guy.This is probably not the movie for those who don't like quirky humor and surreal visuals, but I loved it. The special effects never look phony but always fit the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very mice","review":"This version is far superior to others I have seen. The remastered videoWas flawless. The dubbed version was much improved over older releases. The sub-titles match the dialogue better than older releases"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"In terms of visual atmosphere, dynamic aesthetics, sheer imagination, and artistically inspirational qualities, this gets 4 stars. The only things keeping it down from the 5 star mark are the occasionally nerve-grating wackiness and the general incoherence of the storyline. The story that *is* there is fairly interesting, but I can certainly say that if Jeunet and Caro put as much into the script and the development of the characters as they did the production design, this might well be the greatest movie ever made. Not that the characters don't work, to an extent, and not that the story doesn't; it's just irritatingly chaotic and intangible at times. Still a must-see. Beware the dubbed version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would've NEVER bought this if considered less than 5 stars","review":"WIERD!! That one word will always attract me to a movie. This movie certainly attracted me. I guess you could say that it is future-Franco-neo-gothic.I absolutely hate the French, but I loved this movie! It was very bizzare, grotesque, fairy-book, & macabre.Although the movie was written by someone from Hollywood (as all movies are, and you know what I think about Hollywood, communist scum) and most likely has some leftist message to it, it still makes you think. Very few movies nowadays encourage anything resembling thought-provoking.Altogether, a jolly good movie. I like the English-dubbed version better, as I despise everything French. I also have BOOKS for reading, and DVD's/VHS for watching. If The City of Lost Children was a book first, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"jacque le blew- this blew!!!!!!!!","review":"i take back my title , maybe this movie just wasn't for everyone. the dubbing was awful, and story just dragged on for too long. but all isn't lost........ the movie is visually stunning!! thats it take it or leave it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weird, yet boring","review":"i tried for about 30 minutes to watch \\"City of Lost Children,\\" but I could not get into it.

A true masterpiece","review":"I had the great honor of seeing this film a few years ago when it was on it's first run in American theaters. I was captivated by the very surreal and dark look of the sets as well as the plot. The look and feel of the movie remiend me of the works by former Monty Python brain, Terry Gilliam (12 monkeys, Brazil, Time Bandits, Baron Munchausin). This movie is definatly worth your time and money, but only see the subtitled version. If you like this, I also recommend Delicatesson (By the same directors), it is kind of hard to find, but if you find a copy buy it, or rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, Eclectic, Dark and Hilarious","review":"Probably the most visually interesting movie to date. Film-making like this might not ever come from the US: it's smart, funny, dark, interesting, very strange. It's brilliant. BUT DO NOT, *I REPEAT*, DO NOT GET THE ENGLISH OR OTHER DUBBED VERSION--see only the subtitled version. The others are terrible.The music is eery and quaint and wonderful. If you truly enjoy movies such as the new \\"Godzilla\\" then you might want to pass this one by. If you liked \\"Cube\\" or \\"Pi\\" or \\"Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai\\" or \\"Baron von Munchausen\\" or \\"Time Bandits\\" or \\"Princess Bride\\" etc. then you will love this one. It's probably better than most if not all of them. Well, Princess Bride is far more quotable (might not be the case if I were French).The colors are just amazing. Talent is perfect. Soundtrack brilliant. Hilarious. Just great. See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real masterpiece!","review":"Rent it. . . Buy it. . . Do what you have to do to see this movie at least once. Really weel done with more surealism than I've ever been able to sit through! Truly worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Weird than Wonderful","review":"I generally enjoy weird, off-center movies. My relatively modest collection of about 30 DVDs includes Brazil, Dark City, 12 Monkeys and Donnie Darko. So when Amazon's algorithm recommended City of Lost Children, I hiked on over to the local video emporium and rented it. I was not entranced.The sets are wild and wonderful. The characters are certainly unique. But somehow, the movie just didn't work for me. Slow pacing and an almost non-existent storyline made it hard for me to sustain any interest. The Dickens-meets-Gilliam atmosphere eventually palled. Finally, about halfway through, I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating","review":"Buyer beware, this film is not for the light hearted not the dim witted. Darkness wrought, this film mixes a delightful solution of French noir with the apokoliptic feel of The Crow:City of Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE, the visuals are STUNNING!!!","review":"This movie is about a man named Krank that cannot have dreams, so he kidnaps children for their dreams but they are afraid of him so they only have nightmares. Well he kidnaps the wrong kid and his big brother, One(a strong man),wants him back. One(Ron Perlman) teams up with Miette a street girl that has to report to her two teachers as well as with the other children that they control. Miette and her fellow street kids go around stealing from pockets and houses and have to report to the two twin teachers or else. Well One and Miette search for Denree, One's little brother, while the twin teahcers are after the jewels that Miette has and didn't give to them. Also they want One for his strength so they can steal more and more. They finally reach the oil rig where Krank lives and operates his evil, and I'll let you watch the rest...a MUST see. Bueatiful, stunning, fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually and emotionally exciting. One of my faves!","review":"The entire cast in this film is fantastic, but then, this director often uses the same great actors. Even the children were great. Ron Perlman is young and very emotive, and the film allows for a blooming human relationship that focuses more of innocent family love than romance (considering the great age difference.) At the same time, it touches on a child's first crush, and the confusion that can bring for one so young.Despite how dark and unsettling the imagery can be at times, the whole film has a very lackadaisical feel to it. Even during serious scenes, the viewer may pleasantly enjoy him/herself.The gadgets are truly intricate; the characters are all memorable; and the script is sometimes hilarious, sometimes narrative, and always very clever.I highly recommend this film to just about everyone. Be aware that there is some very brief nudity, but nothing unacceptable. The subtitles are easy to read, in case that's a concern of yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie-Like a dream","review":"One of the most dreamlike films I've ever seen. Inventive, imaginative, and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fairy tales ever!","review":"This is one of my ultimate favourite movies. The visual effects are simply stunning and the expressions and faces of the characters are incredible (Daniel Emilfork makes Rowan Atchison look like a slacker)! The story line, while a little convoluted, is at least interesting. I feel a little like The Grinch criticizing Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's eerie cinematic genius. The plot is basic: an urban strongman's surrogate \\"little brother\\" is stolen by a group of deranged cyborg-creatures dubbed the cyclops'. In order to get the little boy, Denree, back, the strongman enlists the help of a motley crew of child kleptos. A pact is formed, and the strongman and the children (particularly a girl named Miette... played by the superb Judith Vitet) delve into the dream-like underbelly of the City of Lost Children. If you're at all curious... see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is great, the dubbing sucks!","review":"Ok, the movie is wonderful, but please, please please, do not buy the dubbed version. They didn't get the actors to do their own voices, and well, it leaves so much to be desired. Get the subtitled version! Get the subtitled version! It's got all the depth and wonder that you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMM...","review":"There always has to be one, just one, review which rises to the surface like a fetid sore along side all the sloppy adulation. This is that review. Sorry.Granted, the film is visually opulent, with it's shimmering vistas and expansive dystopia's, but if this is the yardstick against which films should be judged, then Tarsem Singh (The Cell) would be an uber-director by now (with his eye-popping use of religious iconography an the like). Clearly he is not. The film is as empty as a tooth cavity made by too many trips to the sweet shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually interesting, boring otherwise.","review":"I really liked most of the visuals and quirky style. There was a little annoying CGI but done in at least reasonable amounts.As far as being stylized, it was very interesting. I wish it could have been applied to a better story.The acting also was pretty poor by many of the main actors which caused the story to drag even more.It was very nice to look at but the story just bored me.Seeing how popular garbage like the Matrix is just for visual style (with its combination innovative camera work and crappy CGI) minus content, I guess how I can see how this gets such rave reviews.It's visually far superior to the Matrix but at the same level storywise."},{"rating":"2","title":"ingenius","review":"This is quite positively one of my favorite movies. Jean-Pierre Jeunet shows his gift as a director and does a wonderful job of presenting what is a dark story both visually and in plot, in a manner that is light and bordering on the comical. This movie is both beautiful and insightful. See this movie and see his other movies starting with Delicatessen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Out of this world","review":"Not just the story goes on a almost out of this world city even the art direction, the sotry, the casting...I'm not overacting.If you want to see a modern tale this is the right movie.Good argument and dialogs.Some parts have animations and for been 1995 it looks advanced in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cure for boring cinema.","review":"A wonderful creation. If you are a real fan of film, be sure to see this as well as their other films (delicatessen!!!!). Beautiful scenes, mysterious plot, playful cinematografy. Quite a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, visual feast.","review":"Haunting and intriguing are how I would describe this movie. Simply watching the movie is a visual feast, and probably too much to absorb in one viewing. The story is marvelously complex, and the viewer is rewarded in the end for struggling in the beginning to put all the pieces together. This is a fantastic movie, but not one for the timid. I would recommend watching it with the English dub, although it is not as good as the original French, simply to help understanding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but makes you think.","review":"City of Lost Children is a great movie. I have also Watched Delicatessen, which was done by the same people. (Also did Alien Ressurection) It is a science fiction / futuristic movie in which a Man (Krank) Is aging rapidly since he does not dream. He tries to steal and live out dreams from little boys, but things just start to go wrong from there. It is a great movie you will watch time and time again. Ron Perlman plays a great roll in this film. Also If you can't get enough of Dominique Pignon, you will get 5 times more in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baron Munchausen meets Dark City","review":"This is a very interesting film. It has the dark and ominesence type of story, and environment, of Dark City; while still maintaining the more family friendly feel of a film like Baron Munchausen. It actually works quite well. A movie to be recommended to anyone above 8 years old (although it may be a bit frieghtening to some children), this is a well balanced story that captures your attention with a tale of morality, life, and love.As far as the movie itself all aspects are par, nothing jumps put as being particularly special, but you don't notice anything wrong with it either. However, the acting is above average. An important note is also that I have only viewed the French audio version with subtitles, so I cannot comment on the dubbed audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I read other reviews to make sure that I don't repeat anything. As always, a movie cannot satisfy everyone. So I wasn't surprised to see 5 stars as well as 1 stars. I think, personally, that movie is novel and great. If you think Monster Inc was good, here is the parent movie which has the original idea. Pixar simply copied it. TCOLC is a french movie and inherits all its attributes. I pity some reviewers who claim that they like \\"independent and foreign\\" movies. Yes that show off is good but wouldn't make you appreciate a movie. It is not a hollywood movie, so don't expect your typical stuff.-a"},{"rating":"2","title":"A weird movie, a great movie.","review":"This movie has everything- cyborgs,nightmares,clones,talking brains, and in the most non rediculous fashion possible. Its one of those movies I guarantee your friends haven't heared of and you could just sit and watch it and freak out. Its a very weird movie, but its extremeley well thought out and well done. I'd buy it if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for The City of Lost Children","review":"I enjoyed this movie a great deal. It was a surreal look at an alternate timeline that appears to be neither in the future nor in the past.The story is about a circus strongman who is attempting to retrive his younger friend from a group of kidnappers. Along the way he meets orphans, conjoined twins, cyborgs, and clones.If you like movies in the vein of Tim Burton films, or Pan's Labrynth, I belive you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, surreal n' crazy","review":"I enjoyed the film, it was uncanny, bizarre, and colorful. wow. It' was a nice family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hard Film to Love","review":"Jeunet (and Caro) have made some of the most extraordinarily graphically beautiful films of the last 20 years. \\"Amelie\\" virtually defines \\"charming\\" and is easily worth 5 stars (maybe 6). \\"A Very Long Engagement,\\" \\"Delicatessen.\\" even \\"Alien Resurrection\\" -- that's quite a body of work! This was the hardest of them all for me to love -- but I'm still working on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Two Handed Movie","review":"This is definitely a two handed movie. On the one hand, the relationship between One and Miette is beautifully wrought, the sets and art direction are fabulous, the evil Siamese twin sisters are deliciously over the top. (Judith Vittet in the role of Miette is especially noteworthy in that she plays a strong, forceful child without a touch of saccharine. Truly a great performance.) And there is one sequence in which the power of a single tear in a sympathetic universe to stop evil is brilliantly played out.On the other hand the central plot, a mad scientist who steals the dreams of children with a wife who is a midget and who has seven identical sons, is a terrible hash. Who these people are, why they are the way they are, what their relation to their world is (for instance, where do they get the resources to buy stolen children?) is never addressed.The mushiness of central plot keeps this very interesting movie from being more, than \\"interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money!","review":"This gadget will work fine if you're drilling in something like thin baseboard molding, etc. or other light weight stuff.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. My only issue is that after about an hour and a half into a DVD a green spot appears just left of the center of the screen and continues to grow. This is even more pronounced when the DVD remains on pause. This is easily fixed by turning the TV off for a couple of minutes and then turning it back on. Not the biggest issue, but I'm thinking of seeing if I can get this fixed at Best Buy where it's still under the store's warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not ever, EVER buy this TV","review":"I bought this TV a year ago from Best Buy. At first, I was greatly impressed.

I took it to Best Buy, but the warranty had expired, only parts were covered. They wanted half the initial cost of the TV to fix it WITHOUT the parts.

This machine can produce enough volume to be painful in close range, but (at least in the large gymnasium where I tried it) the volume drops very quickly as you move further away. And I don't know exactly how to describe it, but the sound is not satisfying - it's like some range of tones is missing. Yes, there's bass, and you can hear the overall piece that's being played, but the nuance in the middle just isn't there. Have you ever eaten food that's beautiful but tastes like nothing?

The performances by the Philhamonia Hungarica are pointed and delicately etched, but with a reserve of power and virility. The other performances, by the Minneapolis Symphony, are perhaps a bit less authentic sounding but even more suave and musical. The sound engineering is very good, although a bit veiled by the high standards of Mercury Living Presence. In sum, this is a collection to set beside your Willi Boskovsky albums in its joy and authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"good collection","review":"Some rare pieces are put together with more famous ones in this collection of the Mercury Living Presence Label. The first 6 pieces are from a late 50's recording with the Philharmonia Hungarica and the other 3 are added as a sort of bonus with the Minneapolis Symphony. All goes well under Dorati who finds sure amusement in this repertoire. The listings are 1) Lehar - Waltz from Merry Widow / 2) Kalman - The Gypsy Princess Waltz / 3) Joseph Strauss - Village Swallows / 4) Dohnanyi - Wedding Waltz from The Veil of Pierette / 5) Waldteufel - Skaters Waltz / 6) Joseph Lanner - Die Schonbrunner (with Philharmonia Hungarica) then 7) Johann Strauss Jr - Voices of Spring / 8) Joseph Strauss - Aquarellen Waltzer / 9)Eduard Strauss - Doctrinen Waltzer (with Minneapolis Symphony)Worth the money every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike anything else I've seen","review":"Simply one of the most nervy, discomforting, yet fascinating documentaries I've seen.

Additionally, while working I was much closer to the contact cement than was the filter, so whatever got to the filter had to pass by me first.

Details do enhance a novel, but there were so many tedious details that did nothing to advance the plot. Most of the sentences were choppy, and there were inumerable fragments.Ms. Lee seems like she could have a future as an author, but her writing needs much more polishing.

Had I not looked at the back cover itself, and browsed the pages, I would not have noticed the heavy handed religious nature of this book. There is certainly a market for such items, but they should be clearly described as such by the seller - which this one is not. Jesus does not reside in my kitchen, or anywhere else in my home for that matter, therefore this cookbook will not find it's way onto my shelf.

It taught me more about Africa than I would have learned in any one semester course - from the early navigational schools of the Portugese and the inability of early sailing ships to tack and sail south, to Stanley and Livingston (whom I had always thought to be a missionary and not the explorer he is portayed as in this book) and on to Leopold's desire to carve his own little fiefdom, the Belgian Congo, which not even the Belgians wanted. For anyone wanting to educate themselves on the history of Africa this is a must read - educational, erudite, and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River Congo","review":"One of the most fascinating history books that I have ever read.

Kind of a Dr. John of the North."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR DANCERS IN LOVE","review":"This album is not recommended unless you have a guy or girl who loves you so much and would love to dance,especially slowdance. It's like a high school senior attending the prom. Just imagine the HS senior elegantly dressed as is his/her date. They're holding each other,gently swaying to music like the music on this album.

The control Pepe has over his rasgueados (flourish-like effect produced by the fingers of the right hand)and tremelos is by far the best I have ever heard. His flamenco playing makes you want to get out and learn the steps yourself just to see what he's projecting. The only place where the recording is \\"iffy\\" is his duet with his father. It's a little shaky but hardly noticeable, could even be the arrangement itself. The very last piece, a duet with his brother Angel, is my very favorite. Played with some kind of double-stinged instrument (like a twelve sting guitar but different somehow) is had a very thick, beautiful quality to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unfortuntely, this was one of my first encounters with the \\"flamenco guitar\\" and I have to say that it made me look away from flamenco for many years.

I haven't had any problems with it. I am using it for my school papers and it works great to transfer from computer to computer. It is easy to use and understand. It allows you to just drag files and drop them. It also comes with a longer cord that you plug into the usb port so that it is easier for computers that don't have a usb port in the front of them. It also comes with McAfee securety which is what I currently use on my computer for virus protection and I love it. It works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hiss than an angry cat","review":"The content on this disc is hard to beat. It has a good number of solid, desirable tracks - many of which are difficult to find on other compilations. This is the only reason I gave it two stars. But there's one BIG problem...I have NEVER heard sound this bad off a pre-recorded CD before. Even in the first track, you don't have to listen very deeply to hear scratches and pops. And some of the titles have so much hiss in the background, you'd swear you were listening to a half-worn cassette tape. When I first put this disc in, I started checking the speakers because I thought something was awry with my system. Nope - just dreadful sound from the disc. It literally sounds like someone dubbed the songs from LP to cassette and then over again to compact disc.This one isn't digitally remastered, it's belt-sanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light viewing","review":"I enjoyed this light movie.

I thought I was going to hear the unique sound of a four high caliber guitarists playing as a quartet. Its actually a collection of solos, some duets, with only a couple pieces where its evident 3 or more are playing. And, while the performances were technically excellent, most seemed somewhat flat and lacked the personality expected of the classical guitar. Many of the pieces are 16th and early 17th century pre-Baroque works. The saving grace is the Mercury \\"Living Presence\\" mastered recording, reknown for acoustic quality.

Last year, while visting my parents I happened to look at it. I was amazed at the great information it contains. It has hundreds of ideas on getting into better condition. I kept thinking if I had only known this stuff when I wrestled in high school and college what a difference it would have made. I have incorporated a lot of the information it contains in my workouts and have had a lot of success with it.

It comes to my son's nose when he is sitting up and they are both on the ground. This is not a toy that can easily fit into a diaper bag or large purse and go. The bigger size does mean that the tags are easier to grab onto since they are larger.I think I will be letting my daughter have the giraffe if she wants it and I'll order the lion or zebra for my son and see if they are a bit smaller.Overall, I think it is very cute and I think my son will enjoy it.

The music makes your ribs crack not only because of the noisy, thickly composed screaming metal-banging music, but also the immediate juxtaposition of wild noise & some of Thirlwell's quintissentially Thirlwell modern classical pieces. There's also a blues song (with very poetic lyrics, I might add as a well-read poet), & some tabla drumming. This crazy experimental music can be pretty catchy, too, if you ask me -- especially the 4th & 5th songs. Or anyways. I mean. I like those songs a lot. It's also pretty incredible that Thaw is so radically different as a whole from the Foetus album that preceeded it: Nail, also wonderful music.

Strings creates a wonderful lush sound, and the prominent, yet not overbearing, bass line helps maintain focus. 33.3's debut is a great listen no matter where you are or what you're doing--working, studying, driving, relaxing.

The movie is funny and poignant and, although, offensive to just about every group of people, it's light and hopeful at the same time. A gem of a movie and a definitely deserving of its Sundance win."},{"rating":"2","title":"She cried...","review":"My sister had been looking for this dvd for a long while so I ordered it for her for Christmas, she was so happy she cried. It's a sweet movie. It got there on time and in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"an entertaining little story with likeable characters","review":"While I don't think this movie will blow anyone away, I do think it's a good story (based on a long short story or novella, by Etgar Keret - whose short stories I highly, highly recommend)and an interesting take on suicide. By focusing on the humorously monotonous afterlives of a couple characters (all of whom are very likeable) and then adding an eccentric Tom Waits (another genuius whose body of work I highly recommend)we get a unique take on suicide, friendship, love, life and afterlife. If you're the increasingly rare type who can enjoy a movie without supermodels and explosions, then I think you'll probably enjoy Wristcutters - A love story.Oh, and as an added bonus, the music of gogol bordello makes up a large part of the soundtrack (this movie actually served as my introduction to both Keret and Gogol - and by proxy Eugene Hutz... yet another genius)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie.","review":"While the production standards for this indie film where not very high, it is remarkably original, witty and endearing.

I picked it up earlier this week as Hollywood Video had a copy for three bucks, and I can't begin to express what a good value for the dollar that was. Shannyn Sossamon here is charming and electric, and Fugit reminds you of all the potential he exhibited in \\"Almost Famous,\\" before shrinking into the Hollywood background. The two work really well together and the whole, strange plot beat about never being able to smile was both an intellectually challenging exercise for the actors, surely, and really reminded you what a beautiful smile Sossamon has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastish?? Epic Movie","review":"I came across the movie when I was looking through Hulu. Thought I'd watch it. Turned out to be one of my favorite movies ever. It shows that even though you're life might suck, life on the other side after committing suicide isn't much better, if not worse. It's a different kind of movie but once you watch it, you can't stop. Don't let the title fool you.

Josh believes you should be at the church whenever the doors are open, and if you are not there, you are living in sin. Come on, it's easy to be at every single church function when that's your job and you have Mondays off!One big contradiction is that Josh later talks about how important it is that we reach out to people. So, when we're doing church activities when our time is free, when do we reach out? I think this book is similar to I Kissed Dating Goodbye. It's filled with lots of personal opinions with shallow scriptural references. There are some good ideas, but keep in mind they are all opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug Into a Church!","review":"After reading this book, I really came to realizing that it's not about what the church offers for me, but what I can offer for the church. I came to understand that experiencing the full power of the Body meant to plug into it yourself and follow the Spirit in whatever it may tell you to do. Looking for all the small details in a church shouldn't be the defining point in finding a family of God that you can dive in with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"We are using this book with our Singles group at our church.

Collectables is nice enough to package 2 original albums on 1 CD; it's too bad they didn't bother to do a decent remaster or give any consideration to the packaging.

But I was just flat-out disappointed by Fanny and Alexander after reading so many glowing reviews about it. Perhaps it's the subject matter that doesn't appeal to me. I've never been a big fan of movies that delve into the insipid world of the bourgeois elite. I certainly don't mind slow-paced films that explore the subtleties of life, sans fiery explosions and gratuitous car chases, but that doesn't mean slow-paced films can't be boring and tedious.I would take exception with anyone who says they don't have at least one Bergman film that doesn't do it for them, and Fanny/Alexander is that film for me. That doesn't make it a bad movie; to each his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This was the first Ingmar Bergman film that I have seen, and I am now an instant fan. This movie is much like an epic film about the fictional Ekdahl family in Sweden. This movie is very long, but I would not say it was too long. In fact, when it was over, it left me wanting more. This movie does an excellent job of developing the characters and making you relate to their situations. Overall, a very entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Superior to Original Theatrical Version","review":"The longer TV series included in this set is far superior to the theatrical version. One of the five disks is a new HD transfer of the original theatrical edition so you get it all. If it is available, buy this set. Used sets are a particular value. You won't be sorry.I consider this, Bergman's last major film, to be his finest and perhaps one of the best films ever made. Because it is Bergman's writing and directing, the theatrical values are excellent. It has an all star Swedish cast who turn in outstanding performances. I don't usually comment on subtitles. Whoever wrote these has a wonderful grasp of the subtleties of the English language.All in all, one hell of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criterion review","review":"I *LOVE* this film.I just *HATE* Criterion refuses to include spanish subtitles in their products.

It is boring. The director completely went off focus. After viewing the movie, one wonders why it is titled \\"Fanny and Alexander\\". The movie was more about the family than about these two kids. I bet the people who gave 5 star rating would have a difficult time to describe the characters of Fanny and Alexander, except they were lovely and adorable. But most of the movie was spent on showing lavish lifestyle of the family, with many unnecessary stories inserted. And those stories had nothing to do with Fanny and Alexander. Terrible! Terrible. I know the director was a BIG shot guy. But he definitely dropped the ball here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I am a huge foreign film fan, and thought myself in for a treat when I finally got to watch it. I had read the reviews and Oscar hype. I was gravely disappointed. I'm sorry, but I just didn't get it. This is one of the most confusing films I have ever seen. If this is Ingmar Bergan's signature work, I'll never watch another one of his films. I think I'll stick with Ang Lee and Pedro Almodovar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dull Dull","review":"I really wanted to like this movie and I really thought it would have some sort of enlightening climax but was disappointed to find out it barely had a point.

It is bewildering to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite horrible","review":"This movie is quite horrible, just as horrible as Bergman's own experience with these people I guess. Given the \\"realism\\" of this movie it is very useful in order to avoid all the crazy, oppressive people described in it. Moreover, it could be useful to create change within Norwegian society. It is political in that way. The family described here is no better than the one in \\"Texas Chainsaw\\".

I would deam this most inapprpriate viewing with company of any kind. I purchased this based on it's recomendation as a Christmas film. IT IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE!

He has a glove on the back so he's easy to manipulate. Princess, Prince, Queen and King are different however. You put your thumb in one sleeve, your pinky in the other sleeve and your index or middle finger in the head in order to make the puppet move. It is not very easy. It is almost impossible for my 7 year old to move the puppet because her hand is so small that the span between thumb and pinky doesn't reach the sleeves/hands of the puppet. I'm not sure why all the 5 star reviews. We have the Prince with the blue cape and crown (old model). I am not sure if they improved him and made him more like the Pirate (who has a glove on the back) or not. But I wouldn't buy them the way they are if I've seen them in the store.

It examines the personalities and characters of the principal persons, as well as the political, military, diplomatic, and domestic happenings caused by these persons. Maps are included to illustrate the military movements of forces throughout the war. Using a narrative style it is compelling reading. If I have one complaint it is that as such a deep examination of the war it includes many personas, and remembering on which side of the conflict all of them were is a challenge, and it is up to the reader to make any sort of character list that might aid in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelby Foote Civil War Narrative","review":"For those who are interested in the Civil War and hungry to learn more about the chronology of events, the three volume series by Shelby Foote really hits the mark. At 2,800+ pages for all three volumes, it is not for those with just a casual interest. I am not an avid reader, but find myself pouring through the book with a U.S. atlas and my laptop close at hand (the National Park service has a website that is useful in providing even more detail)."},{"rating":"2","title":"North and South go at it.","review":"Shelby Foote knows his stuff. Over 800 pages of exciting Civil War action, from the secession crisis of early 1861 to the inauguration of Mississippian Senator Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederate States. From Yankee disaster at First Manassas to Robert E. Lee's embarrassing debut in western Virginia. From riverboat actions on the Mississippi and its tributaries, to George McClellan's snail-like movement up the York-James Peninsula toward Richmond. And on and on, until October 1862, when the Confederacy retreats from failed invasions of Kentucky and Maryland.As I said, Foote knows what he is writing about. He has plenty of stories to tell about the first two years of the Civil War, and he'll keep the reader busy with his storytelling. Along with James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom and Bruce Catton's work on the Army of the Potomac, Foote's Civil War Narrative belongs on the shelf of every Civil War enthusiast, this volume as well as the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding History","review":"I can't praise this book enough. It combines a good grasp of history with a fascinating narrative style. Although it is probably too long for the casual reader, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long long long hard read....","review":"Well I can say that this is the most difficult Civil War book I have read. It has taken me a lot to read it all the way through. Mr. Foote's style of writing is very dry and dull. It will flow nice but then it gets long and well very boring to read. I have had this book for well over a year, I have picked it up read some got very bored with it put it down, then pick it up a again. I have been told that the whole 3 volume series is a must read, I must say that if you can sit down and conqur this, you were dedicated. I myself cannot. It is very detailed in almost every angle of the begining of the war. The book covers all theaters of the war, though it jumps around. Would I consider this a must read for a Civil War Buff as my self....well....I leave that up to the you! I have been looking at this 3 volume set for many many years, I think it will sit in my libaray for many many more years to come. Yes it has earned a spot in the CW classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging!","review":"Well, I finally finished all three volumes in audiobook format (150hrs listening). It is a very engaging account of the war. I found I often just want to jogging a bit more to listen it.There is enough acclimation about the books and I would not repeat most others' comment. Two things might be a little special for me. I really like the account of the back-stage maneuvering of politics of Lincoln, against Seward, against Chase, etc. It is not mentioned much in other civil war books and I found very interesting to learn about. The other is the emphasis on Jefferson Davis. The author put him in a center position as counterpart of Lincoln. Personally, I feel due to the structures of the South government and the dominant role of R E Lee w/ Army of Northern Virginia, he does not weigh as heavy for the war as Lincoln and maybe does not deserves so many pages.All in all, I like the books. It is long, but really worth reading/listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, In Depth","review":"First, I love Shelby Foote. I have seen him as a commentator in many documentaries. I would love to give him a Five star rating for this treatise, but I can't . I am absorbed with the civil war, but I got bogged down in the minutiae of this account. Sorry. For a historian, it would be a great read! I'm not a historian and I prefer the writing style of Jeff Shaara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good level of detail","review":"Well written narrative of 1861 - 1862 part of the American Civil War with some back story.

She loves it.Also, she has bad arthritis in her hands, and she has had no problem with the tactile response of the keys. Oh, and it was no problem getting the shortcut keys to launch internet, email, etc. That's really nice for someone who has a hard time navigating the desktop.So, yes, it's primarily built for Windows-PCs, but it works great for Mac users as well.

She likes the white font on the keys, which seems obvious but some keyboards have their symbols or numbers colored so that they are hard to see in the dark. Didn't need to use the driver disk as she doesn't use the extra function keys, and Windows detected it automatically. The keys don't type as smoothly as a laptop keyboard, but that's to be expected.

They don't glide up and down as nicely as other keyboards. At first, it seems no big deal, but over time you notice typos, and it turns out to be a big hassle.Special purpose keys: quite handy, especially Sleep and Volume buttons, although the Wake button doesn't seem to work with his Dell PC.Wear: Under light use there has been no problem with wear. The markings are surface painted, not embedded in the keys, so I suppose there could be a wear issue if heavily used.The painted-on key markings are reasonably crisp and uniform, but not perfect.There are some competing keyboards on amazon, probably worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Julia said","review":"Just a short note to echo the previous 1 star poster.I had the same experience, but I gave up after 3 keyboards.

A boy is accidentally locked in the back of a moving van driven by two killers. A nosy neighbor saw him with a derelict in the park (John Carradine), leading everyone in the wrong direction while the boy witnesses the drivers burying their victim. The situation, similar to The Window (1949), or Home Alone without the comedy, is very suspenseful due to good acting (especially by Harry Dean Stanton & the boy, played by Danny Martins), noir -ish cinematography, and effective direction, and despite a low production cost, the only effect of which is slightly faded color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run very small!!!!!","review":"This is a good pair of capris but they run very small for size Order larger than normal size!!!!@"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this show","review":"Pinwheel was an incredible show!!!!

With the introduction of Visual Studio 2005, release 2.0 of the .NET framework, Small Business Server R2 and most recently Vista the material is badly outdated.[...] As with other items written by Microsoft marketing staff, it is heavy on coverage, light on technical information and hard to use.

The font size appears to be half that of other books on my shelf... I mean it's small. I am not sure I'll really be able to read this book due to the small font size, though I plan to try reading it in small doses. I can't imagine why they would have done this. Honestly, I would have been happy to have paid a little more for the additional paper that would have been needed to use a readable font size. I can't really rate this as it is so hard to read (so I have not read it), and content doesn't do much good if it is a struggle to see it.

I have bought this book for all of my friends who have or plan to have children, and I plan to read my own copy over and over, as I raise my own.

I like her shows, and have previously tried two of her recipes (made one myself, tasted someone else's) which I both liked. The recipes in this book looked enticing and not too complicated. But the amounts and cooking times are off. There is so little fat that you are not frying or baking, yet not enough liquid to stew. So food burns easily. Nothing gets salted until the very end, and thus is not as tasty as it could be. If you cook with perfect, freshest ingredients (which Martha always recommends), maybe the results will be better. But I do not live in Napa Valley, and my ingredients, even those bought in expensive organic supermarkets, don't do the trick. Want healthy *and* tasty?

However, if a cook has been cooking for a while, then the recipes in this book could be inspiring.Note: There are not photos for every single recipe but enough photos to inspire. So, if you need many photos, then this book may dissapoint. Also, the title is deceiving because I found some of the recipes to not be very QUICK!NOTE: Some of the recipes require using ingredients that most people might find \\"non-standard\\". In other words, some of the ingredients require a more advanced palate because they are not your average store-bought (and easy to find) supermarket ingredient.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone (male or female) interested in attending a military college/academy whether it is The Citadel, USMA, USNA, or USAFA. The stories told throughout the book are relevant to each of the academies as well as other military colleges. It captures the spirit, comraderie, and challenges inherent to military colleges. It will prepare a young adult for the \\"unknown\\" trials they will face upon entering one of these schools. Additionally, adults who have had this experience will find humor in the stories related."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"Despite the fact that this book has received glowing reviews from other readers I beg to differ.Mace's story is superficial and something you can probably compile from recruitment material that The Citadel, VMI, USMA, USNA, and USAFA doles out to prosective cadets/midshipmen. Her story lacks any kind of analysis or deeper thoughts. Just a rambling about what happened to her and the The Citadel class of 2002 during their Knob year.A military college/service academy is one strange and fascinating place both in its philosophy and rituals. Mace fails to really capture any of it.Since I am totally butchering this book I should give an alternative: \\"Victor Padrini - a novel of the US Air Force Academy\\" by Mark Pizzimenti is a much more interesting read and \\"spoke\\" to me, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, a whole lot more than Mace's bland attempt at a \\"hoorah\\" for her school."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest cadet ever! (According to the writer)","review":"This book is as vapid as it is untruthful. I have never seen anyone praise themselves so blatantly. This ghost-written book is nothing more than a collection of outtakes from the cadet manual, and random stories.I am a graduate of this institution, and have nothing against the fact that it is now coed. But it should be noted that Petra Lovetinska, mentioned briefly as a roommate, was the first female to spend four years at The Citadel as opposed to the author's three. Petra made it through on her own accord, and her daddy wasn't the commandant. You also don't see her writing a book about how she single-handedly revolutionized the Corps of Cadets. Thank God for Nancy Mace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Ticket to Ride","review":"I graduated from this wonderful institution known to all as The Citadel, to some as Pure Hell, and to the Mace's as their fumbling fortress. It is a total sham, everything in that book except for the names and locations. Those are true, but unless you were there at that time, or there at all, you will never get the truth. Conroy's Lord's of Discipline held more legitimacy than this book. And we all know when a book is written by 2 people, the first person spoke and the second person actually wrote.There has yet to be a truly accurate depiction of The Citadel- maybe someone with a little bit of INTEGRITY (part of what the Citadel stresses) will set the facts straight. Until then, this book may give a few good laughs, but all in all, its more of a wive's tale than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another high quality Logitech Product","review":"Easy installation, worked right out of the box.

One of the \\"must haves\\" was a headphones jack on the speaker so I don't have to reach down behind the tower when I start a recording session and want to plug in my cans.One interesting feature that I will likely never use (but someone might) is what appears to be an input jack so that someone can play an MP3 player directly through the speakers without disconnecting them from the PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left speaker buzz; Logitech shipped replacement which works fine","review":"I bought a pair of these 3 months ago.

That cured our problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toughest speakers i've owned","review":"I ordered these speakers June 18, 2007 for $30, I figured they deserved a review for still playing like new.They have received semi-daily use for the last five and a half years.I must have dropped them over a dozen times, no signs of damage (other then some cosmetic scuffs and dents)They are by no means audiophile speakers, but they do have a great sound for $25.Clear highs and mids, but the bass is sometimes lacking.I have a 5.1 system hooked up through an optical cable for watching movies and listening to FLACS.I use these speakers for youtube videos, the occasional tv show, games, and mp3 music.If you are looking for a great pair of speakers that are tough and have a pretty great sound, buy em'I'll post an update in 5 more years, provided the world doesn't end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich C","review":"Shopped around and was mixed on what really to buy, I have had several brands in the past all of which worked well, Wasnt really looking to spend a lot, Once again read the reveiws and these speakers seem to rate well, The the sound is pretty good and the volume is plenty loud for me, The overall quailty seems good.Overall pleased with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"These speakers are proof that you don't have to spend a fortune for computer speakers to get very good reliable sound. The are powerful and substantially built. We are very happy with the product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech x-140 Speakers","review":"I love these speakers! The sound quality is great and they are perfect for use in my home office. They are a little big for the space I have to work with, but they sound so good I wouldn't trade them for a smaller speaker. I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Speakers -- Welcome Sounds","review":"We purchased these to boost up the weak, tinny sound that came from the small flat-screen that we purchased for use in our bedroom. The design matches the TV itself very well, the installation and setup was ridiculously easy, and the performance boost is much more than merely welcomed. The only change to this product I'd suggest is to dim down or make smaller the amber \\"Power On\\" light, optimally making it smaller and a dimmer green LED; the brightness might irritate or distract some folks. We haven't yet used them as computer speakers, which I gather is there primary purpose, but have no doubt they'd be good there also. We have hooked iPods and our iPad up to them and they've worked very very well for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Speakers","review":"These speakers are great at their purpose - small, unobtrusive speakers to provide some middle-of-the-road sound - they don't carry heavy bass and of course they don't have a subwoofer, but they provide surprisingly good sound given the low price tag and size.I bought these to replace a larger system on a computer as I no longer listened to music or watched movies on the computer and didn't need to take up that extra space with a full speaker+sub system. The angled design of these speakers makes it easier to fit them just behind the sides of my monitor, and the position of the knobs makes it convenient to reach underneath the front corner of the monitor and turn the speakers on and off.All in all, these are well-designed, well-priced, and will serve their purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive sound and volume","review":"Bought these based on the Amazon reviews to replace an 8-year old pair of fantastic low-end Harmon Kardon speakers that kicked the bucket. Very disappointed in these speakers. Sound has a tinny echo and sounds muffled, and changing 'tone' doesn't fix it, nor does multiple output devices (laptops, iPod, etc). Also, even with computer output volume at max, we still have to turn up the speakers to at least 50% volume or higher. Lastly, these are quite large for computer speakers, not small or unobtrusive. I don't even care too much about the size, more how horrible they sound. I wouldn't recommend buying these at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best that they have","review":"Sound quality is poor compared to the same product i have had for over 5 years now. These speakers are slow to respond, sound tinny, and out of the blue the bass will come alive all on its own. Volume switch has to be cranked to the halfway point just to get a peep out of them. The item description doesn't say it but I suspect that these speakers have been poorly refurbished. And therefore really put a dim light on any other Logitech purchase I will make in the future. Because it seems they are getting to be more of a Wal-Mart made in China brand than the quality product of past purchases. My best advice find a different product, even if you have to spend more, you will be happier elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Customer Support from Logitech when they don't work","review":"I've purchased Logitech's X140 speakers and they didn't work within a week of purchase. They have to be turned up all of the way before a low tinny noise comes out, but there's almost no volume working. I then went to Logitech's website, which doesn't list the speakers at all in their technical support. I finally located the manual on the speakers, but found the file was corrupted when I tried to download. I went to their 'Contact Us' page, filled out a long form about the issue the speakers where having. Once complete they then force you to sign up for a new account before you can submit the issue to their customer service. You shouldn't have to give up your personal information in return for customer service. Absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bass on these is terrible","review":"With so many people rating this product so high, I thought is was getting a higher quality product for a great price. Well, you get what you pay for and these sound terrible, especially the bass. If you need cheap speakers for your small children to play games, then these are probably ok, but if you want to listen to music, these are not the speakers for you. They sounded so bad that I called Logitech thinking that I just received a bad pair. They were very customer friendly and sent me a new pair, but they sounded just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a good idea","review":"The speakers arrived DOA. Just got a buzzing sound from them. I tested the computer with known good speakers and everything worked. So these were DOA. Seems like poor quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Don't buy it. these speakers have an integrated power supply with the amplifier circuit. I heard a constant buzz from both speakers whenever the speakers turn on louder or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying hum/buzz is too annoying","review":"If these are going to sit on your desk, the constant BUZZ is too loud and annoying.The hum continues even if the volume is all the way down; it's a power supply issue, not an issue with the input signal. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great speakers","review":"I bought these speakers to use with a new laptop. They sound really good and are a great value. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work initially, so quality is questionable","review":"I was probably just unlucky, but these did not work initially when I received them. After shaking them and whacking them several times, they began functioning and have worked fine ever since (about 6 months). I decided not to send them back for replacement due to the hassle. However, I'm obviously concerned they will fail again.Other than the lack of reliability, I have no complaints. The quality is fine. They create plenty of sound for computer speakers, look nice, and don't take up too much space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming & Returned","review":"I was looking for a pair of speakers for use with my laptop. The sound quality wasn't nearly as good as what I expected based upon other reviews here, but what really frustrated me was the loud buzz that emanated from these speakers whenever they were powered on. No matter where I plugged them in or what was plugged into them they buzzed loudly.I'm wondering if the problem isn't with interference from the integrated power adapter since I've never had this problem with other PC speakers that do have an external wall-wart style adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money...great bargain","review":"the speakers are well worth the money....loud and clear in sound........they are no frills but that is exactly what I wanted.....no frills and quality for the cost"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for the price, size, and lack of (sub)woofers","review":"I received these today, and they had some scratches on them. Considering how cheap these speakers are, I didn't care enough to complain to Amazon about the scratches. They work just fine anyway.In regards to sound, specifically, bass, you could probably get better speakers for the price. Like one of those speaker sets with a subwoofer. The reason I didn't is because I move a lot, so I skipped those that included anything more than two small speakers.Overall, still a worthwhile purchase if you are limited in space and budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers for the Price","review":"I purchased these speakers thinking they will be adequate for my needs. I have found them to be Terrific in both sound quality and in the way they look. They add a modern feel and look to my home office, and sound great. Produces a very nice sound with good base and are very good for listening to music, watching movies or playing games.Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I bought these for $15, and they're very underwhelming.Pros:$15 (would not pay more)Cons:Big - they won't fit behind your monitor unless you move it forward. I personally don't care about this, but I see many others who would like to put their speakers behind their monitor.Sound - they sound very tinny. I've had them on for about three hours, just in case there was a burn in period. They still sound tinny.For $15, I won't complain too much, but I would NOT pay more for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PC Speakers at a Great Price","review":"I wavered back and forth between this model and other, cheaper speakers to replace my desktop PC speakers for several weeks. I'm really glad I went with these. Perhaps one of the best parts about them is the auxiliary plug in - which means that I can plug in my MP3 player and listen, even if the computer isn't even turned on. They are plenty loud for PC speakers, they sound great, and they're just the right size. They also look great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"These Logitech speakers look and feel good quality, but they have a loud hum when plugged into the line jack. My previous speakers did not have this issue. The bass speakers had a great amount of static when playing music. I am returning them and will not buy Logitech speakers again. If you want good quality, you will need to spend more money on a better brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for the price.","review":"All in all a very good purchase. Sound is good, and they look nice. Only complaint is that the volume and tone knobs, on my set of speakers at least, feel a little flimsy. The volume knob especially encounters a lot of friction when turned more than about 1/2 up to max and feels like it might come off. But so far that hasn't happened, so I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Logitech, but....","review":"I bought these for my massage office. I read all the reviews that said the volume was poor. I thought since I was using them for \\"light music\\" in the office they would work fine. I had always had good luck with logitech. When I played my mp3 with them I had to turn it up to full volume and if you walked more than 5 ft. away, you could not distinguish the song playing. I plugged my son's Itouch into them and the sound was a little better (louder) still had to have the volume ALL the way up. The radio was slightly better than the mp3, but worse than the itouch. I plan to send them back. Very disappointed, because always liked the brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Speakers Big Sound","review":"I have bought TWO sets of these speakers. I have taken them to work with me and they are great. I needed a set of speakers to be louder than the background noise and these do it. The price is incredible and I am able to play them at high volumes for long periods of time without any ill effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good buy","review":"I really liked the speakers. Its very good for music. Though I am not an audiophile and I haven't had a luck at higher end speakers, this one reproduces the tonal quality really well. I haven't given 5 star because the voice (as in speech) is not reproduced well. Maybe not the best for movies.

I've purchased their speakers before and I found that, for the most part, they at least sounded decent. These sounded absolutely awful.

My laptop speakers sound better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and simple","review":"I was looking to add some additional sound and bass to my 26\\" TV, especially for my games. Saw these, tried them out and picked them up. I did NOT want a complicated and expensive surround setup and I also sought to keep the wire clutter to a minimum. This set did the trick.What really attracted me to these particular speakers were the nice, sleek design, as it did compliment my TV. I was also happy with the fact that with this unit there is no bulky AC adapter, but instead a \\"standard\\" plug.I plugged it in and the sound was impressive, to say the least. I can also hookup my IPOD for some extra sound and not a lot of money out of pocket.If you want something simple, yet sturdy and inexpensive, look no further than these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound","review":"I didn't have huge expectations for these speakers - I realize that they were at the entry-level price point - but these are horrible! I have to turn the volume up on the computer, itunes, and the speakers in order to hear anything. I liked the fact that they had an input on the speaker and that you could turn them off without unplugging them. I wish they were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Most - Especially For The Price","review":"For the price: These are tough, sturdy attractive looking speakers. In fact, better than most. The treble is excellent and the mid-range is near perfect. The bass is a high-bass, so don't expect your desk to rumble, but the overall quality of sound is very good. There is distortion after a turn of the dial. The orange \\"on\\" light is a bit bright (I'd prefer blue or green, but that is a minor concern). The volume control does make a pronounced difference in loudness (most speakers systems don't), but the tone control varies only in the absence of bass. It is easy to set up and there is a convenient headphone jack and a single male plug for external music sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving!","review":"Please be aware...these speakers have an integrated power supply that is very susceptible to outside interference. I heard a constant buzz/hum from the left speaker (where the power supply is located) whenever the speakers were turned on.However, by looking at some of these other reviews, it does seem that others had a positive experience with the X-140s.

The sound quality is slightly better then a set of OEM Polk speakers I was given. I recently moved to a much smaller house and didn't think I needed the sound for the larger X-5500 speakers. The X-140 sound very tinny and if you turn the volume anywhere about a quarter turn, you start to get distortion. I would keep looking if I had had a chance to try these first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphone hiss, short speaker wires and mediocre sound.","review":"I have a pretty specific list of requirements for desktop speakers. My work computer has a broken headphone jack in the front, so i have to use the one in the back. These were to double as an extension cord for my headphones. Also I have four monitors, from the left to right monitor it's about 3.5 feet. I need the speakers to reach from that distance. Finally, i'm no audiofile, but I like the speakers to sound ok.These do none of those.- The speaker cable between the left and right modules is bout 2 feet, to short to go on both sides of my monitors.- The headphone jack has a constant hiss coming out of it.- The sound quality is pretty sub par.- Also they are quite large, I could possibly fit them under my monitors if they were less then 4\\" high, but they are more like 7\\" high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value but ...","review":"The last 2.0 computer speakers I bought were the Creative Labs I-Trigue 2200. I really liked them but the wallwart power supply gave out and 18VAC replacements are impossible to find.This looked like a reasonably priced alternative since I am no audiophile and the sound is quite good (though not as good as the ones they're replacing).The part I don't like, and the reason for the \\"but\\", is that all wires are hardwired! Not one of the power into the right speaker, the wire from it to the left speaker or the audio-in wire can be detached, and are therefore not replaceable, at least not easily :-(You don't see that in the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Budget 2.0 Speakers","review":"All I wanted were simple, good quality, and good sounding speakers. That is what I got. For their price, these are an excellent value. The sound quality is very good though not audiophile quality of course. These are good for gaming or listening to music with. I could tell they were good quality when I was unboxing them since they were rather hefty (rule of thumb: light weighing speakers are usually lower quality). I'm very pleased with these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issue - every beat buzzes; this one's going back.","review":"I have a Logitech 2.1 setup (the Z-4 I think) and have been happy with the performance. We needed a smaller 2.0 set for another computer, and got the X-140 based on the positive reviews.We must have gotten a lemon, because there's an annoying buzz in the right-side speaker, like distortion on every beat. Sounds like a torn speaker. Also overall volume is very weak - need to turn it up 2/3rds for a decent listening level, and then the distortion problem is far worse.From what we can tell, buzzing aside, the sound quality is mediocre at best. Again, it may just be that our unit is defective and not like the others; but honestly these don't sound much better than the \\"free\\" garbage speakers that came with PCs a decade ago.We plugged the Z-4 into the new computer and everything was as expected, so it's clearly the X-140 that's causing the problem. We're returning it for a refund and won't take a chance with the cheaper Logitech units again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good speakers","review":"These speakers are easy to set up and use.

I am surprised that such good speakers aren't very expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly shielded design","review":"I bought these speakers to use with my MacBook Pro about a year ago. The sound quality is pretty good for when you're sitting at the desk; the bass is decent, and the trebles sound crisp. However, the speakers consistently pick up signals from area radio stations and other hums/buzzes; this happens regardless of whether they are plugged into the computer or not, so it seems to be the speakers themselves that are poorly shielded and picking up these signals. At times, it's loud enough to be quite audible and quite distracting.

That is especially true for those programs and DVD's that have the soundtrack and the ambient noises louder than the conversations. With these speakers, you won't miss what the characters are saying. There are probably various ways to attach these speakers to a TV, but we have just plugged the mini into the headphone jack.

I was not looking for the best sound quality; just something that would deliver sound/ music, simple with no frills. The speakers have only been used about 10 or 12 times, and one speaker just died last week. I would like to blame the blow-out on excessive audio levels, but that was not the case. One speaker just died for no obvious reason - end of story. I would suggest that anyone looking for a cheap set of speakers go with another brand. I would gladly return these to Amazon, but the product fizzled well after the return window, which expired on Jan. 31, 2011."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bookshelf computer speakers","review":"Much better than the $6.99/pair previously used.

They replace the speakers that I bought with my Dell system 6 years ago that included a powered sub-woofer that died. Honestly, I can't hear the difference, and because the sub-woofer is gone I now have a little more room on my desk. I thought they would be a little smaller and was surprised at their size. I don't remember if there was any size specs on the advertisement. Very good sound and I'm quite happy with the purchase. May not be high end but are fine for my purposes. Volume and tone controls work well and there is even a headphone jack if you can't get to the one on your computer.

Seem to be well made.I did not like the fact that they are hard wired to each other. There is no power brick & that is a plus. Unfortunately there is only one tone control instead of bass and treble. They sound pretty thin without bumping up the tone. Too much & they just sound muddy.Pretty big speakers. Bigger than I was expecting but I have room on my desktop for that.Can plug an MP3 player into them directly but I can just play stuff off of iTunes instead. These would be good for your nightstand & iPod but they are too big in my opinion.Decent sound quality & the price is right.I always liked logitech products and this is no exception"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great company","review":"These speakers are the sound quality of speakers sounding ten times the price. These upper end audio companies must hate these guys. I honestly don't know how they do it. This is my second pair of speakers from them. The first pair cost even less and frankly the sound was just as good. At the price I just wanted to have some back up speakers on hand.I have also owned other products from this company and had a keyboard where two of the letters where wearing off the keyboard after a year of hard use. I was hoping they would send me some stick on letters to replace them. Instead they upgraded me to a free new wireless keyboard and mouse without my asking. This company rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"These speakers are awesome. GREAT sound quality, I couldn't believe it.

They are larger than I thought, but solid and very clear sounding. The tone changes the bias between bass and treble a bit. They are plenty loud enough also. The reason for losing a star is that there are quite a few 2.1 systems (with a subwoofer) for around the same price.

The weight of the speakers are ideal I do not have to worry about them vibrating around and falling off the shelf. After updating the software on my soundcard on the computer the sound quality of the Logitech X-140 2.0 speakers was above what I expected. The clear sound of the speakers is a blessing and the tone control knob on the speaker is a plus.And don't forget you have a input for headphones which most computer speakers do but these have a input for a MP 3 player! And another great thing I found is when I have my cellphone by my desk theres no loud humming (feedback through the speakers)like I had with my other ones . I was very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced computer speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Muy bueno! Great value for the price. I'm sure there are better quality computer speakers out there (more expensive), but for the money, I think these are hard to beat.

These logitech speakers fit the bill. Many speaker sets are large and cumbersome which creates a need to move equipment around. I didn't want to do that. This set is slightly larger than the $10 speakers you can pick up anywhere, but the sound is greatly improved. The volume is much better and so is the quality.These speakers are being used in a large room for video conferencing with students. The nice part is the size. As I said before, I didn't want to have to rearrange equipment to get a set of speakers with a subwoofer to fit so I gambled on there. No regrets! I simply plugged them in, placed them where the old external speakers were and turned them on. No problems hearing the webconferencing now!Definitely consider getting these if you don't have a lot of space. And, Logitech is a trusted name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speaker for the Value","review":"Ordered these speakers to replace my generic piles of junk speakers from 1995 (Too much Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer back in the day destroyed any sound quality the old speakers may have had) For the X-140 Sterio Speakers, these are a very good set. The Sound quailty is very clean and sharp at low to mid volumne, a small buzz at louder volume (May be causec by the soundcard on my Motherboard). Tone control is not the greatest but I place it and leave it. Does have good bass for speakers of this size. If someone did have a separate subwoofer, and roll some of the lows away from these speakers, that would be TNT. Also, the black look is stylish.Pro: Cheap, Good Sound Qaulity, Quailty speaker housing, stylish for nerds like myselfCon: Eurgonomics of the speakers could be better being that the speakers point too high.

I am far from a sound expert, but I think the average person would be very satisfied with how they sound.

I have the Audiophile M-40s at home which sound amazing, but these were just for work to listen to the occasional video clip or plug in my MP3 player.These are very large speakers, but don't put out a lot of sound. When I do turn them up to a decent volume, they get almost \\"muffled\\" and slightly distorted. They have a separate \\"Tone\\" button which I don't like at all. I can not find a sweet spot, and I think it is unnecessary to include this button. The instructions don't even really explain it, just saying to turn it until you get the sound you like.

The Z-5s cost about two and a half times as much (on sale), but they produce real bass, even down into inaudible frequencies, and have a pretty reasonable range for speakers with only two drivers each.These speakers should be able to produce at least a little bass output, but after buying, and returning, two pair, I can say that running off wall power doesn't help the X-140s at all in that department. Twisting the \\"tone\\" knob all the way right just makes the output muddy.I'd strongly recommend buying... almost anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider the source","review":"For the money, $27 with free shipping, these speakers are very good.I find that the audio source you run through them make all the difference.I ran them through the headphone jack of my home theater amplifier, and controlling the main volume from the amp itself made for getting the sound out of the speakers very good.If used on a low quality amplified source, such as a portable device, the sound won't be as pure.I bought them to run the sound through a small HD radio. In that, they're only fair, but listenable in an environment (workplace) where loud volume isn't allowed anyway.Long story short, the source has everything to do with the audio output from these $27 speakers. Well worth the money. Substantial feel to them, too. I've seen other plug-in portable speakers which weigh half as much and sound cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Sound and Value.

These have neither of those, but are just what you'd expect: reliable dependable speakers. I use these to do training sessions for 1 to 20 people in a 30 X 40 foot room and everyone can hear what's going on with no noticeable distortion. I don't use them for music, so I can't really speak to that, but for voice and dvd training videos they are very acceptable.The only complaint I would have, and it is my own fault, is that they are larger than I thought they would be.

I enjoyed the way Durrett introduced a new topic to the readers. The examples are helpful; however, some of exercises seem to be a bit more difficult than the examples provided. There are two recommendations about this book. (1) correct typos. I located more than 10-15 places to be corrected after Durrett published his corrections on his web-site. (2) discuss more about Brownian Motion.

She hints and dances around the characters of her life creating frustration and disappointment with almost every page.Yes, the writing is lyrical.

The addition of the FBI men and the detective work that they do is a wonderful addition to this slightly dull book. The ending is the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.

I like the dialogs and that they teach you the grammar.However, they use their own way of transliterating Thai into the roman alphabet, which makes it utterly confusing when you try to look something up in a dictionary. \\"j\\" is written as \\"ch\\", \\"ch\\" is \\"sh\\", etc.Furthermore, the transliteration is skimping on the tone marks. Tone marks appear in the glossary but not in the dialoges.

It was great to show my little ballerina what practice and dedication looks like by watching a performance, yet the video is tailored to little girls that wouldn't be able to sit through an entire show.

I got the Swan Lake one for my girls last year and decided to get the Nutcracker since we were taking them to see the Nutcracker Ballet this past Christmas. I still love these videos but I must admit the production value is a bit low. The sound was really awful. It wasn't that bad on the Swan Lake DVD.

If you do side-by-sides you'll know what I mean.Wilma Cozart can again take bows for her excellent work refurbing her own original product.

Although somewhat like a textbook in its style of presentation, the writing throughout is clear, incisive and often quite absorbing. And there are plenty of black and white photos and architectural renderings which accompany the text to enhance its ability to inform. But only twelve colour plates were included in Invisible Gardens. I felt a bit let-down personally by this aspect of the project.

The movie shows nearly every obstacle that a college student can face through the stories of Malik, Kristen and Remmy(lack of $$, racism, sexual assault, sexuality, identity crisis, wanting to belong, adjusting to college work) However, by trying to include every possible situation that students face, the movie's themes and plots become very muddled. Higher Learning would probably have served more if it had focused on one or two situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda flick","review":"this film's entire reason is to inspire hate. the blacks are all freedom fighters. the whites are either lustful alcoholics with rape on the brain, bigotted campus police, or racist skinheads. either way, it's obvious that the portrayal of the white community is that they are pure evil. the acting is for sh1t. the plot and dialogue are contrived. this movie is an absolute shameless propaganda flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"John Singleton is one of my favorite directors. I thought this was a well done film. I know alot of caucasian people think this portrays them in a bad way but it's not the whole race. It's shows how some people think and that's true.

The acting was good and this was a strong college drama for it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Average Movie on Campus Life.","review":"This is a movie in the backdrop of Columbus University, on the different issues of college students often divided along the lines of race, ideology and sexual orientation. John Singleton's attempt is to bring out almost every problem on the campus to light, but ends up focussing on a psychotic young man in a neo-Nazi group. His encounters with the African-American group of students, leads to a high drama of race hatred and violence on the campus. The story line is rather spread out, but the characters are well-portrayed e.g. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that is symbolic of black ignorance","review":"This movie is a great piece of propaganda. It has very little substance and the plot is transparent and shows the ignorance of John Singleton. Basically the movie displays blacks as wonderful and whites as evil. The movie is your typical hollywood hate propaganda against whites. John singleton lost all credibility with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scattered","review":"This movie has grand aspirations, but has no focus. Singleton is trying to tell too many stories at once, doesn't go into depth on any of them, and then dumps them all at the end for a silly skinhead attack. The stars all do a fine job in the movie, I blame Singleton for this disaster. I would recommend watching it solely to see how a movie that could have been good can go so wrong.

Where students are divided among racial lines. Where security regularly harasses black students. Where neo-nazis and the black panthers go to recruit new members. Where interracial and homosexual couples have to fear being attacked. Where campus shootings are bound to happen.A movie about reace relations in college was a great idea and there are good performances from the leads in the film. The movie made some great points about students needing to appreciate the opportunities college brings them and taking responsibility for their own lives. However it also puts the characters at such extremes that it makes a totally unrealistic portrayal of college life. If this is what the writer went through in college than the university should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting plot that included every possible college genre","review":"Whoever argues that Blacks are still drawers of water and hewers of wood, did not see this particular movie. This film not only depicts African-Americans in the main stream of college life, but making great strides in professions and carrers that are not just positions of servitude. The film by Singleton depicts every aspect one could think of concerning academia. From the meledious tones of the professor to the cannon ringing shots fired into innocent flesh. The much extreme notions Singleton depicted through out the film were all warranted due to man's comprehension. The average person doesn't understand mixed signals and covert symbolism. Which in my opinion the argued scenes that one could say were overdone and over dramatized were warranted and necessary. In short, even though things may seem to be unreal this particular picture seemed not just real but needed. To open the eyes of consciousness of all who view such a work."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Singleton's work in this was excellent. Casting an all-star cast and speaking the truth about race, sexuality, and education. The movie was such a reality check to what happens in the real world still.

John Singleton does an exceptional job of describing college life in today's society. In today's colleges and universities the situations are not as blatent as in the movie, but the mental struggle that students encounter are very true. Higher Learning touches down on many aspects of the problems that all Americans endure on an everyday basis. I believe without a doubt that this movie should be a prerequisite for all entering college students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I love Higher Learning because it makes you think and it shows you the concequences of being racist.

This movie is just making people dumber and misinformed. I also hated how the white cops are shown to be so racist against blacks. Seriously john singleton??

I may be wrong but I think poor Busta has been used as a marketing tool to sell this movie.If you believe what you see on the silver screen then america has some serious race problems...granted uk has a few race problems of its own, but it is nothing compared to the states.

But Partridge and Moulding's songs are so strong that they often do very well in other hands.Some of the songs on this collection don't survive the individualistic treatment; the first three cuts on this album are pretty forgettable. But some are gems. Reuben Blades changes \\"The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul\\" from XTC's Rundgren-produced spy movie theme into a steamy Latin tune. TMBG's\\"25 o'Clock\\" is as much fun as the original. Sarah McLachlan's \\"Dear God\\" is as good in its own way as the original. And \\"The Good Things\\" by Terry and the Lovemen is probably unique in the history of recorded music- a band covering itself!If you're an XTC fan you'll need this album to complete your collection, of course. If you're not already a fan, buy the XTC originals, but buy this one just for McLachlan's cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant concept & solid execution, with a few mis-steps","review":"The subtle reworkings of \\"Earn Enough for Us\\" and \\"Senses Working Overtime\\" are smart interpretations, staying close to the original but being different enough to get (and keep) your attention. The letdowns are limited to 3: Joe Jackson (quite surprisingly!), Sarah McLachlan (it just seems tired and uninspired in this post-Lillith era), and an utterly verbatim chord-for-chord replay of \\"Nigel\\" by The Rembrandts. That last one is probably the least insightful, least creative, and most pointless contribution to the overall effort. [Though what else would you expect from an act known only for the \\"Friends\\" theme?]TMBG and Mr. Blades are exceptional, and L. Hux's \\"Another Satellite\\" is a transcendent reinterpretation of an already phenomenal & groundbreaking song.Bottom line: If you like XTC and have an open mind, buy it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Uncle Albert!","review":"Love this CD!

After a month of use, the coating on the metal started to rub off where my wrist rests. This was exasperated by customer service that failed to reply to my email."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mousepad doesn't work with my optical mouse.","review":"The mousepad looks nice and sleek.

If you, like I, use a laser mouse, do NOT buy this pad. It skips horrifically, and has almost no resistance whatsoever (I realize the latter issue is more of a personal preference than a design flaw, but it is, to me, an issue). I tested the surface with 3 different laser mice, all reacting the same. I haven't attempted using this with an optical or ball (do they even exist anymore?) mouse, but like I said, it is absolutely awful for a laser mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"I've been using this pad for about 10 months now and I must say I'm very dissappointed.1) The pad gets sticky VERY easily. I have to clean the pad every 2-3 days because it gets sticky and creates friction.(Not a good thing for gamers)2) The paint on the metalic part(where my palm touches) started coming off after 2-3 months of usage.3) The place where paint came off is now collecting rust. Whenever I use the pad for decent amount of time, I'd get rust on my hands.I'm tossing it out as soon as my new pad arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allsop Mouse Pad A Dissapointment","review":"I bought one of these several years ago at a local retailer. It was the last one they had left. In hindsight I think I know why. For one thing I had hoped it would be the last mouse pad I would ever need to buy. However I too have noticed the tarnish on the metal about where my wrist would set. But strangely, fine scratches all over the edges of the metal. I can't think of a reason for this.I think the attribute for this product should be \\"Quality of Product\\" - Not \\"Ease of Use\\". And due to the poor quality of this item I cannot give it any stars.I think my next mouse pad will be a homemade one from a piece of plexi-glass (pollycarb) and contact paper.

Yes, it's a CD compiled of songs that are inspired by famous poems or, alternatively, there are musical versions of the original poems themselves. Although there are moments when her song doesn't quite do the original justice, there are also moments when she nails it better than its original author. I particularly enjoyed the upbeat Galuppi Baldessare, the heart-breaking Sence You Went Away and The Drop and the Dream. For literary folks out there, I believe you'll find this to be a grand treat. The original poems included in the CD booklet are a nice compliment to the songs themselves. It's an intelligent and thought-provoking album with a wide range of music styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex poetic experiment","review":"I admit, I stumbled on this album because I had too much time on my hands in the summer heat, and I like Mark McKay's music, and I saw on his album page here on Amazon that Kris did some vocals and cello playing for him on a couple of his albums--Shimmer and Live from the Memory Hotel. I am always looking for new music, a new album to be the kind of album I just love and can listen to over and over again for months. If you know what I'm talkin about you also know how rare it is! Anyway, this album just might turn out to be one of those. So far so good! I'm loving the purity of it. The poetry angle is a cool angle. Richard Buckner did this too, fyi, for anyone who might really dig this experiment! But don't listen to reviewers, just check out the samples and downloads and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific album","review":"What a terrific album! Like quite a few people in the UK I came across Kris Delmhorst when Since You Went Away featured in the TV series Case Histories and I tracked this album down from there. It's really excellent in my view - thoughtful, intelligent, tuneful and varied.Kris Delmhorst has based these songs on works by poets. Some are settings of words close to the original and others loosely adapted but all work very well. As examples, Masefield's Sea Fever is truly beautiful and her adaptation of little how town by e.e. cummins is deceptively up-beat, giving it a great impact. The songs have elements of country, folk and jazz all of which are exceptionally well played and sung and the overall effect is stunning, I think.Kris Delmhorst is less well-known than she deserves to be on this evidence. She is a fine songwriter and a great performer with a lovely voice, and I recommend this album very warmly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a keeper..","review":"One of the songs on this cd was featured on the PBS program 'Case Histories'.

As a fan of the genre, I am fed up with mystery authors being thrown into this category. While we're at it can we eliminate V.C Andrews as well? And anything written in the last 3 years by Dean Koontz and/or Stephen King. (Ah but when they wrote to scare, no one can compare!) Lastly on this topic, I received a book the other day from the \\"Leisure Horror Book Club\\" that was touted as \\"Tales of the Dark.\\" Sure, it was more like \\"Tales of Irony,\\" and the first short was a romance!! Don't get me wrong I read a lot of different genres, but when I'm looking for a good spooky story don't give me crank phone calls. Speaking of which, I stopped reading \\"Tormentor\\" midway, I passed it on to a friend and realized I had gotten to Chapter 17 and didn't really care about the story or the characters!

I thought they were two different novels and if I had known they were the same, I would never have gotten the paperback.The only reason I gave it a one star rating is because I couldn't post this comment without giving it some kind of rating, even though, as I said above, I haven't yet read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great descriptions but horrible read!","review":"I was on a book kick, and while looking for something appealing to read, I saw \\"summer\\" by Edith Wharton looking like something interesting to read.

The descriptions of new england are fascinating, lovely and wonderful. The descriptions of ribbons, fourth of july events, fireworks, and wonderful dresses is just awesome.

One of the few books in which she actually admits that her characters have sex (oh, my) and actually does it tastefully and in strict accordance with the characters' natures and the plot itself. The ending was a stunning surprise, and this from a huge Wharton fan, who found this book accidentally for the Kindle.

A good, quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY PADDED","review":"I've never gotten the whole Saul Bellow thing, but this one is very padded; very much a short story expanded to novella length"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seize the Day not an option for some","review":"In one of Bellow's best works, Seize the Day tackles many of the hardships faced in the capitalistic society of America. The main character, Wilhelm, has failed miserably at virtually everything he has ever attempted. This failure is a derivation from the fact that his father has never been able to show him love. Thus, Wilhelm accepts love from anyone who is offering, and constantly gets taken advantage of by those he trusts. Hidden within the text, is the issue of the Holocaust, and how the world must reflect and look at the sins of the past in order to progress into the future. Ironically, \\"Seizing the Day\\" is not the answer for Wilhelm, or the world. From this novella, we must realize that in order to move on with our lives, we must reflect upon and accept our sins and mistakes of the past. Very powerful and moving, this novella should force every reader to think about the direction of their lives, and the importance of love and compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pathetic Tendency Made Funny","review":"A middle-aged man at his wit's end; his past, present, and future seem bleak. Mr. Bellow wrote with ease and humor about such a man. Although the character is in his forties and has barely jumped over one hurdle after another throughout his whole life due to his own naivety, he continues to make more mistakes than ever. The story takes place only in one day. In about 115 pages the reader finds out what makes the man he is. It is also up to the reader to conclude Mr. Bellow's account of this man. Mr. Bellow's writing was fluent where he detailed each appearance and action thoroughly with a very good sense of humor. It is a fast and interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saul Bellow -- Seize the day","review":"This is a book about a man who is tired of life in NY City, tired of his father, tired of everything...the writing is a little hard to understand at first, but soon enough one can understand it. The fact that this book (or novella) is 107 pages (with relatively big font size) is good, because one can read it quickly. I was able to read the whole book in 3 days. I do recommend this because it is a GOOD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seize the day? Yes! Buy this book ? No!","review":"It took me longer to read this boring novella than it did to complete \\"Gone With the Wind!\\" I know, I know, Bellow is a Nobel prize winner, but just because his work has merit doesn't make me like this tedious book any better. This book is for you if the thought of endless talk about the price of soybeans and lard on the stock market, spoken by essentially dull characters, makes your heart beat faster and your pulse start racing. Thankfully, this book was not my introduction to Bellow; I started with his first two novels, \\"Dangling Man,\\" and \\"The Victim,\\" and I liked them. Then I read \\"Herzog\\" and \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" and I LOVED them. I will never give up on this author -- he's a masterful writer, and his \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\" and \\"Humboldt's Gift\\" are waiting for me on my bookshelf. (Books are so patient.)

Maybe you will be fascinated by doing the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book that ever scared me","review":"I stumbled upon this book quite by accident. Started reading it. Wow! We've all lived in fear of this nightmare coming true: to be middle aged, broke, angry, alone, alienated and generally, a loser. This slim novella captures the downside of the human condition with all the introspection that comes with it. This is a worthy successor to Joyce's \\"The Dead\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day in the life","review":"There are any number of good reasons to read this alarmingly lovely and grimly hilarious novella from 1956. Here's just one, an unforgettable paragraph on page 87 in which Tommy Wilhelm and Dr. Tamkin go out to lunch:\\"They ate in the cafeteria with the gilded front. There was the same art inside as outside. The food looked sumptuous. Whole fishes were framed liked pictures with carrots, and the salads were like terraced landscapes or like Mexican pyramids; slices of lemon and onion and radishes were like sun and moon and stars; the cream pies were about a foot thick and the cakes swollen as if sleepers had baked them in their dreams.\\"For anyone who has ever had a soft spot for a good cakeshop, that last bit is especially sweetly crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book -- I expected better from Saul Bellow.","review":"This slender novel -- really just an extended character sketch -- presents a morose, self-pitying loser gazing into his navel.

I give it two stars rather than one only because Bellow is obviously a serious writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why am I still an Idiot?","review":"I bought this book in hopes that I would be playing the piano as soon as I began reading the book. This did not happen. The first seven chapters were getting me familar with the piano world -good but not at this point in my learning. I also found I didn't need the wit or the side bars. All I was looking for when I bought the book was a logical step-by-step method of playing the piano. The books' material is good but not for me, and that is why I feel I am still an Idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this book.","review":"This book has a lot of information on the piano and keyboard, but it does very little to actually teach one how to play either of them. It does a decent job of teaching the individual notes, but the section on chords is not very good at all. The book also does not contain nearly enough practice pieces. Most of the book is just about the history of pianos and stuff like that. Buy this book only if you want to learn all about the piano and keyboard but not how to actually play them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Useless","review":"I must agree with the negative criticisms other reviewers have made of this book, but I would rate it even lower. The eager beginner will want to get his/her fingers on the instrument as soon as possibly, not sit around reading all day! (reading text, not even music at that) The information that is covered in this book is not particularly essential to the beginner. Worse, most of the book feels like padded-out fluff, with the many different kinds of sidebars cumbersome distractions.Don't be fooled by the complete idiot's ploy. This book is just a cash-in on the Idiot's/Dummies market with no real substance. Instead, get in touch with a piano teacher, and see what books he/she recommends, even if you don't want or can't afford to take lessons (Although lessons would be the most sure-fire way to obtain results.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!","review":"Yes, I'm a complete idiot. And when I started reading this book, I had just gotten a keyboard. After a year of having a keyboard and this book, I could not read music, could not play piano, and worse, was really kind of scared of even re-trying to learn. This book is full of dull music and music notation, which if you don't know anything about music, you won't know what they're talking about. It all makes for a rather lame book.What finally turned it around for me was a combination of more user-friendly books and watching tutorials on youtube. I still can't read music, but I can play some good stuff on the piano now. Maybe one day I'll find the magic bullet that helps me take care of that first part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Batteries","review":"Not much to say but they work as they are supposed to.

I loved it.As an African American who grew up in a working class neighborhood which, over the 20 years since my departure, has deteriorated almost to the point of \\"ghetto\\", I can say unequivocally that whatever Gilder points out concerning the general population indeed goes triple for the African American community.

Although statistics have changed, they still show the same pattern they did years before the book was published and they still show the same pattern now. I gave it four stars because of his immigration views and views of women in the workforce. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know why the nuclear family is important to society. This book is just as relevant today in the 21st century as it was when it was first written. A beautiful and classic read. The author lifts up women as the single most important members of society and describes why it is necessary to bring men into appropriate roles and why monogamous marriage is the best way. A must read especially for young women who wish to understand men (especially those who ask the question \\"why can't the man stay home to raise the babies while the woman brings in the money?\\"). After decades we can see that this author got it right. I just wish there was an updated version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Guilder","review":"I was very pleased with George Guilder's book on Men and Marriage. Perhaps he is a little heavy on evolutionary causes of men as hunters of women. He recognizes the reality of differences between the two sexes, and the suffering and damage done to marriage by the feminist cause. He is not anti-feminist, nor am I. Guilder recognizes the power that women have with men, and men's desire to please their wife.

In sum, the book explains how and why we find ourselves in the midst of such a mess, today."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad, not bad at all","review":"I just finished George Gilder's Men & Mariage, and I have to say that he makes a lot of good points. Since this is an updated version of his earlier Sexual Suicide, I would be interested in how much the statistics still need updating.Gilder highlights some of the elements that would substatiate the fact that gender roles and the traditional family are the key to a healthy culture. I agree to some extent, but I feel that it is better stated that the health of a society is gauged on fidelity to Scripture... gender roles and the traditional family being but an aspect of that larger issue.I enjoyed his style. He was just irreverent enough for me to laugh on occassion. All in all, I would have to recommend his book to others. Well done, George!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"\\"The male penis is no longer a decisive organ in itself. Thus the feminist demand that women have control over their own bodies accentuated an unconscious recognition that males have almost lost control of procreative activity. A mans penis becomes an empty plaything unless a woman deliberately decides to admit a man's paternity. A man quite simply cannot now father a baby unless his wife is fully and deliberately agreeable.\\"Male potency was not simply a matter of erectile reliability; it was a fell weapon of procreation. Women viewed male potency with some awe, and males were affirmed by this response.\\"(p. 107)Those were the good old days weren't they?The quotes above are just the tip of the iceberg, and I will let the author write is own review with his own quotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird book","review":"While I agree with Gilder that a return to marriage and family is nothing but positive for society, I absolutely disagree with returning to traditional gender roles unless that is what each person wants. Live and let live. I have a wonderful egalitarian marriage that serves my family quite well. Both of us work and could each support our family should anything happen to the other which is something that my stay at home sister going through a divorce will never be able to do for herself and her children. If a traditional marriage with traditional roles works for you, great. If an egalitarian one works - good for you too. Men should be offended that Gilder reduces them to violent, drooling troglodyte rapists if they aren't married and in control.

Now I must read it very slowly and thoroughly to to embrace and internalize every detail. If you loved Nakoa's Woman, Gladyce with a C will give you cause to explore the core of your reality.

Simply a laundry list of inventions and events, the actual story within this novel is a mere outline. The narrative of the two lovers meeting in another lifetime takes up perhaps 10 pages. The title character, Glaydce, is completely unappealing. A sequel was a nice idea but this simply does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iona - Impressive Debut","review":"Iona made their debut on to the world stage with this their first album in 1990. The original band was a trio comprised of Dave Bainbridge, Joanna Hogg, and Dave Fitzgerald. The three were augmented on this album by about a half dozen session players, one of whom, Troy Donnockley would eventually become a member of the band as well. The album contains several tracks that are still a part of the band's live show 20 years later including the killer instrumental \\"Flight Of The Wild Goose\\". Iona albums tend to have some filler to go along with the meat, but this one seems to be pretty lean all the way through. Hogg's vocals are pristine and Bainbridge's guitar soars on the rocking stuff like \\"Trilogy\\" and caress on the acoustic selections like \\"Beijing\\". I really like this album a lot and would rank it right near the top of the Iona catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets Keep You Sick......Than Share The Album","review":"A very relaxing and good album, better than the last one.The last album had a few good songs, but there where no \\"flow\\" through the album.Got a good felling by listening to this album, so that must mean that I liked it.Enjoyed a few songs particularly much.At least this is my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless listen..Classic","review":"Everything on this is just as relevant today.It is also Beatabley beautiful to jam to.You dont know what you're missing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one...","review":"This is no \\"Check it\\".

A story of men who finally broke through the color barrier to win the respect and opportunity they so richly deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story and message","review":"A great story of the struggle of black pilots in WW2 trying to be allowed to fight for their county. An amazing story of sacrifice and skill. Much like the Japanese Americans unit who were the most decorated group of us soldiers in WW2 who fought in Europe the black pilots never lost a bomber they guarded. A feat that has never been equaled. Can't say enough except buy it and watch and be inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see...","review":"...simple, but very well produced.Nobody ever can tell this wasn't a major budget production in the business, with such a good team working together!A touching story, after all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Very Satisfied with the service and the Item I ordered .It got here in time for me to deliver it on Christmas Day as a gift ..Thanks Again , Ken"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical account of black aviators","review":"The Tuskegee fighter pilots were simply some of the best American pilots in WWII. They fought the enemies of prejudice in order to get to fight Nazis. This film is far, far superior to other versions. It is well acted and tells the story within the story of one of Americas most successful and decorated military units."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASED","review":"DVD in very good condition and was delivered quite timely. Will not hesitate to use this service again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior film to that of Red Tails","review":"I remember first seeing this in it's original airing on HBO almost two decades ago. The new movie Red Tails PALES in comparison to this original movie. Granted, Red Tails has a couple of carry over actors from Tuskeegee Airmen, but \\"'Tails\\" lacks the level of acting performance the collective from \\"Tuskeegee\\" had.Tuskeegee Airmen was better because it was less \\"Hollywood\\". The focus was more about the acting, dramatic dialogue, and the antagonist/protagonist relationships between the black squadron members and it's white command superiors than it was about the special effects or the aerial flight/battle sequences. Tuskeegee Airmen also better dealt with the interpersonal friction/difference between the varying character traits of the black pilots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Excellent film! Great cast! This movie tells the story of the first Black Army Corp fighter pilots and the struggles they had to get the right to fight for their country. The abilities of this outstanding group of men made them sought after as escorts by some of the very men who rejected them because of the color of their skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave men poorly presented","review":"I am knowledgeable from other written materials concerning the plight of these men. The producer ignored any of the issues other than race relations. They were there, and we all know it. Getting through flight school was a major hurtle due to the army instructor's prejudice; but, these men overcame that issue and the face of death in Europe. I was personally disappointed and resented the shallow \\"hollywoodized\\" version. These men were deeply challenged on two fronts and to me heros to be admired and to which all Americans owe tribute. Find their story somewhere else. You can have mine. Finally, let me restate, just getting to EAO took tremendous bravery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tuskegee Airman","review":"The Tuskegee Airmen is a true story about the role the black soldiers played in aiding their country to win World War II.

Special notation should be mentioned for the character and integrity of the black pilots of this era (known as \\"The Tuskegee Airmen\\"), which was extraordinary considering the prejudicial treatment, so common in the culture of this era, by the very people they volunteered to defend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuskegee Airmen","review":"Well constructed movie that identifies and addresses the challenges faced by the Tuskegee Airmen while focusing on their commitment to safety of this nation. In the end, the movie conveys that excellence is an antidote to racism. While this may be true, it is a cumbersome burden to expect that all persons of marginalized group will be excellent in order to exercise rights extended to whites who perform and display behaviors less than perfect in the same arena. It is a story of triumph over adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuskeegee Airmen","review":"This is an excellent movie, the actors are wonderful and they really portray a positive image of a significant military unit in United States history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black pilots fly in WWll!","review":"This fictional movie related to the true historical contributions by the 1st WWll fighter pilots and the obstaclesthey conquered in the air.

We had a Scott stereo system at home with Tannoy speakers - and this music is some of my most favourite. I had the honour of seeing their farewell concert at Massey Hall in Toronto in the fall of 1979, and I cried all the way through it. I have looked for their recordings in CD's for years, and am happy at last to be able to purchase them. Is \\"Casually Classic\\" no longer available? How sad - it was one of their best. I danced to \\"Maria Elena\\" with my father at my wedding - it remains one of my most cherished moments.

As a veteran (now retired) swinger, I can tell you that his books were once considered gospel in certain circles. No one was more disappointed than I when AIDS and the '80s swept in, and dozens of important books like \\"Making Love\\" went out of print. So I was obviously surprised when, looking his book up on a whim, I found that other Amazon customers remember GTS, and are still finding his books as useful and life-changing as I did in the early '70s. Clearly, someone should be thinking about a new edition - maybe even a Grant Tracy Saxon omnibus - I think he still has a lot to teach us."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music cleans and clears my body, mind and soul!","review":"The crashing of waves in Tract #1, Gateway, put all levels of my self on notice that attention and healing is imminent. The music gently moves my mind through nothing less than a frequency change, if you will. The \\"Waters of Remembrance,\\" Tract 4, pulls my heart and soul over old hurts and joys and new feelings are the watershed. Tract #5, \\"Lake of Enchantment,\\" allows me to wander back to what may have been dreams during childhood when I reclined by a stream, singing and playing with fairies and dancing elves. Tract #6, \\"Spirit of the Healing Waters\\" plucks at my heart strings to intensify emotions and calm stresses. By the last song, \\"Lotus Reflection\\" this old favorite renews every cell in all of me.

Then I get the second one and the face motor was messed up and it would not give me the CD back. Another $15 to them and $8 for shipping and I get one that works when installed. The CD has to run via the DVD and makes it so you can not read the track number. You have to switch it to radio to change any of the sould settings. and the card reader is in a real bad spot. Also you have to have the remote to do almost all functions. Now I have had it in for about a mouth and the face moves when it wants to.

Save your money and get something real."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sean Nos singing of Darach O'Cathain","review":"The Sean Nos (traditional unnacompanied singing)takes some getting used to for people more accustomed to the \\"Galway Bay\\" style of singing,as the singers are not entertaining in the familiar western sense but trying to tell a story or convey an emotion. Style and emotion are much more important than what most of us would think of as a good singing voice. In fact, many fans of Sean Nos singing sometimes find a well worn voice more able to convey the often sad details of many of the songs. Darach O'Cathain was one of Ireland's greatest Sean Nos singers and this CD is a great example of his singing. Listening to the singing of Darach O'Cathain along with Joe Heaney (Also known as Seosamh O'Heanai or Joe Einiu in his native Connemara), Johnny Mhairtin Learai McDonncha, and a host of other Connemara and Connemara-style sean nos singers will give any serious student of traditional unnacompanied Irish singing a great introduction to the style."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a superior historical novel.","review":"I highly reccomend this book to people who enjoy historical adventures.

These guys want to be considered prog so badly, they do not know when to can the scale/tempo changes in favor of memorable melodies.3) Vocal lines are very limited, largely due to the vocalist's severe lack of talent. This guy has a below average voice and can't hit a note at point blank with double-barreled shotgun. Simply terrible.Summary: Try again guys and get rid of the crappy singer. If the talent pool in Hungary is that dry, just put out instrumental albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry's son comes into his own with a monster cd!!!","review":"I'll keep this short: This is a stunning cd, one of the best of the year already.

Once you program in your age and height (for up to 2 people), you can then weight yourself and determine weight, body fat and water %. It appears to work well and measures consistantly.You can just measure anyones weight instantly by pressing the foot button on the front of the unit, or select a guest mode from the menu which allows you to measure the body fat etc for someone who is not one of the 2 people programmed in.It only shows instantaneous readings - i.e. has no history of what you weighed yesterday etc, but since you naturally change weight each day/hour anyway I'm not sure that would show you much anyway. What does it matter that you're 1% heavier than yesterday! To track your weight, just use pen and paper over a longer time.It works well for the price.

It wasn't possible!","review":"I had a completely dissapointing experience with TANITA. The feature to register your current age, height, and sex is only to calculate the IMC, fat and water percentage, but this scale doesn't store anything.

Clearance was't enough to make it over door frame on the floor. If you have lots of time and like projects and only have to shift the table around a little then this might work for you. Personnally I think I could move the table over just as easy without this thing. I have a scroll saw on the table in question. My other table with the miter saw is equipped with locking casters that I afixed myself. This works quite nicely. Got the $7 dollar ones from Amazon.

On this base I have a Delta 14\\" bandsaw with riser block, a router cabinet, a drill press and I'm planning to put a Powermatic 60B 8\\" jointer on one. I used galvanized square extruded steel stock instead of wood. It was cheaper but just a little too wide for the bolts to fully thread through the mobile base and the struts. So I have bought new bolts that were a little longer than what Delta supplied. The bandsaw is pretty stable in motion. I was concerned that it would be likely to tip over but its fine. The drill press is a benchtop model on a cabinet so its fine in motion as well. Not sure yet if the base can handle the weight of the jointer but I think it should be ok.

As with the other reviewers, It's sloppy with the 1 1/2\\" boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16\\" holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press, you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop, I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever, but it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but......","review":"I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws. I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw. The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of. However, I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw. I will probably take this and use it on some other machine. So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw, jointer, or planer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Option","review":"This mobile base makes moving my Delta saw so easy it should be outlawed. Seriously, all you have to do is step on the pedal to lift the saw & push or pull it anywhere you want it to be. As long as your floor is smooth you can move the saw with one hand. I have a Delta tablesaw with a cast iron top and wings and without this little jewel, I would need two men to wrestle it around my shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta Mobile Base","review":"the product was made in China, which explains it's quality control problem. The design is good, but Delta is not watching it's suppliers close enough. The main problem was the assembly hardware was a mix of Standard bolts and metric nuts. In a couple of cases a specific bolt would be standard and its matching nut would be metric. I would probably not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta MOBILE BASE","review":"The base is very well made and went together easy.The only thing that I think would have made it better is if the bolts about 1/8\\" to 3/16\\" longer because they do not extend completly thru the nut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble - a dream to use","review":"This mobile base is easy to assemble as long as you accurately mark and drill the holes for the bolts that attach the corner pieces to the wooden frame. Assuming you have the 1.5 inch stock needed to make the side rails on hand, you can put the whole thing together in less than an hour. And when you're done, you have a mobile base that is the equal, in ease of use, to anything I have seen on the market. I especially like the foot operated third wheel, that easily engages by simply stepping on the lever mechanism, and disengages by lifting up on the lever with your foot. Nothing could be easier! And the base moves smoothly over the floor on three wheels rather than having to lift one side and push your tool on two wheels like an ungainly wheelbarrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wood not included, fixed feet not included","review":"Bought 6 more to go with the initial one I tried last year.All six arrived without the fixed feet in the sealed package, Delta responded quickly and without complaint.Op note. While I believe this is the better base, there are some limitations.The lift mechanism is sturdy and easy to use The three point contact obtained, when rolling, provides good mobility on smooth concrete. When used on (limiting) heavy equipment, however, the lift occurs on mid beam between corners, the resulting twist of the wood beam that supports the retractile roller is objectionable. For this condition, this one rail can be replaced or strengthened with a 1 1/2\\" x 1/8\\" angle to provide stiffness. For most applications, pine will do for all rails except the lifting beam where the hardwood beam is more appropriate...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the description, don't look at the picture!","review":"I am very unhappy with this purchase and returned it.

This volume is yet another of his logically well-integrated, dramatic trio on that war and speaks a soft/loud pianoforte of war from the Southern perspective. It contains many a large gulp of its often hesitantly bitter, prolonged agony from the bloody cup of setbacks and disappointments on both sides of the conflict. Had Foote given us the same mysterious energy without frequently caricaturing the North to glorify the South, it, in my estimation, would've transcended all such history, narrative or not, in the long fog of peace and romancing of the war. Yet it's THE monumental work, forcefully contradicting the rule that only victors write definitive histories of war. I hope its brilliant histrionics are never misused by historical revisionists, or deter America from completing the Spartacan dream of abolishing all vestiges of involuntary servitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Civil War narrative","review":"Along with vol 1 (and I am guessing vol 3) the only books anyone will ever need on the Civil War.

It's refreshingly unique very simply because the protagonist is a middle-aged woman, and the story is almost entirely told from Lisey's perspective. It's a bit odd hearing King narrate in a female voice, but he pulls it off, and it sounds honest and authentic.I enjoyed the plot, which I found an interesting amalgam of King's \\"From a Buick 8\\" and \\"Insomnia\\", and Clive Barker's \\"Coldheart Canyon\\". Like some other reviewers, I found Lisey's and Scott's coded talk a bit overworked at times, but palatable.I listened to Lisey's Story unabridged on CD narrated by Mare Winningham. Ms. Winningham gives a solid performance, well-suited for Lisey's earnestness and resiliency, and reasonably dynamic giving life to Scott Landon and the supporting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is still the King:","review":"I am a big Steven King fan and have read almost all of his books. So don't let what appears to be a slow start to get you down. I could never have predicted where King was going and was pleasantly surprised when he took me there. Boola Moon is something you'll recognize as something from the depths of our collective subconscious; or that part of our brain where our dreams (or nightmares) are born. I really enjoyed the feelings I got from this journey to places that gave me a creepy sense of deja vu. It is different from Kings other recent novels.

Lisey is boring and dull. Her inner thought narratives are just painful to get through. I cannot stand the way Stephen King tried to use the phrase \\"strapping it on\\". First of all it sounds gross (sorry that's just where my mind goes when I hear that phrase) and second of all he uses is way too much. Lisey also uses the word \\"smucking\\" instead of the other word it sounds like. That's just stupid. I mean really. Most of the readers are adults and if the character was just too innocent to use the actual curse word then use \\"freaking\\" instead.

The language is geared to a ten year old. (Bool, anybody?) Add a few dashes of misogyny (e.g. Lisey gets a phone call warning her she'll be cut up in a very delicate place) and you have a miserable reading experience. At one time, Mr. King was underrated by the critics. Now it is the other way around. This whole opening section (the 140 pages) could have been cut down to 20 without any character or plot loss.

I really think King's accident affected him more than he realizes. This book is filled with meaningless words - and SO MANY OF THEM!

A strange combination, but that's just the way it is. I have no other words to describe it. Two years after her husband died, Lisey wants to get rid of Scott's possessions and that's what it's all about. A lot of flashbacks show that there marriage has been successfull, but also scary at times, and so on, and so on, ...It takes way too long before something happens and when you finally get interested, the story is over.

The story is weird although the main idea of a writer's widow on a psychological quest about his husband demons is not completely silly. The first hundred pages are horrible, boring and hard to follow. Numerous flashbacks and a secret language between Lisey and her husband brings the reading to a high level of subtility. If this is your first \\"King\\" please do not rate the author on the basis of your appreciation of this book! Check for his early era writings, most of them are great reads and page-turners.If the book would have been 300 pages shorter, maybe I would have given it 3-4 stars for writing quality and originality.

His horror novels are really the best out there. Reading King, you feel like you are right there in the action. I got this book for Christmas (waiting that long nearly killed me!) and I couldn't put it down. Yes, it's a love story but it's not a romance novel. It's Stephen King at his best. He does use many made up words but once you're into the book you know exactly what those words mean and there aren't really any words out there that explain them better. I bought this book for my mother also. I'm pretty sure I inherited the \\"rabid Stephen King fan\\" bit from her and she loved it as much as I did.

It's about as exciting and suspenseful as Virginia Woolfe's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". I have always been a fan of Mr. King's and have usually devoured his books. Unfortunately, that has not been the case since the late 90s. And this one is no better. There is obviously something in it the critics like--it's gotten very good reviews. And I kept reading it, to a certain degree, with that in mind--certain that it would eventually start to \\"talk to me\\". It never did. I found his incessant word creation disruptive and tiring. There has usually been a little of that in previous books--and a little went a long way. But it was constant in \\"Lisey's Story\\".

I will finish it, if only because I spent a smucking $9.99 on it.I've been reading Steven King since Carrie, and I buy each book hopefully, but I have found myself more disappointed than not for the past 10 years.

I consider him to be one of the greatest living authors and story tellers of our time with unparalleled talent. This novel comes off as a solid short story, stretched out into 500 pages. There just isn't a lot there. The tale of Lisey and her now deceased husband is compelling, but it is so sparsely planted throughout the novel that it was like watching 10 minutes of a good movie every month until it is completely viewed. I was unable to become engaged either to the story or the characters. Rare for me, I put this book down at some point a hundred pages or so in, and read another book then came back to it weeks later and only continued because it was a King novel. I was able to stick faithfully to the Dark Tower series, which must be 5000+ pages, easier than I could to 100 pages of this book. I did not find compelling characters or story in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose Story is this?","review":"The title of the novel \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a misnomer. This is a tortured rendering of King's own nightmarish fantasies (not his first). The novel primarily is the recollection of the horrible childhood of Lisey's husband, the rest is padding. Lisey is just the sounding board. Mr. King once again is trying to scare the reader. At one point, the author uses an actual news story of \\"Ralph -- a lost dog's amazing return home\\", to justify the fiction writer's prerogative to invent just about anything. So, Mr. King mixes fantasy and reality, but not very successfully. The novel is much too long and repetitious. It was a chore to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A POETIC UNUSUAL JOURNEY","review":"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. I listened to it on tape so I wasn't as confused by the private language that husband and wife shared as many seemed to be and though the book itself jumped around a lot, in the end, everything tied together in a neat little bundle. Expect to get through the first 100 pagees in utter confusion before you settle into the rhythm of the book and understand what is truely happening. As usual with King books, he introduces subplots that aren't relevant to the main plot, but for a change most of these forays off the beaten track eventually thread back into the main storyline.The book is beautifully written and the characters are nicely developed. If you have trouble reading it, try listening to it.....the narrators voice only adds to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, the 'performer' who read this was terrible.","review":"Unfortunately, the reader of this story has a voice that curdles milk.Her fingernails on chalk-board voice is just too much to bear. I couldn't stand listening to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I've been an avid fan of King's work from the start, but it seems to me that he may be running out of creative inspiration. His last books have been less masterful than the earlier ones and this one is just awful. It's the only Stephen King book that went straight to the Goodwill box instead of being lined up with all the others on their own special bookshelf. Let's hope he gets himself together before the next one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULDN'T READ IT","review":"Unlike Stephen King novels. I usually get right into his storylines. I couldn't get past the first few chapters when I just completely gave up. Maybe the story gets better but it was soooooo boring. On the basis of the beginning of the book - BORING. If you can get past that then maybe it gets better, don't know and will never read the rest to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.","review":"This book is just plain boring. It drags and has not substance. King creates his own language (blood bools?) that I just plain do not want to understand.The interesting thing about King is that he always has a good concept. However, he tends to destroy it with his writing style - which is just too convoluted. He needs to write succinctly or just give us all a rest.Uggh - dont bother with this one. I actually would love my $$$ back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy - couldn't even finish it.","review":"Long time King fan, enjoyed almost every book - at least finished them all. This one was so slow and laboreous, I couldn't even finish it. It I read the word \\"bool\\" again, I was going to scream (not in a good way). Stupidest made up word ever. Sorry, I just didn't like anything about this book and I couldn't spend any more time waiting for it to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smucking Long!!!","review":"Yes, Im yet another avid S.K fan, who will never give up on the master, despite being horribly dissappointedin his two lastest offerings, firstly the mediocre 'Cell', and now the neverending Liseys story.Why has King become so damn long winded?? His best novels have always been huge, but without a word to spare within an un-put-downable epic (eg Tommyknockers, IT, The Stand etc, etc)Liseys story dragged on like a long, boring movie full of dull characters. There were the odd moments of vintage King, but they were few and far between. I almost gave up halfway through, as the use of the ridiculous word 'smuck' made me want to throw the book away! I also found it irritating that Boo ya Moon was merely a poor replica of 'The Territories' within the brilliant 'Tallisman' (co written with Peter Straub)I still have faith in King and will continue to read everything that he offers us.. fingers crossed he has another great novel in him to rival his spectacular back catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Stephen King please stand up...","review":"How can it be that the person who wrote 'Salem's Lot and The Stand cranked out this boring, repetitive and annoying book. There have always been clunkers in Mr. King's repertoire. Lisey's Story, however, is the bottom of the clunker barrel. Even when Stephen King is off the mark, his writing can take lyrical turns that just enmesh and enchant the reader, and carry us along for page after page. Not so in this book. I have read all of Mr. Kings books, fiction and non-fiction and have come to a conclusion. The pod people have obviously made their own version of Stephen King, and this Pod-Stephen is the one who wrote Insomnia, Dream Catchers, Bag of Bones, From a Buick 8 and the rest of that ilk. Cell might have been a collaboration between the real thing and the clone. Anyway, if you love Stephen King, reread the old books. Lisey's Story is definitely the work of the Pod King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into","review":"I finally finished this book, based on other reviews I was hoping itwas going to get a lot better, it got a little better. There is no \\"error\\" on the answering machine as mentioned in another review, there were two answering machines and the policeman called the other one.So he's not insulting our intelligence (unless of course you count buying this book in the first place).It's a little like reading Dr.Seuss for adults with all his made upwords. The repetition of said words is absolutely maddening, doesthis man not have an editor to tell him this? I'm a bit of a King fanso this has been a very disappointing experience. I readthe other reviews and think maybe the problem is mine but nonethelessI found this to be a very difficult read which is not what I've come toexpect from Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I was totally disappointed...","review":"I love just about everything Stephen King has ever written, even some of his more offbeat novels, but I could not for the life of me figure out what the plot was in this story. I found passages in the book that were repetitious, boring and distracting. And what the heck is a \\"bool\\" anyway? I only made it about a 1/3 way through the book before I gave up in frustration of ever finding a thread of a plot. Please Mr. King, the public is hungry for a really juicy horror novel again like Carrie or The Stand. Come back to us Mr. King!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"When I get a new Stephen King book, I check out of the world for a while... I just read, read, read from the opening paragraph until the last word. I am spellbound by his books. An electric connection. I LOVE Stephen King.

I kept hoping it would get better.I don't think he wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I pushed to get through this. By the end I was glad it was over. Didn't like it at all. The story was slow and complicated with all the made up language.

But as a long-time SK fan, I feel obliged to at least finish it.It's been a while since I read a SK novel, gone are the days of a new one coming out each year, so perhaps I've changed and no longer have the patience for his style. But I just find the constant \\"smuckings\\" and little internal \\"stop that thought Lisey!\\" bits irritating, and, perhaps more importantly, unrealistic.He manages to keep my attention for some time because of the whole \\"what's going on?\\" question -- I need to keep reading to find out the mysterious bit (NOT the scary bit). But information needs to be doled out regularly or I grow impatient, just as I have with \\"Lost\\" on TV.Anyway, to summarize: irritating, not scary, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The best I can say is - tedious.

An author's widow is faced with the task of cleaning up her late husband, Scott's, study. While taking this on she is faced with: her past, her husband's past, a stalker and a sick sibling. In great King fashion we have the ever present supernatural aspect in his novels with Scott's special place, Boo'ya Moon.I thought this was a wonderful novel that I truly enjoyed. I have read many of King's works and although this differs from many it was one of my favorites. It didnt so much make me jump out of my seat scared, but rather made me think of a great love, a great relationship, a haunted past and a special place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"I was hesitant to give \\"Lisey's Story\\" five stars, primarily because it took SO long to get into (the first third of the book is slow and meanders somewhat). However, the book left me with so many indelible images and such profound sadness that I could not give it less. Clearly this is not a horror story. Certainly it has King's trademark fantasy oddities. But more than that, it is, as described, a love story. King's imagination and ability to create well-developed characters never ceases to amaze me. I've been a fan for many years and he is once again at the top of his game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort from King","review":"I have read most of his books and this one one of the dullest. Dealing with a widow and her constant interceptions in her head from her dead husband gets to be quite a bore. Even down to the predictable big monster King like to end his books with, this book was dull and disjointed from beginning to end.Cell - that now was interesting, with his standard gore. This was really really ordinary and boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"King reaches new low...","review":"And I thought SK had reached a low spot with \\"Song for Susanna\\" Lisey's story was the biggest piece of literary feces I have ever sifted through. I was actually embarrassed for SK for writing such nonsense. All the goo-goo ga-ga baby talk made it almost impossible to read and comprehend what the plot development was, which by the way NEVER occured. I remember the Stephen King days where if you read the book your hair stood up on your neck...the suspense in Liseys Story made me P.O'd to even be wasting my time reading it. Has SK been reduced to can-openers as his weapon of choice?The only reason(s) I finished this 500 page paperweight is it was a Xmas gift from my wife and she had already seen me start reading it and for pure curiosity of seeing how pathetic the story was going to get by the end.SK needs to stick with what works, good gut wrenching horror. I am just hoping that the last couple books are not an indication of the demise of a great suspense / horror writer.BTB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"Not your typical King read, in fact, I started to have a feeling that the beginning was written by his wife and that he finished it off. I felt like I was reading material written by a woman in the first half...then suddenly, it became a fast pace pretty good read. I am prejudice, I do seem to enjoy the male authors' more (with a few exceptions.) If you are looking for a good scare, this is not the book. If you are looking for a so-so read because you are bored with your life, then this is the book you want.

Some have been amazing (The Stand, Pet Semetary, The Dark Tower, The Shining, IT etc.) others really great as well (Salem's Lot, Needful Things, The Dark Half, Cell etc.) and then others I just couldn't get into (Bag of Bones comes to mind). Lisey's story falls into the latter category for me.I've been reading it on and off for a couple months now. I keep getting frustrated and reading something else (just finished reading \\"1984\\" again). The book's sitting right there on my nightstand looking at me, daring me to read it.The problem is that I keep zoning out while reading it. Lisey's internal thoughts and the back and forth is just getting plain annoying. Enough of the smucking and bools already. It gets old. Fast.I'm not sure if I'll finish reading it. I might just pop it on my shelf and read Nightmares and Dreamscapes again. Now THAT is a great collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still your typical well-written King novel","review":"This is not The Stand or IT, but still and unmistakenly well-written King novel. Not his best but certainly not his worst (I'd place is somewhere in the middle). I've always appreciated King's style of excruciating detail and character development and Lisey is no different. It seems that many readers today are looking for more remedial writing. If you want that I would suggest Dean Koontz.

This one isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't King Have an EDITOR?","review":"I tried. I pushed on just past 100 pages. What happened to the Stephen King who grabbed his readers on the first page and never let go?

Maybe it gets GREAT after pave 114...I couldn't spare the time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was he paid by the word?","review":"I'm a big King fan. That said, Lisey's story was disappointing. He tried to do something new but between all the flashbacks and made up words, a reader could lose interest. My wife put it down and never picked it up again.It seemed that he was paid by the word. He would use a cliche, and follow it up with other cliches meaning the same thing, like he was trying to come up with something new, a different way to skin a cat, trying to build a better mousetrap, a new spin on an old story. If that last sentence put you off then Lisey's story isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The king is dead.","review":"Another let down by $tephen.This book is not horror, it's horrible.

A few days later I flushed them down the toilet in a cloudy whirlpool of relief. This book was an over-winded, boring toture session that I somehow, inadvertenly, volunteered for. Thankfully this read was of my own accord, and not a signed contract. I am overjoyed I put it where it rightfully belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I took the time and patience to finish","review":"I took until about page 150 to decide to continue and am really glad I did.

I know it was a tough road in the beginning but I am ever so glad I was able to finish, I must say I almost loved it, certainly more than like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again!","review":"This is another attempt to show that he's can write more than horror stories, but it's a pretty bad romance story. If you like the stories that made him famous, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bool-ish","review":"Let me say, that I loved King since The Shining. I couldn't even finish The Stand the first time. When the devil Flagg went to the jail, I was creeped out and had nightmares for three smucking days. With the The Long Walk, I think he stretched to the moon and beyond. The Dark Towers series was excellent until book 6. Thereafter, I have my doubts...My wife recently borrowed Lisey's Story from the library. When she showed me, I was apprehensive.Well, she read all of eighteen pages, and swore to take it back to the library right away. But no...I had to read it first. Hoping that what she was saying was false.I was captured the first dozen pages or so, but when I hit page 16, with that flashback with Tony thinggummy. I was through. All the made up words and flashbacks just through me into a tizzy. However, as a fan with unconditional love, I will keep reading his works.

The fact that I didn't want to spend money on it should've told me something. And the one star I gave wasn't actually for the book. It was for me for holding on till page 175 and not throwing it out the window.I just couldn't get interested in any of these characters from page one and things didn't improve as the story went along. It may have gotten better further on into the book, but the way King was writing up to that point, I just didn't have the patience to hold on.What is wrong with King? He's done some good stuff here and there over the last few years, like \\"From a Buick 8\\", but by and large his work has been lacking some vital elements needed to pull you into the story. I don't what they are, but I know that they're missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of my comfort zone for sure","review":"My sister talked me into reading this. Hated it...too much sexualy explicit stuff, didn't like what happened with the two little boys, bad language. All was out of my comfort zone.

This is horrible Mr King","review":"This is a long boooooring, boooolish, bad gunky , waste of time read. I just read 11/22/63 and it was fantastic. This book is not. A friend and I are reading this simultaneously and we both find it horrible and a challenge to finish. I'm giving up after 450 pages because the story is lame and I don't care about the characters. I didn't waste a dime on this book and I'm happy about that. Very Bad and booooolish, babyluv Stephen King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King Surprises with Eloquent Love Story","review":"I really liked this book - very much. It was obvious to me that King is married to a not-as-well-known, nor popular, writer, Tabitha. The insights Kings wrote regarding what a Mrs. Stephen King (or Mrs. other popular celebrity) would feel were quite understandable, respectful and moving. King writes from his own personal history, I am sure. While I would classify this as an unusual love story, it is still classic Stephen King, with memorable characters, absorbing believable dialog, and some freaky nightmarish aspects thrown into the mix. I would now like to read more of Lisey's Story - Lisey Lives On, as it were. Great storytelling. Excellent work, Stephen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is \\"bad gunky\\"!","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet. I am a huge King fan. I was surprised when I saw this book at the store (b/c I didn't even know it was coming out). That said, I bought it right away. Well, bottom line is that it was terrible. The made up words were too much!!!! Bad gunky, bools, sowisa, etc....made me want to dump the book after about 100 pages. Also, I found the storyline to be too similar to the Secret Garden. If you are new to King's work, try the Dark Tower Series, or Talisman and Black Room. They will provide much more bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"PICKED THIS BOOK UP 3 TIMES TO ATTEMPT TO GET INTO IT, AFTER 1 HOUR EACH TIME I DECIDED IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, THE WRITING IS JUMBLED, THE STORY IS LACKING AND AFTER READING 100 PAGES IT STILL HADN'T HOOKED ME OR SPARKED ANY INTEREST TO KEEP GOING. DISAPPOINTMENT IS MY COMMENT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Talk","review":"I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in \\"IT\\", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. I'm going to go re-read \\"IT\\" now. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only King book I couldn't finish","review":"This is literally the only King book I couldn't finish reading.

Like many reviewers here, I found the imaginary language between Scott and Lisey to be truly annoying and unnecessary. I got about 400 pages in and couldn't go on any further and honestly I didn't care where the story was headed. Luckily my local Target had The Road by Cormac McCarthy in the bargain bin and I've started my summer reading that. Time much better spent in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really gave it a chance","review":"I really gave this novel a chance... over 250 pages. Then, I had to put it down. I didn't like the main character nor the words King uses over and over. I just found it to be juvenile and disjointed. Not to mention uninteresting and poorly written-- as an English prof. in my spare time. Read old school King if you want to see better writing; this book is not on par with any of the better King books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out. I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world. However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world. I was bored, and I gave up. Perhaps I will try again some time; the book is still weighing down the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This book was terrible. I have read every Stephen King book and short story out there, and have enjoyed most of them, but it was really hard getting through this one. The story was initially very difficult to follow, jumped around irritatingly, and never got going. I always finish what I start, so I felt obligated to finish the book, but it was the biggest waste of time since The Historian.The characters are irritating and don't react to situations appropriately. Their responses to danger often border on the ridiculous.My advice is not to even think about reading this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this is a book written by Tabitha King","review":"This book is an incoherent mess and pretty much unreadable. I used to look foward to each and every King book, but this one is the bottom of what has been a long slow slide. In a way this book is sort of like a very bad first draft of a book, perhaps it could have been a good book eventually. The plot was depressing and over the top, none of the characters are likeable or even developed as characters. The language, dialogue, and thoughts of the characters are uniformly unpleasant. The overuse of \\"smucking\\" and \\"bool\\" are annoying.I would sum this book up in one word: unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Talk","review":"Rarely if ever does King disappoint his readers. I read 200 pages of this novel until I finally couldn't take anymore of the eternally repetitous cutesy baby talk of Lisey's dead husband. It's just too drawn out and there is very little to grab this reader 200 pages into the book.I think this is only Stephen King book I did not want to finish. He still remains my favorite writer however. It is also too much of a Romance novel for me. Give me chills and blood, not sappy sentimentalism. Your time will be better spent reading instead his (Richard Bachman)book \\"Blaze\\", which is as good as King gets(and that's pretty damn good). Blaze is a page-turner that will keep you up at night, in the grand King tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"King sent me on a \\"bool\\", ad I didn't even get an RC at the end!!","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said? Meandering smucking book! I wasn't sure what was happening some of the time, it was WAY too long for the story...could have been told in less than half the pages! The only thing I can say is that it offered a nice diversion and helped me go to sleep at night! Not a real plus for a suspense writer. Pick one of the Dark Tower books, and you will be glad you did!! Leave thison the shelf as a last choice read.....That being said, Stepehn King is one of the greatest writers of all time, and my opinion of this books doesn't change my opinion about him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I like King, and this is one of his better ones. Not quite as good as The Stand or Hearts in Atlantis, but close. When it boils right down to it, it's a love story, and one that has a smidge of Nicholas Sparks. There was only one part I had some trouble with and that was believing the whole world of Boo ya Moon, an imaginary world that author Scott Landon often visits. If you can buy into this supernatural world, the story is perfect. Once I forced myself to care about it, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't, the story of Scott and Lisey's marriage makes it all worth it. By the time you finish with the book, you'll feel as if you know these two people, and you'll care very much about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aimless and annoying tale","review":"I love Stephen King's books - I can usually plow through even his less interesting stories. Lisey's Story was different. Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers, the so-called 'secret language' between Lisey and Scott was annoying from the first introduction of the word 'smuck', and King's use of this language was unrelenting. It was annoying and incomprehensible. The story itself meandered along with no real purpose, and finally led to a vapid end. The only thing I felt by the end of the book was relief that the experience was finally over. King usually creates interesting characters, but that is not the case in this book. Scott came across as a complete idiot, Lisey came across as a two-dimensional character who behaved in unbelievable ways. Overall, this is probably King's worse effort to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly L O N G and overwritten","review":"I'm a fan of old King from the 80's, but he's really gone overboard with this new book. Good writing doesn't mean you can tell a good story. There were a few fleeting moments of suspense, but for the most part, it's just nonstop rambling for hundreds of pages. I didn't like any of the characters in this and thought it was terribly overwritten. It takes him entire paragraphs to describe the most ordinary of acts, and by the time he finishes, all tension has fizzled into nothingness. I can only assume he keeps selling books because of public loyality. The fact that this won the Bram Stoker award last year for best novel tells me people voted for him by default, not having read the other finalists. It's a shame, and frankly, embarrassing. Don't waste your time with this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Unless the story picks up tremendously after the first one fourth of the book...I just couldn't keep going. It's sad too, I am a Stephen King fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I'd agree with some of the other reviewers that the use of \\"smuck\\" became really irritating; SOWISA got up my back a bit too. I would also agree that some of Lisey's reactions weren't believable - particularly cringeworthy, for example, is the scene in Boo'ya Moon where she is temporarily reunited with Scott, yet becomes petty and spiteful about ownership the \\"african\\" blanket \\"especially if it hurts him.\\" Odd, one would think, given that she's been grieving for this man she loved for 25 years and then lost. However, I'm glad I plodded beyond the first rather convoluted 200 or so pages; it was a suitably engaging read for summer holidays and helped make up for my disappointment at Cell, which I thought stank. The substance of Scott's childhood, and the way that victims of the long boy don't die but \\"live and scream\\" was truly unsettling.Not the Big Steve's best, but far from his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A severe miss!","review":"It amazes me what Stephen King can get away with some times. Make no mistake, King is an amazing writer and has written some of America's best horror novels. Here however, he buries a possible good story under four hundred pages of near indecipherable time/reality jumps with newly created words that do nothing for the reader or story. I was so disappointed by this novel. The usual King creepiness is there only sporadically the general plot was all over the place.

While cleaning out her husband's office and going through papers, Lisey finds herself being stalked which leads to dangerous encounters.We also find out about Lisey taking care of her mentally ill sister, Amanda.

Stephen King is one of the greatest storytellers of his time. If you're expecting a real Stephen King masterpiece like Pet Semetary, IT, or The Shining, then this is not it for you. The writing is beautiful and very original. He's creative. But, the story is boring and, in my opinion, a chore to get through. As I said, this was piece of originality and probably a creative endeavour for him, but he's better writing the scary stuff than this boring manuscript of 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Stephen","review":"I just did not get the whole story line.

Particularly the early, funny ones.\\"The same is with Stephen King who got lost in himself somewhere in the early 1990s.Lisey's Story is neither Christine nor The Shining. It's neither Pet Sematary nor Salem's Lot. Bluntly, it's more like a lot of blah blah blah tucked into 600 pages. Sometimes, you may get the creepy feeling that King let his comupter do most of the job by itself.It won't hurt King to take a long break, relax and search for the roots of good writing. I think he can afford that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No smucking good!","review":"As a long time reader of Stephen King's books, it took me two tries to get into this book.

There definitely is a slow unwind at the start for the first hundred and fifity pages or so, but I personally found much of it engaging. Beyond the main love story and Lisey's coping with grief over the loss of her writer husband, much of the book deals with Scott's damaged childhood, and the outlets the creative mind take to cope and fabricate in order to survive, but also in his case, to thrive.The climax for me was a slight disappointment, however the book overall was a reinvigorated and different world for King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Steve","review":"You'd think he was paid by the word.

The Colorado Kid, The Cell, and the first 50 miserable pages of Lisey's Story simply don't take the reader anywhere. King's writing has morphed into this artsy mess that bears no resemblance to his classic works.The average reader wants a PLOT. We want a clear introduction, a clear conflict, and we want to be able to take guesses as to how the conflict might be resolved. We read to escape the outside world and to get caught up in plot. But with Lisey's Story, I find myself wanting to escape this pathetic novel.I've never abandoned a book by King, but there's first time for everything..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet","review":"No one is giving this 5 stars without a vested interest in the book doing well.

He is one of the best writers ever--for me not because of his penchant for horror but because of his canny grasp of human psychology. He's been one of my gods for a long time. Which makes it all the more sad to see him stooping to this drool. I agree with the reviewer who said King should heed his own excellent advice from ON WRITING and cut out the bad-gucky stuff. Come on, Mr. King. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor effort from the master of fiction","review":"I have read all of Stephen King's books with the exception of the Dark Tower Series. Over the years his work has brought me much pleasure. So it is with reluctance that I say this book is simply awful! Far worse than even Desperation and The Regualtors. Using such words as Smucking instead of a similar commonly used word beginning with an F and talking about Bools the book is ridiculous! I honestly wonder if he didn't let his wife or kids have a shot at writing and just put his name to it! In the past I have bought hard copies of his books without reading the reviews as I always liked them, but in future I will be careful before sinking my hard earned money into such drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless things...","review":"This book is too slow and too boring. Unless you are totally bored and have nothing else to do, do not spend your precious time on these 600+ pages of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and a bit silly.","review":"Liseys Story is not the best of King. It is the tale of a widow of a famous writer who had a bizarre sense of humor. It was long, had extended parts of irrelevant banter, and had an inordinate amount of made up words. Lisey and her dead husband practically had their own language of stupid words, and King makes the reader learn each and every one of them throughout the course of the book. The book does start to get interesting about 300 pages in, when a madman pulls out all the stops in order to acquire the dead authors unpublished manuscripts. However, by the time this occurs in the book I actually hated the main character and was cheering for the villain. This book would have been a decent novella or short story, all he had to do was cut out 400 pages of the silly talk and get down to the action.Even the biggest fan should ignore Lisey's Story...Relic113"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I've read everything that Stephen King has written and have enjoyed most, if not all, of his books. This book, however, is the first and only one that I've actually put down and considered never picking up again. It was truly grueling, but I did force myself through it -- reading just a few pages at a time before dozing off! If you manage to get through the first half of the book, you finally get a sense of where the story is going and it starts to move along and become a little more interesting. Although King seems to have fun making up words and phrases, it is so excessive in this book that it becomes extremely annoying. I was relieved when I finally finished the book and didn't have to pick it up again. I kept wondering if King was having a good laugh thinking about all of the fools that would buy this book simply because he wrote it! He had to have some idea what his readers would think, but I guess he didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed...","review":"This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.

I got to page 332 and hung it up. Honestly, this is the first SK book I was bored enough with to put down. Major plot hole; if 'Lisey\\" has 20 million bucks, and doesn't trust the police, why doesn't she hire a body guard?I guess I'll never find out , because I can't get through this.

You know those annoying couples who have cute little inside words for things? This is an entire book of that. Smucking, Gunkie, SOWIESA, Boule, Bouja Moon, African (for a afghan)... they keep bringing them up incessantly as if to remind you how tight a couple they are.

Because 'The King' wrote it, I gave it try after try, but just could not get interested in the main character - could care about her (ongoing...and ongoing...) inner conflict or ramblings. Pass this one up or get it for your collection maybe. He's done much better work and I am hoping he does so again, but I haven't been happy with the latest offerings.

I used to thoroughly enjoy his earlier work. Over the years he has had the ability to begin with an initial provocative idea. However, his recent novels wind up going NOWHERE. The details are unendingly boring and go on and on ad nauseum...I tried Cell and at times ,I found myself laughing at the inanity of it. I vowed never to read another of his novels, only any short stories - if he could limit his excruciatingly wandering prose.I picked up Lisey's Story based upon some good reviews by publications that I have valued( Hah! ) with the thought that it might be a gem ...unlike his recent work. However, after a hundred pages or so I found myself enjoying it as much as I would having to walk through waist-high mud.

This one is a good one, though if there is such a thing as a typical Stephen King story, this is one. Ghosts, crazy men, other worlds, it's all here, though at times it doesn't make much sense. And some things are never really explained, just more of the realm of King. I will say King has gotten much much better at writing women. The style of writing is on one hands typical of King's later work and on the other, atypical of his work, with lots of stops and starts. It is a little clunky."},{"rating":"2","title":"like most sk books...","review":"apart from the dark tower, most SK books start out with some back story that doesnt seem that interesting at first. but when you get to the end and think back on those things, it makes it all well worth while. this book was like that as well. the first half or so i read rather slowly for me. it took me a week or 2 to get through that part. when i reached the middle and had gotten to really know lisey and scott a little better, i devoured the rest. one day. i loved it. as far as his love stories go, i probably liked bag of bones better, but i really enjoyed this one as well. the little things between lisey and scott were what made it for me. their little lingo and the private things they shared are what relationships are all about. they are what makes them great, so it was really cool to get a window into that with charachters you really care about. well done, but i like everything he does:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book has far too much baby talk.

I like the character of Lisey, strong and passionate, in love with her husband and going through the grieving process. It took me at least the first hundred pages to get an understanding on what was going on.

His writing in this book is the opposite of economical. Extravagant? Seems too polite a term for his running on at the mouth.As irritating at the \\"private language\\" is the way King has Lisey run through lists of worn-out cliches, followed by \\"As the saying goes.\\" He piles on several cliches about dying (kicking the bucket, buying the farm, cashing your checks, etc.) as well as vomiting (tossing cookies, etc.)and lots of other examples. To what end? To place such cliches in the mouth (or mind) of a character is no excuse for bloating your novel with them.When he's good (as in his short stories for The New Yorker magazine, and some novels), he's very good.

I've enjoyed the sparse use of made-up language in his other books, but this is too much.It demeans Lisey. It comes off as childish and affected. The reviews attempt to justify it as showing the deep, loving bond between Lisey and Scott.

This writer who is supposed to be the love of her/our(?) life comes across as a whiny selfish effeminate bluecollar wannabe. Answering his fans with lines like \\"No can do Brother\\". It surpised me that King should paint the writer in these unflattering terms, since it is obvious that the writer is King (like always). Maybe he thought this was a likelable heroic portrait.Is King even still actually writing these novels?

For chapped dry hands in winter that sting when any other lotion or cream is applied, Kamillosan actually soothes the pain on contact as well as speeds healing. It's great for scrapes and small cuts such as those painful splits beside the nail of the fingers in winter. Usually one or two applications covered with a plastic bandage is all that's required to mend the skin. I wish it was available to buy in Canada.

While Welty wrote several novels, including the entertaining Robber Bridegroom, her reputation rests mainly on her short stories. This collection contains many of her most famous stories and shows well the range of her writing. Welty was an extremely skilful writer who could vary her writing style from the lyrical to the concise. Welty's work seems to inspire dichotomous reactions; either rapture or dislike. I find her work interesting but not compelling. This book is an excellent means to decide whether or not you wish to invest the a significant amount of time in reading Welty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was worse then expected.","review":"Do not read this book unless you like short stories or are required to do so. Each story is like reading the exposition of a novel, which is the most uninteresting part. Here are some of what the stories are about: 1) A woman who lives at the post office and has male relatives who wear dresses 2) A man who's wife said she drowned herself because he came home late, so the man went to look for here body in the river AND 3) Two mentally challenged people who want to get married and one is a xylophone player If these sound interesting to you get the book.

If you don't know anything about Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, no problem, you will most likely still enjoy this film. This was Massimo Troisi's last, he died just after the movie was completed. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is outstanding in this. Set design, cinematography, and landscapes are all great. Sound might have used a bit of improvement in a couple of spots, as Troisi's character had a tendency to speak in low tones, he was at times difficult to understand. Note that this film is in Italian, with English subtitles. As usual, the subtitles do not precisely match the Italian words spoken, but the general meanings remain the same.

It fails to incorporate the full depth of Mario's story and brings it out of its true-to-life context. Still, it retains enough to stand as a poignant story. Read the book if you liked the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will be disappointed if you listened to the hype","review":"This is a pleasant, easy-paced small film. One attempts to identify with young Mario, but the character fails to develop, except as a kind of political hero for Italian communists. The Pablo Neruda character wasn't developed at all. There was very little plot (no, I wasn't looking for \\"car-chases\\" or violence or sex). If you are tired when you begin watching, you might fall asleep. It was engaging enough to keep my attention, but I was well-rested. The best part of the film was the English translation of the Pablo Neruda poem shown at the end. I am glad to have seen Il Postino because (1) it was a pleasant way to spend a boring Saturday afternoon, and (2) I learned of the beautiful, haunting poetry of Neruda. In short, it was nice, but over-hyped by Miramax. And it became a sort of \\"must-see\\" for self-styled intellectuals and the otherwise pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this movie...","review":"but I ended up turning it off minutes before the end, out of sheer and desperate boredom. I really did not like the main \\"common man\\" character guy--he annoyed me. The story dragged on and on until I feared it would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie wasn't as good as all the reviews I had read. Infact, it was pretty boring. The story is underdeveloped and not verybelievable. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking however, as isMaria Grazia Cucinotta.In the midst of a pre-WW2 economicdepression, Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi) takes on a part-time jobdelivering mail to the remote cliff-side home of the famous poet PabloNeruda (Philippe Noiret). Poor and lonely, Mario becomes infatuatedwith the wealth, fame, and sex-appeal of Pablo. Trying to imitatehim, he tries his own hand at poetry while courting the beautifulBeatrice (Cucinotta).The movie becomes very annoying with itspro-communism sub-theme, and the DVD desperately needs Englishdubbing. Sub-titles get old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"After reading the reviews for this film, I had high hopes for an enjoyable evening--with popcorn and cokes at the ready. However, this move fails in many ways. It is not about Mario's romance (as described) but about his relationship with the famed poet. When Mario speaks, he mumbles, slurs his words, and often does not face the person listening to him. In addition, he speaks so slowly that all sympathy for him is lost. No one watching the film with me found anything funny in the film, yet it is described as a \\"romantic comedy.\\" Other parts of the film are predictable and boring. One person with me fell asleep watching it. Another spent time petting the dog. As for myself, I was continually angry at the advertising deception used to market this film. Compared to U.S. films, it rates an 8 on a 10 scale. The plot is good, and of course the scenery is nice. As a watchable film, however, it rates about a 2, or perhaps 1.5 on a 10 scale compared to international films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorification of collaborator in mass murder","review":"If this movie used a mythical accomplished poet to build the story around, I would find it a pleasant if light diversion. But it not only gives us Neruda, it is unabashedly enthusiastic about Neruda's remorseless support for Stalinist mass murder. He may have created interesting metaphors, but he was unable to comprehend morality. It wasn't that Soviet crimes were unknown in Neruda's time, it was that he chose to support them. His career was devoted to extolling Marxism, and he accepted the Stalin prize from the Soviet murderers.It is impossible to imagine a film made today that glorified an artist who was a Nazi, but we are still subjected to the mythmaking that, at once, conceals and implicitely justifies communist mass slaughter. The movie does not merely place the characters in the time of Soviet brutality, and refer in passing it, it shamelessly revels in communism. It is thin and evil propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"a visual poem","review":"pablo neruda helps an ordinary man win the woman of his dreams...and both men learn about the meaning of friendship , honor and standing up for your principles. the settings are gorgeous, the acting flawless and the message timeless. i have long been a fan of neruda's poetry. i WISH i could like write like him..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss the late great Massimo.","review":"Yet another of my very favorite films, and another in which literature plays an important part. Massimo Troisi plays Mario, a timid man who simply exists day to day without much hope or imagination. He lives in an idyllic Italian fishing village, where he pines for the lovely Beatrice. Enter the exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, who's tutelage in poetry and the art of seduction inspire Mario to persue his dreams. A subtle, though brilliant jewel of a film, understated and yet wonderfully articulated. Troisi gives a heartbreakingly true performance, while Philippe Noiret (a giant star of international cinema) is both charming and eloquent as Neruda. Add to this a haunting score by Luis Bacalov and the unwavering beauty of the Italian seascape, and you have a nearly perfect romatic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Movie Wrong Format","review":"I was very disappointed when it was discovered that the DVD that I had ordered from Amazon would take over two weeks to arrive because it was coming from a supplier in Italy (understandable given the origin of the movie)I was doubly disappointed when it became apparent that my new Sony DVD player did not recognize the format of the disc and could not play it.

Now, I find that \\"Lost in the Amazon\\" is just a re-titled version of \\"Extreme Exposure.\\" \\"Lost in the Amazon\\" was at best improperly titled since the expedition remains on course for the duration of the trip. It is indeed an adventureless story that the author has attempted to refashion into a life threatening ordeal. In short, the book about Kilpatrick's plodding through the jungle and he's bothered by bugs, the heat and the rain.

But after the initial killings take place, the book enters a slooooooowwww period that goes on and on and on, until the blatantly predictable ending. I'm the kind of person who never sees the \\"twist\\" in movies coming, but the ending of this book was waving a yellow flag from three miles away.As a wimpy white belt who just started karate a month ago, I did enjoy reading the bits concerning the dojo and different Japanese ideas. But the idea that this adjunct college professor (we are never given an explanation of how he is able to read Japanese-- did they teach that in kempo?) who has trained in martial arts in his spare time is able to rise to the level that he does... it certainly stretches the plausibility factor more than a Jackie Chan movie. At the end I was just waiting for this book to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack Luster at best","review":"I found this book to be a very Unreal, the combat was writen as if by someone who has never been in a real fight in there life. only trained in the world of make believe. the author also likes to keep his characters in a tight stereotype, the japanes masters who do not like whites, the white student trying to be more like his japanes master, the master who is above all.if you want to read a very good seires martial arts books that are more basied in reality try the Rain books by Barry Eisler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I suppose martial artists might find it interesting and there are some interesting thoughts concerning sensei but wow! this is just a terrible story.

The only reason I watched and reviewed it is because it was released by Criterion. The film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood. There is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by. It got an X-rating by the MPAA and was banned in many parts of the US.The film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement. When her apartment is broken into, the burglar falls in love with her.The only special feature on the DVD is an interview with the film's director, Barbet Schroeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"The joy of 70s films","review":"Although the subject matter is risque, the cool, unstylised camera work and authentic acting make MAITRESSE a far, far better film than others in the \\"adult\\" genre. Barbet Schroeder cut his directing teeth on documentaries and it shows: the weird and extreme scenes hover between funny, frightening and banal - the audience isn't told what to feel or think, and have to decide for themselves. The whole affair feels real and human, and it's relaxed and unself-conscious in a way that modern movies, especially Hollywood films, just aren't anymore. Bulle Ogier, as the maitresse, is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Training Set up","review":"An e-collar is the way to go.

As much great fun as this DVD is if your a fan of the domestic goddess that is Brini, I was disappointed that the Season One DVD only in actuality had the first half of the season and not the full season in it's entirety.I also unfortunetly found out that the Style Network is not renewing Brini's contract for a second season, so for fans of this fabulous domestic diva I really hope that the Style Network will release the rest of 'her' season onto DVD.I can't recommend this DVD enough, it's great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Martha Stewart on Bad Drugs","review":"The premise of this show holds great potential: a drag queen hosting a Martha Stewart-style show.

Although it worked well for international adoption, the book also had ideas and sections for foster children, older children and domestic adoptions. In additiona, Beth includes sample pages and helps with wording for tough situations like abuse, neglect, and lack of information on birth parents.Overall a great book, easy to read, full of ideas, and worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"positive","review":"Awesome!!

We never get too much background on him, nor why he does anything that he does, but we do get a relationship development theme. What made this stand out was the writing regarding the police, they were shown as actually figuring out the mysteries surrounding the story (instead of them being oblivious and looking dumb). Not the most conclusive ending for the characters, but I liked it.The DVD clarity is good and the sound is adequate; the supplement is a 16 minute making-of that had some good behind the scenes about Keaton's thought process on both sides of the camera. 3.5 for the film and DVD quality, .5 for the supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Keaton, the Sleeping Giant","review":"Those who know and admire Keaton's work will long have considered him both underappreciated and diverse. From madcap comedies like Night Shift and Mr. Mom to harrowing dramas like Clean & Sober and Game 6, Keaton is one of our most valued cinematic resources all but ignored in modern Hollywood. And yet, he was somehow able to secure financing and helm this touching character study about loneliness. It's a quiet film, the kind you have to lean into and meet on its own terms. While it may involve a hit man, an abused woman and a meddlesome policeman, The Merry Gentleman is independent to the bone. The pacing is very deliberate and static. And while it may not be for everyone, if you favor stillness over bombast, character over action, you should be pleasantly surprised by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Film directed by Michael Keaton","review":"I have always enjoyed Michael Keaton's performances. He can be both funny and fierce in such a mellow way. It is sad that he has not appeared in better fare, but such is life it seems. This movie has his touch, after all he is the director, though the star is Kelly MacDonald. I enjoyed how though he is a hitman in this story he is still nonchalant even if suicidal. It is what it is, a mellow story about a hitman who seems a bit transformed by a lovely lady. It's not a romantic story, but a unique in all its ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did this author come form?","review":"Let me just say.....WOW!!!

I wanted an infant tub I could use on a counter until they were able to sit on their own and be in the actual bath tub. However, when placed in this infant tub the water barely covers the legs of the baby being bathed and my boys hate it and cry because they are cold. I've tried covering their bellies with a washcloth when washing to keep them warm, but they hate it. I thought they just didn't like baths until I bathed them in a tub that was deeper and they could be more submerged and they LOVED it. Also, the angle of the seat makes it easy for them to throw their bodies forward or sideways while being bathed. I would not recommend this tub to any parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional at best","review":"I bought this for my 4 month old daughter since she's temporarily out grown the sink. The foam back and crouch support keeps her from sliding down but need to be more concave. My daughter can easily roll side to side and had nearly rolled right out of the tub. It also makes it very hard to wash her back, butt and groin areas. The tub's not very deep and is designed so she sits up out of the water which causes her to get cold easily. And being as only her feet are really in the water she tends to kick and splash a lot. The pivoting handle is useful to hang the tub on the shower curtain rod. The plug in the bottom of the tub helps drain it afterward and doesn't leak. The temperature indicator is very helpful showing if the water is too cold, too hot or just right. It's an okay tub until my daughter can sit up better and we can go back to using the sink."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby bath tub","review":"I ordered this for my grandchild to be.....it'sa great size (room for growing) and the price was great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Incorrect Labeling for Toilet Tanks","review":"Dear Amazon Shoppers:I have looked for this product (Decor Brass Tank Lever KTAL5) for six months and finally found a decent price (albeit 75% the cost of its Overstock.com matching KB605AL bathroom faucet).

Everything is in detail and he also shares his positive and negative experiences, so that we, his readers, can learn from it. He gives so many examples, and shares his stories in detail. This book answers alot of questions and is definitely great for a beginner. I bought this book as a gift for someone and they love it just as much as i do. If anything, give it a try. It is also the best thing you can do for yourself. I rate this book higher than 5 star, it really is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Book To Learn About ESP","review":"When I bought Psychic Development for Beginners, I had expected a lot of useless New Age silliness but I was surprised to find that the author really knows his subject. He knows that the true key to psychic abilities is being able to enter the theta state, and points this out quite often. The only problem is that the exercises he has, doesn't help much to achieve that end, though. If you could enter that elusive theta brainwave state, then the exercises would be of considerable value but those exercises won't help you get into alpha or theta; you have to figure that out for yourself it seems.But that matter aside, the author covers a lot of ground and provides considerable and reliable information for someone who has no previous knowledge of ESP and psychic phenomena other than what they might have seen in the movies or on TV. This is indeed a very good book for begining psychics and I don't know of any book that's any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was actually helpful","review":"I did try Sonia Chouquette's books and I agree with the reviewer that this one is a good addition.

I could not wait to do the exercises and took particular care not to rush through them. To cut to the chase, in spite of my commitment to these exercises, my psychic abilities are still at point zero. This is not a book for the serious wannabe psychic. If you are a psychic junkie like me, learn to spend your dollars wisely. Preview the chapters of the displayed book and use the \\"surprise me\\" option to get a feel if you connect with the writer and/or the content.

Well,go ahead and make your lists now - your \\"deja vu\\" experiences, correct intuition experiences, little voices telling you otherwise. Then do the pendulum and playing card challenges.

After a few basic mental exercises to easily and quickly go to 'your basic psychic level', the rest of the book is mostly a long list of pleasant case stories intermixed with very short and easy descriptions on how to do something similar - just by asking your higher mind and/or guide/angle for it.I see the value of the book as an appetizer to a potentially wonderful and very pleasant life with just about any power and knowledge one could imagine. But it will probably not make you a psychic unless you are already VERY close. Perhaps one should keep in mind that the author has a background in hypnotherapy and builds somewhat on (self-) suggestion.I bought the book because of some exercises mentioned in a review, and indeed some of them might show up to be beneficial over time. As usual, this will depend more on the student than the teacher.

I think he made it because he had some ideas he wanted to exploit, and above all, the film is a hommage to 1930s theatre.The setting is... New York in the 1930s - Broadway, the Mob, the lot. And Allen once again uses his choice of surroundings to back up the typical atmosphere of the showbiz industry, with its minor and major scandals. In fact, this could be interpreted as a parody on today's Hollywood! 'Cause 'Bullets Over Broadway' may be a hommage, but it certainly is a parody as well. In the unique Woody Allen way!It's beuatifully done - the actors are very well chosen (nearly stereotyping their roles, ach and every one of them!), and the whole scenery, the colours, the atmosphere are just so over-1930s!A witty and entertaining film, worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullets Over Korea","review":"I love the film itself but this copy is bad.

Not just one of the actors, but all of them. And the main actors were the worst of all. The plot was so ridiculous that just the setting up for what would be the main plot was beyond belief. The guy escapes from 2 guards sent to watch over him at a funeral he is allowed to go to and, as if that isn't unbelievable enough, he then takes their car, gets hit by a train and jumps over an 8 foot chain link fence to finish the get away.

Personally, I see the plot as a mimic of \\"The Negotiator\\" (with Samuel L. Jackson), which should not imply anything bad about the movie.

I realize he is in his early sixties now but the voice is strained and the performance shabby. Just to be sure I went back and listened to \\"Live Evil\\" from the early eighties. He was so powerful then. Fortuitiously for me, I saw Dio several times in this period, solo and with Black Sabbath. This performance was an embarrasment (like watching a train wreck).

I really recommend this album if you want something that is simply up beat, inspiring and easy to relate to. It's an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD","review":"I enjoy this album as it has a variety of different music styles on it. I agree with the other reviewer who felt Kathy might take flak because of it. However, it is an upbeat cd. It makes me smile, tap my foot, and I certainly enjoy listening to it at work.

It has a \\"slightly more mature\\" sound, or perhaps it is her spirt), but certainly contemporary. It is clear that these songs come out of a heart that has been through some pain and has come out on the other side, and in the end says \\"All is well.\\" I also like the refreshing view that Kathy portrays about going through hard times in the song \\"Break my heart.\\" It basically says that if it takes hard times for you to break my heart, then go ahead, Break my heart. Helps one realize that \\"it's been in the rain that I have grown through all the sorry I have known...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety: the spice of life","review":"Wow what an album! Pop--most definitely. A departure, yes--although Kathy has sung so many different flavors, it's hard to label one above the other as a departure! It's definitely different from the Corner of Eden album that was mentioned earlier, but then so was Love and Mercy, Sounds of Heaven, Sentimental Christmas.....I could go on. As for lyrical depth, I find every bit as much here as I do in all her previous work: incredible honesty, passion and insight. I have to admit this album took a little longer to creep \\"under my skin\\" than did the last three--probably because I really do like rich and mellow over pop. But different doesn't mean bad. Variety is the spice of life, and there's something for everyone here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Maiden fan!","review":"I have been a die-hard Iron Maiden fan since roughly 1990. Having read several interviews, articles, etc. about the band this book gave me a great insight into the world of Maiden like no other source has before. I already knew all the big, major stories of the band - how they formed, hooked up with their management, got a record deal, made it big, etc., but \\"Run To The Hills\\" offers a lot of detail into the lives of the various band members, how they grew up, when and how they started playing music and ultimatley how they ended up in the world's biggest heavy metal band. There's quite a bit of humor in this book, as well as some sad tales. If you are just a casual fan of the music, it's still a very enjoyable read and if you are a hardcore fan of Eddie and the boys like myself, you probably have already read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden 4-Ever","review":"This is a really great book. Not only as it is the biography of one of the greatest heavy metal bands: Iron Maiden written by excellent writer Mick Wall (of Kerrang / Classic Rock fame). The book perfectly describes the bands unique determination to keep playing and growing continuously as band members are exchanged and overall music trends are changing.The band's story is very inspirational and instills the mantra to never give up and keep fighting for what you thing is right will give results. Well recommended to all fans of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mick Wall, you suck......","review":"The book is okay, it gives a little background to the members of Maiden. Other then that it blows major chunks.

It is rife with political cynicism and disillusionment, as well as artistic expression and innovation.

Edward Norton and Matt Damon are good actors, but this is a terrible film for no other reason than that I don't believe them in these roles one tiny bit. Norton thinks he's \\"Mean Streets\\"-era De Niro and guess what? He's not. Who knows what Damon is doing but his supposedly know-all voice-over is laughable. As out of place as these guys are, they're the BETTER part of the cast. Malkovich has the WORST Russian accent ever. I expect better from him. Yet the lowest of the low is Gretchen Mol who proves that a pretty face doesn't translate well to the screen when you have a speaking part. Her attractiveness quotient plummets in this film. Hopefully she'll stick to being motionless on magazine covers from here on out, but I know that we can't be that lucky.You want a good movie with cards as a backdrop? Get \\"House of Games\\" which is infinitely better than this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible DVD","review":"This DVD is not worth buying, unless you are a huge fan of the movie!

As for John Dahl, \\"The Last Seduction\\" was your last great movie. If you want to make more movies like \\"Rounders\\" go work with Jean Claude at his 'straight to video' studio. And Miramax!

It's one of those movies that you end up watching again and again just for the sheer pleasure of it if you understand and perhaps even embrace its ethos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.","review":"\\"Rounders\\" is the kind of movie that you don't expect too much before seeing it, but after a while watching it, you realize that the movie is actually very interesting. \\"Rounders\\" takes us to the underworld of the gambling and the card games, a world that can make you rich in 5 minutes, or can leave you without a dollar in 5 minutes.The movie has two main characters, Mike (Matt Damon) and \\"Worm\\" (Edward Norton. Thank God they didn't use that pathetic actor named Ben Affleck for the role of \\"Worm\\"). During the movie, we see this two charismatic dudes, Mike & \\"Worm\\" using a lot of very interesting tricks in the card games, and that's one of the main reasons why this movie is very, very amusing.\\"Rounders\\" is a very interesting film, with a very charismatic cast, and good editing, specially when we see the tricks used by Mike, \\"Worm\\", and the crazy russian Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). If you like card games or movies about gambling, \\"Rounders\\" is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great plot....great dialogue","review":"Don't really understand the last and only review for this movie. Either that guy was watching some other movie, or he is totally incapable of determining great movies due to his ignorance (I'm leading toward the second reason). Watch this movie, nothing is predictable, and everything is well made. Matt Damon was great and Edward Norton was better. And Malcovich, well, what can you say, he's Malcovich!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine effort even though it&#65533;s derivative.","review":"\\"Rounders\\" is basically Steve McQueen's \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\" modernized (and \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\" is basically a good attempt at copying Paul Newman's classic \\"The Hustler\\" with poker instead of pool. Luckily, \\"Rounders\\" works very well and has some solid performances throughout (although I'm not sure what to make of Damon's girlfriend in the film). What sets \\"Rounders\\" apart is the narrative that runs throughout the film, giving the audience an insider's look at the finer points of the \`game'. Normally, when a film attempts to insert a lot of narration, it sadly detracts (\\"Blade Runner\\" is a good example). In this case, however, the narration is timely and really adds to the film. Between 1 and 10, \\"Rounders\\" gets a marginal 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!!","review":"Matt Damon was as incredible as he was in Good Will Hunting and for an actor I've never seen before Ed Norton played an absolutely great character. John Malkovich was astonishing. See this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it would help if I was a bigger fan of poker...","review":"Another Ed Norton movie, this one also starring Matt Damon. And John Malkovich, although I almost didn't recognize him at first. Problem is, I'm not a fan of poker or gambling, and none of the characters are particularly likable, so this did little for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best Poker Movie","review":"This movie has the most poker content of any movie. And the pokercontent is realistic, unlike many other popular poker movies. Itmainly portrays New York's underground card rooms but also poker ina casino and in home games. It also shows the ugly side of losing andthe fun of winning.The story is a good one, though Hollywood, and stands on its own. Itgives the viewer enough to think about for life, not just at the cardtable. The main draw however (other than poker) is the acting.Edward Norton especially does a great job in creating an antihero whois likable but in the end is someone to avoid.I highly recommend the movie. Be warned that the language has plentyof profanity and poker terms unfamiliar to most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Matt Damon and Edward Norton are at their best in this flick about childhood friends who find themselves in a rather difficult situation and are forced to gamble in order to get out of it. Worm (Norton) upon his release from prison is forced to settle old debts. Damon tries to help his longtime friend, but ends up caught in the middle of his debts. Great supporting cast including Martin Landau, Famke Janssen, Gretchen Moll, John Turturro as a sort of mentor to Damon and John Malkovich as the notorius Teddy KGB.Highly recommend even to those who don't like to play cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Poker Movie","review":"Rounders is a great movie about the underground poker clubs in NY.I do what it at least once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie - and not just for card sharks","review":"Rounders is the type of show that will appeal to more than just card sharks. Despite many of the other reviewers here, I felt that Damon's (his character's) struggle to be the best, to find out if he's good enough to play with the best in the world, was interesting enough if people do not understand cards. Damon's character continously bailing out a friend devoid of common sense will ring true to many people. Sure, there was a fair amount of jargon in the show, but people may find it interesting. Ed Norton was excellent in his role as Worm, and John Malkovich was very good as KGB - even if his accent was less than perfect. I would recommend this film to all - not just card enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta have a love for the game","review":"Had I seen this movie prior to my (current) addiction to the World Series of Poker, I probably would have panned this movie. I love the philosophy and the playing tips more than I like the acting. Malkovich was killing me with that Russian accent-but still the film comes out to be very entertaining. Recommended to poker lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"All In","review":"if you're an avid poker player like me, you absolutely must own this film. not only is it an entertaining film but its portrayal of poker play and psychology of the game is fairly accurate. the cast is great, in particular norton playing the low life cheat and malkovich as teddy kgb with the incredibly funny accent and \\"don't touch\\" sign on his stack of oreos. damon also does a good job as the poker player converted square who realizes hes a poker player at heart.-just to note this has nothing to do with the movie: to all you scrubs who think any two suited cards, J 5, Q 5, and such are good starting hands, always chase till the river, go all in against a tight player with your middle pair, have no regard for kickers, and don't understand a thing about positional play, quit playing and save your money. ever since this recent poker explosion going on i been seeing too many of you suckers in the poker rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about Matt Damon","review":"He's not a great actor. In fact, he pretty much sucks and ruined Rounders for me. John Turturro should be receiving all the praise for this film. He is always excellent and saved a good story from Damon's acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely my favorite","review":"I watched this movie before I knew how to play poker and loved it- Matt Damon and Edward Nortan are incredible actors and having John Malkavich as a character just puts a cherry on top! Oh and Famke Jensen! double cherries! The acting is incredible, the story is unique and new and fun, the language is cool. Everything about this movie is great. I later learned how to play poker and love it just as much or more. You don't have to be a poker player to love it! You might have to watch it more than once to get the gist, but you'll want to anyway! Edward Nortan is easily my favorite actor- see this movie then check out his others! I swear I watch this movie at least once a week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROUNDERS- AWESOME FLICK!","review":"For anyone who has any knowledge, and for some who don't, Rounders is an enjoyable film. Matt Damon is awesome in this movie! Adding to the cast are Edward Norton (Primal Fear), and John Malkovich (Need I mention his countless movies?). This movie flat-out makes me want to go win some money. The poker strategy is explained for those who don't know much of the game. The only way to describe this movie is TENSE! How they can make a poker movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat is beyond me but this movie does just that! Be prepared to want to go play some Poker after this one.

Of all of the gambling games, poker tends to be a thinking man's game. Matt Damon and Edward Norton prove that in this film. The core of the plot, a man conflicted by what he should do versus what he wants to do, is clearly shown in this film. As always it takes a catalyst to drive you on the path you were meant to go. Brilliant film. Flashback sequences actually make sense in this film. I can only say that I am a fan of poker, by no means an expert, and this film got me really thinking about the motives of some of my opponents. If you read my profile you'll know that my background is in futures trading. So the skills I learn from poker easily transfer over to how calm and collected I am when I trade the markets."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artistic view on a popular sin","review":"Rounders is an amazing movie that delves into the deep life of a smart street poker player. For those who actually know how to play poker, this movie will be very exciting even without all of the non-poker scenes. For those who do not know how to play poker, Matt Damon's struggle to be something he's not will enthrall you. The only problem that I have with this movie is how annoying Edward Norton's character can be. Every 5 minutes he does something wrong and then apologizes, i feel like grabbing him and saying, why dont u stop apologizing and just stop being an idiot. But the movie is still excellent and should be a treat for many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poker & Friendship","review":"A very good movie featuring two of the better Hollywood young guns. I really like Matt Damon and Ed Norton & Norton takes the opportunity to shine in this. John Malkovich appears and delivers a great performance for a fairly small role.In terms of the DVD you're thinking about buying (why else read this page?), the image is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen and overall is pretty great. Colors are vivid and the picture is sharp and detailed. The sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and, while not a spectaular action epic with extreme use of surrounds, this soundtrack presents the dilolgue clearly.Bonus supplements? Just the trailer.Okay, so it isn't loaded with bonus materials, but buy this flick for the movie and the performances from Norton, Damon and Malkovich!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, psychological movie","review":"Plenty has been said about \\"Rounders\\" authenticity, and I won't further run that into the ground here. I will add that this simplest point they make is in Matt Damon's last ditch chance to save his relationship. Poker is not a game of luck. If you accept that it is a game of skill and how you play matters more than the cards you get, then you can appreciate the truth of the film.\\"Rounders\\" is more interesting when examined from the perspective of Matt Damon's character, who has two balls in the air and can only catch one. He must choose between his \\"legitimate\\" life as a hard working law student with a good relationship, or his \\"underground\\" life as a Rounder. He is geniunely torn by his loyalty to all his girlfriend and his friend Murphy (aka Worm, played by talented Ed Norton). It is fascinating to watch the conflict unfold, and that is truly what makes the movie more than just a realistic, intense gambler flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great poker movie for all","review":"Rounders is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Damon plays an outstanding character that you can't help but root for. Norton plays \\"Worm\\" to perfection. The movie demands great praise. A greater respect to text as I learn more about the game.

However, Ed Norton gives what I consider to be his best performance ever and Matt Damon delivers too. Also, I have to say the girl who plays Matt Damon's girlfriend, Gretchen Mol, is unbelievably sexy. If any of you guys (or gay girls) have a thing for the spoiled rich girl type, she is your dream girl. The other great thing about the movie is that it celebrates the freedom of the individual - Damon's character ultimately chooses to risk it all, and that's an exciting thing to leave the theater with. The movie has an uncanny knack of making you feel free - and how can you beat that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"Upon seeing the preview for this the first time, I assumed it was destined to be your typical mediocre redemption dramas with so-and-so saving so-and-so from this-or-that big bad guy. Ok, so that's basically it but it is deeper.Matt Damon does a fine job as the law student who swore off the game he loved as a promise to his girlfriend. Then upon the release of his buddy, Worm, from jail, all that gradually changes.Woe are those gambling addicts who take their snake-in-grass pals to poker joints and expect to make it out in one piece.Not much can be said about this film except that it tends to be a wee bit underrated. If I were you I would see it. It really is worth the watch. Luckily the ending is believable. I severely dislike unbelievable endings... this one was very good and very fitting.Enough already. Just buy it and watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I didnt care all that much for this film when i first saw it.

I wish MGM or whatever corporation did the DVD production had pulled out some more of the Tyrone Power footage (shot before his death 2/3 of the way through filming) and added it to the bonuses. Since the film itself does not have the greatest reputation, I would think that the addition of some cinematic history would really make this DVD more worthwhile. Too bad.

Unfortunately, the producers of \\"Solomon and Sheba\\" (1959) decided that Yul Brynner and his yak hair would make an ideal substitute for Tyrone Power.

David McCallum looks (and is) very young indeed. This was around the time when he was playingIllya Kuryakin in the man from U.N.C.L.E.

You can imagine my disappointment when I saw many of the same flying scenes borrowed from 633 squadron. I am a fan of David McCallum but this movie has trouble redeeming itself amongst good war movies.It is a decent movie but if you are an avid fan of movies like 633 Squadron, Battle of Britain, and Memphis Belle, you probably will be disappointed. I'm afraid after one viewing I donated my DVD to the library.The DVD quality is good and picture and sound quality are solid.

I mean, Mossies, and Ilya Kuryakin(David McCallum)? Gotta do it.One of the opening scenes portrayed \\"London\\", but as a V-1 Doodle Bug flying bomb nears the end of its flight, there's a nuclear cooling tower....and the movie didn't improve. Surprisingly, the romance aspect of the film was one of the highlights....not a good sign. At least the makers of this film had the sense to borrow copious footage from the far superior \\"633 Squadron\\".By the way, when in England, be sure to visit the De Havilland Museum at Lincoln Colney, just outside St. Albans, Herts.

You've never read a book like this. The suspense is mainly psychological but nevertheless it is hard to stop reading. It is frightening, heartbreaking, and yet beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left it as a short story","review":"It is quite obvious that this was originally a short story. It should have stayed one. Instead, Card added 400 pages of side stories that never tied into the main plot line. Read the last 50 pages and skip the rest. I understand that there are many people who praised this book and I can only assume that they share Card's faith and enjoyed the detailed description of life as a Mormon. But if you pick up the book, read the synopsis on the back and buy it based on that you'll be fooled as 90% of the pages are unrelated to the \\"main\\" story. I kept getting angry as the story went no where until the last few pages. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"So I really liked this book up until the last few pages. I loved the family dynamic and the story of the father's crap job and their son's imaginary friends. What I didn't like is how most of this book is a mystery type book only 20 pages of this book is sci-fi, and even sci-fi is questionable. I guess I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this who hasn't read it yet, but I got to the ending and just thought, are you kidding me. You have such a great story buildup and the thing with the list and it's connections and this is how he ends it? Did OSC just need to finish the book quickly so he could make some dough? There could have been so much more to the ending which was abrupt and lame. I wanted something good after reading 500 or so pages and all I got was disappointment.If you want a good OSC book go read Ender's Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat out Great Read","review":"I am blown away by the bad reviews on this. Are you kidding me? This book rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I gave up too early...","review":"I read about 200 pages of this book, waiting for something interesting, ANYTHING interesting, to happen. It didn't. I chucked it. I hate doing that. It is a rare thing for me to not finish a book, even more rare for me to throw it away in disgust. This was one of those books.From some of the reviews, apparently I missed something miraculous. I don't believe that. After a hundred pages, I was thinking \\"Get to the point, Card, you're boring me.\\" I gave him another hundred pages. No good.If you have the patience of a saint, and don't mind reading endless empty tripe, by all means buy this book. Better yet, have someone tell you what happens (or more accurately, doesn't happen) in the first 200 pages, and take it from there. Apparently, it gets better, although I think it would take a miracle to save this piece of doo-doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card's Folley: \\"The Lost Boys\\" should have remained lost...","review":"A constant loving fan of OS Card's work, I was disgusted at this work. This piece feels like his first attempt in high school at a manuscript. This would be the one he threw away, not the one he turned in. It concerns a family which has moved to a new place; Father has a new job, son starts acting strange, playing with kids who arent there, Children start turning up missing, etc. Card tries to twist and turn the plot to point at different characters: a overly strict school teacher, a strange neighborhood boy with a twisted sense of religion, etc, but these plots are cheap and not well thought out; I was almost insulted and kept returning to look at the cover to make sure the author was not some one else. The ending was the best, but only because it was the ending. I rated the book a '2', only because I saw the original manuscript to \\"Plan 9 from outer space\\". It got the '1'. - Bob Meads"},{"rating":"1","title":"Though the writing was good, I found this novel disturbing","review":"This novel should not be available for children or teenagers to read. It tells of things children should not know about as well as producing images children would find horrifying. Of the OSC books I have read, this was the most disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaawwwwwn","review":"I am trying my best to get through the audio book version of Lost Boys. I listen to this book on my train ride commute every morning. And every morning it helps me fall asleep. Nothing and I mean nothing goes on in this story. The first chapter sets it up that we are ready for a good suspense story, but it never happens. I don't understand why Stephen King keeps getting brought up in the reviews. It's an insult to compare this book to anything the great Stephen King has written.If you have trouble sleeping at night get the audio book of Lost Boys. It's better than Ambien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I am a Orson Scott Card fan, however this story was just pointless. Although it is well written, and the characters are interesting, the story is just a recruting story for the Mormon church. I have nothing againt the LDS cgurch, and as a matter of fact found the family in the story wonderful... ipossibly SO wonderful. A fantasy always gets along no problem family. The real plot goes nowhere slow... painfully slow. Just not interesting. Much better stories out there to devote time to."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I ever read","review":"Worst book I ever read and the first I threw in the trash! (I'm a compulsive book collector) After reading and thoroughly enjoying Ender's Game, this disjointed story full of religious clap-trap was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority View - But possibly Card's worst novel ever","review":"All I could think about as I read this was that it was a not so thinly disguised propaganda piece for the Mormon faith (Card's own). The book goes in for far to strong an explanation of the church's heirarchy and various functions, history, and traditions and the story the novel is supposed to be about gets definite short shrift with a very unsatisfactory, rushed, and cliched ending. Note that I have nothing against the Mormon faith itself and actually quite enjoyed FOLK OF THE FRINGE which also had a strong Mormon content. All in all, LOST BOYS is a huge disapointment due to false billing. One of the very few books I have ever thrown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter how bad a book is, someone will give it 5 stars","review":"Really, I mean really, it's a short story that some apparent ghost writer (that joke was better than the book) padded out to a novel. It blows my mind that someone would think that a story about day to day mormon life, followed by more day to day mormon life, followed by the lame last chapter, would give this five stars. It seems like the fix is in on many of these amazon reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling, a very realistic vision, a page-turner!","review":"I am fascinated by Card's ability to keep me flipping pages well into the night. As a Mormon, I felt that he painted a very realistic, warts-and-all picture of life in a Mormon family. It turned out to be an ideal backdrop for this heart-rending story of a young boy under horrible stress. I don't normally read this type of novel, but rather followed the author from other genres- was truly satisfied with the result. Bravo! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-toots the horn of Mormonism","review":"This book isn't poorly written or anything, but it's not at all comparable to the Ender's Game series or the other Orson Scott Card I am familiar with. I certainly wouldn't call it an \\"absorbing thriller\\". The indications of creepy/supernatural content given by the cover art, title, and plot synopses are all misleading. The whole story of the 'lost boys' is just background material, just a vehicle for a story which is really about a Mormon family trying to be good people... which is kind of interesting, I mean, you don't read too many books where the main characters are Mormons. Card, though, he really hits you over the head with the religious values stuff. And anyway, I felt kind of wronged, as I was expecting both a ghost story and something at least HALF as exciting as Ender's Game and its progeny.For a better book about both family AND supernatural stuff, I recommend \\"Firestarter\\" by Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"It has been a number of years since I read this book, but I thought it was really beautiful, and will make you cry. I wrote an email to Mr. Card telling him how much I loved it, and I actually got a reply. Such a thoughtful man, and of course, great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer Produces Reprehensible Garbage","review":"As a favor to Card, lets assume he wrote this in his younger days and only published later for the money... after his rep was established and a publisher would accept any tripe with the Card name.Card exposes his beliefs... and we find his inner psycho. The message is really truly twisted - a child martyrs himself and Card tries to make this ok. This is EXACTLY the behavior for which he excoriates one of the \\"villains\\" in the story. What a nasty mind. Makes one wonder how he ever created such sensitive and thoughtful characters as Ender. A much needed reminder that the Great Authors (and I believe Card is one) who create Great Characters (Ender is a great character) are rarely themselves Great Men. Hence the occasional bit of trash, even from the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read this a long time ago, when I was maybe eleven years old... I remember the night I finished it... I had to keep putting the book down and sobbing... I remembered the book, and I read it again this summer (I'm 15, now)... yes, it's long, and at some points, it seems pointless. But when you reach the end, you realize that all the parts of the book were necessary, to get you to love Stevie and all the other characters as much as I did. What an amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and exceptional character development","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago and I will never forget it. Often a horror or suspense novel will be peopled with cardboard cutouts, while many of the more introspective novels seem to focus on the characters to the detriment of plot. In Lost Boys, I could picture this very believable family and still be enthralled by the suspense as it grew. A veteran horror reader, I was still surprised by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love OSC, but if I wanted to read a book about Mormons....","review":"I love OSC and almost every book he has written I have read and enjoyed. However, this book promised to be a horror story and instead spent the majority of the book giving glimpses into Mormon life.Very plainly, if I wanted to read a book about Mormons or what it is to be Mormon, I would buy that book. This book was not the book that it claimed to be and I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with this one.","review":"I completely hated this book. It took forever for the author to finally decide what he was talking about. It should have been titled \\"A Day in the Life of the Fletcher Family\\". This book started really good and then just went downhill. If they put the first five chapters and the last three chapters together, and left out the middle, this would have been a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too implausible","review":"The story of an average family and their sensitive son had its eerie moments. The end was a major disappointment, which left me unable to tie up all the loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh","review":"I read Lost Boys while on my break from college. I had heard marvelous things about it, and being a big fan of Orson Scott Card, I had high expectations. I found that the book was about 300 pages too long with many useless details. In fact, there were entire chapters dedicated to these useless details. The plotline was dragged out so thinly that there were times when I would forget that there even was a plot. In fact, the tension didn't even begin to build up until the second to last chapter. I must say, I thought Enchantment to be a masterpiece while Lost Boys did not satisfy me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A struggle to discern right from wrong","review":"This novel depicts an ordinary family undergoing a stressful time. Each character is beautifully drawn, and so real! The pettiness in the office and the church, the viciousness of some people, the madness of others -- all closing in. And al the time, we have Step an DeAnne trying to do what is right, trying to figure out what is right, their debates, their insecurities, and most of all their love for each other and their children. And against this compelling, realistic backdrop we have the story of the evil stalking the eldest boy...an excellent book! For many reasons, it reminds me of Rebecca by DuMaurier, with the sinister story overlaid with a veneer of boredom and insecurity. But in many ways, Lost Boys is actually better, for the philosophy and questions about religion and struggling to do right go much, much deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the audio tape version....","review":"I just picked up an audio tape version of this book in a bargain bin, and was held as its prisoner during a long drive. I don't have any doubt that Card spun a good tale in the book version, but if there were some holes left in the print version (as another reviewer pointed out) they came across as craters on tape. Unlike the print version, which I believe may have carried the subplots more effectively, I revealed the end of the book (out loud) to any empty car a good hour before it ended... the tape version was that transparent. It wasn't the worst way to spend 3 hours, but I have to think I may have cheated myself out of a good book by taking it in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Makes this Book so Good","review":"You have the relationship of the family, despite all the things trying to erode them from the outside, teachers, church members, co-workers and bosses. There is their strong faith too that makes the family appealing even to non-believers like me.There are lines in this book that made my eyes tear up. When I was mature enough to be moved by this book, the ending made me bawl my eyes out.There were interesting twists and turns in the story. You'll never really expect the end. It will punch you in the gut.This book is Orson Scott Card at is finest. Writing a powerful story with characters based on him and his own family. It's right there with Ender's Game and Seventh Son, two other fine books by Orson Scott Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart wrenching tale of a family's journey through life.","review":"Orson Scott Card draws the reader into the lives of a typical American family. He allows the reader to experience the thoughts and feelings of the family members and shows us how they deal with the trials of day to day living. From the hassles we all experience at work to the concern that our children are getting the best education with competent teachers.The story takes a chilling twist when neighborhood boys start disappearing. The suprise ending will leave the reader gasping for breath and any parent who reads the book will be driven to find their children and hug them close"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his standard","review":"Orson Scott Card has written some enthralling novels and some very interesting short stories. He should not try to combine the two, apparently. This novel, originally a short story but now a commercial for Card's religion, just seems to scream for an editor with a shard red pencil. The father's trials with his job might have been interesting if they had anything to do with the story. Otherwise, the meat of the story seemed to fall in the last few pages. If I wanted to read a novel-length advertisement for the Mormon religion, I suppose this might be an interesting way to go about it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaargh! The ending!!","review":"No spoiler, just this:I read the whole, dragging book, only to choke on the ending. Not much else I can say without giving away the ending, but after it was over, I thought, \\"I really hate this book.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I never expected to find one of my favorite authors writing a horror-type novel but was pleasantly surprised by the result. Card has a way of drawing you into his characters. Not being familiar with the Mormon faith, I enjoyed the peek into their way of life that Card provided. (Despite one of the earlier reviews, the strong faith of the main characters was very important to the story and character development.) I have to confess that the revelation at the climax of the story made me actually gasp with surprise. Call me naive but I didn't see it coming. It also left me in tears. Though I never felt the chill of horror while reading this story (no book seems capable of doing that for me), I was haunted by it. Card has an interesting gift of blending sadness and hope in the same story and Lost Boys is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice ending doesn't make up for boring book","review":"This could have been a good book, but it's too boring. Secondary characters exist only as weak suspects for the killer. The Mormon angle had nothing to do with the plot. The main plot is hardly mentioned in the first 450 pages. It's all fluff and drivel. The end is nice, but Card should have concentrated on the main story and cut the extra stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I am a major Orson Scott Card fan, having read or listened to about ten of this books. This was by far the worst. While the end was certainly intriquing, the journey to get there was not worth it. I had no interest in the family or their struggles, and it seemed irrelevant to the book's climax. Plus, the blatant \\"commercial\\" for Mormonism was pretty self-serving. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"If you're thinking about reading this book because you love Orson Scott Card's science fiction stories you can stop right now. The other-worldly computer game is a very, very minor part of the book. If you're thinking about reading this book because you love the moral and idealogical dilemmas Orson Scott Card weaves into his novels, you can stop right now. There are no ambiguities to contemplate here: the Fletchers are good and practically everyone else is evil. I can't believe the same person who wrote this also wrote \\"Pastwatch\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect to be Disappointed","review":"This book starts off at a fast pace and after the first couple of chapters you will be hooked. It is about a family who moves to NC (so that the father may work for a small software company) and the stress and changes that affect all of them. Card sets a creepy tone for the book from the beginning and this is further enhanced by the environments he creates for Step at work, DeAnne at home, and Stevie at school. But it seems that Card either didn't know where the book was going or got tired of writing it, because the last 50 pages bring the story to an abrupt end and do nothing to address many of the sub-plots in the book. If you are fan of Card's you will buy this book despite a bad review, but when you are finished, don't say you weren't warned that you would be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise ending, but is it worth the effort?","review":"Although it's nice to read a book in which religious people are not depicted as blithering idiots, 'Lost Boys' is not a particularly good book, which is surprising because Card is such a talented writer. I liked the style of having each chapter beginning with the same two words, so each chapter was almost like a mini-story. However, it is far too long for the plot, and I disliked the many dead-end story lines, such as Stevie's evil teacher and Step's dead-end job. Many of the characters simply aren't realistic, and I initially found it difficult to care about many of them. Step's whining about having to work for someone else was particularly annoying. The end arrives abruptly, or rather, the only sense of impending climax is knowing the book ends in less than 30 pages so something has to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for a Card's book","review":"I read this book looking for the light-hearted prose of Orson Scott Card, like in \\"Songmaster\\" or \\"Ender's game\\", and it is not at all like those books. The story is too terrible, too dark. This book left me a sour-sweet feeling that I didn't like at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"card's worst","review":"First off, Card is my favorite author period.I read an essay of his where he states that Lost Boys is his best work. Sorry, but I couldn't even finish it...it bored me to tears. He should have left well enough alone with the short story (which was absolutely perfect)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sad Card tale is empty at heart","review":"Yes, the book is harrowingly sad, the ultimate fate of the characters utterly heart-breaking, the portrait of their lives drawn with poignant care. But the book is meaningless. I fail to understand the point of a story whose sole intent is to relay a message of bottomless sorrow. And there are other, darker implications beneath the text that speak of Card's ongoing exploration of certain aspects of human behaviour, making me feel very much lectured at. But the book is highly readable, and the history lesson about the early days of computer software is very engaging. It'd rate higher with me if it weren't for the fact that it seems to have been written with the single-minded purpose of manipulating readers into feeling heartbreak and sorrow. I'm even supposed to boo at the obvious villains"},{"rating":"2","title":"Numbers for spark plug wires.","review":"An item that is hard to locate these days.

Are we, the audience, supposed to sympathize with Nicholas Cages's annoying Italian fascist character? Should we like him because his accent is so horrid or because he delivers his lines with no believability? And should we fall in love with Penelope Cruz, whose acting and accent should only be forced on prisoners of war? The only time this picture becomes bearable is when none of the actors are on the screen, and just the vistas of the small Greek island are in view. And unfortunately, those vistas are few. Usually, the director submits his audience to the bad acting of Penelope Cruz, as she utters gems like \\"you think you can come here and turn my world upside-down?\\" Oh, the pure terror of it all. Whoever thought of making a story sympathetic to fascism anyway? Please, skip this film. It is not even entertaining as a popcorn flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazzling, Beautiful, Believable???

I picked it up thinking it would be a great Sunday afternoon flick. Boy was I wrong!!! Nicholas Cage as an Italian soldier??? Please!!! It is an insult to those of us who are indeed of Italian heritage to see such an actor portray this role. His performance was not believable nor was his dialect. Cage could and should have been better prepared for this role. As for Penelope Cruz, I think having been supported by a lead actor who was more suited for this role would have made this a phenomenal picture. Overall, I was bored with this picture and would not recommend to anyone.

After the capitulation of Italy the German invading force then cast a black cloud over the events with brutality.

It wasn't as bad as I anticipated but it wasn't great either. Nicolas Cage is a terrible actor and his fake Italian accent was getting on my nerves in a major way. All the Italians in the movie joke around and sing-that all they do. I also couldn't see how they(N and P) fell in love. One day they just were. Yeah, right. I have to add one more thing and its about Penelope's looks. I think with right clothes and makeup she can look decent but in this movie she looks downright horrid. Her hair is done in the most unflattering hairdo on the planet and her clothes look as if she robbed the scarecrow. Whether the look was intentional or accidental is a mystery. The ending was incredibly stupid. He leaves Penelope until the war is over and then doesn't come back until two years later because he feels guilty about coming between her and her fianc��.

It is a romance, and the island is beautiful, but this is first and foremost a war movie, and a brutal one at that. This movie is not for the faint of heart.Aside from that, this movie still doesn't have much going for it besides the beautiful scenery. I am a Nicholas Cage fan, but this is definitely not his best work. The accent is inconsistent and poorly done, and Cage himself doesn't seem to feel comfortable in this role.Did I mention this movie is brutal?I won't be watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the Italians lost the war....","review":"OK..I am not a Nicholas Cage fan(8mm was good in it own disturbing way..)but other than that I think the man is WAY overrated. this movie is just another testamonial of how bad his acting is. He is not a fluid actor, everything he does seems forced. A Singing Artillery Battery? No wonder the Italians lost the war......One of the best parts of the whole movie was the actual surrender of the village...to the Germans.(Oh, and the singing arty men facing the German firing squad.)Penelope Cruz was very good...too bad she had to play opposite Cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I stopped it half way thru - why waste yet more time.

It doesn't nearly do the book justice. Nicholas Cage, who I usually love, is wooden and not at all like the Corelli of the book. The scenery is beautiful and Penelope Cruz, who always glows, does her best. But the ending is truncated and ruined, which takes much of the power away from the story. Don't waste your time with this awful film, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"A very real portrait of what was going on in Axis occupied Europe during World War II. Based on historical events, it shows the impetuosity of youth while the confusion of war was raging around them. The depiction of Corelli by Nicolas Cage is superb, showing the romantic artist being thrown in a place where he did not belong. An excellent performance is also given by John Hurt, the wise old Greek doctor, who said that \\"it is not always best to win, especially if in the process you have to spill your fellow man's blood to achieve it.\\" The movie, filled with romance and emotion appears with the background of a Greek island scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Scenery and Nothing More","review":"Somewhat of a mixed bag, this lush but lopsided film adaptation of Louis de Bernieres' 1994 wartime novel is best observed for its breathtaking views of Cephalonia (I'd fly there tomorrow if I could). That plus Christian Bale's convincing portrayal of a jilted Greek fisherman (his Greek accent is perfect) make this overlong film somwwhat bearable.On the downside, you get Penelope Crus completely miscast and wooden as a dewey-eyed Greek woman who falls in love with an Italian soldier played by Nicolas Cage. O.K., Cage tries to redeem himself. But his Italian accent is as phoney as the screenplay. In short, laughs comes in all the wrong places, especially when Cruz and Cage try to act sexy. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sanctity!","review":"Break the mandolin now! Nicolas Cage can't play an instrument, no! I was expecting to see a stuntman's hands while playing the mandolin, but Cage does it himself.

I can't tell, everybody's misplaced in this bread crumb of a movie. Not enough war scenes, I was distraught. Oblivious muddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"If you're thinking of getting this film because you liked the book, DON'T BOTHER!

I enjoyed this movie apart from one thing: Casting Cage in the leading role was a big mistake, in my opinion. I'm not trying to take anything away from Cage's acting ability here - he is great in some parts, such as in \\"Face Off\\" and \\"The Rock\\" but he is about as convincing as an Italian lover as Austin Powers would be! It is painful, almost, watching Cage try to be Italian. In one of the early scenes Cage is conducting his men singing the Anvil Chorus while they shave, with huge and overdne gestures. All I can see when he does this is Cage as the madman in the Halleluja Chorus scene in \\"Face Off\\"! Ditto when he laughs wildly and says \\"Quick, get a gun\\" when the father breaks the curfew. It just doesn't wash, somehow. However, that said, as the film progresses, Cage does seem to become more comfortable in the part and therefore more convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is John Shannon?","review":"This \\"official\\" reviewer for Amazon makes the blanket statement that Nicolas Cage is \\"miscast\\" but fails to explain why he thinks so. I think this is a great movie, a fine love story set in the horrors of war, and in the worse horrors of being a one-time German ally. In my judgment Cage was perfect in the role. Moreover, I like the happy Hollywood ending much better than the novel's, wherein Captain Corelli returns after the war, sees Pelagia with a kid, assumes it is hers and she is happily married (with Mandras?), and so leaves without even speaking to her. This really strains credulity. Only an idiot would do this, and the good artistic Captain was no idiot. Thanks, Hollywood and John Madden, for a fine film a major improvement on the novel. And John Shannon, open your eyes, man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, although when I got it I wasn't sure about it.

Great musicians they may well be but the songs are lifeless without lyrics. That some of the tunes are listed on the cover as Instrumental lends lie to the fact that they are all (with the exception of a couple of the songs that have some minimum vocal inclusion) instrumental.This is NOT a CD I would recommend to anyone buying the Funk Brothers for the first time unless it was someone who loved groovy organ playing (and I do NOT!).

If the last one, \\"Iced World\\", was about the same length, this would have been a decently-sized album. But no, \\"Iced World\\" goes on for HALF AN HOUR!!!!!!!!! Eno puls a supremely weird joke on us all.However, I do have one positive thing to say: This album seems to spark some very interesting, well-written reviews, something that one is sometimes hard pressed to find on amazon.

It is jazzy, groovy and very suitable to the 90's boom of digital music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketches of Nothingness","review":"Hmmm... perhaps my least favorite Eno album, this one. It almost seems like someone decided to release a series of his sound-sketches for a never-released Talking Heads album.

I couldn't help but be dissapointed by \\"The Drop\\". The recordings lack the discipline and layered structure of Eno's earlier Ambient work. Another reviewer put it best by stating that this album seems like Eno simply \\"noodling\\" at the keyboard. I don't even think it qualifies as thoughtful noodling, but rather a collection of poor a-tonal improvisation that reminds me more of John Cage than it did Brian Eno.I recommend that listeners new to Eno check out his earlier work, such as his collaboration with Harold Budd on \\"The Pearl\\", any of the \\"Ambient 1-4\\" series, Eno's excellent collaborations with Hassel, or his \\"Music for Films\\" series. Any of those examples show Eno as an innovator and disciplined musician.\\"The Drop\\" is at best a improptu sketch of a weak idea.

I'm 60. As far as I can tell, I could be 10 years healthier than average, or 10 years less healthy than average, and I was looking forward to seeing what the scale said. But now I'll never know.

Case in point, I input my correct age of 55 and got a fat percentage of 18.9 %. Stepped off the scale , changed my age to 35 years (without changing other input parameters) and got a body fat read out of 16.5%. A 2.5 % difference. The measured muscle mass, bone and water percentage also changed significantly.The scale can be useful if following large changes in body composition where the precision of the numbers is not that critical. However, if you need to measure fat percentages with an accuracy of lets say, +/- 1% or so, you will need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This product is worthless. The body fat measure, which is the only reason one would pay more than $20 for a scale, was off by 50% !! I did the scale, then did a caliper test by two different guys who do them all the time. I would expect the scale to be off by 2% maybe. So if I am 14% on caliper I could live with scale saying 12% or 16%. THE SCALE SAID 22.2% !!! That is crazy - so someone with 20% body fat may get a reading of 30% or 10% on the scale !!!! Yikes.

Their algorithms for the other, dependent variables leave a lot to be desired. Their estimate of my skeletal mass, lean muscle mass, and required maintenance calories can vary by more than 10% overnight! Visceral fat rating shows much more stability. It's pretty hard to assess even the average accuracy of any of the outputs except for weight, for lack of comparison standards.The stability of the displayed weight measurement is nice, especially compared to the touchiness of analogue scales.Not exactly intuitive to set up and use, but not too hard to learn.Atractive, convenient structural design - I love the thin-ness - but it is tippy, so care must be exercised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with some reservations","review":"The scale is attractive and appears to be accurate. My only reservation is that I'm a little suspicious about its ability to measure all the different variables. If you experiment several times per day you'll discover that you get results that sometimes don't make sense, compared to previous readings. You must understand that body fat is measured as a PERCENTAGE of your weight. This means that if you maintain the same amount of fat, but are 2 pounds lighter due to dehydration (say, after a work out), your body fat PERCENTAGE will actually go up. Of course you don't really have more actual fat. It's important to use the scale at the same time each day to determine your progress.I'm very happy with the scale.

So far the only problem I have with it is that if I move too much on it, it doesn't read all the measurements right (it will just read the weight). The insructions do state that, and when I first got it I didn't have that problem. I can't exactly attribute that to the scale, though.

There was terrible Yorshire acents for one, there was a set designer who was trying to hard to hard to make an apparently 1970's looking set, every single part was clich'ed and the plot was about as pradictable as a trip to the toilet. But luckily it was one of those films that is so terrible it makes you laugh, so my 2.50 wasn't wasted completely. If your looking for a good Josh hartnett then go else where, like Halloween H20 or $0 days and 40 nights. If you want a decent Alan Rickman film go for Dogma, and if you want a decent rachel Leigh cook film, then go for She'll all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hartnett's accent blows.","review":"I like hairdressing.This movie is abour hairdressing.

(See, it does sound unlikely.) Nonetheless, I've been listening to this CD for several years, and each time it penetrates more deeply. I have since collected almost all of the works by Biosphere, but none match the depth of \\"Substrata\\"; the next best by Biosphere is the attempt at a follow-up to this work: \\"Substrata 2.\\" When I first heard \\"Substrata,\\" it sounded very familiar, like a half-forgotten dream or childhood memory. The only work by anyone else in this genre that comes close (in my humble opinion) is Robert Rich's shamanic journey, \\"A Troubled Resting Place\\" (though his music generally has an earthier, darker feel). \\"Substrata\\" is \\"music\\" for low lights and a willingness to go with Biosphere dream imagery. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too minimal, even for ambient?","review":"I'm not sure I've ever listened to a \\"grayer\\" album - it feels as though any emotional and personal touch of the artist has been stricken from the music.

Several moments of the album reminded me of the soundtrack to the Japanese anime \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" - I think I could appreciate these tracks more if they occured within a similar context. As is, there's not enough that catches my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I pride myself on being an open-minded music lover.

I tried to give \\"Substrata\\" a chance; I really did! But this album is just plain awful! It is so empty, so lifeless, so boring that it's like listening to...um, well...air. I kept waiting for the album to \\"start\\" and it never developed. The day after I bought it I popped it back into my CD player to give it another chance and I was still left wanting. ... One addtional thing that added to my disappointment was the knowledge that Biosphere does have the talent to make good music! Why he released this ... is beyond me.

Really, I normally enjoy listening to all kinds of ambient music, but this album.... [is terrible].There's no evolvement on the album whatsoever, just useless static/noise/rain sound in between tracks. Don't expect interesting, beautiful, organic, deep, dark, mysterious etc. atmosphere that takes you away to some place. No, just boring, repetitive and uninspired sounds and melodies with meaningless background noise.This album didn't do anything to me. Instead, it actually got on my nerves. IMO, putting this at the same level as Brian Eno is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambient to keep you awake","review":"It is difficult for me to encapsulate in words the depth, the texture, the feeling and the soul of this album.

Maybe I don't march to the same drum beat but I don't throw out the word hero very often when it comes to soldiers, policemen, firefighters or anyone who don't deserve it. The true heroes are those who risk their lives to expose the truth regardless of the consequences. As long as criminals like this get away with murder and the corrupt system abdicating its own responsibility, then many more atrocities will continue to occur i.e. Abu Gharab. I'm sure that when it's all said and done, the same story will be written about Iraq. But in the end, one will have to answer to God.

The bottom line is this --- WE ALL WERE NOT THERE!!! ---so how can these authors explain what went on and through the minds and misery of these men. It's unfortunate the main characters in this book will not share in the fortunes of the authors and publisher, i.e. Pvt. Sam Ybarra' family.Remember, VietCong Guerillas were equally brutal if not worse.I see 5 years from more of these types of authors providing their explanations and facts of what happened to these so-called \\"atrocities\\" of the current Iraq War, particularly those of the United States!Save your money ----- you better watching CNN for the more recent events and underlying predispositions"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE LIES FABRICATIONS TRASH SLANDEROUS","review":"The authors of this book have twisted, fabricated and just plain lied about the facts.

Also, this book has a lot of \\"military slang\\" in it, it helps if you know a little about the military before reading it.

This book is deeply flawed. It is not just vague, and badly researched, bringing nothing new to life. John Keegan is at pains to justify the invasion. While there's nothing wrong with having an opinion, but why should this be presented as history?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being \\"mystified\\" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter. The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region. Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover. His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began. Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author. Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's \\"The Secret History of the Iraq War\\", David Zucchino's \\"Thunder Run\\", or \\"Generation Kill\\" by Evan Wright."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the Keegan I know","review":"I'm a big fan of John Keegan's books. His \\"Face of Battle\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. Keegan's appeal as a historian has been his objectivity and ability to present all sides of an issue. Unfortunately, \\"The Iraq War\\" was a big disappointment. The first chapters that provide a history of Iraq are unbiased and informative. The following chapters that describe the politics prior to the war and the war's justification are anything but. Furthermore, his description of U.S. and U.K. military forces resembles a recruiting poster more than it does a history book. While I was happy to see Sadaam removed from power and am proud of our armed services, I would have preferred to see a more balanced account of the conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Keegan actually write this dreck???","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read many Keegan books and found every one thorough, informative, and enjoyable. I have also read several books on the recent conflict in Iraq. I must say that this book is far below the very high standard that John Keegan has set for himself with earlier works. In fact I wondered many times as I read this if Keegan even wrote the vast majority of this work. The sentence structure is virtually unreadable (not something I normally comment on but jeez!!), and the content is very sparse. An utter waste of time and a shameless attempt to get a piece of literature into the marketplace before interest waned. The worst book I have read this year. Unless you have been living off planet for the last 2 years you would have gotten more information from CNN and the internet than this pathetic effort brings to the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!!","review":"This is one of the best written books I have read.

This is one of the best books I have read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, Accurate, and Deep","review":"I especially agreed with the author's analysis that the Second Gulf War was won within a few weeks.The chaos and murder that followed was an aftermath that the collation forces were not responsible for. The aftermath was a reflection of Islam's seventh century world view, and demonstrates why we need to intervene when backward, ignorant cultures have access to weapons that can be used in mass murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why we went to war with Iraq in 2003.","review":"I admire Keegan and his thoughtful books about why nations/people go to war. This is a good book detailing why the United States and Great Britain went to war with Saddam's Iraq in 2003. Obviously the war in Iraq is not over with the spreading guerrilla war against the Coalition Occupation. The consensus is this was the war to topple the Baath Party and Saddam's dictatorship of Iraq. This is why Keegan limited the focus of the book to just the regime change in Baghdad. He also covers the killings of Saddam's sons and the capture of Saddam himself. For all those who opposed the war, this thoughtful book tells the reasons why it happened.At a little over two hundred pages, this is an easy read, and gives a detailed summary of the stages for the war. Before the action, Keegan details a short summary of Iraq, along with a chapter about Saddam. A final summary of what the U.S./U.K. face with the guerrilla challenge should have been added. This is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Material??","review":"I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken. About half this book described the history of Iraq. The actual war coverage was broad and brief. This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books. John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this book about?","review":"In this 219 pp book, Keegan goes on for 125 pp about events that led up to the war, and many events that he should have left out. This is so poorly done I can not recommend it. Did the publishers just tell JK to write whatever he wanted and they would print it? Reminds me of the old guy at a party you meet that just has to tell you way too much detail about something he likes to talk about, and never gets to the point.

And, he doesn't remotely touch that.This appears to be a terrible grab at selling a book based on current events... as HISTORY, no less.This guys a great writer...but, this book is substandard, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more pro-neocon propaganda","review":"Relying on this book to give the truth about the Iraq war is just as good as relying on Rush Limbaugh to give real news. In other words, if you want to soak yourself with more rightwing propaganda, then this book is for you. For non-partisan reporting, there are better books than this Bush/Cheney defending nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've long lost and still are losing the Iraq War","review":"This book ignores the true reality of the Iraq War in that the only reason government rushed to this war was for oil. As a true conservative, I don't appreciate politicans who hide under the label \\"conservative\\" while at the same time ramming destructive policies and rushing this country into unneeded wars. No, the Iraq War is not Vietnam War but far worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a book","review":"I thought Keegan was a \\"serious\\" historian. This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a \\"serious\\" miltary analysis of the iraq war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"Mr Keegan is one of the best military historians of our time but unfortunately he seems to run out of steam with each passing year. \\"The Iraq War\\" is not a book about military history but a collection of political and diplomatic analysis which was done rather in haste in order to get published. The author devotes less than 80 pages to the actual military operations and the description of units, troop movements, logistics and leadership decisions are poor to say the least. It is a pity to see a renowned military historian to treat a modern campaign like OIF in such a general and boring manner. I'm eagerly waiting for his next real hit which will be equivalent to \\"The Face of Battle\\". As for OIF, you should better read Walter Boyne's or Williamson Murray's books, or even better the recently published memoirs of General Tommy Franks who presents a real professional view of both OEF and OIF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads more like a history of Iraq than of the 2003 war","review":"The Iraq War is an okay book. Having recently read Blackhawk Down, this is a comparatively much drier work that is more along the lines of a military history book than a book that is a good read. My biggest gripe with the book is that it comes across as a work that was originally meant to be a history of Iraq and Saddam Hussein that was repositioned to be a document of the war after it started. This is a 254 page book. The book doesn't begin to cover the actual start of the war until page 147. A chapter on the war's aftermath starts on page 204. The subject of the book only occupies about 1/5th of the entire volume. The war's coverage is done in a very broad fashion where more attention is paid to the unit IDs of the military units involved than in the actual events that took place. It shouldn't be hard to find online sources that cover the war in more depth than this book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked on my 2000 Civic","review":"After 11 years and more than 300K miles, I replaced the original rear drum brakes on my 2000 Honda Civic DX Hatchback.

The very first page White tells us the pope \\"remembered fondly the attentions of his lover earlier that morning\\". This reads like a cheap Hollywood novel rather than a quality historical book. History can be fascinating and the story interesting without resorting to cheap fabrications such as this. How does Mr. White know what the pope was thinking that morning? Very poorly done.

Hello Miramax, is anybody alive ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"DiCaprio is the best thing in film","review":"The film is beautifully shot in black and white. Many critics faulted Branagh's performance but the truth is if Woody Allen had played his role, it would not have been believable - Winona Ryder, Charlize Theron - all falling for Woody? Anyway, the main spark in the film comes from the 15 minutes of Leonardo DiCaprio as a drugged out movie star playing with Branagh's head - the energy DiCaprio exerts only goes to show, by comparison, how uninteresting most of the other characters in the film are - you wonder how good a film this really could have been if DiCaprio's part was more like 60 min rather than 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"the woody allen clone","review":"Kenneth Branagh's irritating Woody Allen imitation ruins this movie. A waste of a good cast and certainly a waste of a typical excellent performance by Judy Davis. Woody's acceptance of this imitation says something about his ego. For Allen fans or for Davis fans--maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Woody's Lowpoints","review":"Of course, everyone who is interested has by now heard the critics complaining about how pained and annoying Kenneth Branagh's Woody Allen impersonation is in this film, and it is absolutely true. But besides that, Celebrity is surprisingly lifeless. The acting (such asthe performance of the usually excellent Judy Davis) doesn't hit the mark and generally feels exaggerated and false, and the story is a patische of other Woody Allen works and a calculated attempt to appeal to a younger audience. All in all, it's just a bore, and I am a Woody Allen fan, and I can say--having seen all his films--that this one and September are the only two I generally dislike..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one hour movie stretched into two.","review":"This is one of the worst Woody Allen movies I have ever seen. It is so convoluted with dialogue, it loses your interest from the beginning. It stars Kenneth Branagh who might as well be Woody himself with all of the \\"Umm's\\" and \\"Wells\\" he manages to force into each sentence. I would recommend that you not see this movie. It was a huge disappointment and I want those two hours of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great, but good","review":"I've seen many Woody Allen films, and while this isn't the best, it's not the worst either. Some complain that the film is in black and white, but it didn't really bother me at all. In fact I think that it helps support the premise by giving the media driven Hollywood a very dark tone. Pretty much the only thing that bothered me was Kenneth Branagh's performance. Through out the whole film he attempts to imitate Woody's acting style and it starts to get on your nerves after a while. However the other great characters and rich plot can help you see past that. In the end I really wish I could give it a 4 . I'd recommended to fans of other Allen films, but I don't think the average movie fan would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Man's La Dolce Vita","review":"I dont understand why Woody Allen felt the need to make this movie. Fellini did it beautifully decades ago. Allen adds nothing to the classic. Instead of Woody Allen portaying himself, he has kenneth Branaugh do it. Without giving anything away, the Woody Allen character acts inconsistently to keep a senseless pointless story line moving. The talented Leonardo Dicaprio and the stunning Charlize theron are not enough to save this movie. it is pleasant to look at but clearly Allen has nothing to say. I have come to expect more from a Woody Allen production. If you want to see the social life of movie stars and the media see the masterpiece La Dolce Vita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not reach the end...","review":"Man, I love most of Woody Allen's movies, but I could not reach the end of CELEBRITY. AFter the first fifteen minutes I realized was in for a journey of perseverance, but I failed: I was simply not in the mood to watch a film that I surely would not enjoy.Until the part I watched, I did not like the pacing, the plot or the characters. I tought the movie was slow, boring, lifeless. Probably, the so-called \\"authentic\\" WOody Allen faans will say I'm nuts and that the movie is a masterpiece. I disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody Allen at his worst","review":"Woody needs to rethink the formula. And someone needs to tell Kenneth Branagh that imitating Woody is the most awful thing he can do for his appeal. It was a weak story line, lousy acting, annoying cinematography, pure drivel. How so many stars can participate in a project without any of them noticing what a piece of garbage it is frightens me. Do not buy - especially if you liked any of Woody's earlier stuff. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst film ever made.","review":"It is apparently impossible to give a film 0 stars, so I have had to give it one. A Godawful mess bereft of wit, rhythm, or interest. Kenneth Branagh is alternately irritating and embarrassing as he does his Woody impression for two hours. The only good in this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's 15 minutes, during which he blows the stagey, theatrical, northeastern smarty-pants segment of the cast out of the water. Seriously, if you enjoy this film on any level, there is something wrong with you. And I like Woody Allen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie had me laughing!","review":"I am surprised that most people did not like this film. One person even described it as the \\"worst movie ever\\"?!? I would definitely have to disagree. \\"Celebrity\\" reminds me of one of my favorite movies, \\"The Big Lebowski\\" by the Coen Brothers. Like that film, the story revolves around the lives of these pathetic characters. You can't help but feel sorry for them, but laugh at the same time. In fact, this is one of my favorite Woody Allen films. A lot of people think this is unlike a typical Woody Allen film. Perhaps I don't like his traditional work as much. I also enjoyed Allen's \\"Anything Else\\", but many fans did not. It appears most people either like his early work or his later work."},{"rating":"1","title":"One long bad imitation","review":"Not just one, but several characters, seem to be doing poor imitations of Woody Allen. Not sure of the purpose of the black and white. At certain points, you just want to ask the characters to shut up, but maybe that is the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just one of Allen's worst movies...","review":"But one of the worst, most disjointed, unintelligent & unfunny movies ever made. Allen seems to make films for therapy, definitely not for art. There's something desperately - well, desperate about all his films, but a few have enough humor & insight to garner him a reputation as a film-maker. Just watch the banana simulation here to see how desperate & unfunny this one gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad film!","review":"In all sincerity this is an awful and dull film.

I just want to say \\"Shut up and quit whining\\" while watching him. I laughed when Kenneth Branagh's character's manuscript was thrown into the harbor. He deserved it. Some statements about how this country picks celebrities were insightful, but overall I was ready for the movie to end. It seems that Allen wants to live out his fantasies with unattainable women through movies like this.

Peter Perrett's vocals were saturated with a weird, ...charisma, lacking in neither melody nor emotion even though he sounded like the sulky, pockmarked kid contemplating suicide in the back corner of the classroom. The band behind him was made up of (if you'll excuse the term) professional musicians - stubborn old musos with enough chops and experience to defiantly inject drama and subtlety into the simple three-chord-bamalama of late 70's punk. Consequently - and quite naturally - the Only Ones were exiles of their own era, never fitting in to any flavor-of-the-month scene or hyped sub-genre. In other words: rock & roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"One really great song.","review":"\\"Another Girl Another Planet\\" has been one of my favorite songs for years and years, and I spent a long time trying to find anything else from this band. Obviously there's room for disagreement here, but I didn't find any of the other songs memorable in the least. Not bad but kinda tepid power pop.

Thankfully, Dennis remained the star of the show here (despite the high-tech production)- the mark of a truly great singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat idea - botanical 'aliens'","review":"I found this paperback where I get most of the classic sci-fi of the 1950s, 60s and 70s: in a used bookstore (in this case for $1). Knowing Simak's reputation, I took a chance (with my dollar) and wasn't disappointed. The idea of aliens coming in the guise of innocent-looking plant life was a cool concept and the story line was a lot of fun. Not any high-tech stuff here, but perhaps that is why this book endures and does not seem outdated. Simak writes in simple, declarative sentences and the structure of his work is logical and easy to read (Asimov says in a chapter in his own autobiography,'I Asimov', that he tried to emulate Simak). Definitely worth a read if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic literary science fiction","review":"I recently re-read this, and discovered what I'd forgotten - what a consummate literary writer Simak could be. This story, while it's about an invisible barrier and the aliens that create it, is a classic exploration of small-town America. Extremely readable, with likeable characters that consider problems the way you and I might. The language and story aren't zippy action sequences, but flowing prose about real people. Definitely worth reading if you like intelligent writing.This story reminds me of Jack Finney, a rough contemporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing By Heart, Awesome!","review":"\\"Playing By Heart\\" was one of the best movies I've seen. The cast was outstanding, there were so many great actors in this film and that's what made me keep watching it, over and over again. I watched it about five times, until I had to return it to the store. It's definetly a movie I am going to own. When I find it at the store I'm buying it right away! It was written and directed brilliantly. And the cast made it even better! Ryan Phillipe and Angelina Jolie were awesome in the movie, along with everybody else. No one actor made this film, everybody made it! Amazing film, definetly a MUST SEE movie! Everybody should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning Your Heart","review":"Playing By Heart is an amazing film with an incredible ensemble cast. The viewer is allowed to delve into the lives and relationships of eight different characters who appear to be completely separate of each other in the beginning. By the end of the movie we see the pieces start to connect just in time to create a perfect ending. This is a touching film about love in our day and age--everyone can relate to at least one of the story-lines. The highlight of the film is Angelina Jolie (who is always brilliant) as Joan. This movie is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable film","review":"This film was very well written, casted, directed and filmed.

A must-see, I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies i've seen!","review":"I am a great fan of Gillian Anderson and she was the main reason why I wanted this movie. And I was not disappointed. The opposite actually. Great cast!Jon Stewart, Gena Rowlands, Sean Connery and Angelina Jolie was superb and Gillian, well I am loss for words. I loved the way the storyline was told and how everything was puzzled together in the end. If you want an experience that goes beyond all the high technology movies that are such big hits this summer, this movie gives you all you need!

Go for the VHS if you really must have this movie...no joke it is that bad. +There are no extras on the DVD anyway. The acting is good...but not great and the whole thing is a bit contrived...but overall if you want to see a bunch of great actors coast through a romantic movie... can you say date night?...then this is a good movie... practice saying the cliches with the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"International Whine Fest Entry","review":"I have rarely taken a DVD out after less than 20 minutes. I did with this. Angelina Jolie did not even carry her character to interest me. Now this is a hard thing to do. I even watched Gia largely because of her. If you are into people whining about life, love, relationship, and all at 90 miles an hour.. this is the film for you.If you ever get flustered watching a group of teens argue about who is dating whom and ohh did you know? Then this is not the movie for you, unless you are a die hard Angelina Jolie freak. I am making a gift of this one to someone who is. I will not have this thing in my DVD shelf for 24 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious drivel","review":"Truly one of the worst screenplays I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. My wife & I cringed our way through the entire movie. The dialog was clearly written by someone with a desperate attachment to his thesaurus.

Not even worth it to see a very healthy looking Jay Mohr pretending to be a dying AIDS patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"I got the movie but it won't play in any of my dvds. i took it to a friends house and we watch it on her laptop and it still didn't work. it is a great movie i have seen it before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"I was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year. a third of a way through it, it starting to skip and freeze.

Angelina Jolie especially pitches in an absolutely stunning performance, although everyone is convincing and memorable in their role.What a cleverly crafted movie. You know the satisfaction you feel when you've just had a complete meal, that's what I'll bet you'll feel.Highly recommended absorbing film, for *owning*, not just for seeing once.

This is a really great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What tripe!","review":"At the end of the two hours I wasted watching this manipulative, meaningless, maudlin movie, I wished I had those two hours back. It was a tear-jerker in the worst way; it was obviously going for the two-Kleenex box crowd, but brought only a little nasal congestion (no tears) to my usually highly-emotional girlfriend, and I felt sad in exactly one spot of the movie. About 1 hour and 59 minutes prior to the end of the movie, we both knew the underlying theme of the movie, and how it would end. The characters are all distinctive, but contrived. The only bright spot is Sean Connery, who can do no wrong. RUN (do not walk) away from the shelf in the video store where this video is lurking - waiting for some poor, unsuspecting victim to walk by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappoitement","review":"After reading all the great oppinions about this movie and seeing the actors list I was expecting for something better. In this nonrealistic movie, nothing really happens, everyone is dying or about to go that way (mostly from aids) - and of course - the so called happy end is inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"A good cast in a waste of a story. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillipe and Angelina Jolie, Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are all couples with their own stories, Jay Mohr is a dying son and Ellen Burstyn is his mother, and Dennis Quaid is ?. These characters and their stories all come together, but it takes so long to get to the narrative's ending that I didn't care less what happened to anybody. Stewart and Anderson are bright spots, and Jolie is promising. Mostly though, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, so contrived... Yawn!","review":"In the last five years or so i've watched a rather abundant number of films like this one. Yuppie, well-to-do beautiful people who can't find love and are very messed-up, or cynical, or desperate but charming. Sometimes this formula works (see 200 Cigarettes), sometimes it flops (see Playing by Heart). The best thing a movie can have is good writing, and that was absent from this one. The dialogs were contrived, clich��d and stale. The predictability was huge, and the happy ending was tear-inducing. Sean Connery plays Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid plays Dennis Quaid, Jay Mohr can't act, and Angelina Jolie's break-up phone conversation was unbearable. The best thing in the movie is the drag queen. Please pass on this one and go straight to 200 Cigarettes (where Jay Mohr actually does a half-decent job)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"Playing by heart was fantastic. Gillian Anderson was the main reason I went to see it and am glad I did, gillian was BRILLIANT and I loved the dog. Sean Connery was good very realistic.

I highly recommend Playing By Heart to everyone interested in seeing a lovely movie about couples and falling in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic cast, wonderful stories all","review":"I was introduced to Angelina Jolie in this film and was hooked. She's fabulous as the youngest daughter of Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands. Marital complications, personal apprehensions and wonderfully HUGE dogs and a one-eyed cat add to this quilt of family members' lives that segway through beautifully utilized sunrises and sunsets w/John Barry's flowing music. Madeline Stowe, Dennis Quaid, Jon Stewart, and several other castmembers round out a complex group of players dealing with careers, relationships and personal insecurities. This is a keeper.PS. Remember this, the next time you run for an elevator ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a clever, witty movie","review":"i loved this film, i rented it on video on watched it three straight times in a row.

This movie ties in the stories of many, all eventually connecting in one spectacular plot. Each actor/actress did so incredibly wonderful in each role that this movie shines in a way very few others have hopes of doing. With great focus on the story at hand without the distraction of irrelevant details, the only complaint I have about this movie is that it didn't last longer. With so much to tell, the plot could have been divided into 4 or 5 different movies. I really hope that they release a Special Edition with extras in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Incredible","review":"This movie is one of the most strikingly well-written, stellarly acted and brilliantly executed works I have ever seen.

On content, the book flies. I read from cover to cover.However, it is not a page-turner. I recommend that you read the second chapter twice or three times, before going on. Just to get to know the names of the characters and such. Seems like the characters changed names or characterazations between the beginning and the end. Some dropped out, and were never heard from again. Some appeared in a different guise. The author should concentrate on a few main characters from beginning to end. The message, the atmosphere and the characters would not suffer if some of the chaff was cut.In other words, the book is a great start for a beginning writer, but the book is in need of a good editor and an organized re-write.

A girl is watching mold grow on all sorts of hosts inher closet - fruits, donuts, etc. This is how she got pleasure. It should tell you a lot aboutthe characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book - never got into it","review":"I purchased this book because I saw that people who liked \\"Back Roads\\" by Tawni Odell bought this title. I liked \\"Back Roads\\" a lot, but just didn't like this book at all. The story jumps forward repeatedly with very little context. The reader is left trying to figure out what year it is, and what is going on. I did not think the characters were developed well at all, and am still left wondering why the primary female character married the man she did.Depressing story, strange characters, and not what I thought it would be. I struggled to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"do pond life have souls?","review":"Amazing achievement. Gives voice to, and breathes life and dignity into, a whole underclass of people that are now routinely held up as cartoonish buffoons on Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wholly satisfying","review":"Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as well as their lives. However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a \\"sophisticated\\" urban readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beans of Egypt, Maine","review":"I recently read a book, In the Middle, by Nancie Atwell. In her book, Mrs. Atwell highly suggested having The Beans of Egypt, Maine as part of one's classroom library. Being a junior high English teacher as well, I looked forward to the possibility of having another book to present to my students. I have never been so mortified. I could never present such a book to my students with a clear conscience. The language is appalling and the adult situations are not suitable for their impressionable minds. Thinking of my students as I read, I was disgusted and in disbelief that this was considered excellent literature for 12-14-year-olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh","review":"I do not abandon books in the middle but could not continue to read this book. By page 100 I could feel my IQ dropping.If you are considering this book, put it down and run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful!!","review":"this book will put you under in minutes. Its lacking in storyline and tries desperately to hide its lack of content under shrouds of style that is sorely lacking as well. Not worth the used price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop thinking about this book","review":"This book is unlike any other book I've read, though it does remind me of Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying.\\" It is so completely believable-the imagery is excellent--not excessive--just enough to create an image that you can feel with all your senses. The story unfolds in such an unexpected way...I couldn't put it down, and when I finished it, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary jewel on the culture of poverty in New England.","review":"This is a totally unexpected literary treat. Written with an clear, earthy feel for the characters' ever-revloving entrampment in their culture and destinies, Ms. Chute creates an indelible picture of destitute life in the backwoods of Maine. The writing is creative and well-crafted enticing the reader to boldly view the borderless and interwoven lives of these subjects. This is reading on a par with \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to the Canyon","review":"This book has been my go-to resource for the Grand Canyon for years. Not only are the photographs magnificent, but Mr. Redfern does a great job of explaining how the Canyon was carved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning integration of cultural politics and daily life","review":"What I loved about this book was how it helps reframe the cultural politics of Weimar and transition Germany. The use of daily life in the theorization of politics and culture is rewarding for Davis, whose use of police reports and bureaucratic documents, buttressed by newspaper and other sources, forces us to rethink the role of the state and working class women in politics.Because of the lively writing, this book makes good reading for the layperson as well as the academic. It is a fine example of the high quality of historical writing possible when scholars merge contemporary theories of gender and culture with traditional narratives of politics and consumption in wartime Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great WW2 history","review":"An excellent novel with romance and drama. This is one of the Zion covenant series that gives an excellent and accurate look at what Hitler did to Europe in the 1930's. If High School students.read these books they would have better history than what they currently get while enjoying the love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy all three of the \\"new\\" Zion Covenant books","review":"If you're a dedicated fan of the Thoene's Zion Covenant, Zion Chronicles series, you'll be very disappointed if you're expecting completely new material from these three books. London Refrain has the most new material, but the other two books are entirely taken from Twilight of Courage. A few sentences are added, but only enough to facilitate an additional story line added in London Refrain (which really doesn't ring true to the original story in Twilight of Courage). If you really wanted more on Murphy & Elisa, London Refrain gives you some of that story line. My advice, go ahead and buy book 7, but skip books 8 & 9 unless you've never read Twilight of Courage. Or, buy them just because you want your collection to be complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is an abridged version and was not what I thought I had ordered.

Both lead characters are unlikable, and the gross-out scene of people drinking margaritas into which sweat has dripped is just too much. Why would these people EVER fall in love? The whole premise is ridiculous, and the acting is terrible.I had never heard of this movie before I spotted it on Amazon Prime, and now I see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"New new wave","review":"There have been a bunch of bands from the bay area recently. Evening is probably the best one. Their sound is very modern. It is influenced by new wave music and glam rock. The lead singer Matt is very original. It is a very modern sound. They take their fondness of the 1980s and turn it into something really new. There are some dodgy titles like \\"Breastmilk Saves\\" but overall it's a nice album. It has epic sounds that evoke another time. Evening evokes some gothic tones at times. But they probably are more about listening to the Beatles. \\"Other Victorians\\" sounds like some book written at the turn of the century. Evening is a new band to check. The music of the future may be like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much effect on rough hairs","review":"Overall it is a very good conditioner with nice smell and a cooling effect, but it was not that effective on my wavy and rough hair.Maybe it has better results on others..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about Hoaxes.","review":"Fast paced and confusing at times, but only for the sake of demonstrating how difficult it can be to find the truth when you have to depend on people for facts, especialy when you get contrary accounts. Very entertaining subject matter, and it credits Irving Clifford's \\"Autobiography of Howard Hughs\\" with causing the Watergate scandel. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Watch.","review":"Viewed: 5/12Rate: 35/12: More like Y for Yawn...the film contains two annoying aspects: long winded narration and overdone guerilla film editing. After five minutes of either, the eyes and the ears will grow tired. It's a tough film to watch, and Orson Welles was certainly full of it. His prime was already past post Citizen Kane, and he had a difficult time recapturing it. I guess we have him to blame for the garbage dizzy editing that are too frequently used in today's films. And of course, some may find the film interesting, but I found it quite commonplace and dull that it ceased to matter. Forgeries are everywhere through different forms. So, nothing new. All in all, once again, Y for Yawn is more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cinematic Juggling Act","review":"His last major work as a filmmaker, Orson Welles' \\"F for Fake\\" (1973) survives as a rough-edged yet provocative essay on the art of fraud. In this instance, we have three noted subjects: art forger extraordinaire Elmyr de Hory, Clifford Irving (the novelist who conned the world as Howard Hughes' \\"authorized biographer\\") and Welles himself. Editing plays a vital role as the Great Orson maintains his semi-documentary juggling act for 90 minutes. Fittingly enough, \\"F for Fake\\" reveals more about the creator of \\"Citizen Kane\\" than the minor curiosities he examines. Welles ends his cinematic odyssey with an affectionate wink."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man who loved movie making","review":"I agree with most of the above but for me the best part of this excellent package is the \\"One Man Band\\" (Known in Europe as \\"The Lost Films Of Orson Welles\\".It's an 88 minute look at a person truly in love with the art of movie making and I found it very touching and remarkable.As an additional surprise some of the scraps of home shot movie included the finest acting I've seen from Welles. They also showed an acting range I had not realised he was capable of and hearing his offscreen direction of Oja was fascinating.A very nice experience.Marc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welles has lost it","review":"Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his \\"cleverness\\" is off the deep end. This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles. He's so proud of how clever he is. But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings. In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious. In this film he beats you over the head with the \\"subtext\\" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line. I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it. I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist. Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"watching this must have been karmic penance for badly boring someone in a past life","review":"Whether lounging in a field of mustard flowers, waxing drunk in an affected \\"traveler's accent\\" on the, ahem, realness of reality, or mumbling about Chartres Cathedral and the fallibility of man, \\"who must, in the end, die,\\" Orson Welles slurs his way through this pathetic attempt to embody his \\"Grand Old Boy\\" superego like that drunken brother in law, tolerated, but only for your sister's sake. Every five minutes I expected apneatic snoring to interrupt his incessant, rambling narration. I can only conclude that these disturbances were removed in post-production. Too bad -- like drunk uncle Zane passing out in the middle of explaining the whole, damn 9-11 conspiracy, these somnolent interruptions would have provided a blessed intermission during which to run to the other side of the house and hope to god he sleeps it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not an expert, but this movie sucks","review":"Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those \`experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"The book arrived in great quality. It was nice to save a little money on a book that I really need.

Not only do they use diagnostic terms that would be useless for the medical sciences as well as the field of pathology.

I tried on another (JVC) player and had a similar problem with pretty much every other disk in the package.

Anyone complaining of it being to hard simply doesn't have the drive or will and probably are the same ones to drop out of a gym membership 1 month in and still pay for the other 11months without going.

It skips all around, it has since the first time I put it in. It's not a scratch, the DVD is just composed wrong. You can't use it. This took me down from 5 stars to 2.

I would recommend doing this with a friend or family member as it makes it even more motivating!Only thing I noticed is that for those people who want to loose weight while doing this, I found that it is helpful to run in addition to the workouts.

I swear by this program. I'm on my 2nd time using the program, and 2 weeks into month two. It is still just as hard as ever. The reason is because the better you get at it, the more you can do in the allotted amount of time. So it never gets easy! But the results...OHHHH the results!

I wanted something fun and challenging and this is that! It is not for someone just starting to exercise. This program is for somone that is already in good physical condition and already exercises regularly. It was hard but I felt great at the end of the session. After about 2 weeks it got easier, but when month 2 started up it was hard again. I have completed this once and now do the workout 3 times a week between the days I jog. I couldn't believe how toned I got and how cut my stomach is. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an advanced workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love these workouts.

This routine is very difficult but I was able to get through it with no breaks but decided to stop doing it because I was waking up with knee joint pain. This workout routine is very bad on your joints. If you are young and can get through this routine, I assure you it will affect your joints...if not immediately, in the future. The body is not meant to do so much pounding, especially the knees. It has been a week since I stopped and I am still having issues with my knees. I love the Beachbody DVD's, especially Chalene's and Tony's DVD's, but am disappointed Beachbody for this routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order from beachbody.com NOT amazon!!","review":"All my CD's are defective.

I was disappointed with the overall quality of the set and cd's. The sleeve the cd's came in was already falling apart when I opened it from the mailbox.

The product arrived in a very short amount of time (by Wednesday morning), and I was able to begin using the workout DVDs that same day.

This 60 day total workout is awesome so far! As of now I lost 3 pounds and my fiancee lost 8 pounds. The only secret to insanity's success would be staying dedicated. Never miss a day, and push yourself. Shawn T is a great coach and watching the other people in the video make you feel like your at a gym taking a workout class. I recommend insanity to anyone who wants to get in shape and lose weight in a healthy way. Insanity you rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity DVDs","review":"The package arrived quickly in 3 days. Every DVD so far has been perfect, no complaints! I just realized that I have the \\"DELUXE\\" package which includes 2 extra discs. Only thing is, I do not have a CARDIO CIRCUIT DVD, but I think there is a misprint in that they mean the PLYOMETRIC CARDIO CIRCUIT for the scheduled day. Workouts are very challenging and I look forward to popping in that dvd every morning!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Shipping, Poor Quality Fake Product","review":"Seller shipped item immediately, and was received promptly, however looking at the product something appeared to be off. I didn't think much of it, but as I used the DVDs they would skip and freeze. I returned the DVD package back to the company and ordered directly from the manufacturer (beachbody). It wasn't until I received the new order that I realized that the item I had previously purchased was not a \\"like new used product\\" but a bootleg. For as great of a program that Insanity is get the original and let the company make the money they deserve.Insanity itself has been great, really intense and results are immediate. Hard on the knees but just know how to pace yourself. As Shaun-T says \\"Keep it Safe!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a disc","review":"The package received looked like a bootleg version of the real program. And was missing one dvd which was replaced by a duplicate of another. Just terrible. Obviously paid $120 to support some illegal operation. Pay the extra 30 bucks and get the real one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity Review","review":"Most of the things about this product were great. I received it in very quick timing, it was packaged really well, and they even included some laffy taffy with it. However, one of the dvds was defective. It skipped throughout the whole thing and was unusable. I emailed the seller about it and they said they would send me a replacement dvd. I waited a week and hadn't heard anything, so I sent them an email asking if I would be notified when they sent the replacement dvd. They responded with just a period. That's it. So I thought maybe the response was a mistake, so I resent the email. I got the same period. So I'm not sure if I'm going to get my replacement dvd or not, which is a bummer because when you pay almost $100 for something you would hope that the whole thing would work, not just part of it. Great business and package except for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio product","review":"Great product if you like cardio. Im a p90x grad and im 4 weeks into my 2nd round. Honestly If your looking to bulk up do some kind of hybrid with insanity and p90x. This program is more about losing weight and toning up. Would recommend a heart rate monitor with this one. This program will push you to your limits cardio wise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity","review":"I would strongly recommend these videos to anyone who is serious about getting into shape. After about 2 weeks I could definitely tell a difference and felt a lot better. There are enough different videos that they dont get old and boring. If my lazy butt can do it so can you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing workout","review":"I work out daily and am in relatively good shape. Insanity is the only thing that brought me back to the intensity of high school wrestling practice. I had my metabolism up so high at the end of each session that I would take a cold shower afterwards and get out only to immediately start sweating again. This work out can be for everyone if they modify it to themselves. I know other people who use it and exercise at a lower level of intensity and helps them, but does not get the same results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Outstanding!!!","review":"My wife and I are both in pretty decent shape and this workout had us both sweating like crazy and our heart rates at incredible levels. This workout is super well balanced. Shaun T. times the length, type and arrangement of exercises perfectly to keep your heart rate up high while keeping mulitiple muscles working and never letting your core relax. This is some of the best money I have ever spent and it is a super bonding experience with my wife. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a challenging workout. It is self-paced, which means you can adjust your intensity during the workout to whatever your fitness level is. It also means that no matter how fit you get, you will always get a challenging workout from the Insanity program. On a side note, I think that his workout assistants are robots, because I don't know how these people can keep going without slowing down throughout the entire workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough","review":"Everything about this program is tough. If you can make it through the 60 days I'm sure the results will be there; however, I have not made it on two separate attempts. I have completed two triathlons (Olympic distance) and dozens of races (running). For some reason, when I start this program, I run my immune system down and get sick about 3 weeks into the program. My suggestion would be double up on the vitamin C and Zinc while you're in the middle of this. That's what I'll be doing on attempt #3.My only complaint would be that this is not in HD and it's not formatted for 16:9 televisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great workout","review":"This collection is a one of the few TV infomercials for sports related activities that actually lives up to the name. It's very intense. You need a lot of space and you have to purchase some additional items (plyometrics mat, recovery formula), but definitely worth the investment. You'll sweat so much and really tone and define muscles you didn't know you had.The production quality of the videos leaves something to be desired. It's basically an instructor and two other gymers working out on a basketball court. There is a super helpful countdown letting you know how much time you have left for each exercise and it comes with a tracking guide for progress, calendar, nutrition guide, and discs.Due to the 'intensity' of the exercises, it's helpful to watch them all the way through and then do the routine because it's sometimes hard to keep looking up at the TV. Happy working out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity used DVD","review":"The 1st 2 DVD's do not work. I do not have the invoice or I would have tried to send it back.

I did not have very much fat on me because I eat well and workout already...this is a challenge and i think anyone who would like to build their endurance shoudl do this.. it is intense but not impossible. I think that by week 2 it gets easier. Stick with it follow the meal plan. for max results. you will sweat! like the dripping kind do it at your own safe pace. you need about a 5x8 space to fit it all in without crashing into furniture.

I lost 4.4 pounds the first week on the program/meal plan. The workouts do absolutely wear you out and I'm still modifying the exercises and taking a few extra breaks so I can keep up. It would be bad for people with bad joints or who don't like to jump around a lot. It's like the first week of basketball practice when you were in highschool. You do suicide drills and jump squats etc. This is the first workout I've ever bought off of the tv, first infomercial type purchase and I could not be happier. I'm on my second week and weigh in on Monday my pants are hanging off of me so I would guess I lost another 4 pounds or so. I'll keep pushing on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT","review":"The workouts are good and fairly intense. If you have not trained regularly in an interval style format then you will find these workouts way too much to handle. If you have trained with Kettle bells or done some other sort of interval training then you will find them with some decent exercise variations and challenging routines.If you are someone who dislikes doing the same thing repeatedly, then avoid this DVD series. If you want to get some great workouts in for total body conditioning, then give it a try.I do have to note one of the reasons I have this set 4 stars. I received the set in the mail and all the DVD's are out of order. In other words the plyometric cardio workout was actually the cardio abs workout. Every disk had the wrong label on it and the actual workouts once playing on the screen were not the workouts labeled on the DVD. It was very odd. Everything works and everything was there but the labels were all on the wrong disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bananas","review":"This workout is bananas! Crazy sweat comes off you fast. If you want to sweat a lot this is your workout. I use to have bad knees before this workout having popping and cracking noises and I did have problems with them in this workout. But if you press on through it your legs will get crazy strong. Like my biggest problem was if i needed to all of the sudden run across the street or just run spontaneously I could not without having pain in one of my knees. But now i can jog or sprint across without having to do a stretch or warm up first.I still need to do the last part of the program which is the Max cardio portion which i know I am going to get hammered!The ab routine is like nothing you ever done before. You definitely feel your stomach working. The only thing is I would like to have some weights included in some of the routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is insanity!","review":"No bones about it- this is a tough workout dvd set. It is well made and I like Shaun T's style. It is tough. The latest research on CARDIO Fitness shows that 2 hours of intense cardio a week is the way to train your heart for all kinds of heath benefits. Well this DVD set will accomplish that. It is tough and you can take breaks, Shaun also encourages the use of a heart rate monitor. You have to listen to your body, take breaks when needed but also dig deep and push yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin Awesome","review":"No messing around here. I thought I was in decent shape, but this really pushes you. Love love love it!The only thing: if you live in an apartment without a sturdy/ solid floor, there's major potential to irritate anyone living below you. If you can't do a tuck jump and land without the floor rattling (and then do it again about 80 times), you might want to consider how often you'll be able to get your workout in without disturbing anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you put in the effort... you'll get the results.","review":"First of all, I am a 22 year old, tall, skinny girl who was sick of having a rail for a frame. I decided on INSANITY since it was the cheaper option overall (and shorter time period) versus P90x. The program is NOT easy by any means, but rekindled my competitive drive that I had when I played high school and year round sports. I have a week and a half left and have seen tremendous results. I still can't keep up with the people in the video, but no one expects you to. You are supposed to do YOUR maximum interval each time, not someone else's. As long as you put forth your best effort with the nutrition and workouts... you will definitely get the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"be ready to sweat","review":"This workout is unlike any that I have ever tried it is cardio at its best. when i first got it i wondered what am i thinking there is no way that i will be able to keep up i thought i was gonna die the first day but you have to remember to dig deep. Insanity is not a gimmic it really does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I'm into week 3, but right away I could tell if I could keep myself \\"pushing play\\" everyday I'd have great results. I'm 49 years old, so I haven't pushed myself this hard in a while. I thought I was going to drop over just in the fitness test, but I kept going and I am having positive results. The work out doesn't get any easier, because the more in shape you get, the more you push yourself. If you want to absolutely be dripping when you get done with your workout, this is the one for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Insanity!!","review":"1st day, warm up was too intense that my wife and I were soaked in sweat. We couldn't even get thru the warm up of the Fit Test Video because we were both too tired. We're now approaching week 4 and going strong so far. With the help of the Nutritional Book and eating well, we have enough fuel to burn and we're both seeing results already. My wife already lost about an inch in her waistline and I'm already seeing my biceps getting bigger. We have a long way to go and hopefully would make it to the last day and be excited with the results.

I've played select fast pitch and sports my whole life, so I certainly know what a tough workout is, but this is truly the most intense, total-body, insane workout I have ever done in my life, and I absolutely love it!Even after just the workout, my dad and I are already sweating, but Shaun T really does a great job at making you WANT to continue and dig deeper. Something about it just makes you want to come back day after day to continue, but you also love those recovery and break days, haha!But I wanted to post this review to let people know that you're really not too young to do this. It is definitely a challenge, but no matter if you stick to it, you WILL see great results.Hope this helped!Happy Insanity-ing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't ready...","review":"This is a great program, but make sure to judge correctly if you're ready for it before investing so much money in a workout program. I'm a bit overweight and can do moderate to high level intensity workouts. This workout humbled me. I couldn't finish the workouts because I couldn't breathe.Now, I still think this is a great program. My brother and his roommates have all completed it and absolutely love the program! They were all pretty fit and only had a few pounds to lose, but they all look the best I've ever seen them.I would just advise that you are truthful with yourself about whether you think you can do it. If you are hesitant, I'd say you're probably not ready and need to work up to Insanity (which is what I'm doing, just started Turbo Fire). If you \\"know\\" you can do Insanity, you are probably in the right mindset for this program, it takes a lot of dedication and stamina."},{"rating":"2","title":"From an out of shape beginner","review":"This program is tough but that is how I like it. I need to be whipped into shape and that's what's happening. I like that you don't need any equipment other than your shoes to do this. If you are a beginner and are really out of shape, expect to go through this program very slowly the first time around (yes, this will be longer than 60 days for me). I'm having to put a rest day in between each workout day so that I can continue the program without hurting myself. Make sure you value technique over keeping up with them. Technique is so much more important and will help you get to your goals safely and quickly. I have found that as I continue, I can \\"hang\\" with them longer than the week before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cardio..","review":"I've tonned a lot from insanity!

The workouts are great because you can do them at home and look like an idiot in the privacy of your own space. The workouts suck because they are as difficult as everyone says they are.

I really wanted to like this work out. It is too repetitive. I don't know why but my body started to leech nutrients from my skin, so my knuckles became dark. I took a multivitamin and copper (to help with iron absorption). Callenetics is boring as heck, but at least I only have to do that every other day and can eat what I want. With Insanity, I started to gain inches and pounds on a modified diet (2000 calories per day). At 30 Something, I think I am too old to be jumping around, lol.

Insanity is one of the best I have ever done. All of the Beachbody products I have purchased are top-notch. I have never been disappointed.

After 4 weeks of diligently following the Insanity program, I have lost 15 pounds and several inches. I am excited for the end of the program but I will not be stopping there.

I have been doing insanity for about 30 days. I will be the the first to tell you- this is NOT an easy work out. I drip sweat every single time I work out. However, it is worth it. Not only do I look better, I feel better as well.As far as results go, I've lost 5 lbs so far but it looks like I've lost much more. I've toned and gained a lot of muscle. I recommend taking pictures each week because the scale can be misleading. I haven't followed the meal plans that were included but I have been keeping track of my food intake.The pause button is your friend, especially in the beginning. I went at my own pace but still pushed myself. Have plenty of water on hand too.

I alternate this with running, swimming, and a fun day of Zumba, and I really feel like I have a very complete workout routine.

I'm definitely stronger and my cardiovascular strength has greatly improved. INSANITY is extremely challenging and you definitely know it is when Shaun T has to stop to take a break and the people working out in the background stop mid-exercise to catch their breath or get water....that never happens in workout videos! I am very happy with INSANITY so far! My goal is to complete the program in its entirety! Only 6.5 weeks to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intense, Love it!!!!","review":"Very intense, no nonsense 60-day workout program. Being a 2 time P90X graduate, I hate running and I wanted to lose some more body fat, thus I needed to do more cardio. Like P90X, Insanity fits my needs perfectly. I can do everything from home, on my own time and Shaun T keeps you motivated. I'm currently doing a P90X\\\\Insanity hybrid, P90X 3 times a week and Insanity twice a week. My only complaint about Insanity is that the warmup part of it is kind of long, so much that it's necessary for me to stretch even before I do the warmup. Also, some of the routines in the DVD's are kind of repetitive. Program definitely is geared towards the more advanced exercise enthusiasts, though you can of course always modify. All in all, you will find that this is an exceptionally challenging, high intense cardio calorie burning program. You will sweat buckets and you will see results if you stick with it, just start out slow if necessary at first and take extra breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity Rocks!!","review":"I started doing Insanity almost a month ago and let me tell you, I can see a huge difference in muscle tone and endurance. This workout truly pushes you to your max and when you finish you will be sweating and feel accomplished. This program is very intense and not for beginners. If you have not worked out in a long time then this is not the workout to start with. The participants in the video also have to stop and take breaks. The workout is 6 days a week with one day for recovery by stretching.So what you get is Shaun T who is quite motivating pushing you to do the exercises. One thing, if you have bad knees or a bad back this is not the workout that needs to be done. There is a lot of jumping and sudden movements in the videos which will cause heavy impact on joints.Next week I have my recovery week and then go into the hour long Insanity. So far in the last month I have lost 8 pounds and my clothes are becoming looser."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT!","review":"This workout is awesome, but only for people who are already pretty in shape. I would say this is for those people who don't have problems with their backs, knees or really anthing else and that just have a few stubborn pounds to lose and want to tone up. It is really hard, I'm on my 4th week and it's still hard but it's getting a little easier and I love it. Haven't lost any weight on the scale yet, but clothes are definately fitting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing that's insane is the price","review":"$144.00?? Are you serious?? This set isn't worth a quarter of that. Maybe if the DVDs were made out of gold or platinum, but they're just plain old DVDs. Think about this: a movie like Terminator 2 cost millions of dollars to produce and you can buy the DVD for $10. These DVDs cost nothing to produce; it's just a bunch of people working out in a crappy gymnasium, and yet they want to charge $144?? Don't make greedy execs at beachbody rich; boycott these DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product","review":"The ONLY good thing about this product was the nutrition guide which is definitely not worth the 157$ I paid for this. I am pretty fit and healthy already but I really wanted abs like the ones they advertise you get by doing this program. First they ask for waay too much money then the workout is not insane its ridiculous You are much better off paying 20$ a month for a gym membership and getting fit with regular excersize and the right nutrition best of luck with your goals :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing DVD","review":"The product I received was missing on of the DVDs despite the fact that the product rating was \\"like new\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped DVDs","review":"I purchased Insanity, ready to start a new workout challenge.

It is too bad since they seem like a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity","review":"This dvd selection and workout is not for everyone. It is very hard and very fast paced. Even some of the people demonstating the video could not complete the workout. They focus on repetition as fast as possible. This doesn't make sense to me because I have always been taught to focus on form so that you don't get hurt. There is no way to keep your form in these workouts. Very expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"I received the DVDs and none of them worked. I tried them on 3 different computers and 3 different DVD players. I attempted to contact the seller and never heard back. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM GINA FOR LESS! You will be throwing your money away like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Easy","review":"Ok here it goes. If you have bad knees, shoulders, or any other body part then this is not for you. If you are already in shape then this will not get you in more shape. Insanity is just a cardio work out and it is difficult at time but there is nothing in the videos that you can't do on your own. For 30 to 60 minutes you will do mainly a leg, calf, thigh, and butt work out with some push ups and abs in there too. Many times through the videos some of the exercises repeat from previous workouts that you have already completed.My final statement is: If you belong to a gym or have the motivation to do some physical activity with your life the don't buy this.If you are one of those people who try a new diet or fad every week to try to lose weight or get in shape then try this out waste your money and start something new the next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity\\"","review":"The Item got to my home fast, within a few days.

It took about 3 weeks to get here though. Also, as I progressed into my workout, a couple of the 'new' dvds wouldn't work on my computer. I had just taken them out of the packaging.

I can't say that I had a ton to lose to begin with, but the promise of the program is a total body transformation. The testimonials demonstrate significant weight loss. Most of the work-outs are among the toughest I've tried. I like the challenge and the motivation that ShawnT provides throughout the video. I wish the meal plan had more variety, but I can't complain about it's ability to keep you feeling full.

The workouts are intense and I absolutely finish each one drenched in sweat. I have seen a noticable improvement in my ability to complete workouts and my flexibility. I followed the diet plan pretty stictly the first week, eating about 300 calories per meal 5x a day and taking the meals from the diet plan. However, I have not lost any weight and have not lost any inches off my stomach. I will continue to push forwad with instanity and have enjoyed that using insanity has made eating healthy and exercising a priority in my life. I hope to see better results weight/measurement-wise as I continue the program. I give it 4 stars for now and would recommend others try the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Materials and Program","review":"This work-out product is both effective and incredibly well designed. Not only does the system itself deliver everything it promises (as long as you do YOUR part) it comes with some of the most beautiful and well organized materials I have ever seen.The case looks like an expensive coffee table book , complete with large faux pages covered in beautiful glossy photos of the exercises. These double as very clever section dividers to the disks. A sturdy pocket in the back of the \\"book\\" houses your calendar, fitness test card, recipe book and nutritional guide.All this flash isn't required for a great exercise program, but since the program itself is exceptional, it is a nice bonus that the production quality and materials hold up to the same standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"A friend had my husband and me to try his fit test DVD and after that we were hooked. We just knew we had to have it. Never before would I have ever thought I would try a program so extreme. But its something about Insanity that is so addicting. Its tough but I can't help but be excited about the next workout. Nothing compares to it. I took a starting photo and then another at my 10 day mark. I couldn't believe the difference in that little bit of time. So this program delivers what it promises as long as you put in the hard work and eat right. I can't imagine what my result will be at the end of the 60 days. I'm sure Insanity will be a part of our workouts for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging album","review":"This is my favorite Rita Marley album with great melodic songs like I Know A Place, Serious Time with its message of peace in times of strife, Bob Marley's Who Colt The Game and a lovely interpretation of the Gibb Brothers' To Love Somebody.Three different producers worked on the album, making for variation and diversity, especially on songs like Earth Runnings and Dem A Fight. The production is professional and sympathetic throughout, bringing out the best in her voice. Her falsetto style is beautifully displayed on Just One More Morning and on the bubbly Special Rhythm. I love Rita, Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt, and this is one album that proves why. Essential for fans and would also serve as a great introduction to anyone wishing to investigate this legendary Jamaican singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"practically perfect","review":"I love this bag!

It's a gorgeous watch. It's the perfect size for everyday use. There were other watches that caught my eye, but this was one that wasn't too big or masculine looking and I felt it was more suited for an office environment. Bottom line is that she loves it and it's looks great on.I purchased the watch in late April and since that time, the watch has gone up in price by $15.00 so I'm feeling good about the fact that it was really a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a friend","review":"This was a gift for a friend who lost her watch on a trip we took. She loves this one just as much as the one she lost, if not more. The inner square of the face is like a white pearl finish, which adds a nice touch to all of the silver. The small dial on the face is the seconds hand. It keeps accurate time. The watch face is small and dainty and can be dressed up or down. The band was extremely large for her wrist so she will need to have it resized. Great price and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks very nice, but a pain to dissemble parts and install","review":"First of all, the instructions that come with this lever are USELESS except for a couple of pictures. They aren't written in good English (\\"alien wrench,\\" for example) and they are not detailed at all.To Begin: Spray WD-40 on/into/around the lever and give it time to sink in. Wrestle the lever back and forth until it comes off the rest of the parts. This will take considerable effort and patience. Next, unscrew the top part of the remaining section from the gold 2-pronged part at the bottom.When Installing: You may need to add a couple of washers (inside the tank, of course) to get the lever to fit snugly. Also, if I remember right, some of the tightening is done counterclockwise rather than clockwise. Finally, be advised that the lever may not fit back easily onto the part that you wrestled it off of originally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong for my cur","review":"Seller was quick, package came as described...

This is an excellent book! It moves fast, is easy to read, and captures your heart. I found myself forgetting that I was reading and instead thinking I was living the drama of the story. The character development across a variety of cultures is on pitch and very true to Wyoming way of life.If you want to learn about the realities of ranching in the West, this is a great place to start. The ranching, mixed with the struggles of a young soldier struggling with PTSD, create a compelling drama with lessons about patience, tolerance, and charity. And it has a happy ending. Curl up with Absaroka on a cold night. You'll be a better person for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie quality.","review":"It was exactly what we where hoping to find as far as being in good condition and something that does justice to this movie.

She had to deal with gender, race, and class in her lifetime. Her own relatives did not accept her when they found out she was of lower class then them. Bitita tried to make the best of what she had or would move on to see what else the world could offer her. One time she left her mother and joined a convent. When she realized that she made the choice of no social life she had to leave the convent that provided her with food, a bed, and medicine and go back to living on the streets but had her freedom back to herself. I though this story was an inspirational testimony that shows a young girl who had to struggle in her life that tried to remain true to herself. I would recommend this story to anyone, especially women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful analysis of the life of a black Brazilian girl","review":"Fans of Carolina Maria de Jesus's writings will want to read this startling translation of the black Brazilian author's autobiography of her childhood years.

I bought it from a discount table at an agricultural fair in Maine and didn't really expect much. It is by far my husband's and my favorite cookbook. The meals are \\"real food,\\" stuff you can serve your fussy kids and fussy guests. I haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried to date. We highly recommend the Spaghetti with Spicy Italian Meat Sauce -- it is better than any spaghetti sauce we have ever tried, always gets raves when we serve it and yet it has far less fat. Awesome!

The control was very bad. It was shocking my dog inside our house on the lowest setting. So, returned it and got the Petsafe SDF-100. What a great system. The boundry control is great. It warns the dog with a beep and vibration. My dog has done great with this new system after only a couple of days. Do not mess with cheaper systems and no need to pay more, this sytem works great.Update 7/24/12 - Fence worked great for several years, then it was hit by lightning. It worked so well we purchased the same unit it again. We have a black lab mix, and he never leaves the yard.

Overall, I am very pleased and have already recommended the product to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptic proven wrong....","review":"I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical on some of the reviews and claims made. The system seemed a bit too easy to really be effective with a determined animal.I was wrong.The install was pretty straight forward. The drill trick for twisting the wires made setting up the various \\"safe\\" zones a snap. I came up a couple hundred feet shy on wire, but Home Depot had the 20ga wire in stock at a good price. The \\"edger\\" trick didn't work for me, but a pick-axe and a lot of determination soon had my acreage \\"fenced\\" in. It help to work with damp soil instead of dry btw...We've had the full system up and running a full week. Our dog is already acclimated to the flags and knows better than to get too close once she hears the \\"buzz\\". Even those I had to place back in the woods. It truly was remarkable. We followed the training steps to the letter and by the 3rd day she was well on her way to giving the flag boundaries a safe margin of distance.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good so far","review":"Read manual front to back before starting! install- 4 hours from start to finish rent power equipment for the trench save time.Only part of whole system that looks troublesome is collar receiver o ring is tiny damage it water is as good as in, electronic components are directly behind battery no barrier (weatherproofing) of any kind .

Before I bought this, I knew the collar sensor was going to be big. When I received it, however, it also had 2 terminals sticking out almost an inch. It didn't seem to bother the dog much, but it bothered me knowing that it had to be uncomfortable. A few weeks into wearing it, we found a major problem with it. The terminals poked through the skin and caused a deep hole/cut in the neck. The orange collar also rubbed against the skin and caused a thin cut around the neck (like paper cut, but larger). At first I thought the neighbor's large dog must have come over and bit my puppy in the neck, but upon axamination, the injury is consistent with the orange collar and the zapping terminals on the collar. The fence does keep my dog in, but this injury is not worth it, and it's due to the poor design of the collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWER STRIP!!!","review":"This product is great and does it's job. My dog is a shephard/malinous mix. She LOVES to chase rabbits and has strong prey hunt. She is an inside dog, but does get out every now and then. So we got this for a backup. When busy with all my kids, she kicks the door open to go to the potty and this keeps her in her appropriate perimiter. However after two months of owning this product, we had a lightning strike that ran down a tree and across the underground wire. It was plugged into my garage and exploded. Thank goodness it was plugged into a power strip or my freezer under the same outlet would have been fried too, or worse an electrical fire. Get a power strip folks!Update: The company sent me one shortly after free of charge! I changed my rating to a five. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"great product!my wife and i installed it in a matter of ~4 hours or so. i had a small electric trencher that helped a bunch. if you don't have one, consider renting one.only difficult thing was trying to get the wires to twist sufficiently so that the signal can be 'voided' in certain areas.our 2 yr old lab learned very quickly (matter of days) where the boundary is. it's been in about a month - other than the first 2 days - she hasn't left the yard - even with some strong desires to run/chase something - she pull up well short of the audio signal even.super easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall happy, however...","review":"Pretty easy to install and use however the instructions are incorrect. If you have a small area to cover, (used approx 50% of the wire) the unit MUST be on 5 to work properly. This isn't mentioned anywhere in the instructions and was only communicated to me via phone call. If I would have known that it must be set to 5, I would have placed the wire 2 feet further out!Other than that, the unit works and my Golden Retriever now is much more aware of her boundaries. Also, on the training itself, my dog was EXTREMELY SCARED after receiving the first correction and wouldn't even venture outside with the collar on! I tried numerous times to get her to play around the area however it seemed almost cruel with how scared and docile she bacame with the collar on. It took approx 3 weeks however she is now venturing her way around different areas of the yard.

The camera and editing work must have been done by a ten year old. The sound quality is terrible. I watched it only once (and not all the way thru) and it now sits collecting dust.

Its greatest strengths are the authors' description of Hussein's family and its murderous pattern of doing \\"business.\\"But it's not a perfect book. I got the impression that some events were glossed over by the Cockburns. There is also a very faint aroma of anti-American sentiment.

I started to wonder if all these statements of fact were actually correct or just the authors opinion. This book is not for the average person seeking to learn more about Sadam and the Gulf War. I would say it's more of an historical reference or scholarly textbook, provided the statements presented as facts can be verified, and not appropriate for a leisurely read on the beach.I would summarize my point as saying the author seems to be knowledgeable about Iraq and the US government but a very poor story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Career Highlight Overlooked - To Be Re-relased!!!","review":"Barry Gibb's landmark album, \\"Now, Voyager\\" from 1984 is a masterpiece. Sadly, MCA did nothing to promote it and it barely charted. The top 40 hit \\"Shine Shine\\" was to be followed by the white rap \\"Fine Line\\", but without the help of the producers, this fantastic Gibb project was lost. The duet, \\"Face To Face\\" with Olivia Newton-John was released as a single, but went nowhere, unfortunately. There are some truly inventive R&B; songs here including the, bouncy \`call-response' vocals of \\"Shatterproof\\" and the frantic paced work on \\"Temptation\\". \\"She Says\\" harkens back to the Streisand ballad days and \\"One Night (For Lovers)\\" received great FM airplay for its sultry sexiness. Only one song contains the songwriting skills of all three brothers and \\"The Hunter\\" is a dramatic and eclectic piece of drama that nicely finishes the album.This CD will be re-released in late 2005 with a different cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Barry one?","review":"Voyager seems to be the only solo album of Barry Gibb!

I remember watching the album video back in the 80's when I worked a video store and enjoyed the artistic presentation along with the music. Each song flows very well to the next. It's hard to pick out favorites as I enjoy the entire album. This is definitely a must have album for Barry Gibb fans.By the way, if you're going digital with your music collection, check out ITunes.

In a way, Phillips reminds me a bit of Jayne Krentz/Amanda Quick. I enjoyed it, passed it along to family who passed it along after they were finished---a very good read!. Story: A princessdisguises herself as her cousin, to check out a man she didn't know, the one she was to marry via a royal arrangement.

Still, they're good and brings back feelings from an era long gone with Sputnik in the air and Elvis in the army. And all the best RCA-sides are here like \\"Love me warm and tender\\" and \\"Dance on little girl\\", except for his biggest hit from that period: \\"Crying in the wind\\", a huge hit in Scandinavia, Continental Europe and South America in the summer of 1963. Strange to leave that one out. And really, no compilation of Paul Anka is complete without \\"I miss you so\\", a real, true diamond from 1959. That one's on his big hits, vol. 2.

This performance in Dresden is special for a few reasons. I used to live in Germany, and it was great to see the highlights of Dresden again, and see all the German people in the audience. The costumes are beautiful. He has a nice group of young dancers on the flanks of the stage for many of the performances, dancing the viennese waltz. There is also a newlywed couple involved in many of the numbers. And Andre speaks throughout in German, entertaining the audience with subtle humor. Some of that might be lost on those who dont know German, but the subtitles are fine.In a word: Elegant. Probably the most elegant of all of his videos.

However, this is a fast, entertaining, intelligent read. While it's not a \\"romance novel\\", the love story it contains is quite touching.

I found \\"The Canterbury Papers\\" to be disappointingly two-dimensional. There is a treasure trove of background upon which the author can draw, and many vibrant historical figures that can really sizzle in print. Unfortunately, the author glosses over this and leaves her portrayal of the era as a colorless and drab as a black and white comic strip. Readers who enjoy beautifully depicted settings are better off reading Rosalind Laker or Judith Merkle Riley. Also, the plot was hopelessly predictable. I was able to see the author's plot twists chapters before they were revealed. To me, the \\"mystery\\" of the book was that I managed to finish it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to use and doesn't do a good job","review":"This is really a British camouflage face paint kit. The paints are very hard to put on. Neither a rag, sponge, or brush can be used to apply it. The face paint is very hard in the case and one has to press hard with a thumb to get it out of the case. Then it is hard to apply to the skin. It took an average of 20 minutes just to apply it to a face. The green comes out very light although in spots it will be dark. The brown doesn't give a good color easier. When I was in the service, camouflage paint came in tubes and it easily squeezed out but that is not the case with this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"workable","review":"This spray doesn't work as fast as an actual inhaler but it does do the job and the price is reasonable.

The SM200C might not be the snazziest PCDP but it is a solid performer. Very good sound quality, good build for plastic and good user interface. The only thing I have found I cannot do with this unit is hike. Even though the anti-shock feature works fairly well, decent bumps while hiking can jar it into pausing for a few seconds. Plays all of my MP3 and burned audio CDs with no problems. I have a couple of friends who admired mine and got their own and love them.

Recently I was even able to see them when they came to Seattle, which was pretty cool seeing as how they hardly ever tour!This record is my favorite Sol Invictus release. It has the best songwriting, I think, and the best production. There is a fullness of sound that is absent in some of their releases, because of a consistent inclusion of percussion, keyboards/piano and samples throughout the album as opposed to just the usual guitar, violin, vocal arrangements. Blood Against Gold is a very powerful song. During the bridge especially, the rolling drums and rising strings elevate the majestic and tragic mood. Black Easter is a favorite as well, stirring up a sinister atmosphere with its primal low-tuned drum hits and bizarre keyboard feedback noise.Strongly reccomended"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing i ever heard!","review":"These guys are really incredible! Alexandre Pires, the singer, is getting worse each day, specially in this awful album. His spanish is terrible!

I could not put this down once I started. It is very informative and sad to see how the foundations of our lives shape and sometimes haunt us into adulthood. While reading this book, at times I felt compassion, other times anger, sometimes harsh judgement and then complete understanding. Emotions were very present.

My Highest Recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where there is evil, the phantom is not far behind","review":"For a girl like me, who is not that big into comic book heros and the like, I must say that the movie the Phantom has a certain niche that makes it an enjoyable experience to the likes that one cannot descibe easily. The main character, The Phantom, played by Billy Zain (Titanic) is a swashbuckling superhero similar in style to a purple clad Indiana jones because he only uses his hands and a pistol as well as his head to get out of situations.

It is a fun, cheesy throwback to stories of adventure and love. I found myself smiling the whole way through the movie.

The only person who survives this film with a smidgen of dignity is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who brings a sense of flair to her role (perhaps too much; I thought I saw her hair flair at one point). My favorite continuity problem in the film: after Phantom and Swanson leap onto a horse from an airplane(!), watch for the wolf running behind. Sometimes it is in the scene, and sometimes it is not. Finally, why in the world would anyone in their right mind leap through the jungle in skimpy purple tights? At least Batman wears body armor.

Billy Zane is great as The Phantom and Treat Williams gives a great performance as the ruthless villain Xander Drax. The real value here is the superb picture quality on this Blu-ray disc-- it's outstanding! Colors are bright without being garishly oversaturated and blacks are nice and inky. It's certainly an improvement over the DVD and well worth the $11.99 I paid for the disc.

A guy in purple spandex riding around the jungle on a white horse, with a wolf tagging along? I'm a person who tolerates Batman and really liked Spider-Man, so I'm not just anti comic book hero. This movie manages to make mincemeat out of everything it tries to do. The action is boring, the dialogue is rotten, the fx are cheap at best, the characters are non-dimensional, the romance is cheesy to the extreme, and the whole plot is lame. If you want action/adventure reminiscent of '30s matinee, just watch Indiana Jones. Forget this; I can hardly believe I endured the whole thing.

They are much thinner than I expected, as compared with other flour sack towels I have previously purchased. After washing one of these towels just once, the seam came undone and began to fray. Considering these will be used as kitchen towels, I assume that they should have been designed to hold up to numerous washings.

This is the second set we have owned. I tought the first set, a gift, was rather flawed, but this set is beyond bad. At least one of the three is not even clost to being squared, very crooked. Some of the side hems were only turned over once, rather than a real hem, so that the edges were ragged even before washing. I don't know who in India is now making these towels but it looks like perhaps a very small child who is forced into labor and either doesn't know or certainly doesn't care about the outcome.While they are inexpensive, you certainly get what you pay for.

Last week I loaned it out to build a huge playground at my daughter's school. It powered through 5 days of heavy use, making literally thousands of cuts on pressure treated lumber, from 2x4's through 2x10's. Everyone who used it loved it, and I mean everyone, from lady volunteers who had never used a saw in their life to a master carpenter, and every skill level in between. It starts up smooth as silk, slides with ease, and powers through the cuts. The had a few other miter saws around for chopping 2x4's, and the Bosch looked like a man among boys next to them.

At the time I purchased it, laser cutting guide lights were not all that common on saws in this price range. Since then I added an after market \\"Infiniter\\" RS-1 laser cutting guide from Rockler ($20.00) and I now feel that the Bosch 3915 competes with the best of them. The factory provided 60 tooth blade gives clean cuts with no tear out. It also came with a 40 tooth blade as well. Though its bulk and weight can stand on its own, I have it screw mounted into a recessed work table for added stability and convenience.This is truly a quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding quality and value","review":"I purchased this saw nine months ago to use for the finish working I am doing on the second story addition to my house. The saw's performance is excellent, and it's priced better than any of the other saws in its class.The biggest challenge I've thrown at this saw is doing all the cross-cuts needed to install 1,200 ft2 of 3/4\\" solid Jatoba (Brazilian Cherry) flooring, including stair treads and risers. Jatoba is even harder than oak, and the Bosch saw has handled every cut with ease. Each cut has been clean and smooth and the saw is very easy to adjust for miter and compound miter cuts. The sliding mechanism is smooth, and has been extremely useful when cutting 12\\" deep stair treads.I love this saw, and would not hesitate to buy it again if I had to purchase another sliding compound miter saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serious Saw","review":"Received my new Bosch slide compund miter saw just two days ago.

My selection of this brand was based upon the performance of my other Bosch tools as well as the very helpful reviews on this site.I had only one simple adjustment to make by which the blade is made ninety degrees to the table.The only reason I do not give the saw 5 stars is because of the (you guessed it) dust collection. So far, the bag has picked up nothing. Will try a vacuum adaptor next but I really don't think this will prove much better.

I had my saw hook up to a powerful dust collection system (not just a shopvac), but just after a few simple cuts, there are saw dust everywhere! It threw dust around a 4 feet radius around the base! Maybe I am used to good dust collection system from a table saw and jointer, but I did not expect it to be this bad. Maybe this is a common problem for all miter saws and it is acceptable for a job site or an outdoor project, but if you plan to use this saw in a basement woodshop, prepare for a lot of cleaning afterward!!This is too bad because I would use this saw a lot more if it has a better dust collection system."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWSERS","review":"THIS SAW IS THE BEST IM A CARPENTER AND I LOVE IT BEST THING SINCE SLICE BREAD.

CBS has hit it out of the park again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted Case","review":"The dvd its self was awesome. Im a huge Stripes fan so of course I loved it. The case to the dvd was busted as if someone had droped it and it landed right on the bottom left corner. The plasic and the paper under the plastic was torn as well. I usually never have problems with Amazon. Even the used stuff I have bought from them in the past is almost in near perfect condition. Idk what happened this time?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes go to Canada","review":"I was not a White Stripes's fan, but I became more interested in their music after seeing Jack in the movie It Might Get Loud.I love that movie and I found this one very interesting too. Jack is a very clever guy and he is very in love with guitars and rock.The scenes off stage and on stage are very well balanced and I loved the Northern landscapes and atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and entertaining","review":"I was not a huge White Stripes fan basically due to lack of knowledge but I enjoyed the Blunderbuss CD so thought I would give this DVD a try and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to have up to a 10 star rating to get close!!","review":"Was a gift for my brother. I have never seen him so excited. He was thrilled to receive this cd and after listening to it for a few minutes in his car, he was rendered speechless. He loves it. This was indeed a rare find, and pretty expensive but it was worth it to see/hear such great results. Would highly reccomend if this cd can be found again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Battle?","review":"If you are interested in daily life in Austria during the Napoleonic period then there is something here for you, as this novel contains insights on that. However, if you want to know about Wagram, well I keep thumbing through this book and I can't find the chapter on it! It is not a bad book, it just has a misleading title."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a work of history","review":"This book which I purchased in hopes of finding more info on the battle of Wagram (why would I think it had something to do with that?) turned out to be a turgid and boring novel. Action? No... Plot? There was one. So one point for implementation. Conclusion? I returned it in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I hate to admit that I read this book. I am proud to say that I threw it away. What battle? Not in this book. Not even a decent story. Unbelievably boring and ridiculous. Apparently this waste of time takes place during the Napoleonic period. But I'm not sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of legwork, little result","review":"I think Mr. Bell took his research notes and just make a book out of it with little editing. Most of it was \\"I went here and did this. I drove here, had tea, then talked to this guy...\\" . Lots of pounding the pavement and time spent, but it was hard to draw any sort of conclusion based on his information and as a writer, he should at the very least tried to tie all his information together and come up with a thesis. There is none of that here. Besides a couple of new minor details, I came away from this book no more enlightened about Houdini and the incident that allegedly caused his death than I was before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulton Sheen's Guide to Contentment","review":"I like everything I hear or read from Fulton Sheen. He is so wise and so spiritual in understanding Jesus and the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruling Elite Intoxicated by Power","review":"History gives its audience a nice overview of good and really bad rulers of Antiquity. The series of eight rulers behaving badly stands out because of the in-depth analysis of their respective psychological profile in addition to the narrative of their deeds. The documentaries \\"Herod the Great,\\" \\"Constantine the Great,\\" \\"The Soldiers' Emperor,\\" and \\"The Queen Pharaoh\\" are also noteworthy for their content. In conclusion, History gives its viewers the opportunity to get a better appreciation of what these rulers accomplished or failed to accomplish during their lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended visual treat","review":"Color reproductions from science fiction posters pack a gorgeous presentation which focuses as much on the background history and talents of the artists themselves as on the works. Tony Nourmand is co-owner of a poster gallery in London and a poster consultant for Christie's; Graham Marsh is a designer and art director: their joint efforts here pack genre history with full-page poster reproductions in living color. A highly recommended visual treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction Poster Art","review":"Great Book, great quality printing and lots of amazing rare posters that I've never knew it existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamillosan as natural Medicine","review":"I've had Kamillosan liquid prescribed to me by a German physician when I had a windpipe infection. Kamillosan came with an inhalator. Simply inhaling the hot steam into mouth and nose several times a day helped a lot. I recommend this everytime you have breathing problems due to a cold or flu, sinus infection, mouth and throat catarrh, bronchitis and such, especially right before bedtime for relief and a better night's sleep.Kamillosan also helped with hemorrhoids by using as a sitzbath clearing this up in just a few days with noticable result. It saved a trip to the doctor. I have the booklet on this medication, it can be used in so many different ways (cold/flu, infections, wounds, digestive problems, skin care, baby care). I recommed Kamillosan for your home medicine cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamillosan is a miracle","review":"Growing up in Germany, we would use Kamillosan for cuts, pimples, infections and more. It is the best healing liquid/ointment I have ever used. What a relief that it can now be purchased in the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamillosan is OK!","review":"Bought this German product initially when I lived in Thailand. It is excellent for instantly removing the pain of a sore throat. Tastes terrible (so you know it working!) The container I received just had a dropper but fortunately I had the old sprayer bottle so I was able to refill it and use the spray which is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamillosan","review":"This product was suggested by an oncologist to relieve some of the effects due to radiation. It appears to be helping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Cheap binding causes the book to fall apart. Manufacturers simply should not be allowed to produce a codex in this format, it is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent discussions of the masters with brief discography","review":"This book focuses on the key composers of each age. Dubal spends a lot of time on the artistic development of each composer. He does a good job describing the emotional impact of each of their major works and often provides a quotation from another composer who was impacted by that work. Finally, he provides a list of recommended CDs to get a beginner started in building a collection.One drawback--he spends almost no time analyzing the key elements of a particular composition or how the composer accomplished his purpose with his music. Also, his prose, while beautiful, might be a bit flowery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable movie","review":"This was my favorite movie when I was studying film in college. It is certainly a comedy, but one that has remained with me almost 25 years now. I recall the \\"chicken-coop\\" scene every few months, and begin going thru the emotion and questioning that I experienced when watching so long ago. Although the film moneymen had wanted a simple slapstick comedy, the director fooled them and created a movie of depth behind the laughs. This created bad feelings and I believe there were lawsuits and the film was shelved for a time, despite winning awards. The movie is very funny but it's like a tootsie-pop...the candy is great but the chewy middle makes it special."},{"rating":"1","title":"bread and chocolate","review":"The quality of the DVD was grainy and he sound quality poor. This was worse than one would expect from an original master. The film tself represented the contrast between the well off swiss (chocolate) and the italian and turkish working class (bread) just working to survive. It is classified as a comedy. I would call it a tragedy. The Haydn quartet - opus 3 number 5 - the serenade, provides a wonderfully appropriate theme musical background."},{"rating":"1","title":"bread and chocolate","review":"i bought this for 2 reasons because NINO MANFREDI made a ITALIAN SONG that i liked very much and the other because my friend had seen it 35 years ago and he said he liked it .after watching it i found it so so maybe because i have trouble liking italian mvies even though i am ITALIAN.last to say if i was brought in ITALY i would have enjoyed the film better"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much chocolate, not enough bread!","review":"BREAD: funny at points, the main actor was a sensitive and sympathetic character...at first at least... also the portrayal of a a man out of his country, out of his element struck a symbolic chord in me (= a person not at home in him/herself, not on a connected path, a lost soul out of joint)CHOCOLATE: the character went too far at being comedic and became a buffoon, so that it was hard to empathize with him...and at that point the story lost its symbolic strength. also, by the plot going over the top, becoming too wild and absurd, it lost its simple power and just became dull, frankly.i couldn't finish watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pagan","review":"Good for what it is described. I use it as a reference for my Pagan Fellowship Group. A good basic book for a Pagan Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic and Informative source","review":"I am just starting this path, and this book explained in an easy but detailed manner how the gems and rocks and planets and colors all work together in spells and other majic.Scott wrote in a fluid manner and was very easy to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this book to your magickal bookshelf now!","review":"If you get only one book on gems/crystals/metals and thier magickal correspondences, buy this book! I refer to this book almost daily; it has a brief history of each stone alphabetically, their magickal uses/correspondences and even color pictures of the different stones. A very complete guide that is good for any magickal use, written in the wonderful style of Scott Cunningham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative and straightforward Guide","review":"An excellent, gentle guide to including natural magic into one's life.This book and others have helped me to come to terms with the mystical side of every soul and the universe we live in - without eroding my more mainstream belief in the one G-d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Journey into Stone Magick for Beginners of Crystal Divination","review":"I avoided and ignored this book for a long time.The general responses said about,'Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal,Gem & Metal Magick',placed it as being weak on depth,scope and purpose.I found the book to be quite charming,regardless of the popular opinion downplaying the book's material.Contrary to most,i can only recommend this work as one of the author's best.His personal insightful experience with 'Stone Magick' is pleasant,unique and charming to read about.This book can be used as a basic heuristic method for establishing or furthering your own stone divination technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have resource","review":"When I first began learning about crystals and other gemstones, this was one of the first titles I added to my bookshelf, and it has been an invaluable resource ever since. Now, years later, this is the *only* book I recommend to others who are beginning their own explorations into working with stones, as it is so easy to look up precisely what you need and find helpful details. Cunningham definitely knows his stuff, and all of his titles -- including this one -- are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable addition to the occult library","review":"The late Scott Cunningham had a remarkable talent for compiling information into clear and readable accounts, such as his works on herbs,oils, incense, foods, etc. This book is no exception, as he offers an exhaustive encyclopedia about the magical properties of gems and precious metals. He provides a succinct history of the uses of each stone, its folklore, the deities it represents, and its magical uses. His bibliographies are always appreciated, as they are annotated, and offer a very helpful guide to further reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy enjoyable read","review":"My first exposure to Scott Cunningham. Found the book very easy and enjoyable to read. I was able to read it in one sitting. He provides a great deal of information and presents it in a clear and easy to understand way. This book would make an excellent reference tool and I recommend it for anyone seeking such a resource. The only downer was (to me) the excess of \\"money making\\" spells, delivering a message the average wiccan is a very financially challanged or money centric individual. I would like to imagine there are more graceful things we can apply energy to than making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be alot better","review":"Another scott cunningham typical book. The author attempts to create a book about crystal and metal practice but it is a very fluffy bunny wiccan format, usual for him. The author explains overbaringly so about ethics and morality and gives rules on how one is \\"allowed\\" to use stones. The author also claims that in certain configurations like a necklace stones are more powerfull than seperate peices. He further explains that polished stoned are more powerfull than stones in the rough, IS HE SERIOUS? I would tend to believe that using a stone in its natural state is far better than a man tumbled and polished stone. Anyways if your looking for a good book on stones read LOVE IS IN THE EARTH by MELODY. Its a far better work. Also if I might add, its a good idea to just stay clear of scott cunningham books all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH","review":"The author gives a wiccan explaination of the use of stones and claims that stones which are polished are more powerfull than those in the rough. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with Cunningham","review":"Upon reading Cunningham's bio on the back of the book, I was incredibly disappointed in his lack of practice in the Wiccan arts. He's completely uninterested in the history of Wicca which is an essential to any practicing Witch. I find it arrogant that someone who is relatively clueless to the actual Wiccan artforms feels the need to write books about it telling others how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good effort","review":"All in all, I liked this book. It had good references, good explanations, and nice pictures. However, it worried me that some of the definitions were rather vague. For instance, at least half the stones had \\"healing\\" as one of their properties. Still, a good beginner's reference written in the no-nonsesne Cunningham style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem & Metal Magic","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. While there is some information in it, I found it to be lacking. There are SO many stones with SO many uses. I had hoped that more would have been covered. Also the book had few pictures. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!!!","review":"The content of this book is extremely interesting as you wont find the kind of information elsewhere and with the kinda detail Mr Cunningham supplies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal, Gem and Metal Magic","review":"This is a very good book for all who are interested in this topic. I purchased this book to replace a very dogearred copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Communion with God","review":"Have the courage to listen to this tape or read the book. If you are a new-ager and have problems with the word God, lay it down and listen. If you are a stout Christian but something just doesn't add up for your, lay it down and listen. If everyone looked at the 10 illusions in their lives and then interacted with the rest of the world, knowing the illusions - WOW! This was a life changing book/tape for me! I am paying attention to Neal and not picking it up as the finally authority or my next bible, but I do recommend this book. Even if you hate it, it will make you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost along the way","review":"I consider this book to be one of my greatest waste of time and money to date. By the title one would think/hope it dealt with advanced Navigating skills. After reading it, I can assure you it dose NOT! What it is, is a rambling self praise book that deals with survival skills. Yes those skills do include navigation, but Mr Davenport's long winded overly complicated discriptions make it laboreous to learn even the most basic skill. I learned more about navigating and survival watching the movie \\"The Edge\\". My advice to anyone thinking about buying this book is to save your money and buy one of the military manuels instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaks to the soul","review":"I picked this video for a Spanish class to view after we had our discussion of the Spanish Civil War. Several themes came to mind afterward- PTSD, a longing for the past, and reconnecting with the past in order to move on in the future, to name a few. All of the students enjoyed it and recommended it saying they were able to understand a lot of the Spanish and could relate to revisiting the past hoping to find that someone they cherished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound/video quality, decent show....","review":"I'm not a fan of this particular dvd, which is a shame...it's the only true Eek video I can find anywhere. The quality is very similar to the Barrington Levy (Wanted) Live in SF dvd....poor at best. The lighting is terrible, and the audio is not representative of what Eek brings to a live show. Only a true hardcore Eek fan will find this one tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Predictable","review":"This is a page turner, alright; maybe the pages should be \\"turned\\" into a halfway decent made-for-TV movie....to be shown on Lifetime Cheannel, because my three year-old cousin could have written this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent start, interesting premise, lousy finish","review":"This was a disappointing book. It started ok, and actually was a fairly good (maybe B-) read for most of the book, but just a terrible finish (like D-).The protaganist was just too wimpy. And the book finishes that way.This was a thriller that was also a human drama (or was it a human drama that was also a thriller?). But the thrill died out, and the drama didn't flourish.I'd give it one star, but it was decent most of the way through, so let's go with 2**."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful--An Easy to read page-turner","review":"This is the tale that make you ask the question, \\"What would I do?\\" Everyone dreams of this happening to them and this book truly shows the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Sorry, but this one bored me to tears. The million-dollar jackpot is a nice thought, but even that's cliche like most everything else in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Plan Redoux","review":"Maybe I enjoyed \\"Windfall\\" so much because I also loved \\"A Simple Plan\\", and the basic plots are quite similar. Magnuson does a great job of having his main character, Ben, agonize over the questions we'd all ask when trying to hide illicit funds. How does an honest man launder money? When will the bad guys show up? How do I find a way to make this money improve, and not ruin my life?The tension is high, and I finally gave up trying to read it in bed and finished the novel during the day. I just couldn't get to sleep after a session with this story! It's not Shakespeare, but it surely was an entertaining and thought-provoking rollercoaster of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner! Couldn't put it down!","review":"This is an extremely entertaining novel about the \\"lure\\" of materialism.\\" It grabs you and doesn't let go. It was taut and suspenseful - highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful thriller","review":"This book made me anxious - but that's a compliment. I had time to read this only in small late-night portions, and my sleep suffered for a week. Magnuson portrays beautifully the internal conflicts of a man who stumbles onto a fortune, but can't let anyone know. The pacing is excellent, the dilemma gripping. Grab it for the beach this summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fasr but damaged book","review":"Book came in fast but had damage to the page edges and looks like mold on some pages.

I hate to read and I don't like books that involve reading,,,bllaaahhhhh......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best","review":"I first read this book as a teenager in the '70's and though it fascinated me (astral projection was new to me then) I found the techniques frustratingly difficult to follow. Baker uses the technique of becoming lucid while dreaming, which in itself is no easy task, and, once accomplished, projecting the consciousness to a desired location. Problem is, once I became lucid I almost always awakened, usually within 20 or 30 seconds (and sometimes sooner) thereby putting an end to my astral endeavors. Because of the poor results I got using these techniques I can't give this book more than 2 stars.However, for those people who have a knack for this particular technique of astral projection this may be what the doctor ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe think twice","review":"Originally written in 1969, supposedly revised in 1995, I found the book to be a bit out-dated.

It was also presented in 70mm on that huge Radio City screen. I remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see Tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more. Wow,,,,what a great movie!I've seen many versions of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen. Maybe because it's a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it's gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red, white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. (hehe) Buy it before some group puts a ban on it. Which should want you to buy this for the kids even more. They don't make them like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film For a Young Boy...","review":"I was seven years old when I first saw this film in a theatre in 1973. I never forgot it. Regardless of what the \\"high-brow\\" literary-types say about the screenplay abandoning Twain's original story, this is a terrific film for the young boy in your life who's beginning to notice the wonder of the world around him.As for the music, I don't think you could ask for more than the Oscar-winning duo who provided the tunes for most of Disney's movies for years, Richard and Robert Sherman.Then there's the film's cast, most of whom have gone on to bigger and better things: Remember 'Sgt. Hulka' from \\"Stripes\\"? or Jeff East who plays Huck? Not to mention little Jodie Foster. It's worth buying the film just to see them when they were younger...Truly a great film with all the mischief and awe and fun that a young boy dreams of enjoying before he's forced to grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising on this DVD","review":"The advertisment for this DVD on Amazon was incorrect. The ad stated that the DVD was in Wide Screen Anamorphic format. The DVD was not in this format, it was standard Pan and Scan, and it was a poor quality transfer from the film. I thought about returning it, but decided to give it as a gift. Motion Pictures that are filmed in anamorphic, or 2.35 to 1 format should only be transfered to a DVD in this format. The people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised, and poorly educated to artistic principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER PAN & SCAN TRAVESTY","review":"MGM issued this on laserdisc a few years back in letterbox format, and an audio commentary track with Johnny Whitaker.

Don't waste your money on this until the studios wise up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why only full screen?","review":"I, too, saw this wonderful movie when it first came out, and it was shown in the CinemaScope aspect ratio. I waited for years for the DVD to come out, and when it did, I ordered it immediately. It came today, and I am returning it tomorrow. I don't buy pan-and-scan versions of 'scope movies.

The reviews went from 5-star to 1-star. But I haven't seen the movie in about 30 years and wanted to see it again so I went ahead and ordered it. I have to say I am so glad I did. From the moment I put it on I was transformed back to Radio City Music Hall where I saw it for the first time. I even remembered a lot of the songs, they just came back to me, and back in the day we didn't get to see the movies over and over again where we could memorize the songs. I didn't encounter some of the visual problems that other reviewers had. It may be a little dark in a few scenes, but I could overlook that for a trip down memory lane.

I do not want to wrestle the oven while putting it into a complete enclosed storage bag it is getting to cumbersome for a 75 year old guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION","review":"After ordering I saw the review which explained that what you see and what is stated is in fact misleading.

So much for book covers. A better comparison would be to Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, since both involve vast conspiracy theories and arcane magic. Eco's book works because it's really about people, and about the human fallibilities that make us want to believe such unlikely tales; Neville's characters, on the other hand, are too lifeless to support the implausible plot. Much heavy-handed foreshadowing and historical namedropping. Read Eco instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong then peters out...","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it for my book club.

Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Great plot device but outcome is very predictable. The characters are so stock as to be out of comic books. The author does a better job with the 18th century than with the 20th, the historical characters come alive and are fun and interesting while the fictional characters (the stars of the book) are terrible. How about some realism in your people Ms. Neville -- give them them age appropriate positions in the world and be at least somewhat realistic in their experiences. Very disappointing and ultimately brought down the book to a less than enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Eight\\" by Katherine Neville","review":"This is possibly one of the best works of fiction ever written.

From the first page, I was hooked. I can't recommend it highly enough--romance, adventure, fantasy, imagination, and a hum-dinger of a plot leave you guessing until the end (if you can last the whole thing without taking a peek...it will be hard!). I can't wait for Katherine Neville to write another book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"It's supposedly as awesome as the Da Vinci Code but to tell you the truth, it's tedious. If you want evidence read only page 186. She goes into SO much detail about the bookstore (useless information) that you have to wonder if the bookstore is some sort of inanimate character that will somehow fit into the plot later (magically come to life etc etc). Is it really necessary to add that much detail about the store? I mean, really. It's ok but I don't think the chess aspect of it is as exciting as the reviewers supposedly think it is. Also, it talks about the \\"Service\\" and its history, why it's so great, etc. but I did not really get the feeling that it was that powerful...which is important bc it's the central object of this novel, lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish it.","review":"What a waste of money.

They have no food, and barely enough water, not to mention a little dog and are rescued by a plane that happens to be big enough to transport them AND the rolls royce. ARE.YOU.KIDDING.ME? That along with the back and forth from past to future about a chess set and different people being the players is just too much. What is the point?

Nevermind the cardboard characters and the clunking prose, but I am now on page 322 and hardly anything has happened!Oh yes, there are plenty of winks and nudges, dark hints and smouldering looks - but when will this plot actually get into second gear?? I hate giving up on books, but tonight I have made a decision not to waste any more of my life on this truly dreadful effort.Personally, I can't understand how any publisher would have taken this on and then not at least employed an experienced editor to make it halfway readable.I'm not normally this grumpy (honest!) but The Eight is just way below anything that you would expect to pay money for. If I could, I would have give it zero stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"LIke many other reviewers, I had high hopes for this book. The theological/historical fiction genre is my favorite. I kept pushing through this book in hopes that at some point, I would fall in love with it. No such luck. I have a hard time believing that The Eight went through a rigorous editing process. There were so many irrelevant details and characters introduced that the plot got lost along the way. Every so often there would be a paragraph where I knew I was supposed to have an \\"a-ha!\\" moment, but they always fell flat. The author kept alluding to upcoming intensity (\\"if I had only known that the next 24 hours would bring such and such\\") so I'd keep reading and never find the shocking twist that was supposedly right around the corner. I really think this could have been a good book, but only if it was about 200 pages shorter and more efficiently told."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripping good yarn!!!","review":"I am not of a mathematical or musical disposition; I do not play chess, but I love reading and was absolutely captivated by The Eight!

It is somewhat interesting and plesant to read, but it is certainly not a masterwork by any means. I also found the ending to be a great disappointment there were so many other options avaliable, the choice of the author seems trite and really distroys the integrety of the work. I also caution against looking too closely at the 'history' in this book - I found the contortions a bit hard to take. A very plesant book to read, but nothing like Eco's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read it fast, you are going to miss it when you finish","review":"The Eight is the book that I recommend to anyone that listen to me.I bought it because I heard somebody in a book store talking about how good was this book, he was absolutely right!

I almost bought it based on that. I waited more than a year to finally buy it and read it however. Once I began I was very impressed. Shortly into this book I found myself wondering about the author. I couldn't imagine that there were people who appreciated the same things that I do. I was reminded at times of \\"Godel,Escher,Bach\\" by Hofsteader. Upon completion of this work I was very impressed. The author has a unique opening to her chess game. An inspiring middle game. Unfortunately I felt that the end game was a bit weak. I was impressed enough however to find myself looking for more of her work. I would like the author to know that I appreciated a lot of the subtle things which I saw there. Someday you may play a game with a better end game. I think however that the her \\"game\\" was for the most part very sound. Congratulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 - To Be Sure!","review":"Like many people I read for relaxation and enjoyment. I have read many, many, many books over time and there are few books that I can honestly say have surprised me. The Eight was one that really surprised me. Perhaps it is because I make allowances or dont expect much from literature, especially modern fiction. This book was well conceived, well written and had a brilliant and intriguing plot that held together from beginning to end. I consider myself a fairly cynical and discerning reader but this book is absolutely on my Top 10.Post Script: To the recent reviewers who were so hugely disappointed by the 4.5 Star rating I can understand why you felt this book was lacking if your tastes run to the more mundane and oft replicated plots by Grisham, Crichton (have you read Prey yet???) and Sheldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than DaVinci Code...","review":"...and I loved The DaVinci Code. The Eight is not well-known enough in my opinion. I passed it along to my mom who is a die-hard book lover and she loved it so much that she's passed my copy on to one of her friends.With that having been said, The Eight is one of those books that goes back and forth between present day and the past. It also provides descriptive words to help you visualize places you may not have visited, such as Africa.It's been a while since I read it, and writing this review makes me want to reread it because it was very complex and detailed, and a reread will likely help me get a better understanding of some points I may have originally missed. And I am not one to reread books!

I have probably encouraged over 100 people to read this book, including almost everyone on a mailing list, and I feel that the mystery, adventure and collection of hidden meanings and ideas in this book makes it a voyage each time I read it. And since voyaging is victory, that's a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book to pass up.","review":"An interesting premise turned into a silly plot: New Age Woman goes on fantasy adventure. But my main trouble with the book was the writing style, or rather styles. It reads like it is written by two or three seperate entities (Neville into chanelling?). Particularly annoying was the voice of the modern day character, Cat Vellis, who sounded as if she would be more at home in a harlequin romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"I found the idea of the book interesting and I wanted to see how it turned out but I found it hard to get through the badly written, over-wrought pages.

This was a neat idea that needed a good editor--and maybe a better author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable; Not even close to Brown's Da Vinci Code as some may suggest","review":"This book was okay. Good Story telling between two era's that are brought together in the end, but it was predictable. I also felt there was too much filler content that made it unnecessarily lengthy. I picked this one up because some suggested to was similar to Brown's Da Vinci Code....but that was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Steady Diet of Cotton Candy","review":"Reading Katherine Neville's novel The Eight was like having to eat nothing but cotton candy for a week straight. Heavy-handed, unintentionally funny with dialogue straight out of a \\"Bad Novel\\" writing contest, it drags on and on like a terrible nightmare. I finally resorted to something I have NEVER done with a book--skipping to the last chapter to see Who Dun It. In my defense, this was done out of a sense of self-preservation as I thought if I had to read any more of this drivel I might go mad. I can't believe this is a best-seller! As the author was a VP at B of A, did she make her staff buy it, read it and do book reports? As her character Harry might say, \\"Oy, darling!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst book ever written","review":"I picked this up at a local grocery store for a dollar. I overpaid by 100 cents. I would shred this and put it in my cat's litterbox, but that would be cruel because he deserves to defecate on something better.This book has a DaVinci Code like plot through the eys of historical characters and through the present to the books heroine. And you must be on heroin if you want to get to the last page. If you are a simple minded conspiracy nut job then this book might appeal to you, but only if you've head a frontal lobatomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PERILS OF PAULINE IN SPADES","review":"I give her one star for idea/plot and another for research. She gets none for writing only what is necessary to tell the story. She gets none for characters. She gets none for editing. The drivel went on ad infinitum. So many harsh, angry women and so many handsome, beautiful men ready to rescue said harsh, angry women. So many coincidental meet-ups of famous people. Like name dropping.

It was boring to me.

For those who critique this book for not being historically accurate, I would suggest you check out what aisle in the bookstore this book came from (p.s., its FICTION).

All in all an outstanding read for the history nut, the chess buff, and a little bit for the romance enthusiast too."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much potential...","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars except for how the ending turned out. I am really impressed with the author's creative skills and how she can weave a plot together. Overall, it seemed very interesting and plausible.I thought the greatest weakness was the ending. With so many possibilities, it seems like such a mild conclusion. I sense that possibly there will be a sequel and that this is not the last we have heard of Cat. Maybe that is why the ending is the way it is. Sort of like the ending to the first Lord of the Rings books. It just leads to something bigger and better.One question that I kept coming to at the end was \\"Why?\\".Why was everything so important and all the sudden it wasn't?It seems this book is more about the pursuit than actually getting it. Lots of things in life are like that. I guess I just wanted a bigger ending, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book I loan out more than any other","review":"Somehow, when people ask me what my favorite book is ... (a tough question for any avid reader) my mind always comes back to this book! The Eight captured my imagination and all the twists and turns left me hungry for more. The cryptic messages that have you flipping backward in the book to read them again ... A tremendous amount of historical research went into this book, and combined with real life experiences of the author. I have loaned my tattered paperback out so often, that I have to replace the book every few years. Worth every penny. Always on my list of the top ten books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I really tried to like this book and I thought the concept was interesting...but the terrible dialogue, complete lack of suspence and flat characters made me stop reading about half way through. From the beginning there was never any compelling evidence as to why Catherine (the main character for the modern portion of the book) was in danger, yet she is shot at and has her apartment broken into, all for simply having heard about the chess set. I would recommend any of the other popular historical/intrigue novels (Angels & Demons, DaVinci Code, The Rule of Four, Name of the Rose) over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but the execution is too confused","review":"I picked up this book after reading and loving \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" The premise of two women in different time periods on a quest for the pieces of a mystical, Moorish chesss set of untold power is a great idea, but this book is just too unwieldy in its execution. There were too many characters to keep track of, and only a few of those were developed to their full potential. The book seemed too scattershot -- it contained references to everyone from Napoleon to Catherine the Great to Benedict Arnold, Wordsworth, Mohammar Qaddafi, and Bach. You don't even really find out what the chess set does until after the first 300 pages or so. I finished it only because I had invested so much time in it. I will say that by the end, there's a good pay off that ties everything together, but after 600 pages, it's just too little too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Neville has the power to capture the essence of time!","review":"I could not put this book down. In the league of Umburto Eco, Katherine Neville puts out another great book. She has the ability to tell a story that spans hundreds of years! Jumping from one time to the next was handled masterfully. She give a creepy sense of reality to this book that is like no other thriller I have ever read. Her incorporation of real charaters from history was beautifully done. She doesn't just tell a story, she creates a legacy. I definitely recommend this book to whomever picks it up. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent web of murder, deceipt, history and passion","review":"A wonderful intoxicating BIG book that presents every challenge to a reader which makes a reading experience extraordinary as opposed to just good. You are transported in time and space, unaware of the intertwinging of fiction and non. The characters - many from our history lessons and superegos - are sharply developed. Although the book ramble sin places and the characters get a bit overwhelming to keep up with, there's nary a wasted syllable. Set against the backdrop of chess, you don't have to be a chess player to enjoy it - the metaphor never escapes you with just a small sense of the game. Life is a game after all, and this book is a grande game of intrigue, mystery and even faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the most engrossing book I have read!","review":"It's hard to add to the list of superlatives about this book!!Katherine Neville has woven a wonderful story(?) that continues to haunt me - even almost 10 years after reading it for the first time (and I've now read it 8 or 10 times). It is marvelously inventive, historically (mostly) accurate, and provides wonderful bases for some of the most intriguing conversations.I've passed this book on to most of my male relatives and friends - who all think I'm nuts when I insist they read a \\"chick\\" book, then come to me three days later absolutely amazed how much they liked it!If there is one weakness, it is that the modern-day characters could be more fully drawn - but that's relatively minor when compared to the intricacy of the story and the wealth of detail Ms. Neville provides.All I can say is try it! I'm sure you'll like it!(By the way - wouldn't this make a great computer game, a la \\"Myst\\"??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"The Eight wasn't bad, but comparing it to Brown's The Da Vinci Code is simply not fair to the latter. The plot is nowhere near as intricate or exciting. Not quiet as well-researched, either. If nothing else (and there was plenty), I assure you, nobody received a \\"special education\\" in the Pioneer's Palace in the USSR. It's like saying that somebody was specially educated at the Boy Scouts. The two stories are disconnected till the last couple of pages. Some of the scenes and dialogue smacked of Danielle Steel.Overall, I found it rather underwhelming.Given the wealth of excellent books out there, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Like It More Than I Did","review":"I could not enjoy this book. I wanted to, I forced myself to read more than 450 pages to see if I could, but in the end I just didn't care enough to finish it. I found some plot elements too coincidental, our 1970s herione just a little too unlikeable, and for the life of me could not understand some charater's leaps of logic. That last could have something to do with me not understanding a thing about chess, though. I'm also someone who likes to be able to relate to, or at least feel some empathy for, a character I'm reading about, but none of the characters in this book caught me in any real way. Unfortunately this is not a book that I can recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated drivel","review":"This book is badly written, needlessly convoluted, and chock full of gratuitous and often inaccurate historical details. I found some of the historical name dropping laughable and clearly the author was overeager to impart intellectual gravitas to her sub-par effort by padding the narrative with copious amounts of historical celebrity name dropping. I'm not even going to mention all the bodice ripper rip-off sections that just make this book that much more of a chore to read. The whole book seems to be one big exposition consisting of around 590 pages leading to a rushed, limp ending that holds no thrill and is easily guessed, with a bit of imagination, much earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"It seems that the author was too committed to trying to tie chess and the number eight to everything in life regardless of how ridiculous the plot needed to be to make it happen.Characters were pretty simple, and the \\"logic\\" explaining thier actions just didn't make sense much of the time. I certainly wouldn't want the book to be any longer, but I think many of the scenes needed to be drawn out and developed further."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my time on this book!","review":"I had read reviews of this book and was looking forward to a good read. As I was getting close to the end last night I thought, \\"Surely the author is waiting to the very last to make this book worthwhile.\\" I'm still wondering how and WHY I stuck with it.What a disappointment and a waste of time. I learned a few interesting things about Algeria, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is terrible","review":"if you want to read a book that's actually intelligently written, and not sophomorically bad...try foucault's pendulum (eco) or the name of the rose (eco) instead. the development and depth of this book is of kindergarten-level quality, at best. but if you are dull, you'll love this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Only read the first 60 pages. When I dreaded having to pick it up again I knew it was time to move on to something enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on tease; short on payoff","review":"It took me EIGHT weeks to read this book. If I were not a chess enthusiast, I probably would have given up early, but I kept looking for a payoff involving some grand chess theme. That never happened. I didn't have any problem with Neville's writing style, as some reviewers did, but I found it impossible to keep up with the jumble of French and Arab names of characters and towns. In summary, I gave the book a low rating because it raised questions that were never satisfactorily answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Often a tease without every reaching it's potential","review":"After several attempts I've managed to fight my way to the half way point of \`The Eight. At times it's riveting and at others positively dull, I know there has to be more given the rave reviews, but when?This is the first novel (just finished the entire stable of Dan Brown thrillers) in sometime I've used effectively as a cure for insomnia, that can't be a good testimony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to finish","review":"For better or for worse, I'm the kind of person who has to finish a book or movie once I start it. While I usually take less than a week to read a book, it took a few months to plod through 300 pages of this 600 page book, as I had to force myself to read it. Eventually I made the rare decision to cut my losses and give up.As others have mentioned, there are simply too many characters, minimal character development and a glut of never-ending backstory. Neville definitely could have used a good Editor to sharpen the plot and the writing. There are glimpses of an interesting plot throughout the book, which is why I read as much as I did, but it gets bogged down in the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true spellbinding original","review":"i read it when it first came out and again when Opra added it to her book club. nothing like it - although others have tried"},{"rating":"2","title":"The PLOT!!!","review":"Like a previous reviewer said... OMG the PLOT! This story makes \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" look like a first book. I love this book and it's been reviewed a lot of times, but I am glad I missed it in years past because I love it now... I can tell I will be rereading this one to find the stuff I missed the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least 200 pages too long","review":"This would have been an interesting book if it was only 400 pages long. The only truly charming character was killed off in the first 200 pages, and it's hard to care about any of the rest of them. The book had an interesting premise, and would have been interesting if it was significantly tightened up."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a terrible excuse for a book","review":"someone recommended this book to me, knowing that i enjoyed eco's novels (esp. foucault's pendulum); needless to say, i have not taken anything seriously that that person has said to me since i finished reading this pitiful 'book'.don't be fooled by some idiot recommending this to you, it is a very very very very poor novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT buy this book!!!","review":"I am unfortunately a slow reader, so can often take a month to get through an average sized novel. I'm also the sort of person who, having started a particular book, will always look to finish it. So having spent a good few weeks reading this TRIPE (& moaning continually to my girlfriend about how bad it is) I really wish I hadn't. I enjoyed Da Vinci code (but don't agree with the hype) and on that basis a friend recommended this to me - I just don't see the link, as this is boring, poorly written nonsense. I'm having a barbecue tomorrow night & already know how I'm gonna get that fire started..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Intrigue is abundant in this book. Heroines in the present and centuries past. Two stories unravel yet are intertwined around the same chess set with powers no one should possess. The women in both time periods struggle to gain control of the chess pieces and keep their powers a secret and out of the wrong hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I'm halfway through and can't understand the rave review of the person who loaned the book to me. She loved it and I have a great deal of respect for her. But the book strikes me as being completely facile. Who would believe that this 20-something of the 20th century can be such a naive idiot, and the only female in a top accounting firm? And back to the 18th century, did Neville pick the top 10 names of the period and just casually drop them into the plot? The characters are silly and unbelievable in both time frames. What am I missing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down!","review":"I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next chapter. It's full of descriptive images about the people, the different countries and about chess! I don't know how to play chess, yet I did not have a difficult time understanding and comprehending this book. At the beginning of every chapter, there is a small paragraph from literature that describes the chess move. This book is very intriguing and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Pants","review":"If you enjoy reading the back of soup cans, then, boy, are you in for a thrilling time. If books are more your thing then avoid this contrived, bloated turkey of a novel in which the Author concocts a magical (not really) Chess service that secretly hides an alchemical formula. Forget hackneyed, graceless metaphors and try the real thing. It's called the Emerald Tablet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"I'd have to agree with one reviewer- if you are trying to fill the \\"Da Vinci void\\" this one won't do it. The danger in writing parallel stories is that the reader can easily lose track and one story may be more engaging than the other. Such was the case here. Also the unnecessary depth of detail detracted from the smooth flow of storyline. I didn't get past page 150 and decided to spend time more valuably. Call me still looking.................."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 is Great","review":"This book is for readers who enjoy the story. I found this book engaging, informative and fun. Have read all of Dan Brown's and found this equal to DaVinci. This book is about the game of chess - the game ultimate metaphor of life and friendships."},{"rating":"1","title":"overzealous and disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book given the rave reviews, but was sadly disappointed by an author who tries so hard to mesh too many historical characters in such a cursory fashion. Add in the fantasy/mystical angle for the plot, and the book leaves you with the sense that absolutely nothing is authentic. The references to historical figures actually becomes tedious.In other \\"semi-historical\\" books the characters are fictional and the time period pseudo-accurate (e.g., the Alienist, Angels & Demons). Or the characters are as close to what one would imagine (e.g., The Great Train Robbery). In this case neither is true.Finally, I won't spoil the ending, but the resolution of the plot is horribly disappointing. The whole 600 pages talks about discovering a formula. Well?Overall, the writing style isn't bad, and the author has a way of keeping you reading. But, too many times I'd put the book down and say to myself, \\"oh no, here comes another misused historical figure\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Thought Provoking Page Turner","review":"Aside from the famous name dropping which I thought detracted from the book, a superb read. I still wonder about some of the word play throughout the book and also don't know who played the various positions in \\"The Game\\". For example Most Cats have 9 lives so what does Cat Velis =Cat Lives mean. and all the words beginning with car/kar?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Novel I have ever read!!!!!!","review":"It has been over 6 or 7 years since I have read this book but it still rings fresh in my mind. This book had several different interests for me beings that I enjoy chess, am a history nut and absolutely love mysteries and intrigue. This book done what would seemingly be the impossible and intertwined all these subjects together in a very smooth fashion. This book took all these things and intermingled them with real-life historical figures from the past and made you want to know more about these people. After I read this book I ran down to my library to find out more about Charlemagne, Robespeirre and Napoleone and Catherine the Great. This novel is most definitely a MUST READ!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Was The Editor","review":"The book could have done with better editing, in fact, the editor must have been out to lunch. As it is, it's tedious and often akwardly written. The frequently elaborate descriptions of personae, places, furniture, what have you, remind one of a romance novel rather than a thriller.As a thriller, is doesn't move well either.Also, the reader is left to guess which of the stories are historically accurate. An afterword explaining research and what's historical and what are the author's license and invention, as well a bibliography, is missing, inexcusable in my opinion in an ambitious book such as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, hard slog","review":"This ambitious book has a promising start, but it loses its way. Ms. Neville exhibits an impressive grasp of history, chess, mathematics, art, computers, and more--but that's a big part of the problem. The plot is full of gratuitous detours apparently designed simply to show off the author's knowlege of of these subjects. At first these bunny trails are minor distractions, but for me they built into a major annoyance. Only more patient and forgiving readers than I will make it to the end of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot-driven, poorly written, lame ending","review":"I almost put this book down after the first chapter because the writing style turned me off. I decided to give it a second chance and got hooked by the plot. It reminded me a lot of the DaVinci Code, but wasn't quite as suspenseful and started to drag about halfway through. I liked the historical details, but was disappointed by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memorable","review":"I say this because halfway through this tome I realized I'd read it a long time ago. The realization came as a shock. I didn't remember a thing about it. On rereading, I find it rather tiresome, dragging in every name Neville could think of and every reference to chess she could find (and Lewis Carroll she ain't). Divided by time, seeking the same chess board and pieces, the modern heroine is an idiot and completely unlikeable. The second heroine is better drawn, especially during the French Terror, but again...ultimately, who cares? I begin to dislike quests that end with the usual \\"ultimate power in the wrong hands\\" kind of thing. When a master takes it on, like Tolkien, then stand back. But when a much lesser light tries, it's a scatter shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so happy it ended...finally.","review":"I love to read. And I'll read about anything. I'm also a chess player and enjoy books that do multiple timelines with intertwining plots. I thought that \\"The Eight\\" would be really good.It wasn't.I was a history major in college. I know a good deal about the French Revolution. For Neville's portrayal of this era, I'd give her props. But the constant name dropping of historical characters was ridiculous. I found it distracting.I think my biggest gripe was the character Cat. I found it extrememly unrealistic for a person her age (26?) to be that skilled at computers in the time period she was in. And just because was she was 'smart'--she could decode everything?I felt like the plot could have been so much better---cleaner, direct...plausible.I read every book I start---but this one was hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Writing","review":"This book started with a potentially interesting idea, but the writing is so dreadful, the characters so cardboard, the plot so ridiculous, and the ending so unfufilling that I can only say if this is what passes for a good book these days, America is in serious trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Someone sent me this book while I was on bedrest during my pregnancy. At the time, I was reading a lot of trashy mystery novels and feeling like I was cheating my brain out of nonfiction. I picked this book up expecting it to be brain candy. Boy was I surprised!Yes, it's a mystery/adventure kind of story. But the setting, jumping between modern New York and revolutionary France, required just enough brain power to make me feel like I wasn't killing brain cells. The plot twists kept me guessing, the historical context kept me interested, and I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, vivid detail transports you to foreign worlds.","review":"I enjoyed the book. The ending was a little dissappointing but the roller coaster ride itself was very enjoyable. The vivid descriptions of the landscape and details about the characters and their customs really transport you to another time and place. It was easy to get lost in the story which made the rather long book a rather short read. I finished the book in about 3 days by taking it with me on a trip that involved several flights where I had nothing else to distract me from reading. It is kind of like a Da Vinci Code sort of novel where the main character(s) are mostly female. If you like adventure and are vaguely interested in a trip through Europe / Middle East / Africa in the past and nearly present, its a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Being number 366 to review Katherine Neville's THE EIGHT there isn't much left to say. I missed the original edition and bought it as a companion to the sequel THE FIRE.The mystery/adventure requires constant attention to all of the chess moves and illustrations of the figure eight though out history and various cultures.One of the best mysteries I've read in a long time and I knew nothing about chess. Now I'll tackle THE FIRE.Nash Black, HAINTS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eight","review":"Fantastic! Can't put it down, up till 2 a.m., adventure, thriller, who-done-it master piece. Puts The DaVince Code way back in the pack, and did it 20 years ago!! No wonder much of Europe considers it one of the top 10 books of the last century.Probably best to read on vacation ... because not only will you not want to go to work until you've finished, you won't want to cook or sleep.Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another book","review":"The really good thing about this book is the end, the rest of the book it really doesn't have any sense, but to understand the end you have to read the book, don't waist your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Dazzler, if a Bit Fantasy Inspired!","review":"Where are the legendary chess pieces, the ones that may open the door for the always hidden holy grail!? Are a group of French nuns right before the 1789 Revolution on the road to this amazing clue that may answer the questions of history and philosophy, perhaps Christianity itself?! You won't know till you read this lengthy, fun, connect the dots fantasy that weaves the lives of a present day computer whiz kid (much like author we may presume) and the mysterious exploits of nuns and many others (including historical personages like the painter JL David, among many others). So relax by the fireside and dig into this minor masterpiece for a trip thru some strange and wild journeys through time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well researched and--well, boring","review":"The subject of this book has always fascinated me. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tom Robbin's \\"Still Life with Woodpecker, Eco's \\"Foucaults Pendulum\\", Neal Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\", Robert Anton Wilson's books, and even \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" which all deal at various levels with hidden global conspiracies that are \\"really\\" behind history as we know it, and so it was with great anticipation that I picked up \\"The Eight\\". I loved the epic scale of the story, I loved all the historical references, puzzles, mind benders, chess quotes, etc. However, the prose all seems to have one pace, lacks real tension and release, and plods along dutifully to resolution. This book should have excited me but I found myself picking up one of several books I was reading at the time instead of racing to complete \\"The Eight\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit reading this with eightly pages left","review":"I so disliked this book that I turn the book overin bookstores so that other people will notbuy it.The \\"secret\\" that is the subject of this novel isnot a secret at all. All of the characters in thenovel know about it. The book is aggravating becausethe only person that the \\"secret\\" is kept from isthe reader.Ultimately, I felt that the book did not involveme, the reader, and that I lost all interest indiscovering what everyone character in the bookalready knew.I very poor excuse for a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but....","review":"The story behind this book is extremely interesting. The mystery, the legends, the secrets just take you in. But the ending left me wanting. I would rather been left wondering then actually having this lame ending.What saves this novel is the weaving of the two times, from today to the 18th century and back. It just made it more compelling. The history is well researched. I admit that there might have been a tad too many \\"historical\\" characters added. A few would have sufficed. I could also have done without the cliches... There are far too many \\"eyes\\" descriptions (his eyes were a deep blue, her eyes were so deep, blah blah blah). Also, please, stay away from the \\"and this event would change the rest of her life\\" OR \\"little did she know the consequences of this action\\", type of sentences.I gave it 4 stars because it's an original, interesting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time...","review":"I was a little upset that this book took forever to finish and when it did it was anticlimactic. I was really upset, hoping for something to happen and then nothing did. Don't get me wrong it had its moments, but not enough of them and not often enough. I kept on reading hoping for something to happen, but nothing ever did. They spent too much time on detail and not enough on excitement. This was like a three hour movie that really should have only been a hour in a half. Two stars that's it. Would never buy this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point was.....???","review":"The only reason why I finished this book is because I held out hope (even till the last 10 pages) that the entire 600 pages would actually explain what the whole \\"Game\\" and \\"secret\\" was (because there was no POINT to the entire plot - it was almost like 5 year-olds in a sandbox seeing who could collect the most lego pieces, except this was a really really big sandbox), and would have somehow been worth my time. No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow plot, confusing writing style","review":"I wish I had better things to say about this book, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said that she wished she hadn't spent so much time reading it. The plot is predictable but basing it on chess could have been clever - except that it comes off as contrived. The writer peppers the pages with references to marginally interesting trivia, such as the name of top-end sherry or the makings of a dinner full of Jewish delicacies, but ultimately the storyline depends too much on historical \\"shockers\\", many of which have been used in other, better-known books and movies. I still would have plowed through except for the writer's tendency to write in a way that, I imagine, makes sense to the author but to few readers. For example, I theoretically understand what she means when she writes of one character not to be \\"confused by reason or logic\\", but this isn't the kind of book where I want to spend time puzzling over why that phrase is included!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst","review":"I've never actually audibly groaned while reading before. This is the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I gave it a good 350 pages worth of effort, but it proved impossible. The prose is horrible and the plot is beyond absurd. The entire premise is based on the worst combination of historical fiction and inane mysticism. Someone with religious brain washing might find this interesting, because the idea that there are magical forces that control human destiny is in keeping with their general world view. If you think you might be amused by Napoleon talking about a magical chess set which can destroy civilization, well then, enjoy! Atheists, brights, rationalists or anyone prone to common sense, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, fun read...","review":"I have a question...why do the previous reviews from \\"A reader\\" and \\"Robert Beveridge\\" criticize the book for a) not being similar to Umberto Eco and b) not having the sophistication of prose to be considered a good book? All I can say to these two is \\"Hey, if you two are such an expert on what makes a great book, why is Katherine Neville the one with a published novel that has sold millions of copies?\\"...And why does everyone think that liking an Umberto Eco book makes them a sophisticated reader? I bet half these people havent even read, or at least made it past page 30 of an Eco book...Anyway, about THE EIGHT. A great, exciting read, full of characters that you end up really caring about. The two plots that are intertwined, one in the past and one in the present, are both interesting enough that I never minded when the timeline shifted. Not the greatest book ever written, but definitely worth the read if you like adventure"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"it was hard for me to put this book down. a mixture of mysticism, suspense, and intiguing history. This story requires the ability to follow a complex plot and to not expect non stop action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Eight!","review":"I have read this book several times and still love it! I wish I had my original copy, so I purchased a new copy today so I can read it once again. I look forward to reading the sequel, The Fire. Frankly, I read one of the reviews that said they didn't understand the book. I don't think it's that complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eight","review":"The Eight by Katherine Neville is a fabulous piece of entertainment so long as its readers understand that's what it is - entertainment. For a novel which jumps between two very distant time periods the author manages not to drop any of the balls she's juggling (interesting plot, historical accuracy, interesting characters who form complex relationships). Also great by this author is A Calculated Risk, avoid The Magic Circle at all costs, it is by far the weakest of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome-grabs you from the beginning holds on till the end","review":"This book has everything you could want in a book. History, romance, adventure...it's all there! I've read and read this book over and over and I get more out of it each time! A GREAT read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm FINALLY finished...","review":"It has taken me almost a year and a half to finally complete this frustrating and disappointing literary journey.Why did I even bother you ask? Because from the first moments of this story, the reader is dragged-in by the idea of this mysterious secret formula that is so over-hyped, you feel guilty for not finding out what it is. I should have taken some advice from Harry Burns in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and read the last page first.And by the way, Ms. Neville...we're all so very impressed with your historical name-dropping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"This book was a pain to finish. It could have been a really good book though, given the historical setting. I don't really like jumping between timelines because it just breaks the momentum of the novel. But hey, I've seen some book that do that really well! The prose is cliche and amateurish. The plot was weak and tiring. The only reason I started on this book was because it had a fictional encounter of the murder of Marat, which is in one of David's painting which I love. And perhaps that's the biggest draw of this book--all those famous names scattered around. Too much fluff, too little substance unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely worth passing on.......","review":"Okay, I am still reading this book (on page 386) but I am like some of the other readers in that I refuse to not finish a book once started, however poorly written. And yes, this is poorly written.Clich��d in many spots (every attempt at character development), awkward, boring, verbose, and you get the point. The only positive thing I have encountered, relative to the book, is that there are many other readers that share my sentiment.\\"The Eight\\" has been translated into fifteen languages. I have no idea why."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 is a 10","review":"Katherine Neville has a unique style juxtaposing two different eras into one book.the stroy deal with a mystical chess set and fanctions trying to posses it's secreats.The main characters of both eras are quite interestng and fleshed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly easy to put down.","review":"This book does not live up to the hype. The excessive name dropping of historical figures gets old quickly. The author tries so hard to keep everything mysterious that the characters are one-dimensional and the solution, when it comes, doesn't seem worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"I suspect that most of the 5 star reviews for this book come from readers of Harlequin romances who think that \\"The Eight\\" is great literature. After reading the first few chapters, I knew that the writing was horrible, but I continued reading with the hope that the plot would become interesting. Unfortunately, it only became absurd. For example, the characters meet many historical figures, from Napoleon to Benedict Arnold to Catherine the Great, who all know something about the \\"secret\\" of the Montglane Chess Service. And every historical figure has a \\"tale\\" involving other historical figures, who know \\"formulas\\", \\"solutions\\", and \\"secrets\\" that nobody else has been able to find. After a few hundred pages, this gets to be very boring and repetitious. The few \\"action scenes don't provide any excitement, since there is never any doubt that the heroine will escape. Please, unless you're a Harlequin reader, don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unrewarding Slog","review":"The good: excellent story.The bad: poorly written. The clunky Thesaurus-driven prose can be tolerated, but not the wooden and puddle-shallow characters, the dreadful dialog and the absence of a driving and interesting narrative. And it's lonnnnnnng. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 8 stars if I could....","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It sat on my bookshelf as part of a collection from a yard sale, but I didn't pick it up for years. Once I did, however, I found it hard to put down. What everyone else says about this book is true; the stories are engaging, the details are amazing! I finally had to purchase a new copy because both covers came off from wear, the back page ink was starting to wear off, and page 247/48 fell out! I will have to get another someday, because I've already read the new one twice. The story just never gets old! Read and enjoy--highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those books that's stayed with me","review":"I read this book shortly after it came out 14 years ago, and it's stuck with me all these years. I won't say its the greatest book I've ever read - there were definately some slow points and characters that seemed to be a bit TOO odd or maybe even unnecessary - but it is definately a VERY GOOD book, one I would recommend to anyone looking for some nice escapist fiction that can get you thinking in unusual ways. It offers some very nice twists and turns and was quite and enjoyable ride. It's not every book I remember 14 years after first reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"I'm a big fan of chess and mysteries, but this book was so dull I stopped reading it. Now, it will join the quagmire of books I have in a trashbag that will hopefully end up in a library or used book store. The cover looks cool though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was recommended to me by three different people and so I looked forward to reading this book. After a few chapters in, I realized that the style of writing was overdone, the plot was \\"trying too hard\\" and the way the author tried to fit in as many historical characters as possible was undeniably ridiculous. This book would have a lot more interesting had it had a couple hundred pages edited from it's story line. I just wanted the story to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaving a thread through history...with a hammer!","review":"What starts as moderately interesting just begins in a downward spiral as the author insists on making the plot more ludicrous with everyone page. While the concept of weaving a story around seamingly separate true historical characters is a nice concept, Neville really takes it too far and makes it into a global conspiracy extending back thousands of years. Ridiculous does not even begin to describe this book. Bored does not even begin to describe the experience of reading it. If you MUST read this book, read her subsequent book The Magic Circle first. That one is so painful that it makes The Eight seem like a gift from the gods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short","review":"This was a very boring book, recommended to me by a friend. I had absolutley zero sympathy in the characters and a similar interest in the plot, so, by page 180 I decided to call it a day. I know it was published in 1988, but today I felt all the talk of 'secret codes' to be completely infantile.If you want to have your concepts, world-view, personality, destiny or whetever else challenged in any way then do not read this.I sometimes waste time by strumming aimlessly on the guitar. If you like to pass the time by reading something, then this might be the book for you.Oh, and there's just so much bland description about insignificant things that a man can take in one day.I do appreciate how long things take to write though, so I admire her (and anyone's) ability to persevere and get it written and published. This act should be commended.(After all these years of learned criticism, it just comes down to \\"It just wasn't my taste.\\" Unbelievable!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I must entirely disagree with most reviews of this book as I found it to have one of the most incongruous plots I've ever had occasion to come across.

I might have just have received defective units so I just simply returned the items with no hassle. Besides the sensors, the device looked nice and the usage was pretty intuitive. My grandparents would have totally liked the device is the main sensor actually worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"As with some othes I got LOW battery life - 1 month ONLY!","review":"That is simply unacceptable! Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Couldn't understand it.

The best article is by far the 1997 interview-story that John Seabrook wrote.

However, the complaints on my music seemed to subside when I putt this in. Most of the time I'm occausted by the people that ride with me over my taste in practically lyric free music.

Merlo maschio, Il (1971)","review":"An outrageously silly Italian comedy. A failed musician finds purpose by exposing his wife's body in public places. He first begins by photographing her while she's asleep. The prim wife discovers the photos and leaves him. After they reconcile, she agrees to go along with his wishes. Not surprisingly, the dubbing is handled poorly for this video tape edition. The voice actors sound like slick infomercial hucksters reading from teleprompters. This must have felt dated even back in 1971. Veteran actor Lando Buzzanca plays the husband, and Laura Antonelli is the wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"British espionage melodrama","review":"Dating from 1971, The Executioner is a British espionage melodrama, in the tradition of The Ipcress File or Funeral in Berlin. The emphasis is on plot and intrigue, although there are also some powerful action sequences, culminating in a climactic gun battle. George Peppard plays a lower-level functionary who apparently discovers a Soviet agent in British intelligence, but his superiors inexplicably respond by exonerating the suspected spy. The visuals, which range from London to Athens, are impressive, and the direction is outstanding. The supporting cast includes Joan Collins and Judy Geeson, both of whom handle their roles well. There are even some surrealist touches, such as the play of lights when the action moves backward and forward in time. This film was underrated at the time of its release, and deserves more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Spy Thriller!!","review":"George Peppard and Joan Collins star in this pleasant spy thriller set largely in London.It's a must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasm II is the best horror movie ever made.","review":"Phantasm 2 is my favorite horror movie of all time. I have seen it 20+ times and it continues to be entertaining and scary. My favorite thing about it is the creepy settings of cemetaries and funeral homes. The Tall Man is truly one the best horror characters over to be thought up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"After what seemed like an eternity, Phantasm II finally makes its way to Region 1 DVD, a couple years after Anchor Bay re-released I, III, and IV. The second installment picks up where the first left off, with Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (James LeGros, replacing A. Michael Baldwin) on the trail of the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), who is turning everything he touches into a graveyard. With a bigger budget and studio backing this time around, writer/producer/director Don Coscarelli managed to accomplish a lot in Phantasm II, and it really doesn't disappoint in any real regard either. Unlike many however, Phantasm II isn't my favorite of the series, as I and IV still stand to me as being pieces of brilliant, cerebral, horror filmmaking. Still, it's great to finally have Phantasm II on DVD here in America, and now the only thing that could be better would be if Coscarelli would return to the Phantasm universe once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ball is back again","review":"ive been waiting along time for this movie to be available on dvd in the us.even though this movie didnt have any special features it was nice to get it on dvd and in widescreen format,all i had was the old vhs copy and ive almost worn it out.this is my favorite phantasm movie,its more scarrier than the first one.plus i like the characters more .i could not find this in any store but amazon had it of course and i got it at a good price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was phantastic two, I mean too","review":"PHANTASM 2, like the original, is a brilliant film for several reasons. Its chief strength, however, lay in its script. On one level, it utilizes classic horror movie elements: nightmares, grave robbers, the haunting mausoleum and cemetery, the menacing man who watches over everything, etc. But then it incorporates that with classic sci-fi elements: reanimation, the alien race conquering humans, transports into other dimensions, etc. Unlike the original, this film is tempered by a sweet but not saccharine love story and a good smattering of humor. All this, which could have been muddled by someone else is deftly directed with low budget (but very effective special effects) by Don Coscarelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel - truly chilling","review":"I don't know about most fans of the series, but I discovered the PHANTASM films with this one, part 2. I had never seen a film like it - so different from the numerous slasher HALLOWEEN ripoffs that dominated the genre. Great effects, a bizarre story, and a mood that makes you keep the lights on all night. An excellent film for \\"jump\\" scares - the kind that pop out when you least expect it. I hadn't seen this film since it's release on video until I bought it tonight. It has held up. Not as well as the original, mind you, but it is still light years ahead of 99% of the \\"horror\\" films out there.Definitely worth the money - a must for the collection of any discriminating horror fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Part One","review":"This installment may very well be the best of the series. The end is unforgettable: the quad-barrel shotgun, the chainsaw to the groin, the balls. The Tall Man has never been better. I am a huge phan of all four of theses movies, but this one stands above the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALY..... It's about time!","review":"We've waited over a decade for this to finally be available on DVD and it's finally here. The first sequal to the excellent original. Some people disregard this as a sequal because A Michael Baldwin didn't play Mike in this one, but I love it. Out of all 4 of the films, THIS is the one that has the best ending where the Tall Man pops up at the end after Mike says, \\"It's Only A Dream\\" and the Tall Man replies, \\"No, it's not!!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The continuing adventures of Reggie and Mike","review":"Phantasm 2 is loads of fun, and Coscarelli keeps very faithful to the \\"Phantasm\\" world he created. James Le Gros does a credible job of playing a more buffed up Mike. And Reggie is everyone's favorite ice cream dude with the 4 barreled shotgun...watch for the cool chainsaw war he has with one of the Tall Man's henchmen. The Tall Man, played by the legendary Angus Scrimm is at his sinister best, and one imagines Mother Angelica from the Catholic Channel fainting as he tells a hapless priest,\\"You think when you die you go to Heaven....?...You come to US!!!!\\"One of the coolest and best lines in all the 4 films. Mike and Reggie do their best to score hot chicks in this one, but the Tall Man ruins everything as usual. The death of the Tall Man is one of the coolest horror scenes you'll ever see, very imaginative and gory. But death is not the end...Because its not a dream...No, its NOT!...Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a B-rated flick","review":"Drags out painfully. Really lousy acting. The dialogue was dull with no intonation --- All the actors were extremely monotone - particularly the narration and actress with the 'dreams'... watched it for 20 minutes and finally quit. It obviously wasn't going to get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Horror Movies I've Ever Seen","review":"Phantasm II is an awesome horror film. It picks right up from the last one and delivers all the great scares of the first but with far more advanced F/X. The settings are awesome too, it has a very dark atmosphere. The sequel has Reggie and Mike looking for the Tall Man. Along with these characters, another great one is added to the series - Liz, whose been linked with both Mike and the Tall Man ever since the events of the first film. This movie is a must see with a shocking ending that I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming in 2013 from Scream Factory","review":"Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that Scream Factory (the horror branch of Shout!

However, there is nothing to appreciate about Phantasm 2. It's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is discombobulated; the acting is mediocre; the dialogue is too weird; there isn't suspense or intrigue; and it was very boring and vapid. The special effects were good but they aren't anything different from the Nightmare on Elm Street series. In fact the director of Phantasm 2 seems to have borrowed too much from Nightmare on Elm Street. Do not waste your time watching this trite trash. This is not a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money, time and space","review":"This movie has to be one of the worst movies ever created. It brings a new meaning to the phrase senseless violence. It simply doesn't make sense. Apparently a fat man (I'm sorry, tall man) runs around with silver flying balls drilling into peoples' heads. The hero is an overweight and balding ice cream vendor and his goofy side kick. This is not a horror movie. It was either a bet among studio executives to see if a sequel could be made or the director had a very, very bad acid trip. Words fail me in describing how bad this movie was. Let me put it this way: it makes Waterworld look like a movie of great depth with subtle nuances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy and never again","review":"I was very disappointed in the dvd that I purchased.

So I am out my money and will never purchase a item from Amazon again. Which is sad due to this was my first online experience and will never try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantasm Poo","review":"Sometimes a bad movie can be fun, but not in this case.If you're in the mood to watch a half-naked, tall man engaging in every heterosexual man's latent horror fantasies of drilling silver flying balls into peoples' heads, and you feel like laughing at bad dialogue, and sniggering at the many holes and inconsistencies in the plot, and you have an hour and a half to lie about lazily, you can have an awful time with a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclipse Song #2","review":"Great dance tune...and the new Mitsubishi Eclipse commercial does it justice.

Very few examples, skimming over content, and no answers! WHAT GOOD IS THIS BOOK IF YOU ONLY USE IT TO GET YOUR HOMEWORK PROBLEMS FROM THE CLASS?! I've learned more from searching wikipedia on the subject than reading this book. Maybe schools should choose books based on their content and their help to students rather than some sort of corporate money game with the book companies.

It does have many problems, but without the answers. Only teh few quizzes in the text have answers, besides the explanatory examples.

At least one item appears to be taken from a download, with 'block' pixellation and very variable contrast. The (jerky) text commentaries re Chaplin before some of the films is gushing, poorly executed and not a little irritating, particularly considering that these are collector's items not likely to need this sort of interruption. There is no information with the disc except titles, and some of these are at odds with those displayed on the films - one 'Star Border', is an obvious misspelling. For my money this disc seems unremarkable value, and I would be cautious about buying others in the 'The Actors' series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince of Rai","review":"I had listened this before and wanted to purchase it so I found it on Amazon.com and had no problem getting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun TOY","review":"This is a fun product thogh it is NOt a full wig.

I attempted to return it and Just Brands was the worst company I've ever had to deal with. They were impossible to get a hold of in order to get an authorization number to return the watch. Then once I returned it they denied receiving it even though I had a delivery confirmation from the post office. Luckily Amazon refunded my money.

It really turned out pretty mediocre though. There was some scratching at the beginning, but that was about it. I guess I was expecting him to pull more tricks out of the bag. What you have left is a run of the mill d&b mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revised review; I stand corrected","review":"Earlier, I complained that the book had errors, based on my attempt to knit the Embossed Twining Leaves pattern on page 121. I had found the publisher's web site and its errata page, which didn't have a correction for that pattern. Moreover, a note on the page said you might have to wait some time for their response to their inquiry -- discouraging! They surprised me, however, with a quick response suggesting what might be the cause of my difficulty. They were right. No error in the pattern, but you have to pay close attention to directions, including glossary definitions. Charts might be helpful, but this pattern (and presumably others) would be difficult to chart. Most of the photo swatches are beautiful, though those in the lace stitch section done in red yarn make it difficult to see the pattern. Overall, it is a beautiful book and inspiring. I've changed my rating, based on my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book","review":"This book is not for the novice knitter, but is an excellent reference book for the more experienced knitter. There are many versatile edgings and provides hours of reading and looking through a very well organized book for your library. I have taken it out many times just to read and have already tried some of the unique edgings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite knitting books!","review":"As an intermediate knitter new to (but obsessed with!) lace, I've found this book to be unique and excellent. I started trying to knit lace with a couple of patterns I found online, but was practically in tears over those. I had decided I simply couldn't knit lace at all until I found this book. I began with a nine-line lace pattern and can't wait until I get good enough to try some of the thirty-line ones! I know this book will challenge and inspire me for some time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they do corrections for the paperback edition?","review":"I cannot tell from anything online, but a word of warning over here on the paperback edition: the instructions have many mistakes in them. And it's tricky to find the errata/corrections online (vogue knitting has some).Lucky for me, I am happy with a diagonal slanting ruffle vs the vertical royal leaf I thought I was making. I've been knitting for over twenty years, I can follow instructions.She has great ideas. Just please folks, make a swatch first before you invest much time in these.

I have saved so many pamphlets and photo-copied a ton of patterns for sweaters, afghans, etc. that I would never make just to have patterns for the details. This book has helped me declutter! I can't believe that she has all of this in one book. Thank you, thank you, thank you! The patterns from \\"Knitting on the Edge\\" that I have used have all worked out. I have also easily been able to vary the patterns to work into the piece I was working on. She's made it very simple. And having worked some of the edges in - they really have made the pieces 100% richer looking. (Borrowed it from our library and had to buy my own copy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"knitting on the edge","review":"The author wanted to make a single source that collected all her edgings and the book is simply a collection of 350 patterns on edges. The chapters are; ribs, ruffles, lace, fringes, flora, and points and picots. There are some finished designs in the book that I don't believe that anyone would knit, they are simply not fitted, but she definitely fulfils her edge-aim. At first I was pretty bored when looking in the book. Then I realized that I was thinking about several different knits I would like to do, being inspired by the edgings in the book... Therefore, I believe this is is a book for anyone who likes to make own designs and who wants new inspiration to make edges that adds something to the knits. I haven't looked into her other two books on edgings, so I don't know if or how they add to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"covering the collection of three books","review":"Amazon Verified Purchase.For anyone who enjoys pushing the boundaries with their knitting projects these 3 books by Nicky Epstein are an absolute joy and a must have,with such great ideas.

However, this book is my project.It is already been pointed out that there are numerous errors and how to correct numerous errors. Yet part of the fun is finding them myself. I have the time and material and find this book quite intriguing. I have bought many other books just for the subject as pieces of the book and here I have the complete book. This is also useful for people that are really professional or deep into her avocation.I think you will have hours of pure fun. Do not let me catch you watching TV and doing mindless knitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicky Epstein is a knitting Goddess","review":"As usual Nicky outdoes herself and writes another extremely helpful, easy to understand and thoroughly needed book!

The book is filled with mistakes and typos! I tried to contact the publisher, but there is no listing in New York for Sixth & Spring Publishing. I finally found a phone number in a knitting magazine. They were not very pleasant, but did tell me to contact \\"webmaster@sohopublishing.com\\" to get the corrections. The book does have a disclaimer about mistakes, but they should have tried knitting from their own instructions before publishing this expensive book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It does have mistakes","review":"I agree with other reviewers who pointed out the mistakes on the instructions. I bought the book recently and tried to chart the butterfly pattern on page 139 with no success, even and odd rows have a different number of stitches (and no, there are no increases or decreases involved).So, good for inspiration, but you are better equipped with Barbara Walker's \\"treasuries\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the corrections????","review":"There are many mistakes in this book...and it is poorly written.

Though, so far, I have found it quite fun. The levels are designed quite well, and the AI has caught me off guard a couple of times. The rookie level isn't to easy, like most games, but I haven't tried the harder difficulties yet.There are a few timed missions that you have to rush through, but they are optional. The upside to doing these is that you unlock new weapons/upgrades and such.The controls are easy to remember, and well laid out.The graphics are nice, I wouldn't compare them to BLACK, but it has more... Depth? To it.The riot shiled is a great part to the game, it helps a LOT.If your looking for a good game to spend some of your spare time on, I would definately recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Behavioral made bearable","review":"Not a big fan of behavioral science, but this book makes it bearable by focusing on what you'll be tested on and helping you distinguish similar conditions from each other.

It is very sturdy and fits the grill perfectly. It has pockets for storing the hoses, regulator, etc, so the entire grill and connections stay clean and organized. It is very sturdy and dust wipes off easily.

And my husband is happy with it.In the future if this bag doesn't hold up, I think I will find a plastic storage box that would fit it for stowing in the belly of our RV.Review update 8 months later - So far so good.

The packaging does not actually use the word waterproof. Packaging says \\"blocks water\\", and \\"water-hating\\". When I place the socks in running water, water penetrates the seams easily as they are not sealed. The packaging claims to seal in heat, but I haven't tried it while wearing, so I'm not sure if it's a valid claim.It seems to be water repellent and pretty good if not in standing water, but I would think if your shoes are wet, the water will eventually wick into the socks.Also, Medium is too small for me as I wear size 9US shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterproof for a day.","review":"I do not know what happened. When I got those socks, they were very good and seemed ro repell all the water out, preventing anything form going in. I do not know what happened, but it has been two weeks and the socks are no longer water proof! I only wore it once prior to this...I put them on today and water was going in like it was cotton. The only possible explanation I have is that I must have streched when putting it on (they fit in very tight if the sizing guide is correct) causing the pores to open--but still!!!I haven't washed them or anything like that. I plan on calling seirus but I doubt customer service will have any answer. With that said, buy it at your own risk. They would definitely be worth it if they remained functional. In my case, $30 was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stormschmuck","review":"I use these on cold, windy, wet days when riding a bike in Western Siberia. I put it over a wool sock. I got the XL and it's a good size and easy to get off or on but looks like it might tear eventually.Not sure how long they will last, but at the price, I hope for 12 years at least. Stiching wear/tear might be an issue. Waterproof is an issue for me since I need protection from the cold, wet, wind.Update: Worthless product, does nothing for either the wind, wet or cold. Used with 2 wool socks, still had freezing feet. Buying this was like using my cash to light a cigar with. Very unhappy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I ordered these socks thinking they would be waterproof.

I used these for 1, 12+ hour work day that just so happened to be a rainy one. These supposed wasterproof socks did not hold up within 5 minutes of down pour. My feet were soaked the entire day and man was it miserable! The seams are just a single stich so I'm not sure how Serius expected these to last. Don't waste your money!

Funny thing is, with all those copies out there, I don't know any one who has it (or will admit they do).There is a somewhat comedic plot to this film (albeit a very thin plot) that sets it apart from the typical x-rated film. Most x-rated films have only one purpose, and plot ain't it. If that's what you're into, this film isn't very good cinematically in that regard. What strikes me is that something so poorly made and so cheap to produce can outsell a multi-million dollar blockbuster Hollywood production.If you buy it, share it with friends and a beer for a solid hour of laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Throat Sucks for Real","review":"This copy of Deep Throat is not like the original.

Having never really listened to reggae before, it was somewhere in the middle of the first Yellowman song I heard that I realized I had a new love in my life. King Yellow's infectious rhythms and intelligent (and often very funny) lyrics had me hooked from the start. This is a great CD to introduce anybody to this great artist, including hit songs such as Mr. Chin, Two To Six Supermix, and Natty Sat Upon A Rock, which often find their way into his live repertoire.

This album offers nothing of value and will be forgotten quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album yet since Van Halen departure","review":"When I first heard this album, I thought it was right on target with what Sammy can write. I think with the edition of the guitarist, he has added a rough edge as well as a modern sound. I also like that Sammy has incorporated the backing vocals \\"ala Van Halen\\" in song like \\"Tropic of Capricorn\\" and \\"Serious JuJu\\". It just shows that Sammy is a great song writer. \\"Tropic of Capricorn\\" is a \\"happy song\\". \\"Shaka Doobie (The Limit)\\" is a great rock song as well as \\"Serious JuJu\\". Really all the songs are great, but I have my favorites. \\"The Message\\" has the same vibe of \\"Right Now\\" from Van Halen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CD","review":"THIS IS SAMMY BEST POST VAN HALEN CD.THIS CD ROCKS BETTER THAN ANY THING HE HAS DONE SINCE BALANCE.I LOVE THE SONG LET SALLY DRIVE WHERE SAMMY JUST STARTS SCREAMING.I WISH HE WOULD DO MORE SONGS LIKE THIS.BUT THERE ARE OTHER GOOD SONGS ON THIS TO,WITH SHAKA DOOBIE ,ANOTHER ROCKER AND THE MELLOW BUT GOOD SONG LITTLE BIT MORE.I LOVE THE SONG TROPIC OF CAPRICORN,WHICH WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR SITTING ON THE BEACH DRINKIN A BEER OR MARGARITA IN SAMMY\`S CASE.ONLY REASON I DIDN\`T GIVE THIS A 5 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SILLY SONGS SERIOUS JU JU & THE TITLE CUT.MUST HAVE FOR ANY SAMMY FAN.I HAVE SEEN HIM TWICE IN CONCERT AND HOPE TO SEE HIM AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rounded album! Way to go Sammy!","review":"This has to be one of the best Sammy Hagar albums in a long time. The first two tracks are vintage Hagar, reflective of his V.O.A. days. After those two the album begins to get a little more serious as heard in his Marching To Mars album with little bits of partying ala Red Voodoo. Sammy shows his range on this album and it's wonderful! Ten 13 is a necessary addition to any Hagar collection, and one not to be missed by any serious rocker. 2000 has been quite a year with Iron Maiden's Brave New World, Rob Halford's Ressurection, and now Sammy Hagar's Ten 13. Buy it, you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy does it again","review":"I live in Australia and am an avid fan of SH (he actually toured here about 7 years ago). However, over the last few years, I've noticed a lack of product at our record stores. Having tracked down his website I discovered this album which was never released here. It's interesting to get an album that is actually \\"between\\" others I've heard - it allows you to judge it on its own merits as opposed to comparing it to the last offering.I reckon this is one of his best, good punchy riffs and his voice is at full stretch - much more consistent than, say, Marching to Mars or Red Voodoo (sorry couldn't help myself).It rarely let's up and as such is a perfect driving companion.Can't wait for any new stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and concise but in need of a major update","review":"Although it's a very good \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of African-American history, it is still twelve years old; thus, it is in major need of a revision, considering all the monumental changes that have occured in America, let alone the world, since the book's original publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture, Leadership and organizations: The Globe Study of 62 societies","review":"Though this book is rather expensive, it is worth the price.

I also like various types of Jazz, and so thought this compilation would be a great idea.This CD is, however, an appalling waste of money. The music tracks are mismatched; the tracks do not flow into each other smoothly; the portions of dialog are not the cleverest (or best) and do not make me laugh at all. It is a poor mish-mash of badly matched content.If you do like Frasier I suggest you save your money and buy this instead:http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1557044031/qid=1130513951/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-7816557-2011659If you like Jazz, do yourself a favour and buy this:http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000024F6G/qid=1130514104/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-7816557-2011659Total of about 12, or the same as the price of Tossed-Egg CD thingy in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous and fragmented","review":"The gist of this story is that the \\"good\\" sorcerer defeats the \\"bad sorcerer\\".

BUT but but: where on earth did the producers of this DVD get their print? The thing looks picked up straight out of a badly pirated TV screen, complete with fuzz and shaky images, and as for the the \\"English subtitles\\" (that cannot be turned off, by the way), they are hideously laughable (when they are present at all: sometime, entire bits of dialogue are left untranslated, and sometime the translation comes in... ohmigod: Spanish!).

This is a major problem with many groups purporting to be from the 50's and 60's. The Duprees appearing today is a perfect example of caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who don't read Latin! For those of us who were Duprees fans, this is a not to be missed CD of the original Duprees with the incomparable sound of Joey Vann and harmony that is hard to match.

My review was pretty strident, to say the least. I have had some thirty years in which to cool off. But although I won't repeat my objections from the original review, I still have something to say.

The rods are holding near maximum weight and they have stayed in place for several weeks now. The two that are in the closet are extended to their longest length. The only complaint is that at this extension the clothes tend to move to the middle of the rod and make it bow a bit.The third rod I used in my laundry room to hang wet clothes. It's not extended very far and there is no movement of clothes or bowing at all.Overall I have been using these for several weeks and they are holding up nicely. None have fallen down.

I am not really a \\"watch\\" person so I was looking for something light and not too bulky and this is perfect. Even going from not wearing a watch, you can barely notice that you have it on. The styling is also great, a very classic/classy look. It is definitely a bit smaller than most watches you will see so I would recommend trying to get an idea of how large it is going to look on your wrist before purchasing it. The only thing that is a bit weird is that the numeral for 4 is incorrect (should be IV not IIII), but after a quick look at wikipedia apparently this is a common custom for clocks and watches.

I called Swiss Army (Victorinox) and they said that they could recalibrate the watch under warranty.

You may have to cut a piece of plastic if you want a custom window fit but I simply make up the gap of several inches with a small white rag that blends right in -- easy to move to windows of different sizes. Highly recommend this Amcor model!!! Be careful if you select other units as this is a newer technology at these price points so a brand name may not mean much.

One reviewer spoke of it's noisiness. True it is louder than my quiet fan, but since the sound is relatively consistant, I find it helpful to lull me to sleep as I work nights alot and the daily neighborhood noises (traffic, playing children, construction, and lawn mowers) have been a problem in the past.

Do a search for \\"canon e18\\" on Google and you will see complaints from thousands of people talking about an error these cameras experience that renders them useless. Essentially what happens is the retractable lens gets stuck and the camera ceases to function. I have recommended a Canon A-series to two friends and both have had this problem. The worst part is Canon refuses to acknowledge the problem and won't do anything about fixing your camera if it's out of the one-year warranty period.I am a huge Canon fan and this is a really great camera until it has the E18 problem. You are taking a gamble if you buy this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this camera as a gift. Actually this is the 2nd A520 I've bought in 3 weeks. Both of these A520s were defective - the lens cover would not open all the way on either of them, so I of course returned the original and the replacement. In general, I like Canon cameras. You get a lot of camera for the money compared to some other cameras. For this reason, I ordered a Canon A610 and so far it has worked beautifully. My husband and I both have Canons and have never had problems. After my experience, however, I would not recommend the A520. I've seen good reviews of it in several magazines, but for myself, I will not go for a third try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design yet poor production quality","review":"This is my fourth digital camera. I am happy with the right amount of features packed in a small package. The quality of the pictures turned out to be reasonable for this type of camera.The real disappointment was the quality of assembly. There are five white flakes visible by bare eyes between the clear protection cover and the LCD screen. The largest one was more then 0.5mm. It is annoying to look at the pixels blocked by these flakes when taking pictures.<added 2/22>I took apart the back cover of the camera and cleaned up the annoying flakes on the display.I've taken 500 pictures with this camera in 10 days.+ the 4x zoom gives a wider angle to take group photos in a smaller room+ the high sensitivity allowed me to take most of the indoor pictures without the need for flash+ the use of AA battery makes it easy to carry spares- the zoom control moves too fast- the rubber strip that covers the connectors does not snap in place securely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Compact Camera","review":"This is the second canon digital camera I have owned in the last 3 years and think they are great. This is a small, light weight, compact camera with all the gadgets to take great pics.

But those people either don't know how to work a digital or they're just plain stupid. I got this last year and it's still in great working order. I've gotten nothing but crisp, clear pictures everytime. Of course, unless I'm trying to take a picture from really far away, but that's expected. The only thing that could improve is the sound. I like to take videos of bands I see in concert, and the sound can be pretty crappy at times. The camera has many awesome settings you can take pictures in, like sepia, But other than that, the Powershot is an amazing camera, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a quality camera and doesn't want to spend over $200. This camera is a BIG step up from my last digital which was a Vivatar, which was a piece of crap. Canon overall is a very good brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mistake","review":"This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water. I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it. I would manually open up the lens cover each time. Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that. But now the camera is almost completely dead. It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.My camera was under warranty so I sent it in and Canon claimed that I did not send a reciept or address with the camera. It took several months but finally Cannon repaired my camers and sent it back to me camera came back with the reciept and paper work that they said I did not send???!

Totally delivers! I have found it just like the other reviews describe it - very intuitive manual controls, great picture quality, light weight - great value for money. With 4MP, prints come out really great. Video mode is decent. Yes there is a slight wait time between pictures but hey I am not one who uses multiple shots very often. Battery life is not too bad either. I just bought a Sony 15 minute charger so hopefully won't have to worry about batteries running out now! All in all - a great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-behaved little camera","review":"This is my first digital camera, purchased for a recent trip to Europe. First off, the batteries that come with the camera will last just long enough for you to play with the little memory card, maybe two hours. You will need a bigger card, and lithium AA batteries will last much, much longer. In fact, I didn't need my back-up set of batteries during my week in Prague (and no need for an adapter and converter for rechargables, either). Perhaps I'm spoiled by my old 35mm camera, but I found the slow shutter speed annoying, especially at night with the flash. The camera would click just in time to catch some random person walking in front of me. Good thing I can preview and delete the bad photos. Once I got the hang of it, the A520 did very well (and the prints impressed my co-workers) and I look forward to learning how to best use the extra features."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Customers are always right","review":"I bought a Logitech digital camera before for 50 bucks from Amazon, and the pictures were horrible. You couldn't see a damn thing if you took pics at night, or even during the day at times. So this was my first decent camera with a flash. I read a lot of reviews online and my friends recommended Canon. The reviews were awesome i just wanted to something to point and shoot. The pictures are amazing, granted 4mp isn't the most clear at times when you want to take visually striking pictures of lanscapes of many colors, but it'll work for most amatuers like myself.PROS - The lenses are retracted once the camera is shut down, so there's no possibility of it ever being affected by dirt of smuges.GREAT picture quality -- for a camera bough at Dell for 166 bucks.Software usage was EASYCONS - Batteries dont last very long.You might get addicted to taking pictures of yourself and your girlfriend :)enjoy one of the BEST brands in Digital Cameras out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this camera","review":"I have never had a camera that I hated as much as this one.

However, the camera died with an E18 error during our friend's wedding, and it has not worked since. A quick web search for \\"Canon E18\\" or even \\"E18\\" will show you that this is a common error (with a number of different Canon models). We have never dropped it or abused it in any way, and it has spent most of its life in its protective case. While the camera seemed to be great before the moment it died, I would not buy this camera again. Do not get this camera if you don't want to have to replace it in 18 months like so many other users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke as soon as the warrenty was up","review":"This camera was a good camera for the first year.

I bought two A520's for work, and BOTH cameras had malfunctioning lens covers, meaning they would not always slide fully open. If you touched the cover with the tip of your finger that would open them, but who want's to do that every time you turn on the camera?But, I called Canon Factory Service and they were great. I was on the phone for maybe five minutes total. I returned the first camera for warranty service (I waited too long to return the cameras to the seller) and the camera was back in the office 12 days later with a new lens cap and barrier plate.Five stars for Canon Service and the A520, but only 4 for the record because of the inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"If you ever need to take indoor shots in succession, DO NOT buy this camera. I loved my last Canon and went with this one which was newer, but in the same series. The recharge time for the flash is terrible between 7 & 15 seconds and really makes a difference when you're trying to capture the perfect shot. The reason seems to be that this model only uses 2 batteries. The A620 is entirely worth the extra $100 since it has 4 batteries and the fold out screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential....","review":"This book was interesting, not entirely a bad read, but unfortunately, it does not even approach its potential. Rather than getting a pleasant account of Mr Masson's transition to New Zealand and a description of why he so loves his adopted land, we are given a hardcover copy of the man's political manifesto - everything from race relations to spanking to materialism - with some tidbits of New Zealand life laced between. Really, I could be spared. And, indeed - it is most ironic that while Masson repeatedly praises the Kiwis' egalitarianism, he himself comes off as something of an arrogant, self-righteous name-dropper."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Zealand must be better than this.","review":"I'm in full agreement with Victoria Dew, who's review precedes my own. I was intrigued by the premise of the book but my interest quickly turned to disappointment. Although there are some interesting facts about New Zealand, they are overshadowed by Mr. Masson's thinly veiled sense of self import. Ironic, given the often-sited intolerance New Zealander's have for the tallest poppies (braggarts), of which Mr. Masson is a prime example, and given Mr. Masson's apparent admiration for native son Sir Edmund Hillary who stands in stark contrast as a model of humility.Contrary to Mr. Masson's supposition that his book would result in a sudden influx of immigrants to New Zealand, I found my interest in the islands diminished by Mr. Masson's work. What a bore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book isn't about New Zealand, it's about the author and his laundry list of intellectual and professional accomplishments.

Shameless."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame","review":"We've visited New Zealand and consider moving there from time to time, like when Dubya gets re-elected! :-) So I bought this book looking for a real review of New Zealand, its strengths and weaknesses. Instead I got is this sappy, sugar coated, drivel about how NZ is just oh, so perfect, and where it's not, the problem is analyzed through rose colored glasses. In actuality, if you can get past the thick coating of sugar, there is some meat - some facts and history in this book. I became too nauseated to go much past half way through. I've never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but this book is just so lame I'd like to have others spend their money on something more worthwhile, like a travel guide to NZ. You'd get better information that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I thought this would be a \\"Year in Provence\\" kind of cultural celebration of living in New Zealand and it was a political lecture.

If I wanted political views, I wouldn't buy a book about Americans living in another country. Don't bother to buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"Slipping into Paradise is an enthusiastic account of life in New Zealand by a newcomer who has fallen in love with the country. I grew up in New Zealand and spend a lot of time there, and Jeffrey Masson's account rings true and reads well even for people who already know these fortunate islands. I like the book's engagingly frank autobiographical element and its entertainingly idiosyncratic comparisons with the cultures of other countries Mr. Masson knows. He seems genuinely determined to understand what makes New Zealand tick and most of his answers, even if you don't agree with them, are both reasonable and thought-provoking. I'd recommend this book to anyone thinking of visiting New Zealand, long term or short term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I'm glad you live in New Zealand","review":"If you like self-aggrandizing and politically correct college professors who think white men are responsible for everything wrong in the world and has met Bill Clinton - then you will love this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care why you moved to NZ","review":"I found this to be a strange book, poorly edited, and without much of a focus - except, of course, the author's focus on himself. As others have pointed out, many \\"facts\\" are not verified or true. The author's privilege blurs his vision of a land that is beautiful, but very complex. It was almost as if he had a deal with NZ immigration - that if he wrote a book about NZ, he could immigrate there...and the book was pandering to that. The final \\"travel guide\\" pages were bizarre - if I had wanted to buy a travel guide, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable","review":"Good lord, this book was awful, pie-eyed blathering by a starry-eyed dreamer. As an American who's moved to New Zealand I recognize that ANY place you live is going to have problems and there's no \\"magical land\\" at the end of the rainbow as so many seem to think of down under. That said, I do love it here, but prefer to view it through realistic eyes rather than this author's high-school poetry-level fantasia. As a coda, this bloke actually moved BACK to the US not too long after buying this book, so take anything he writes with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid let-down","review":"I was greatly excited to see that the library was getting this book as I have had trouble finding New Zealand travel books in their section. I felt that the author wasn't so much as impressed and in love with New Zealand as he was with himself. You are lucky to enough to be able to read about why the various other countries he has lived in aren't up to snuff, and his long litany of various types of studies he has undertaken and his quite impressive library, and the complete lack of NZ intellectuals. He never really mentions the day to day life and interactions with Kiwis. He basically only writes about those like Sir Edmund Hillay or the foriegn prime minister or some equally important person. And all thru this he mentions his political viewpoints and I never felt like I could picture New Zealand from his writing. It was a tedious read to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lefty Looking for Utopia","review":"The book is mostly a left-wing rant against the world. He has only lived there for three years...I wonder how long before he finds injustice or dissapointment with this place, like every other place he has lived, and that list is long. I'm giving it two stars only for the nice descriptions he has of nature. The last sentence in the book alludes to the fact that he may return to America if the Democrats return to power; it was written in 2004. I guess he could have returned a couple of years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it used","review":"The book is ok. Moderately helpful in parts. However, the author spends huge amounts of space describing trees and plants in tremendous detail. That is not why I bought the book.

There would have been plenty of space to do so if he had not included page after page of boring tree discussion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disapointment","review":"The opening passage peaked my interest yet it was not far into the 2nd chapter before I realized this book is a dud. If it was assigned in a University to a class of psychology majors I could see it being useful, but not if you really want to learn about life in NZ. My family and I are hoping to move there and I approached this book wanting to see how another transplant viewed NZ. The author has psychology training and it seems he slips into psychoanalysis mode way too easy. He tells you many things about all the other countries he has lived in and not enough about NZ. I found his conversation with Sir Edmund to be just plain bizarre. Fortunately I did not buy this book but borrowed it.

It worked reasonably well with Windows XP on my HP notebook with a Belkin KVM. However, it had one annoying problem where the Shift key would appear to time out if you continued to hold it down after typing one shifted character, so that the next character would be lower case. It was as if the computer forgot that you were still holding Shift. Sometimes it would also Shift a character that was meant to be lower case, but I don't have a clear characterization of the circumstances. It also behaved similarly with the Ctrl key, which made using emacs quite painful. This is using an original Microsoft Natural PS/2 keyboard, which seems better built than anything available today.So I finally got fed up and purchased this Trendnet converter, hoping for a miracle.

For example, I remapped the keys for use on my Mac and then used shift-windows-arrowkey during text editing. Those two modifiers, when used in concert, register only about half the time; the rest of the time, only the arrow key is sent. I'm sure it's the adapter, since it happens on my Dell AT101W and the keyboard from an old HP Pavilion. The latter keyboard doesn't have this problem when using a simpler passthrough USB/PS2 adapter.

Simple and quick. Can't believe this wasn't included in the original package for the CAS label printing scale. This makes easy work of database uploading into the scale.Note: the cable and serial connector housing are cheaply made. Note the reasonable price. I almost broke the thing trying to pull off the nuts on the serial interface. This allowed me to plug the cable directly into the scale. It is more convenient to just use the serial cable included with the scale as an extension.

I wish the cables were a little longer though because I have to attach my old serial cable to it so it will reach the equipment I have to communicate with. The only other issue I have (not related to the cable), is when I use 2 at the same time Im not sure which COM port is for which cable.

The cable is actually recognized as a device in Windows. Second, you will need to go into Device Manager and change the COM port settings.

In any event, I saw this had worked for someone on a different model and thought I'd give it a shot.

It's an old serial link, which used to work on a Windows XP computer I used to have WITH a working serial port.Now most computers don't have serial ports, so I will have to buy the TI-Graph Link (Silver)Texas Instruments 94327 Ti Graphlink USBa 20+ USD value.Aside from this I don't know what else I can use this devise for.

I was disappointed that the user's manual doesn't say anything about how to program it. So I called tech support. The first person I talked to didn't even understand my question; he kept thinking it was a question about installation. He finally referred me to someone in manufacturing. When he called back, all he could say is \\"We don't document that, so we don't support it\\". I tried to explain to him that someone there knows how to answer my question since they distribute code along with the converter that does this. All he could do is recite the same thing.So if you think you might need technical support that involves something more than someone reading the manual to you, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched C/D","review":"I'm sure the music on the C/D is great, but it is hard to enjoy when the C/D is scratched and skips.Not happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Graphics,1 Star for shootout","review":"What did you think I was going to rate this game?The game play sucks!Checking,passing,shooting are all unrealistic.The only thing that holds the game together are graphics and the shootout which is very realistic how the goalie moves.The goalies are very realistic though, with saves and A.I. but once a game allow a fluke goal from the blueline.The other good thing is the stick control,very nicely done.But still what hurts the game is passing,shooting,and checking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The demo of this game had me very excited, but the actual game was a major disappointment. Not only were the controls much more awkward than I expected (they were identical to the 2k6 controls, except they didn't make as much sense), but the gameplay was COMPLETELY unrealistic. I know EA is known for arcade style games, but this was pretty ridiculous. The AI are impossible to work with...they basically just go in predetermined circle paths over and over.

After playing some shoot-out games, I finally got a basic feel for the new controls. Game play is very fun, though not much in the form of different modes. and there are one or to places on the ice where you can score practically every time. the On-line capabilities while fun, lack in variety. With those cons, lets go to the pros. The amount of control you get from your players is unparalleled, you actually \\"feel\\" like you are dekeing the goalie and players. And the AI in the game is much better than previous hockey games. No more getting three or four breakaways in a game, or scoring on most every one timer.Overall the game is definitely the future of hockey, and with a few improvements it could be the gold-standard of hockey games."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA doesn't seem to know what it is doing","review":"This game is horrible. Your team's ai is must have came to the game in the short bus because they are stupid. Whenever I skate up the ice, my own players get in my way and I end up losing the puck. And they can't defend worth anything, I can't count how many times my computer controlled defensemen were caught out of position resulting in an odd-man rush. The opponet's ai is able to pole check and read passes way too easily. The hit stck is just a joke, it's not accurate and when you miss your player is pretty much screwed because he just stands there. And what is with the players poke checking, does EA not realize that you can move and poke check at the same time? The manual shot aim is worthless, most of the time it ends up being sucked up right into the goalies glove.

Stand out cuts here are all available on Hardcastle 2 (Bird Island, Peace On Earth, and Joker's Wild). The song London Chimes echos of an ambient groove, which may be more descriptive of Hardcastle's music. When I think of jazz masters, I think of Miles Davis and others.

There is quite a bit there. Excellent graphics, very good story. The biggest knock would be the controls.

Very difficult and time consuming - if I had known this I would not have purchased the book. It's simply a waste of time.I did appreciate how he doesn't make this a technical commentary filled with quotations from all the older German authors. It's designed to be a commentary for the layman.

This is more than just a boy-and-his-dog book, more than a coming-of-age book, it's a portrait of the heart of America. Funny and heartbreaking, the story is alternately lighthearted and gritty, not shying away from the dark underbelly of family life and life in general.

Although a few details of familiar Bible stories were left out, it did, in fact, really focus on the bigger message. As you move through this book, the spiritual themes become more complex. The spiritual depth of the lessons could be greater than the spiritual capacity of very young children, but the colorful and expressive illustrations are instructive on their own. I would sum up the \\"big picture\\" as One God, one promise maker and promise keeper, One King, One Sacrifice, One Savior.

You have to have a region free dvd player to play it on though or it will not work on anything except united kingdom but it is well worth buying a region free dvd player for future movies like this. it is going for around 25.00 to 30.00 at the moment which is well worth it only if you live in the US you have to pay shipping buying from amazon.co.uk and it takes awhile longer but for the more extra features listed, I believe its worth it.

Well, anyways this is a great movie to own on video but the bad thing is it's not out to buy anymore the only Back to the Future movie that's out is only 2 and 3 but not 1.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd embodies the off-screen brilliance of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg in this cinematic treat, and is a prime example of two actors feeding off of each other's draw and thrusting their film into a classic rank among others of its kind. Full of friendly, funny quotables--one of which Ronald Reagan used in his State of the Union Address--Back to the Future acquired a mass of followers, celebrities and civilians together, and spawned two sequels that closed out the trilogy's better-than-modest success.

Solves several issues for me including using compact fluorescent lamps, dealing with power interruptions, and adjusting for changing sunrise/sunset. Also, despite what others have said, this item was very easy to program. How hard can it be to enter a few numbers?

I liked so much I bought two more. This appears to be a very good switch that accurately tracks sunrise and sunset. And yes, the battery backup does seem to work well to keep the program if power is lost.It also operates well with compact florescent lights. Most photocells will not do this. I do wish the color was more white like Cooper Electical plates, etc. Instead the \\"white\\" is more of a bone color. But I highly recommend. I think it will pay for itself in four months. I always forget to cut off the outside lights.One comment is that the longitude must have a negative sign to get the correct sunrise or sunset. If you want the lights to come on slightly before sunset you can bias the time by entering another latitude or longitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT ! ! !","review":"What a Wonderful Piece of Innovation! I don't need to keep adjusting the on/off time settings as the sunset/sunrise times change throughout the year.The only difficulty I had with this timer was --> I couldn't get it to switch into Automatic mode, it was only acting as a Manual switch. I finally found a section in the instructions that states that the unit will power up and stay in \\"Manual\\" mode until you set it to \\"Automatic\\" mode by pushing the switch in for about 3 seconds. They need to highlight this piece of information more in the instructions (it was kind of hidden).Other than that, the instructions were clear and the timer is GREAT!I'm trying to think of other places I can use more of these.I BOUGHT THIS AT AMAZON ON 9/22/09 FOR $23.95.

It arrived quickly and I had it installed in 5 minutes. The only thing I didn't like was the cheap screws that it includes. The heads are soft so make sure you have a screwdriver that fits well or you'll round off the heads.The instructions were clear and simple. They include lat/long coordinates for major cities, but I got them from Google for my town and that worked too. As soon as I entered the data, the light came on - just like it was supposed to.The switch body is fairly large so make sure you have a full depth switch box that isn't full of wires or it may not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful You Buy the Correct Model","review":"Be sure to check your wiring before you order this product.

But now, I look at my dvd collection and I see huge sets for the first 8 seaons along with the individual cases per 2 discs, and I compare them to the 9th season, and I think, c'mon!They have replaced the package for one that's half the size with horrible inserts for the discs. The summary for the episodes is written in a font size almost impossible to read.

I didn't like that or Gina's throwing up in the toilet--I don't really want to see that stuff when I'm watching 90210. Dylan's back of course right after Brandon and Val leave (not together).

Much of what is printed is just plain wrong. Badly researched and mis-represented. Even the title is wrong!! This is the African SPURRED tortoise - not SPUR-THIGHED tortoise. What a mistake..... but it reflects the bizarre content inside. As for production quality - it looks like it was photocopied as Kinko's on a bad day. What little content there is that is relevant could be squeezed onto the back of a postage stamp. The author/self-publisher has a real nerve putting stuff like this out in the first place.

Its also true that the majority of the people who would speak to Ms Coney on Sahaja Yoga were a small minority of x practicioners with a negative ax to grind, as people with a positive view could sense Ms Coney's determination to put forward a view that would please the academics.

When it started selling on Amazon I preordered it and at just around $25, it was worth the buy. All the episodes come through on blu-ray in a crystal clear picture, with excellent audio. The first few episodes may take a little time easing into, but by the third of fourth the show begins to find it's own pace. My wife who usually avoids \\"guy\\" shows has become an avid fan.

The show drastically falls short of expectations. The first episode was great and I really got pumped for the series, but concept and characters fall apart after that.

Based on the works of Elmore Lenoard, its without a doubt the best written show I've seen in 2010. Timothy Olyphant plays the lead character. A modern US Marshall dealing with the lawlessness of a rural kentucky he thought he had left behind. Raylan also has to deal with his criminal father, friends he grew up with who went criminal, ex-wives and so on. The father does an especially good job. The plots often have twist endings which are well thought out. Olyphant plays his character perfectly.The only downside for me was that the final episode was too over the top. There was too much unrealistic violence and outright nonsense. It also kind of dug a hole in terms of where they can go next season.

The stories are complex, moving and intelligently written. The characters are original and their dialog is inventive. It's a very cerebral show. I am blown away buy Walton Goggins performance as Boyd Crowder. I'm so glad his character has continued into the second season where he is living with Ava and reading \\"Of Human Bondage\\" when he's not working the 4-12 shift in a coal mine.

It lacks all the realism, wit, ingenuity, and whatever other good things you'd say about The Shield, Sons, Breaking Bad, or Mad Men. Script is bad, Timothy Olyphant's acting is mediocre, character development is completely nonexistent. The series is much more akin to Walker, Texas Ranger or that Don Johnson and Cheech Marin cop show than anything else.

But yeah, it's no Deadwood. It's no Dexter. It's no Breaking Bad. It's not teas-and-crumpet Downtown Abbey. But it's a much more accessible show and loads better than most of the crap on network TV. I thought about my dad while watching these. He would *love* Justified. Why? Because, as he would say, \\"it's about a guy who shoots people and kills people.\\" It's about as close as you can get to the world of the gunslinger and still get that Elmore Leonard modern-day weirdness.Hooked.I would just like to be able to leave a review for all of these episodes at once, but the system does not allow it.

Instead of the $17.99 HD seasons, they are now charging $34.99! This is almost double the price! Why the big price increase? The only thing I can figure is now the 4 season has started on TV, and maybe they figured people will want to catch up, so they can double the price? Don't think this is right, and also when the bandwith in the neighborhood goes up, the streaming picture quality goes way down, which is understandable at $17.99, but not if your paying double the price, better off sticking with the Standard Def."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double tap to the sternum","review":"Cross paths with Marshal Givens and you will be circling the drain beforelong.

I like it mainly due to Timothly Olyphant, who I think is a great actor, but the show is very good also, especially the opening sequence with the Miami gunfight. How original! And the event isn't forgotten about and never mentioned, as so many TV shows do, acting like everything that has come before it never happened -- it constantly comes back to affect situations, just like real life. The DVD has good extras and background on the show, which also makes it a good buy. The show probably won't get any better than this first season, since TV series tend to milk their ideas pretty quickly then run out of them, so get this and enjoy it, especially if you, like our family, can't get enough of Timothy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justified","review":"I have only one problem with this DVD set of Season One - it will not play on a Sony DVR in my bedroom.

The show feels like someone tried to cram every stereotype about Kentucky, Westerns, and lower income white people into 45 min of each episode. And while FX usually provides racy unexpected content - this show was very formulaic and predictable. I think the real downfall was that the show tries to have Timothy Olyphant's character catch new fugitives every episode. Makes for a more generic csi or law and order feel as opposed to the shield, 24, the wire etc.Even if you liked the Shield or Timothy Olyphant in Deadwood you probably won't enjoy this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB DUMB DUMB","review":"Is anyone else bothered by the inanity of this episode?

Almost everyone in town still thinks this sheriff is a good guy. So what does the sheriff do? Turn on our hero when the two are alone--so the sheriff is in little danger of getting caught?NO! The sheriff burns every bridge in his life by kidnapping the damsel in distress in order to lure our hero to a location where...where...the sheriff finally addresses his need and kills our hero, right?

Go ahead, you wont be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best show on television","review":"I have to agree with most everybody else. This is one amazingingly good show. The acting is beyond excellent. You feel like you are there, the actors ARE their characters, it is like they are not acting.If you thought Timothy Olyphant was awesome in Deadwood (and I, for one, thought he was), he is even better here. Coolest and most charismatic guy on TV. The main characters are developed so well (thanks to Elmore Leonard and the show's writers) that you feel you know where they've been and what they are capable of. Yet they still manage to often surprise the viewer with their actions, and that is hard to do.Some of the episodes are a little on the slow moving side, but they always manage to fit in some character development scenes and give us more insight, which turns out to be useful to the viewer at later dates.The cast of this show should win any and every award they are eligible for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Show!","review":"Not much else to add other than I'm looking forward to season 3 coming out on DVD!

Rick Hayes (Morrow) is not a 3-dimensional character and his motivation for trying to help Stone's character is unclear, and unconvincing. Stone is fairly believable, but her accent is not always convincing. The scene where she is briefly saved from death towards the end is very moving, but overall the film promises a lot and doesn't deliver it all. Morrow has more to give than this - we know the characters are meant to be in love, but we never see any evidence of any relationship. It's still worth checking out though, to see two strong actors trying their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Touching social drama about the topic of death penalty with Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow.

I hated it. The acting was corny and cheesy. Sean Penn's performance as a condemned prisoner facing imminent execution was vastly superior and definitely more convincing than Sharon Stone's.

Intense psychedelic beats, good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go With Them","review":"The Chemical Brothers conjure up another plate full of whipped, frenzied beats in \\"Come with Us\\", the London duo's fourth studio outing since their groundbreaking \\"Exit Planet Dust\\". Not necessarily Dance and not necessarily Rave or Electronica, \\"Come With Us\\" combines all elements of these genres to come up with some hyperkinetic action. For those of you who enjoy the club scene, this CD does not disappoint. My favorite tracks include \\"It Began in Afrika\\" and \\"Galaxy Bounce\\" -- both rock to killer grooves, earth shattering kick drums and layered sequences that melt beautifully into each other. Most of \\"Come with Us\\" is like that, but the above two stand out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!!","review":"This album is gonna be massive!!

Maybe I was spoiled to hear The White Label remix of \\"It began in Afrika\\" before the album, because the album version is a disappointment comparitively. \\"Galaxy Bounce\\" and \\"The Test\\" bring the album to a level that may make it worth the purchase, but I'm not sure $14 is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodies would have helped. A lot.","review":"I've got every Chemical Brothers release and have been a big fan for years, but this CD is my least favorite by a long shot. Bummer. Uncharacteristic of their other stuff, this disc - to me - just seems to lack anything resembling melody, and instead ventures into repetitive, techno-trance house beats that drag on and on and on. I dunno. Maybe I just don't get it. I'd recommend listening to the previews before buying, even if you're a buy-without-listening fan, like I am (or was)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"How can this album be on top of the electronica charts when it's so terrible!? Their current single \\"Star Guitar\\" is one of the only few good cuts on the whole thing. This album is not for electronica fans that love fierce instrumentation, it's for people that just like noise. This album is so \\"eclectic\\" that it becomes a chore to listen all the way through. Electronica is in a sad state when this CD is flying off the racks; and unfortunately, I am one of the poor fools that made this rubbish a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtly different album","review":"I generally listen to artists such as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, and the like., but I found that this album really was a change from Chemical Bro's usual. It seems to be a transitional period to the band, which of course leads to experimentation. If you like this album especially, you should look into early and mid career squarepusher.... one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you have any doubt? Brothers gonna work it out!","review":"Funky grooves, thundering bass beds, and a heaping helping of that Chemical ingenuity we've all come to know and love are the ingredients that have been lovingly mixed into \\"Come With Us,\\" the Chemical Brothers' latest bake. While die-hard fans may have been patiently expecting something a little more in line with their earlier releases, \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" and \\"Exit Planet Dust,\\" the brothers have apparently opted to continue in the vein of 1999's stunning \\"Surrender,\\" mixing house, trance, and big-beat grooves with a pop sensibility and musicality that is, as of yet, unrivaled in the electronica genre. Of particular note is the down-tempo track, \\"The State We're In,\\" featuring vocals by Beth Orton, and the epic dance anthem, \\"Star Guitar.\\" So if you're looking for immense soundscapes, catchy leads, and an infectious groove that finds its home on or off the dance-floor, consider your wish granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Many Intricate Moving Parts","review":"Subtle textures, multiple overlays, and driving catchy beats. Unlike the beginning of this review, \\"Come with Us\\" has both subject and verb. This album forsakes the \\"radio station\\" playability of surrender for melliflous syncopated compositions. Songs like My Elastic Eye are mature answers to the non-questions posed by the last Crystal Method album. Repeated listenings are rewarded by the intricate construction of most songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty weak...","review":"The Chemical Brothers must be in that rare group of people who like the direction Radiohead has gone recently. Better luck next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much hype, but not so good.","review":"They have been praised for their music alot, and i admit some stuff in the past have been real good but this Cd is a bore. Most songs sound the same, some nice beats on certain songs but not so much moore. This is more easy listening music then chart music or even music you can dance too. There are only 10 songs on the Cd and many are slow and dull, then you'll realize it's not worth the money... \\"My Elastic Eye\\" is a little diffrent though, it's faster and rougher. On \\"the test\\" they sing a little, actally the only song with some vocals. \\"Star Guitar is the best however, but it's like most other songs a very long one, over 6 minutes and if you've heard 30 seconds of it it's gonna be the same for the rest of the song. A waste of money as i see it, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Perhaps it's the end of an era. The orb's last album was [not good], underworld ended on a pretty mediocre note, and Norman Cook looks set to do more collaborations with that awful Macey Grey woman. Now the Chemical Brothers finally let me down. I have fallen in love with all their past albums, but this one is a big disappointment. Hopefully they're just stuck in a rut... Back to the album: Where it's dancey, it's formulaic and boring. Where it tries for psychedelia, it's noodley and kind've annoying. Overall it sounds like it was made by some skilled but uninspired Chemical Bros imitators. One star may be a little harsh, but I expected so much. Oh Arse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with Them","review":"A lot of mixed reviews on this album by The Chemical Brothers. That always seems to happen when an artist(s)'s sound and/or style changes even slightly. This is the case with \\"Come with Us\\". Unmistakeably by The Chemical Brothers, but unmistakeably a different feel than all their previous albums.I don't consider any of the ten tracks to be flops, but at the same time, only a couple are really great. \\"Star Guitar\\" and \\"The State We're In\\" are my top selections from this better than average effort by the infamous Brothers of electronica. Despite this, I'm still very satisfied that I have it in my collection.3.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"A soft, smooth journey into some good sounds.

In baby's infant carrier, when strapped on it came too close to baby's face. If you tried to attach it to the very top (as the photo on the package shows,) then it is too FAR away from baby for him to reach. Maybe it was designed too long ago with out-dated seats/carriers. We bought it of course because of the primary black, white and red stimulating colors and patterns, but you can't utilize it if it won't fit on the intended baby seat! My suggestion to the manufacturer would be an extra ridgid bracket that could be used optionally to help place the toy bar farther or closer to baby's head and face, depending on your car seat/carrier type."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for the price","review":"i bought this toy b/c 1 it was [inexpensive] 2 it was black, red, and white to stimulate my sons eyes 3 it came w/ a spinning rattle, mirror, plays music, and has toys to bat at. but when i put it on the carseat handle my son would just look at it for a few minutes... then hed bat at it and b/c its made of hard plastic hed start crying b/c he hurt himself. how i keep it just out of his reach and play the music. i recommend getting the sunny safari mini-mobile instead. i also own that and my son adores it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So long So Long Stemless","review":"I thought this glass would be of better quality than it is.

The other two broke when barely bumped against another glass. At their low price, I'm still tempted to buy more, but I cannot. It's just bad design and I don't want to reward bad design.

Then three years ago I was using one of my other Skill 77's, a relatively new saw and it happened to have a guard for the blade. I was sawing along as I have for decades and some how the blade bound up instantly, the saw flipped up in to air and hit me right in the chest with the blade still spinning. The blade guard saved my life. Since that day all my workers saws and my company's saws have guards that function properly. This is a wonderful tool, but an extremely dangerous one in the wrong hands. Buy it, use it, respect it's power and it will give good service for a life time.

If you do not know what you are doing and you want to build your own amp, this book will not be a help. If you already know how to build one and need schematics and would also like to know the history of amps and the parts, this is good book for that.

You will not be disappointed with this work of art. Khansahib,as he is lovingly called, shines enigmatically as the music unfolds.'Two Lovers' brings me to a place of innocence and tender affinity. 'Power of Joy' careens with grand elation.'India Blue' is a true blend of east and west with guests Pandit Shri Swapan Chaudhuri, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Jai uttal, and Brian Godden. Other guests include Krishna Bhatt,James L.Pomerantz, Irene Sazer,Kate Stenberg,Greg barber,Bennie Cottone,Anthony Hindson,Daniella Birschel, and Terry Pease. Produced by Jai Uttal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ali Akbar (con)-Fusion","review":"Despite my negative review, be assured that I'm huge Ali Akbar Khan fan. However, the two records he released for Triloka were, in my view, uninspired attempts to reach a cross-over new-agey audience. His father, Allaudin Khan, also taught Ravi Shankar, who had quite a bit of international success blending Indian classical music with Western music. This record and one called 'Journey' might have been similarly minded attempts to find a crossover audience, but ugh.'Garden of Dreams' suffers most when it succumbs to a tendency for saccharine melodies with an eastern 'twang', yet it is still superior to the even more dismal 'Journey'.If you want to know why Ali Akbar Khan is one of the most revered 20th century musicians look elsewhere, such as \\"Traditional Music of India\\" or his numerous releases on AMMP records, especially the \\"Signature Series\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent record of events during the reign of Henry VIII.","review":"I have read many many articles, stories, and novels about English History. I stumbled onto Margaret George the author and she is now one of my favorites! This novel gives an incredible insight into the life of the Prince who became King Henry VIII. She puts history into words that anyone can enjoy. This is a must for anyone who has even an inkling of interest in English History. I have only one complaint.......Ms. George needs to write more novels! I am running out of new reading material!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A history-lover's paradise!","review":"Margaret George gives her readers a glimpse into Henry VIII that is informed and full of fun as well. Reformation England was a time of great flux and change, and George does a fine job of describing that environment. The reader will feel as if he or she \\"knows\\" Henry. And, even if unable to agree with the sovereign, the reader will at least gain a much better understanding of why he may have acted as he did. Top notch! Full of historical and social details that will bore you if you don't enjoy such things. But if you do, then you're in for quite a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't seem quite convincing; but a good read","review":"A HUGE can't put downable NOVEL.[capitalized because I once saw this in the biography section of my local bookstore. The clerk thought it was actually by the king]. My only complaints are that Ms. George's Henry, whilst at Sir Thomas More's home, wandered about in the midnight air by himself. I found it unbelievable that the king could get away from his entourage, when in those days a page would be sleeping in his room and guards would be posted outside. Ms. George's Henry also expresses himself like a twentieth century type of guy. Her Cleopatra was much better written; but Henry is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-o-o- Good","review":"Let me just say this book is excellent, captive, and the voice of Henry VIII mesmerizing. I was delighted to see it had 900 hundred pages, and thought it would last me the summer. I finished it in a little over a month. For further historic information, just read the prior reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the size of this book scare you away...","review":"Because this is an absolutely breathtaking read! Magnificently written and a must-read for all those interested in Tudor history!This book gave me an insight not found in other books I'd read on the subject. It takes you deep inside what might have been Henry VIII's inner thoughts. Throughout this book, you'll learn to love, loath, admire, detest, and sympathize with this complex historical figure. This is a jewel of a book and I'm so very glad I found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love historical fiction and need accuracy","review":"Maragret George is the best historical fiction novelist of our time. Never have I read a book with such detail. You get all the wonderful facts without the boring college-textbook-droning. George weaves a complete story of what Henry the Eigth was like, what motivated him, and who he was as a person. I personally enjoyed, Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles much more but this is still one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"It's not very good. Ms. George does, however, succeed in portraying Henry VIII-one of the most fascinating men to ever live-as a one dimensional soap opera figure. The interludes of Will Somers are very disjointed and inappropriate. If you want an excellent read, try The Great Harry by Carolly Erickson. Don't waste your time on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, its okay, but it leaves something to be desired...","review":"It could have been better...
