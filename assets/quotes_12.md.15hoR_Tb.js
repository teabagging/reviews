They are single cut with nice sharp ridges and made from a durable tool steel. The six files provide the right shape for any situation and they come in a convenient little pouch. They will leave a nice smooth finish on whatever it is you are filing. I would recommend having a good brush for clearing away the material that inevitably will get built up between the ridges when filing. Also the tangs are good enough to be used as is for light hobby work, but for anything that requires more force, a handle is also recommended. These files are quite small so get a handle that is suited to their size since a regular handle will dwarf them in diameter and possibly make them harder to use in tight places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I couldn\`t understand how domestic files could be so inexpensive.

I bought this tie rack two years ago and it fell apart the other day. Even when it worked it, it was annoying because all the ties fell off it when I tipped it slightly while lifting it out of the closet.

The book merely presents in a linear fashion the major ideas that revolutionized our views of the physical world but goes no further than presenting the theories as matter of fact. There are no discussions into the interplay between the philosophy of ideas and the actual modeling of the physical world using the scientific method.

While Charlie Montemayor did move to Mexico this book is filled with silly stories, trivia and digressions that often became quite frustrating and tiresome to wade through. They are a compilation of letters sent to friends and relatives living back in the US and it reminds me of those shallow Christmas letters we receive summing up the writer's experiences for the year with cute little attempts at humor. Some interesting insights but very little concrete information....and a good editor should have told him to leave out the lame, liberal political humor.

It does a great job breaking down the ways that political parties and the branches of the American government function and interact. The authors make a very bold claim that America has descended into a state of \\"pseudo-\\" or \\"semi-democracy,\\" and they substantiate this claim with very pertinent and convincing evidence.

The authors took an extensive look at the shift in the approach to politics today and examined how the shift stems out of history; including references to political parties and the media.

An excellent film!","review":"Having read the reviews but never having heard of this film I expected another over-rated B-grade throwaway but was astounded to find that the five star reviews are spot-on. Excellent in every respect. The only way this film could have been better was if it had gotten all the permissions necessary to make a more faithful and accurate docu-drama. Given that the names have been changed, this film is an astounding accomplishment. The best that can be said is that my wife, who doesn't swim and who only likes sailing when the engine is running, there's no wind, and the water is perfectly flat, loved this movie, not only for the romance story but for the excitement of the sailing action as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the one great sailing movie","review":"Matthew Modine and Jennifer Grey are two very appealing actors. The scenary around Newport RI is a great setting and the boats were terrific too. I loved the International 14s. It was great to see the old Luders 12 meter American Eagle painted red again. And Cliff Robertson is a much more appealing character than Dennis Conner. This is an all around good movie, all the better for being on DVD. It has perked up more than one drab winter day for me.

The love story part of the film is silly and its adaptation to a sailing context is strained, but where the movie very seriously loses it, in my view, is in the weird depiction of \\"technical\\" aspects of sailing. For the most part, this is downright embarrassing.The funniest is when they come up with the innovative \\"whomper\\" sail. I have heard non-racers comment on the movie to the effect of \\"Why didn't the other racers think of that sail?\\" to which the answer is, of course: \\"It's against the rules.\\" But I have to thank \\"Wind\\" for coming up with my favorite nick-name for asymetrical spinnakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is about time this movie came out on DVD","review":"I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it.

Mi (played by a young Mickey Rooney)was a jockey when he was young and got into a bad accident during a race. He was scared from the situation and stayed as far away from horses as he could, until he met Velvet. (played by Elizabeth Taylor) Velvet was a young girl who was horse crazy and dreamed of owning her own horse and racing in the Grand National. Mi becomes a better person staying with the Brown family, and overcomes his fear of horses. I really want to find the sequel to this movie.

This fact shines when you consider their DVD of \\"National Velvet\\". This wonderful film features beautiful early color photography, outstanding performances from the likes of Donald Crisp, Mickey Rooney and the young Liz Taylor, a stunning score and a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's book. WB celebrates this gem, which any other studio would love to have in their archive, by releasing an overpriced, no-frills DVD which was struck from the WORST print imaginable: scratches, drop-outs, discoloration, out of focus footage etc... abound, in addition to a muted, garbled soundtrack + no special features (not even the Theatrical Trailer promised on the box!), even though the two stars are still alive!!Shame on WB. This edition is thankfully out of print. Here's hoping for a special edition with a commentary before Taylor and Rooney have passed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Technicolor Film About a Girl's Dream","review":"I love both the book of NATIONAL VELVET and this film, which makes small changes to the book, but the theme and joy remain the same. Sickly Velvet Brown wins a fractious horse in a lottery and she and ex-jockey Mi Taylor train the horse to race in England's most famous steeplechase, the Grand National, a grueling race with frightening jumps. Velvet's family--her wise mother, excitable father, lovelorn older sister, telltale other sister, and mischievous little brother are all entertaining in their own right--some of the best scenes in the movie are between Anne Revere as Mrs. Brown and Donald Crisp as Mr. Brown. All this in glorious Technicolor recreating an English village of the 1920s. A must-have. Read the book as well--there is another sister in the story, more horse incidents, and it's not \\"translated\\" for American sensibilities like Harry Potter, so you get a real feel for English life and dialect at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Oldie but a goodie and the quality is good too. if you like Old movies than this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series National Velvet","review":"I like the movie but the series was much better.

Far away his undeniable virtues related with the will and firm resolution to fight against the most challenging and hard to beat surrounding circumstances, in direct allusion to a world in War (1944) , the gradual transformation of a simple and desired hope to win the famed National Race will make both youngsters and future cinema actors (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) all the best they can to train their beloved horse.A colossal and unforgettable feat of the human spirit; an everlasting life lesson who can work out as a simple fable, but based on the fact of having resisted the acid test of time it constitutes an admirable and unforgettable life 's lesson.Absolutely recommended for the adults who still haven' t watched it, for the children in progress and for the future generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor treatment of a classic","review":"\\"National Velvet\\" is a wonderful movie, for all ages. Frankly, I'd consider it one of the best \\"sports\\" movies ever made.Sadly, Warner Brothers DVD release leaves a lot to be desired. The picture frequently goes out of focus, and the disc is bare-bones....not even the trailer [promised on the DVD jacket] is included.With Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney still around, you would have thought they'd have either interviewed them, or gotten a commentary track from them for this classic.

All of them follow the same format: an introduction to whom Edgar Cayce was, a definition of the topic and finally at the very end, a short guided meditation followed by more talking that instructs you on the benefits of using the meditation often. I'm a great fan of Cayce, but this series completely ignores the needs of the listener who in all likelihood knows who Cayce was, wouldn't be considering the CD if they didn't understand the topic and is anxious to hear the meditation they \\"thought\\" they were buying. Unfortunately the CD is 90% annoying, condescending discussion and 10% meditation. I would recommend Sylvia Browne's Tools for Life over anything in this series. She has some nice meditations on several of her audio books and unlike the narration on this CD, the talk portion is very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't hold your breath","review":"I suppose I've become jaded in my years, but I had expected \\"more\\" from this cd.

Definitely try the Grumiaux version, Oitrakh (EMI) or Heifetz (Sony). Personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound deployed by Oitrakh's violin in all his records, certainly the most impressive: this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely and he is unique. Heifetz (Sony) is different and in the fourth and fifth concerto, so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same admiration and emotion. Then you realize why Mozart was unique, and also why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively when playing his music and not monotone. Mozart violin concertos are uncomparable, and I would advise staying away from this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new groove for Christmas Music","review":"These tracks are familiar to us all, but the sound and style is unique and exciting to listen to.

For a version I almost danced to, there's \\"God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen\\", with intense drums.

These are strong, vibrant performances rich in warmth and drama, easily echoing Beethoven's own tempestuous personality. I doubt I have heard anything better from the likes of Arrau, Barenboim or Brendel. Only Kempff comes close in matching Gilels' dramatic playing. The sound quality on this old Deutsche Grammophon recording is quite good.

I did not guess the killer until well towards the end, most probably when Ms. McDermid intends the reader to. The average reader probably will not mind the langage, drugs, and general tone of the book as much as me, so I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read from a very good contemporary mystery writer.","review":"This is a top-notch book by a very good contemporary mystery writer. She creates dybamic, multi-faceted characters and is a great plotter. This is one about 4 friends who are, when students, the suspects in a sex-related murder. But the case is not resolved and the years pass. There is someone taking revenge on the murder, the police reinvestigating the case and ... . Not to be missed; a writer who mixes successfully the old and the new in the mystery genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Storyteller!","review":"THE DISTANT ECHO is one of the best stories I've read in months! It grabbed me on the first page and I kept reading it page after page. Val McDermid tells a definately compelling story with deep insight into her characters. It is filled with suspense and it gallops along. Wow! I look forward to reading all of her 5 star books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Cummins","review":"I thought Grift Sense was GREAT. I thought Funny Money was better. Now along comes Swain with another winner in Sucker Bet. Female wrestlers and alligators on the prowl; blackjack and casino cheating scams; colorful and idiosycnratic characters; a guitar strumming ape with apparent psychic abilities; and Tony Valentine, the master at figuring out the schemes and scams perpetrated on the casinos of the world. It's a great book that I couldn't put down. I hope they make movies out of them. I hope hope Swain has 10 more of them coming down the pike. I can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can' Put It Down","review":"This is one of the most well written, exciting books I have read in years. Swain really understands the people he is writing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast-paced mystery","review":"This is the second John Swain I've read and the first in this series. I like this series much better than the down and out Jack Carpenter detective series. Swain knows a great deal about casino security and it makes the book an interesting read. Of the two Swain books I've now read, both have a kid of the detective involved somehow with the villain, which seems... unlikely, at best. All in all, though, a good read. Swain has a gift for keeping you reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spinner From Swain","review":"Tony Valentine's shuffle from the glitter of Vegas (Grift Sense) and Atlantic City (Funny Money) to an Indian Sawdust Joint of South Florida, continues to pay-out big for fans of James Swain. His realistic portrayals of the personas and the scams make for an incredibly fast, enjoyable read. The only thing I hate is waiting a year between releases! Deal me another, and soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gambling expert?","review":"It bothers me that a gambling expert doesn't do numbers. I would think numbers are one of the most important aspects of the field. Here we have a guy saying that casino dice are perfect 1\\" cubes when they are really more like 19mm (.75\\"), and that if one of the sides is shaved by even \\"fifteen hundredths of an inch\\", it won't roll fairly. Duh. That is a HUGE difference, like one of your eyes is less than 7/8 the size of the other. You would look like Alfred E. Neumann. I can't stand fiction by \\"experts\\" that don't give crap about details."},{"rating":"1","title":"[bad] Read","review":"I love quirky detective fiction. I dig fun and hip characters. I enjoy a great twister of a plot. This book is a letdown in all of these areas and more. Fist of all, it is a very poorly written book. The imagery is tired and the dialogue is flat. The plot unfolds haphazardly with very little direction or emphasis. It comes off as a poor writer trying to imitate other more talented authors and failing. The book has a lot of potential but doesn't pay off in any respects, pretty much like my last few trips to Vegas. Just stay away from this one, it's a bad read."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than a day at the races","review":"James Swain's Tony Valntine character is always fun. Tough, but soft; chronically depressed, but always hopeful; crafty to a fault. Valentine is an ex-cop from Atlantic City who now consults with casinos eager to catch scammers, if not stop them before they win a penny.This is the third of the Tony Valentine mysteries. The first one (\\"Grift Sense\\") was dynamite - and each successor has gotten better.The action takes place largely at a Florida Indian Reservation casino. A blackjack player is dealt 84 winning hands in a row, a statistical impossibility.The dealer disappears. But that's only the beginning of the story as Tony gets involved. The blackjack scam is only the tip of the iceberg.Every page is fun. Swain's plots are complex, but always believable. The characters, each and every one of them, radiate believability.Swain's style is compelling and Tony Valentine is one heck of a hero.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully slow---not at all like Bach","review":"This performance is dreadful. It is so slow as to be painful. Yes, you can recognize the familiar melody, etc., but it just doesn't sound like Bach. Also, the soprano soloist (there are two---not sure which one as I write this) is way too operatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bach for elephants","review":"First of all, I admire the late Prof. Richter, who was indeed a great Bachian. I have even had the privilege of attending concerts of him conducting his own Munich Bach Choir. However, to me, this is yesterday's Bach - too slow, too ponderous, too overly reverent. The newer performers of this sort of music (notably Gardiner and Suzuki) have shown the way, and they are better in every department. To me, this is useful as a historical record to show how such music was once performed, but not for real musical pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Tongue and Groove Plier on the Market","review":"I've had a pair of Channellock 430's in my hand almost every work day since 1992. They are hands-down the best tongue and groove plier on the market. No one makes a hinge that lasts longer. Their hinge pin is pressed together which is vastly superior to a crushed nut so many other pliers have. If you purchase a set of pliers (for heavy daily, not casual, use) from ANY manufacturer and there is a nut holding on the hinge pin...you should save yourself a lot of time and go ahead and loosen the nut, pinch your finger inbetween the handles, scream obscenities at whoever is unlucky enough to be standing nearby, and then throw the tool as far as you can...because that is what will eventual happen if you decide to save a few bucks on a pair of pliers with a nut on the hinge pin.If you have ever used another brand for a period of time you will notice the quality as soon as you hold them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent versitility!","review":"This 10 inch supplements the 7 inch channellock that I have.

Can not be used alone to teach someone the subjects that it contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget this is a sequel","review":"If you liked the original, which i did very much, you would just naturally wanna see more. Please, don't do it. Pretend it ends where it did. This sequel is worse than Creepshow 3, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium, and House 2: The Second Story. The runtime for this movie is very short, although it feels longer because it is that bad. This could have been done way better. Looks like the original 1982 version used better film and had a bigger budget than this 1993 sequel. This movie was made on a $300 budget looks like. I could go on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"First off, for me the second CD didn't even play at all for me but somehow I didn't seem to mind that much as this is an awful CD with the exception of a couple of good tracks. It consists mostly of former hair metal bands covering other hair metal bands songs. Additionally, some of these cover bands I never heard of. I agree with the reviewer above. This box set is pretty much good for only one thing: a coaster set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah...I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree.","review":"Admittedly, I don't scour the surface of the Earth for hard to find B, C, and D-class tracks to add to my metal collection.

This book belongs in the bookcase of all students of that tumultuous period. No other book exists that contains such a valuable amount of accurate information and explainations, including the much sought-after Orders of Battle with firm numbers that are unattainable elsewhere. This inside view sheds new light on famous battles, such as that of Gallipoli, often down to the last remaining artillery shells. The facination has been contageous. The cost is well worth it, in any currency."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Military Historian","review":"It is the first English written military history book about WWI from the Turkish sources. So its giving the story from the other side of the front.Even though author did not use original archives documents he still did a very good job. He managed to draw a face for the Turkish soldiers in opposition to other works.I strongly advise it for everybody who wants to learn more than romantic Lawrence of Arabia stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"mom","review":"My daughter loves this game. we were so happy to find it here as it is not available in the stores anymore. It was reasonably priced and arrived quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for 3/4 but not wrapped up well","review":"This guy's imagination is really something but it fails him for the last 1/4 of the book. Entire interesting plot lines are just dropped (what happened to the city administration anyway?). Conflicts and ambivalence are a big part of the book the whole way through but they lose meaning when they are caused by the author just not knowing where to go with the story.It is an interesting read, but really unfortunate that the brilliant vision fades out so badly when it came time to tie up story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best doorstop I own.","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. The combination of a sloppy plot, which goes everywhere, and Mr Mieville's tendency to ramble on about nothing made reading this book a perverse act of self torture. It takes almost half the book for anything to really start to happen and when it does it is so uninteresting and uninspired you loose interest. It's almost as if he ran out of steam half way through writing it and just slapped anything together to make a deadline. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impenetrable","review":"I like to read, I do it almost everyday. I don't think that I'm an especially intelligent person, nor do I think I'm too stupid. I work as a neuroscientist and am generally able to speed my way through novels. That being said, reading through Perdido Street Station was more of a challenge than a pleasure. This is not a quick read, something you can sit down a bit sleepy at the end of a long day and read. Rather, this is a book that requires a bit of focus and a critical vocabulary to understand. The author would never say that something fell out of a window, rather he dedicates almost two pages to how a food basket falls. This adds character to the environment, but makes for an incredibly long, dense read, especially when the vocabulary used to describe these actions is at the least scholarly in caliber.I'll keep reading, but a few chapters in and I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop!","review":"There's a lot of poop in this book. Literally.Mieville can't seem to go a page without mentioning excrement, excretions, spittle, saliva, sewage or something else that turned my stomach.I suppose this is supposed to be some sort of metaphor. But this is a very long and nauseating book that takes itself seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the future of horrorpunk, I want no part of it...","review":"This book is a mess, and when one reads it, you can almost hear the self-conscious rattling of the author and the genre he's trying to \\"expand\\" but just fails on almost all levels. Here is a world where all sorts of fantastic technology exist, yet things like a telephone or radio are unheard of. The language and metaphors are cumbersome, and author uses every chance he gets to use \\"flesh\\" like that makes things more terrifying.Also, I would add that this is more of a Fantasy novel than anything else. If you want something well-written without 1-dimensional characters, try Dan Simmon's \\"Hyperion\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst fantasy ? science fiction I have read in 35 years.","review":"this is not a novel,it is a mishmash of undeveloped ideas and story lines which never find a resting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Speculative Fiction","review":"China's Perdido Station is a great story told in an unbelievably ugly world setting. Cruelty is the norm. Ugliness is the canvass. If you don't mind the descent, this is a story that is well worth the read. Excellent execution on the narrative; the theme(s) are coherent and China pours on the imagination. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, I can't recommend it.","review":"A friend let me borrow this book so I felt obligated to finish it, but I would not have otherwise. The pacing is awful. The plot does not really get going until halfway through, but even so, I actually felt the first half was better. The introduction to the setting and the characterization is excellent in the beginning. The ultimate enemy however, introduced far into the book, is comparatively boring. The spurious details and pointless sidetracks also become extremely tiresome in the second half.The author has a talent for description, world building and social commentary, but story arc, pacing, and action leave a lot to be desired. Maybe he has matured in his later books.Great books are hard for me to put down, this one was hard for me to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Overwritten, pretentious and trying to sell Marxism. I did not know Mr. Mieville's politics when I read the book, but after reading it, took a guess that he must be an avowed communist, and lo and behold, I was correct. The book is both boring and filled with pseudo=intellectual tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelming","review":"This is one of the few books I've ever read twice. Even knowing what was going to happen, I couldn't put it down.Don't expect this to be about elves and magic just because it's in the fantasy section. The world that Mieville creates is too original for that. While the novel contains some elements of traditional fantasy, the beings and forces he creates are as varied, vivid, and fundamentally flawed as those of our own world. The characters try desperately to cope with events outside their control while eking out some good in their world. And ultimately they find themselves having achieved nothing and lost everything, showing us that sometimes saving the world is not a happy ending.I'm a writer myself, and this is one of the books that inspires me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Ride!","review":"This is a superb work. I would rate it as right up there with Lord of the Rings. Somehow, the author has managed to weave magic into a sordid backdrop of a sort of ghetto slum. I would not have believed that would work, until I read this book. What stands out is the attention to detail. At no point are we left wondering about what a certain place would like, smell like and even feel like. So often, SF and Fantasy writers skip over these details in pursuit of a complex plot. But it is these details that make such a story feel so real. The point of novels like these is to transport the reader into another world, a sort of temporary escape from the humdrum. The author does this wonderfully. I cannot put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel and confused","review":"Well, to say the least, this is just a very cruel story. It looks like the author have some perverse pleasure to create a narrative only torture his characters. It reaches a point it becomes funny, like a soap-opera. That's the reason for my 2-star rating.On the good side, the background universe is full of original ideas. He also brings some mytical imagery, changing the names just a bit so we can recognize it...very clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"This book is completely indescribable. I have no way to express with my limited vocabulary what China Mieville has accomplished in over 700 pages with a complete mastery of the English language. There's no way I could ever explain his complex plot and wonderful characters. The book was very moving at times, it sent goosebumps down my spine at others, and occassionally made me laugh, and I was always astounded at the inventiveness of his created \\"city\\", which is more like an entire world, and at the very least a country. The first time I tried to write a review about this book, it didn't work. I just couldn't explain the little things all over the book that make it great. It has to be read. Well, I'll stop rambling now......just go out and buy it......."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first I thought it was difficult to read...","review":"and after reading three chapters, I realised it was poorly written.It's a shame, because the world and the story is actually pretty compelling and you want to know what's next, but it is VERY ANOYING to read fifty pages of adjetives and redundant (extremly redundant)and repetitive description. It's got some very interesting scenes, but you can get more content from an avreage short story.Bottom line: this is an extremly overrated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, depressing book that lacks an ending","review":"Mieville does create a clear, depressing, opressive world. My main complaint is that the story seemed unfinished. My impression was that part of the ending was the lesson that not all things are possible, but there just seemed to be too many loose ends for such a depressing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first","review":"An excellent story. The book was vivid and interesting, but slow, for the first half of the book. It was full of alchemy, fantasy, magic, fictional yet coherent science and a Steampunky grime. I read it mostly on planes, and began to associate the vivid city description with the smell of the plane -- it was almost like stepping into the book itself every time I went airborne.The second half of the book changed pace quickly, and became exciting. The book creates an excellent realism to a fantasy world, creating a creature, science and housing diversity better than Star Wars. The author was not afraid to take risks, and the result was worth it.It's a good read, as long as you have the patience to return to the book during the chapters of the first half. Keep in mind that if you don't like what I just described, don't buy it; it won't appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"Granted I was on vacation and had the time, but I FLEW through this book. It was very good. He created a new world that was very unique and well thought out. It's easy to get hooked. Mieville has a grand mastery of the written word and this books is well worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like how it's written, but not what's written","review":"I'll concur with the reviewers who've opined that Mr. Mi��ville's overly-descriptive writing style interrupts the novel's flow. No question.But I actually find this style intriguing & engaging -- tho' I'd certainly not want every novel to be written this way.My chief dissatisfactions were that I found the novel too dark, the setting too depressed, and the main characters too unsympathetic to care about.I'll likely investigate other Mi��ville books that are considered 'lighter', but I chose not to even finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"China's gift for language is admirable. His descriptions in this book jump right off the page, and the characters are all very well drawn. As well, his powers of imagination are formidable and Perdido Street Station is bursting with originality.However, I strongly disliked this book and put it down--gave it to charity, actually--after reading only 150 pages. Why? Because although I felt like I was really in the world the author created, I detested that world. There is nothing beautiful there, nothing admirable--just filth and misery. When I read a book I want it to be an escape from real life--to someplace better, not to someplace worse.I was also turned off by the scene near the beginning of the main character having sex with the insect-woman. But even though that part was so strange, I kept on reading...and eventually decided that it was just a waste of time.I need something at least a little bit more uplifting and a little less depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Mind Blowing","review":"Slake-Moths will blow your mind. This is a great stand alone novel well deserving of its awards and acclaim. I have read a few Hugo and/or Nebula winners that had zero 'Wow Factor': Left Hand of Darkness, Doomsday Book, and especially - Seeker. What I most liked about this novel what that it does not, in my experience, borrow from other authors. It is unlike anything that I have ever read... while still being a very complex story with deep character development. If I had to characterise this book, it would fall in the Steampunk Thiller genre - pretty sure that is not a search feature on NY Times Best Seller lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLEW MY MIND","review":"Not for every one, for sure, matter of fact most will have trouble getting through it, but you can say the same for Joyce. Some people though have sweet spots and this one hit mine. It's like this, if I met you or knew you, the if I reccommended this book to you then it would be a complement to you. China is increditably creative, perhaps the book has faults but when you present this mountain of creativity who really cares or notices. Just stumbled on the book, knew nothing about it or the author, just killing time in a book store and the staff had given it an award. That makes it twice as special.Question: who or how did anyone proof read this thing?great book for those who read slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the Characters?","review":"This book was very descriptive and paints a great picture of the crazy city. But honestly, I feel like the city was the authors main focus. He takes his time and fleshes it out for pages upon pages. But the characters are completely flat until the end of the book when some character development is thrown in.Honestly I was expecting a fantastic book and got a descriptive piece of junk. I was expecting the Godfather and got Planet earth (discovery channel) instead.Please save yourself and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I tried my best to \\"get into\\" this book. But I just couldn't take it. The descriptions were vivid...but I couldn't handle them. I finally closed the book and gave a sigh of relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having a hard time getting into this, may not finish","review":"While I can see that the author is a skilled writer and much of this is very imaginative, I am having a hard time substaining interest. The book's 710 page length is probably a warning sign. After 100 pages, the reader had better be caught--well, I'm still not caught! May slug on for a while longer. Again, while the writer is very skillful, if ever a book cried out for a good editing, this one does. It's simply too long and does drag. Squalor and decay get tiresome. A pity so few editors really edit books any longer; it often shows as with Perdido Street Station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flapdoodle Story/Completely Overhyped BS","review":"1000 of 99 people found the following review helpful:Apparently I am one of the few detractors of this novel, as I prefer an enrapturing story to tricksy language and weirdness(understatement). Nothing of interest happens in the novel: slake moths break loose to devour the minds of people, a crime boss coming off early as interesting is recharacterized as a complete moron later in the novel, an evil and sentient robot forms out of a junk heap, etc. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story, good characters, or a good plot.For those in need of a real fantasy series, try outGeorge R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.This work of genius contains no flowery passages delving into pseudo-philosophical ideas, (Yagharek's point of view), and keeps it real."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first review inspired by the crappiness of this book","review":"Don't believe the hype. This book is craptastic.What bothered me the most about the book was the weakness of the plot. Things did not develop organically, but major plot events driven by deux ex machina, so that the reader never has any sane ground to stand on.This book is not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost me","review":"i tried to read this book maybe 4 or 5 times after buying it online based on reviews. the writing style threw me off. i'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying to read a couple pages of this book at a bookstore before buying it, in case it's not your style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"After about 20 pages I couldn't force myself to continue with this FREE Kindle book. It was so dreary, way to much blabbing on and on and on. I have an extensive vocabulary, but the author seems to delight in finding obscure words to obfuscate the text. I looked up the words I didn't know and often found them designated as \\"archaic\\" in the dictionary. Why use them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never met an idea he didn't like","review":"This book is interesting, at first. There is a strange new world, richly visualized and described. There are unusual characters, about whom the reader learns gradually instead of having everything spelled out. But it soon starts to feel like the author was making it up as he went along. And it could definitely have used a stronger hand in the editing process. It's clear the author never had an idea he didn't like and didn't feel obliged to cram into the story. Every new character is cooler and more outrageous than the last, and they only stay on the stage for a moment before being displaced by whatever new idea struck the writers fancy.By the end, fatigue sets in, and it became a chore to finish the book. And I sort of wish I hadn't, as it had a terrible ending, with the big 'reveal' of one of the main characters making no sense, and the reaction of the protagonist being completely out of character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the hype","review":"Whenever I finish reading a book I always ask myself if it was worth the hours I spent reading it. Unfortunately I have to say NO for Perdido Street Station. The book is clearly imaginative but frequently gets muddled in insiginificant dribble that it would be better off without.At the end of the day, the book didn't challenge me, make me think, make me go wow! It only left me with a sense of wonder about why I wasted so much time on it. Mieville is an author with potential but he's not worth the hype he's been getting.On a side note, I did like Mieville's King Rat. Not challenging in any way but at least it was fun and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bug","review":"I really loved the part where he made out with the bug. I mean, really the rest of the book was pretty good but that part was the part where I was reading and said to myself \\"Yeah... this is it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, deep and dark","review":"This is the first \\"steampunk\\" novel I've read and I love it. China's descriptions of the city and the characters make me feel as though I'm there and the storyline is not at all clich�� or expected. I found myself wishing that I could stay in his world but I'll have to move on to his other books. Unfortunately, I hear that Perdido Street Station is his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best this year (2002)","review":"The two best books that I read this year are \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"The Scar\\". You could not achieve a better combination of the fantastic, the laughable, the dark and the baroque than China Mieville's books. Buy them and enter a world that you cannot forget. I just hope there are many more excellent novels to come from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a couple friends who had said that this is a new, exciting, and different experience. It was definitely different, I'll give them that. However, I found myself not caring about the characters and their motivations. They all seemed flat like cardboard cutouts. There were also several points in the story where events happened that seemed to have on reason for happening, and one of my main sticking points are the few Deus Ex Machina events that happen and pull the characters away from what they were doing. This all led up to an extremely disappointing ending in which a character does a complete 180 from what he had been built up to be throughout the novel.In short, this left me unfulfilled and nonplussed with China Meiville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately needs a good editor","review":"His style is painfully long-winded. Excruciatingly so! If you don't start skimming towards the latter quarter of the book, desperately wanting to be done with it so that you can spend your time on better things, then you are a stronger person than I.It is unfortunate that what the author set out to create could have been a great work of fiction if only it had been half the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perdido Street Station - My favourite book.","review":"My favourite author used to be Neil Stephenson...until I read 'Perdido Street Station'. WOW! What an enjoyable read. Try opening it at any page and your finger will land on lush and entertaining text.To give an indication of my preferences: I also enjoyed 'Shiva 3000' by Jan Lars Jensen. It was a good read, but I preferred 'Perdido Street Station'. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommenable SF/Fantasy","review":"Very good read, worth buying. Enough substance to his world for seemless verisimilitude. The ending was not tidy so I continued to think about the fate of the characters after finishing the book, much like good theater. I award it four stars rather than five only because of my particular taste; my penchant for the epic as in Tolkien was not piqued in Perdido. However, within its genre it is well worth the investment. I respect and support this author's style and work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why this book got so many good reviews..","review":"I really hated this book. It was tedious and overdescritive with really big words that I did not understand. The plot did not make much sence and the characters were jsut an excuse for the author to describe in PAINFULL detail every street every bridge every section of his creation, NEw Crobuzon. By the first hunred pages I wanted to jsut give up and through this book away. You can tell the author is inlove with his creation but it is a horrible place that I care not to visit ever again...I did not feel a connection with any of the characters and did not care if they lived or died...I made myself finish the book, but it was a f-ing chore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so read","review":"just finished reading the book. The story was somewhat interesting.The only thing that almost made me put the book down was the amount of swearing that was used. Considering that this is sci-fi and many words are either spelled oddly (Chymical, elyctrical, etc.) the F-word could have been permuted with something else. It added nothing to the story. I'd rather have seen something \\"NEW\\" sacre-bleu!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Ok... I only got 40pages into this one, but it was too much for me. Maybe it's just too dark for me; but I lost interest when the lead charactor has sex with the weird bug lady. Not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost five stars","review":"I stumbled upon this novel in the worst of ways, noticing its intriguing cover on the shelf of a local bookstore, I ignored my first grade teacher's exhortations to 'not judge a book by its cover' and picked it up and was immediately engrossed. This is a genre-bending piece that mixes motifs form horror, sci-fi and fantasy into a rich and variegated world populated by fantastic creatures, drug fiends, proto-fascistic politicians, and creatures from paralell dimensions. While many of his ideas ring unique, it was his richly-detailed rendering of New Crobuzon and his unabashed love of the language- its sound and texture as it leaps off the page- that really demonstrate his prowess as a writer. That being said, the plot did tend to lag at times and the characters weren't the most imaginatively drawn that I have ever read. Nonetheless, the book over all is a stunner and well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"Perdido street station did have a few good things going for it. Obviously mr. Melville can write beautifully, his descriptions were fantastic. It was very imaginative, his setting and characters are very interesting. Unfortunately those positive qualities alone did nothing for the book since it is extremely boring. Nothing ever happens except that he mentions the words \\"cul de sac\\" (and a few other words I can't recall) almost every other sentence, I couldn't take it.I don't know how fair this review is since I got about halfway through and could not take it anymore. This is just my personal opinion and I am sure that many other people will love this book. Give it a try for yourself. Final verdict, BORING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long in action. Long in atmosphere. And simply long.","review":"Perdido Street Station is one hell of a tome. It's brimming with colorful beings, a fully-realized world and loads of mind-opening ideas, it can serve as a jumping point for series. Meilville's words are very visual, I felt I was reading a graphic novel without illustrations. However, the pacing could've been faster, as Meilville tend to have overly-long descriptions of a character's philosophical state or the inner workings of a city's bureaucracy. But I guess that helps in making his world more vivid and real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic setup, weak second half","review":"This is my first Mieville book and he had me for the first 300 or so pages. He did a fantastic job making me feel the horror of the city, its drippings and putrid air. The plots were creative and interesting....but these get abandoned for the second half of the book which is basically a monster chase against inter-dimensional moths. I felt like I was reading two books in one, neither of which satisfied the other. As the book wound down I found the reading to be exponentially tiresome, and I didnt bother to finish the last 70 or so pages. It is extremely rare for me to not finish a book.I give Mieville credit for his wicked imagination and for teaching me some new words. There were parts of the book that blew me away, but unfortunately few of these occurred in the last 400 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Imaginative Story","review":"China Mieville creates an incredibly vivid world that you can lose yourself in completely if you allow it to take hold of you. The descriptive prose used throughout the story allows you to smell the filthy scents of New Crubozon, and if you close your eyes you can almost see it as well. He has a way of describing something in such a way that you can almost picture it but still leaving large pieces of it open to your imagination. The story is dark and brutal yet also one of transformation. I can't help but finish it with a feeling of hope....... that life goes on, in whatever form it must."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Are No Socks To Hold Onto In The Future...","review":"This book blew me away!!!! China Mieville is able to incorporate so many different ideas into your mind from the very start. You have this mad scientist with a beetle headed artist girlfriend, and it's from the start of the book you can get a feeling that this book is just on another level. Read it slowly and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting book, Kindle version a bit flawed","review":"Wonderful, imaginative book that well deserved all the praise and all the prices heaped on it. Nothing more to say about the content itself, others have done it really well.However I bought the electronic Kindle version and it has one annoying flaw: It is set in left justification (flush left, ragged right), not in full justification (flush left and flush right). Something every book printer knows is a sacrilege and makes reading harder and more straining. It would have been 20 seconds invested to set the text like virtually every book. Unfortunately there is not option in the Kindle to change justification yourself, only spacing and font size.Great book, sloppy Kindle-version.Book: 5/5Kindle-implementation: 3/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Experience - It's Almost Sad that it's Free.","review":"There are few books that take you to completely unexpected places. Perdido Street Station is a feast of creativity. The story takes place in a city that is a melting-pot of alien species and cultures. Much like the books of Heinlein, Perdido Street Station will make you look at your own prejudices and assumptions in a new light. This story cannot be categorized neatly into a sci-fi genre because it is seemingly set in a real place with real individuals with real ambitions, loves and fears. It is a journey not to be missed, especially now that it is available on Kindle at no charge.I hope you love it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but rewarding","review":"Perdido Street Station and its sister novel (not a sequel) The Scar offer a finely grained and wildly imaginative glimpse of the world of Bas Lag, wherein humans coexist with a vast and bizarre array of \\"alien\\" species - insectoid Khepri, waterloving Voyadnoi, vegetable Cactii, flying garuda, dimension shifting spiders, grotequely manufactured Remade, to name a few. Both novels offer beautifully descriptive language that transports the reader into this bizarre and minutely detailed world. As in the LOTR saga, great swaths of history and context are glimpsed only in passing, a sometimes frustrating technique that does have the effect of adding depth to the reader's appreciation of New Crobuzon and the broader world that the author has created. Some details return later as plot points, other disappear, but overall one is left with the feeling that future books will benefit from the broad foundation created here. Strongly recommended with its sister book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when you get original","review":"I don't remember the last book I read that was as self-conscious as this...and as excited about the cliches it repeats. Mieville lines up \\"look at me\\" moments one after the other, all presented as new, and all begged, borrowed, and stolen from them who have gone before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Absolutely horrible. Every sentence is packed with as much disgusting imagery as possible. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO VERY GOOD!","review":"I read \\"The Scar\\" first, was swept off my feet, and feared \\"Perdido Street\\" would not match it. It did. In fact, it is hard to believe two books set in the same imagined world can be so different. And yet at the same time they share a common substrate, which I imagine springs from Trotzky's vision of society. I was swept wildly away with \\"The Scar\\" but in \\"Perdido\\" I felt strangely at home in the tortured London which lurks in the details of \\"New Crobuzon\\". The slang is (or was in my day) much the same as in London, as is the fondness for pubs and beer, and the peculiar twisted affection of residents for their own neighborhoods. It will take a long time before I am able to size up the two books in a dispassionate way, yet there is no doubt in my mind that they both rank equally high in the stratosphere of Science Fiction. Next to \\"Iron Council\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm obviously not the intended audience","review":"Yet another urban grunge fantasy. Been there, done that. Yet more wierd aliens and hybrid people, ALL of which think and behave EXACTLY like ordinary humans, so what is the point? The highest technology is steam engines, yet we are expected to believe they have powered flight and the medical ability to graft absolutely anything onto the body. Sorry, I couldn't buy into it. Maybe I am just burned out on fantasy science fiction, although I had no trouble recently re-reading Lord of the Rings and loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"reverse order","review":"Just a note to all the folks that inadvertently read THE SCAR first. I did just because it was the only volume of Mieville's work I could get. I then found Perdido Street Station. I had no problem with reading them out of order. Mieville is simply among the best new scifi writers around. He really writes well! I usually avoid anything that is not hard scifi or cyberpunk, except for anything Mieville writes. His books are really lush experiences. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 and a half stars","review":"I just could not get into this book. The characters were not very interesting. The actual city was somewhat interesting but that wasn't enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexual tension is Heated","review":"The sexual tension between the characters Bianca and Kahron is intense. From the beginning the urgency of him passing her on the highway is the same urgency he took in having her as his women to Love and Protect. I have already orders Book#2 in the Strong Family series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Heated All Right","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The heroine had a rough childhood and was estranged from her alcoholic father, but she returns home when he says he needs her. Between him being married to someone she went to high school with and the hot guy who wants to buy her father's land and wants her, she's got a lot to deal with. The romance is a little unconventional in that she knows she wants to sleep with him, but takes her time about her feelings for him. Combine that with someone out there trying to sabotage her father's ranch and her new lover the prime suspect makes for some interesting reading. The mystery is very interesting. I didn't suspect who all was involved for quite some time.It's an interesting read and some very steamy love scenes. I'd highly recommend it if that's what you're looking for. Also, there's a sequel coming out involving the widower, single father brother of our hero. His first meeting with his heroine is very fiery. Can't wait to read that one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating read","review":"Noibia defintly knows how to write! the sex sences were hot!The plot well written and easy to follow.Characters are described so you can picture them cleary.Cant wait to read about Kade"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air conditioning AND a fan required....","review":"Niobia Bryant's latest book \\"Heated\\" is just that...hot!After coming back to Holtsville to help her estranged father save the family ranch, Bianca King has to deal with an evil young stepmother, frightening criminal mishaps and a nagging doubt that Kahron Strong -- the man responsible for the butterflies in her stomach and an overly rapid heartbeat -- may also be responsible for those mishaps.Kahron, with his sexy, southern charm and Bianca, veterinarian extraordinaire were wonderful together. They were passionate, humorous and touching. \\"Heated\\" also offers Ms. Bryant's trademark sexy, love scenes that make you melt.I am so looking forward to meeting all the Strong men, in particular Kade, Kahron's older brother.

The characters were undeveloped. The grammatical errors were many. The story line was predictable. Yes, the passion was there, but the scene where she drives to his home and jumps him at the door is too over-the-top.I've thoroughly enjoyed all of her other titles, but felt taken for granted as a fan with \\"Heated\\" because it was lacking in content and grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holtsville here I come!!","review":"I guess all of the hot men are in Holtsville!! I've guess I'd to move there. Heated is a refreshing story about rekindling a relationship between father and daughter. To add to the mix are two other characters one wanting to purchase the family ranch and the other a freeloading step mother. Put this all together and you have a wonderful read and awesome love scenes to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modigliani: Man and Myth","review":"Although her writing style is dry in its translation, the book sheds light on the Modigliani family in the social/cultural/intellectualcontext of life in the late 19th century, and early 20th-century Livorno, Italy.

Encinas is not only a great guitarist but an equally effective arranger. His use of voice, piano, trumpet, synthesizer, etc. as background orchestrations has simply amazed me. I'm still hearing new (to me) rhythms and subtle backgrounds. I looked for other CD's of his while in Mexico last month-- no luck. Maybe Spain, in May..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silk Lining of New Flamenco","review":"\\"Duende\\" is a must for all music lovers.

The whole CD is outstanding but we have there 4 masterpieces (Night in the south, Gate of mistery, Luna de Fiesta and Desert). Encimas is a fenomenous and this CD is a must in your Jukebox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Nuevo Flamenco","review":"There are great moments on this CD, but to enjoy it you have to have a taste for some world music and some sythesized rythmns. In addition there's a heavy pervading bass that I couldn't get over. These qualities of the arrangement come too close to pop for my tastes. I don't recommend it if you're looking for a kind of nuevo flamenco that sticks to guitar, bass, and light purcussion. This reaches out in many new directions. I sold it back used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too manufactured for my tastes","review":"How do I say it? It just lacks soul, and I'm sorry I can't give you a more sophisticated description than that. I'm not a flamenco purist, but I stilld don't care for the artificial sounds of New Age music.I gave this album a good try but couldn't get over the heavy bass and other synthetic sounds in the arrangement that performed more like a computer than a musician. On its own the guitar work was pleasant.However, if your tastes tend toward New Age music and innovative sound mixtures, then this might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't call it flamenco","review":"It's interesting and pretty music, but it ain't flamenco. Sorry. Neither is Oscar Lopez, Jesse Cook, Armik, etc. I'm not putting them down as guitarists, nor as artists. I'm not putting them down. The trouble is that companies like Narade will put out CD's that juxtapose true flamenco artists like Tomatito, El Viejin, Morente, etc, and mix them with this new age guitar stuff. Unfortunately, the flamenco artists agree to the distribution because they need the money, and these new age guitarists agree to it for probably the same reason. I say save your money and get a Vicente Amigo CD and be prepared to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUENDE: Music with a Soul","review":"This is an outstanding collection of beautiful and ingenious compositions. All of the songs seem to flow like a stream of consciousness, as DUENDE is the moment when the music and the listener become one, and the music then takes us to that emotional realm. Music with passion is DUENDE. \\"Night in the South\\", \\"Gate of Mystery\\", \\"Asturias XXI\\", are but a few of the MANY great ones on this CD. Can't wait for his NEXT CD! A tough act to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what I wanted","review":"This module is perfect for rack mounted equipment. I mounted a dual SD card player at the top like in their picture, and had a smal space left under it to mount a 4 channel wireless microphone array. It hit the back of the unit, so I had to flip the tab around so that it now protudes about 2 inchs out, but works nicely. There was room for my mixer, and a space at the bottom for an amp. This is nicely layed out for easy access. Two of the rivits were pulling out of one of the closure claspes, but I replaced them with a couple of sheet metal screws and everything is fine. Definatly would recommend this product if your looking for a good case, that angles everything up at a nice position for easy of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this item","review":"I just have to say that the copy I recived is a fake one.Sad but true.So, do not buy this item.That is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight Returns is Essential even for non-comic reading book fans.","review":"A one-two punch of a set in one amazing volume. There are examples of a medium that so much represent the best there is that it transcends the traditional audience. The Dark Knight Returns, the first of two volumes in this set, is such a work. The 15-years between it's sequel, The Dark Knight Rides Again, seem to change the momentum. While it is sometimes fun and always interesting, it is merely a ride-along compared to the first volume. Bottom line, this is worth it alone for The Dark Knight Returns- the sequel is just icing.There are two odd omissions here- one was the Frank Miller Batman:Year-one story and the other was his Batman x-mas short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Great","review":"The Dark Knight Returns is one of my favorite comics, it's certainly my favorite Batman story. It's so well loved by everyone that I doubt any will claim they don't respect it. It's just great, in all aspects, even the ending is perfect.For some reason I never got around to reading the sequel until I bought this edition. Big mistake. The degree to which I love The Dark Knight is in inverse proportion to my hatred of The Dark Knight Strikes Again. These two books don't belong together at all.The style of the sequel is completely different. The artwork is much chunkier and sloppy, the coloring is atrocious and the story didn't matter to me at all. When I got to the end I was actually sorry I had read it.I will sell this and stick with my leather bound copy of The Complete Frank Miller Batman, a superior collection. Absolute editions of comics are well produced and usually worth the money - but skip this one and buy Absolute Watchmen instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Dark Knight H/C","review":"I'm very pleased with my purchase.

But this recording is top-notch, rivaling (though not surpassing) the famous Beecham recording with the Royal Philharmonic (and with better acoustics.) The stars of this recording are not the conductor, but the individual players of the Berlin Phil, beginning with a most wonderful performance by Michael Schwalbe, the concertmaster playing the violin solos. (indeed it was for these that I purchased this recording.) But each player in virtually every section gets his moment, and illustrates why, during this period, the Berlin was the standard by which all other orchestras were measured.My one disappointment is that the sonic extremes of the recording make it difficult for me to enjoy on my car stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly short of perfect","review":"I love Shin Chan, and would recommend this product to anybody with a sense of humor. I have some minor gripes, though.It very plainly says \\"Uncensored\\" on the back of the box, but I heard probably two dozen bleeps. Somebody at Funimation really dropped the ball on this one.Also there are no subtitles or closed captioning. I have partial hearing loss and it's hard for me to understand characters with higher voices, so I always have subtitles going when I watch on Adult Swim.Final point. I was really hoping to see the behind the scenes footage they had on adultswim.com - that was much better than the extras we got in this package.I really hope somebody from Funimation reads this stuff.

It is SO much funnier. I first started watching Shin-chan when I was stationed in Misawa, Japan 18 years ago and have been hooked on it ever since. I've enjoyed the Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball series--they are both uncut and have the original footage. Sure, some of this stuff may not be appropriate for children, but parents should have the responsibility to be aware of what their children are watching anyway. Release Shin-chan in his original form and put the entire season in one set instead of this part 1, part 2 stuff--what, are you trying to milk us for money? I hated to see when the Spongebob series started doing that...Don't change the cultural references, so what if some people don't get it--it's a good learning experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that US dubs have zero respect towards anime","review":"What a disgrace. Here we have people thinking Crayon shinchan is an \\"adult anime.\\" Guess what, the original Japanese version is actually kids anime. Crayon Shinchan in Japan is targeted toward kindergarten kids. That's what makes Shinchan so hilarious. This is NOT Crayon Shinchan at all. The English dub turns it into a cheap South-park imitation, using drug references just to insult the original. The least they could do is release the original. There are other countries that dub Shinchan faithfully. Again, a disgrace, an insult. If I want to watch an adult cartoon, I watch Family Guy, South Park, etc. Proof that US English dub/localizations have zero respect towards the original anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another anime that should be forgotten","review":"This is by far the most pathetic anime I've seen thus far, and I've seen a lot of anime (over 90 separate TV series). The first thing that tipped me off was the horrendous artwork, as an artist myself I look for quality in the animes I watch and notice when it's lacking. Next is what passes as humor, this is really low-brow stuff, calling it potty humor would be a complement. My advice is when you see this turn and run..... fast, I will not recommend this to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff but censored","review":"It takes a specialized sense of low-brow, cheap and trashy humor to really appreciate this '90s Japanese TV series in this new English dub.

Luckily, the second set (Season 1, part 2) is NOT censored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"Skip this item!!!

My first huge disappointment was the lack of an original language soundtrack w/ English subtitles. What's even worse is that all the jokes and cultural references have been Americanized. Why bother to watch an animated Japanese show when it just sounds like any number of equally lame American shows? And, yes, I do enjoy various animated American shows, too. The final blow was that I just didn't find the jokes to be particularly funny and no, it's not because they're too crude. I do enjoy South Park after all. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never should have been released","review":"This is a real botch job, from forces you'd expect better of. Karajan is sluggish and tubby and much much too slow and heavy, Mutter is dragged down along with him, and the VPO makes lots of mistakes, and the brass is thin. The audience at the end sounded luke-warm, and so was I, after this labored performance.With recordings by Oistrakh, Stern, Heifetz, Mullova, even Ferras, why this has remained in constant print for over a decade, when the majors are thinning out their classical catalogs, puzzles me.

He's obviously very smart. He does something very subtle in this book that I think is very interesting. You realize that not that many people read art criticism. It's basically a little band of academics who quote each other and give each other praise, but no one else listens. Except the student who's paying tens of thousands of dollars and doesn't want to ruin their grade point average by failing a stupid art history class. So they repeat back the drivel to get the grade.That's not what he says in the book, that's what happens in classes. In the book, Roger makes you laugh at what these guys wrote.

Ultimately the book really is very entertaining (I especially liked what he did to Heidegger in chapter 7) and quite informative, but also a little cloying. For people who hate what art critisism has become (and I count myself among them) this book is their anthem but at a certain point I got tired of the smug self-satisfied tone of the author. Yes, I get it -- your clever. You have clever things to say. Goodie for you. But could we focus more on the issues and be a little less self-congradulatory in our one liners?

It starts off slow, dreamy and beautiful, gets funkier and ends with a stunning track \\"Everything You Do is a Balloon\\" that's quite unlike anything else they've done. Not unlike an orchestral recording, with pillars of dark tones that sound like double basses coming out of the left channel interwoven with a beautiful, subtle melody. \\"Seeya Later\\" is on Twoism but the other tracks are otherwise unavailable. More interesting than \\"Twosim\\" in my opinion, and \\"Balloon\\" is really a superb piece.

It sounded like Karajan let the strings go too wildly. It did not sound together just rushed. And it was all kind of smeared together into one big sound. If it was not for this song this cd would have definately got five stars. The rest of the cd is performed remarkably well. I'm just glad karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic did't revisit that bad habit on the specific song I referred to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This peice is very outgoing and very beautiful.","review":"This peice is excellent. It Has some soft parts and some loud and exciting parts. Edvard Grieg is an amazing composer. I would have loved to seen him preform.

That is why I like this peice so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 3 months","review":"Used this product for 3 months without problem.

Sounds just like a thunderstorm. The flow of rain comes and goes and sounds so beautiful. The thunder sounds real. I love it. It does have some loud thunder. But the second one doesn't. This one is a real storm sound. Rain is louder in this one also. But I think the loud thunder and rain can be more relaxing covering other noises.Track 2 is more quiet and starts with a little bit of bird chirpping(no more than 5-6 minutes until the rain starts and birds stop) And it is an even steady flow of rain with a little quiet thunder in the back. And just as peaceful as the first track. Very relaxing.I can close my eyes and really think it is storming. I can't choose between them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD to unwind to","review":"The CD consists of quite a bit of thunder. good rain variance, and some animal sounds.

Unfortunately, this system has some problems. The primary problem is that there is such a focus on church growth that individual people are left behind. If you're not growing the church, you become part of the problem. The system leaves room for a cultish following of a charismatic leader rather than focusing on individual interpretation of scripture. This system can make you forget too easily that there are some things that are more important than church growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing train set","review":"I purchased this train set for my grandson's 4th birthday. Received it in a very timely fashion. Was excited to find a steam engine train set that actually had smoke.

A wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS SO FAR GOOD, I READ THE FIRST EIGHT CHAPTERS","review":"This book is filled with tons surpises so far and can't wait to finish it. I can't wait to see what pictures where in there. I personally think men should read this as well. Its like American Girls books and Penny Colman's Girls.

I use this when I have a sore neck or headache. Just pop it onto a micro-safe plate (you don't want the cover to pick up any oils or food matter from your micro) and 2-3 minutes later, it's warm and ready to go. The length is great and the fact that the cherry stones move around within the chambers of the wrap is nice too (you can clump them all to one side if you like for those cold feet!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Textbook I've used","review":"I have found the editor's notes in this text (the author biographies specifically) to be poorly organized, proofread, and edited. This text has more typos than any other I have read, and the physical construction of the book is also shoddy (the pages fall out).I think the breadth and choice of excerpts is quite nice. It seems that this book had good vision, but is in DIRE need of a good editor, and some logistical re-working.I'm not sure what else is out there on this subject, but I can only assume it is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat toy!","review":"Was a bit leary purchasing this product based on some reviews, but I'm glad I did. My boys LOVE this and it keeps them entertained for hours. The pieces snap together just fine and does not fall apart as easily as some reviews claim. My 4 year old constructed it in the house and carried his contraption down 3 steps into the garage without it falling apart. The connectors do need to be pushed together a bit tighter than a 4 yr old does, just check it before it's moved. As far as bugs getting out? Who'd want it in the house anyway? I teach my kids to release their \\"pets\\" when they're done playing. I also think that there are a perfect amount of tubes & connectors included, bugs are tiny, any more parts, it'd be way too big & too many pieces to lose or step on. I would recommend this toy, especially for a child who loves to build & connect things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Bug City","review":"The Bug Podz are a lot of fun to play with. There are numerous ways to build all of the parts together and my son loves to change around the Podz everyday. They are not large at all and can only house the smallest bugs. A large grasshopper would have trouble getting around the tubes. This product combined two things that my son loves: building and bugs. The pods and tubes are very fragile and would break easily if dropped from a high height or stepped on. Overall they are a lot of fun and I wish I had bought two sets so that he could build more elaborate \\"cities\\". Next summer I'll get him another set to combine the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product - avoid at all costs!","review":"This product does not work.

Crime Broker may star the once famous Jacqueline Bisset, but she definatly can not save this film from going into the dumpster. It is a very low budget, poorly filmed Australian movie about a respected judge and mother having a secret life of crime. Slow moving with hardly any action and poor acting and directing, making this forgettable and not worth ones time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet faces","review":"I bought this piece for my mother for her yard-art collection. What she most likes about this piece is the sweet expressions on their faces; not \\"froggy\\" per se. The bench swings freely without tipping the trellis. The trellis is sturdily built and ornate without being busy, and there are no hearts anywhere. The bud vases are attached discretely and the entire ensemble looks great with them or without them.A word of caution: the small sign hanging above the frogs says \\"Lovers Lane\\" ... my mother is a recent widow so had I known that prior, I perhaps would not have ordered this. Charming, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid... a gem especially for the price","review":"I am a very big fan of GBS and this release. Some of the songs sounded better on \\"RoadRage\\" (General Taylor, Excursion and When I'm Up are quite noticable) but it's a very small complaint indeed. The harmonies of The River Driver, Captian Kidd and just about everything else are mouth watering and solid all the way through, the slowed down \\"Sea of no Cares\\" is a treat, and the overall mix of song choices is right on. I watched the DVD first... OK I didn't need to hear Danny Boy ever again, but I loved the jokes and fun they had throughout the performance. As always with GBS, the music itself is excellent (especially Bob Hallett... that guy is so consistent and versatile it's scary) and again, it's SO worthwhile at <15 bucks. Hey GBS... thanks for great music at a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the \\"feel\\" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to buy","review":"I love Great Big Sea, and if you are going to grab just one CD by them, this is the one to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near the quality of previous albums.","review":"With Road Rage being my favorite album so far, I was excited when I heard that Great Big Sea had made another live album. This excitement lasted until I actually received the album as a birthday gift and got to hear what was on it. Great Big Sea is my favorite band and it pains me to say this, but this is the worst album they have released to date and a sad attempt at a \\"live\\" album. Sean and Alan sound out of breath through half the album and the timing seems to be way off through out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Some Rest Boys","review":"It could have been so much better. Watching the DVD, the band appears exhausted, and almost every song is sung flat. I was looking forward to this concert DVD, since their first live DVD/CD was great (it even aired on the CBC, but I hope this one does not). I have seen them live, and I can tell you that this DVD does not represent how great GBS can be onstage. If you get a chance to see them in concert, don't let the \\"Courage & Patience & Grit\\" performance keep you from going. I look forward to their future projects and shows, but this one should not have been released.

My son started playing it when he was about 4. It's great in that it's a game you can get even the youngest of kids, and there's nothing in it that's violent or intimidating to them.I just wish this had been the Windows XP version of this game like Amazon said it was, since this was to be a birthday gift for a little boy turning 4 years old tomorrow and his family was just given a computer with Windows XP on it, so it will not work on it.

It is marvelous. Great character development of flawed characters. A real sense of the police team working methodically and hard, rather than brilliantly. Each makes his own contribution. Lots of disappointments. Love the relationships. The humor is terrific.I liked this one in particular. The Man Who Went Up in Smoke is about a Swedish magazine writer who disappears in Hungary. Martin Beck is sent to investigate and is neither equipped with intros to the Hungarian police nor with speaking Hungarian. Nevertheless, he arrives, meets collaborators and various Hungarians and proceeds to solve what happened to the writer.It is fabulously plotted, and I loved the surprise ending. I saw all the clues but did not put it together myself.The Hungarian policeman who gets involved is special and quite humorous. All over a wonderful book.

Also a great section on how to interpret EKG, xray and some physical exam pearls.

I've been scrapbooking for 4 years and there wasn't much that I saw in this book that I haven't already seen before in either a Creative Memories idea book or one of scrapbook magazines.

The other reviewers who negatively criticized this book clearly had their own agenda. Prince does an excellent job telling the story of what happened to aviators interred in Switzerland.

These guys have a unique sound as a band. It is accoustic guitar driven, but very powerful. Sort of a stripped down Dave Matthews Band vibe with a harder sound like early Live. Each song is unique as well. There is obviously no \\"formula\\" these guys use when they write. You have a song like \\"Flypaper\\" that has a bouncy, raw sound, \\"Lions Fall\\" that is majestic and moving and \\"Blood Moon\\" that has a \\"poppy\\" feel, just to name a few.

She has the amazing ability to really put me right in the scene, because her attention to details paints such a vivid picture. You can almost taste what she is eating, touch what she is touching and so on... Audre's work often makes people hold her up as if she was more then human, this book let's you know how very human she was and for me, it let's me know how important it is to be \\"doing my work,\\" as she put it in the \\"Transformation of Silence.\\" Hey, are you doing yours?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book for those sisters who know OUR pain","review":"Zami was one of the first books i read in my teens that helped me deal with the loneliness of being a young black woman in this world.

I was putting it off because I read the first chapter and it was dry. I have to tell you that it gets better down the road. Audre is not just talking about lesbianism, she is talking about being a woman and general. You can get good relationship advice by NOT following what she did in her relationships. I was exposed to lesbianism of 20-30 years ago in this book. It's so different now and for women (of all sexualities and colors) this book is for you.The only problem is that the beginning drags but once you are pass...let's say page 40 or the younger years you will be fine. Concerned, scared, hopeful...these are the things I felt for Audre. If you can't deal with the beginning put it down. However, I want you to know...one day I am sure you will pick it up again; or you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT read this book before bed!","review":"I found that Audre Lorde's prose is more stimulating than an espresso before bed. I would read a chapter and then my brain would trick and rove and hum for the next two hours. I am a white guy in my 40s who shares very little in common with Audre Lorde's own experience of growing up in the US, yet I felt she was telling my story, and particularly telling my mother's story, who lived in NYC around the same time. Lorde communicate the raw need to live liberated in mind and body, a message that challenged me and gave me hope. It is always beautifully written. I had not read any of Lorde's poetry before reading this autobiography, but the writing reveals a poet at work, an artist, and an activist."},{"rating":"2","title":"View of history through black, lesbian eyes","review":"I found this book very well-written and engaging in that it kept my attention.

I wonder if the author does any backpedalling on his mid-90's assertions that God is so angry with the world that a major \\"chastisement\\" would occur prior to the turn of the millenium (year 2000). I am guessing he either ignored his previous claims, or cherry-picked scipture or other previous religious sources to explain why his claims might have been \\"misconstrued\\", and his new ones should be accepted with certainty. I'm sure it's a fairly lucrative business if you can con the community of believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"If you don't like \\"pop country\\" (or what I call \\"sissy country\\") and you're looking for REAL country, buy it!

At first i thought it would not be good becuz of all the ppl in it and thought the idea of hip hop artists may not work. but boy was i wrong. this game has the best storyline i have ever seen in a fighting game. great voice overs by the artists. create-a-player is one of the best I've seen. This is a funny, serious and fun game. Multi-player is what really matters in a fighting game, this game doesn't dissapoint. it has fun multiplayer modes like demolition match and free for all.

This game has it all... A great storymode, an awesome multiplayer mode, and more options than you'll know what to do with...You can create your own character and guide him through different levels/events that will score you money/experience points/girlfriends/etc... You can use your money/experience points to unlock new characters/levels, bling bling ; ), secret moves, etc. This game is very deep, and it will keep you busy for a while, trying to unlock everything... The difficulty level is adjustable, so, you will not get bored fighting at the same level... The control is great, the player models are seamless, and the levels are well laid out... I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of wrestling/fighting games/or just the hip hop industry in general.

The idea is great, the fighting styles are great, everythings great about this game accept the animation. This would be the best game, but for instance, they show a lot of video clips in between fights, or after fights or something, and there always choppy. So the pictures will freez, but the words will keep going, so the words wont match the characters. or sometimes the videoclips will just freez for like, 1 minute. Also sometimes the picture will keep going, but the words will stop. Also, keep in mind im playing this game on my new ps2, and the games brand new too. Also it happens with all my friends game also.

It is for the manufacturer, Ezonics, who failed to include system compatibility information in its Amazon description of the item (and, at the date of this review, *still* has not added that information).

My husband installed it from their tree house (12 ft in the tree) across our yard to the swing set (about 70 feet). The instructions are not as clear as they could be, with important details being a little buried. However, my husband and I are engineers, and so we recognize the importance of paying attention to these details. You want to be sure to read these instructions VERY carefully before installing. We made a brake for the zip line using an idea I collected online: a wooden block clamped to the line held by two, 6 ft long bungee cords staked into the ground. My 6 year old cannot touch the ground at the finishing end of the zipline, so this brake was a welcome relief for the \\"mommy brake\\" (I would catch him before he hit the tree). The brake works like a charm. The boys love this zipline!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this!","review":"Absolutely horrible product!

Because the trolley is made of plastic, the metal cord will rub/wear the trolley. This will eventually create wear that the trolley isn't designed to withstand. Our rear wheel became so deformed that it wouldn't spin, but the rider could still descend on 3 wheels.

What I found was that the U bolts included in the package were not recommended for the size of wire rope included in the package.

Within 3 months of use, one of the cheap plastic wheels in the trolley had failed and the trolly wouldn't run to the end of the line anymore.

The heroine, Virginia Brandon, is such a bubble-headed tease that you want to slap her silly, the way the hero frequently does, which may be why you keep turning the pages. The hero, Steve Morgan, has the morals of an alley cat and little else to recommend him. His one redeeming quality is that he hates Virginia almost as much as you do. Each of them singly is mind-numbingly stupid, and the two of them together are positively Martian. The only sensible thing either one of them does is eat, drink, or sleep -- and even then, they usually screw it up.

There are few shows on television with as interesting a character as Dexter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer with a heart, and muscle...","review":"One of the most fascinating shows to ever grace the cable television. This show projects an eclectic marriage of emotions, which - though inherently incompatible - render synergistic results. Michael C. Hall is indescribably poignant; his off-beat character execution is absolutely stunning. Who would have thought that a serial killer could capture so any hearts in affection. Death has never looked so good, and felt so right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fast delivery!","review":"First of all the product was as advertised, and this show is awesome!

More killing of killers and bad people is what Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is all about. All the while, he has to live a \\"normal\\" life with his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz). But the introduction of a new seductress by the name of Lila (Jaime Murray) and the ever-present Sargeant Doakes (Erik King) will keep Dexter on his toes from the very first episode of the season. Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), Dexter's sarcastic, swearing, fellow-cop coworking sister will make anybody laugh. Dexter: Season 2 is well worth your time to watch, and is a worthy addition to anybody's DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter season 2","review":"It came in 2 days which i loooove!

Dokes is easily one of my top 3 supporting characters in this entire series and he really shines in this season. Michael C. Hall came into his own in this season and made the character his, I feel, and although they've tried changing up the formula a couple of times since then, this season (in my opinion) still holds fast as the season that set the bar for the rest.-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEXTER'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH MAYHEM !!","review":"How about keeping Dexter on the air ?I've always believed the writer and director's of this television show to have mastered the continuous plot needed in each episode to hold the interest of the viewers. We all know what's going to take place with each episode yet the fun is in the watching as Dexter is his third party narrative, and his planning to kidnap the bad guy so he can continuously establish within himself, his love affair with mayhem. All of the episodes of all the seasons are great. Some episodes are better than others depending on the plot. Dexter as a whole is great. If you're a nut case stay away from Dexter. But then I should say stay away from Seinfeld if you're a nut case. Come on Showtime keep Dexter around. It is good entertainment even though it's based upon mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season 2","review":"Love the show and how easy it was to order it. Will order again in the future.

It seriously took almost 90 minutes to watch an hour show. The problem was not the internet connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter S2","review":"Maybe I'm just over Dexter at this point, but I found this season to be dreadfully boring.

Goodbye sweet Dexter, I will miss you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Disc","review":"I don't know how else to report this because I bought it as a gift a while ago and the return policy has expired. But the person that I bought this set for just got to the last disc of the season and found that two disc threes were packed in the set. Now she cannot watch the season finale because there is no disc four. Just a word of advise, check all of the discs as soon as you get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i give this show 5 stares","review":"i love this show it keeps me on my toei have to watch the whole season in one night becouse its that good"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I downloaded the pilot from unbox to check it out given its high user ratings since I don't have cable. But the series is just not for me judging from the pilot. The inner workings of the psychopathic mind is a fascinating topic up to a point and is revealed through the lead character's perspective in his every day interactions. However, the images of chopped up bodies made this a show that I will have to pass on and deleted from my unbox player to make sure young children don't see it accidently. I like shows that are story-driven and about characters interacting. In this show you get some of that, but the body part props and blood are a turn-off as it detracts from the story for me to the point where I just don't want to watch. I'm also not a fan of those CSI type of shows so that may be another reason why this type of drama (violent crime and bodies) like Dexter is not for me and does not appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"still have not recieved","review":"I ordered this over a month ago and still have not received it. it was supposed to be here in a few days then I get an email that it wont be here until may fourth. now it is may 13th and I still have not received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good stuff, but showtime needs to can the advertisements","review":"My gripe is not with the content; rather it is with the intolerable advertisements Showtime FORCES you to watch before you get to see what you paid for. The normal menu-button and/or FF-key options are useless and you must sit and fume before watching each episode. I am sorry I purchased this title from such a clueless, undeserving studio. I will never again purchase a Showtime title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service","review":"I order Dexter second season, i waited, I had to e-mail the vendor several times, only to find out I woud not receive my order until 35 days later, I received a refund.

Only DVD I have this problem with."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series was never alive","review":"This probably the worsed season to make things even. Season 5 is gonna be great because hopefully they will end it. This show is so meaningless and lackluster its not even worth talking about. bad acting, weak and kinda of a spin off storyline of dark comic books like Spawn and Nightman. Sorry I had to put those awesome characters in the same paragraph as this freak of a show. If you want to watch something cool, even though I think TV as a whole is a waste of time for the most part watch Rescue Me; Dennis Leary is excellent in it and it deals with real issues real heroes have such as PTS, substance abuse, and depression from working and living in modern society. Also House is a great series. Very witty and suspensful, well the first few seasons were.just avoid this garbage altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better every season!","review":"Dexter is my favorite show of all time. This was even better than the first season and I loved that they mixed it up in adding Lila the crazy temptress. Amazing plots, awesome acting and a very guilty pleasure.

I heart Michael C Hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"i got mine right on time and the shipping was great there was nothing wrong with the dvd at all oval very happy with this purchase! plus great price u save 20 bucks! and free shipping!

Physical appearance, aggressiveness, and stature is nothing compared to mental ability, setting the tempo, and controlling the plot.A master of manipulation and control of emotions equal Dexter a master that Doakes finds out the hard way by seriously underestimating his abilities.Not everything in this world revolves around Title or Status as Doakes seems to think- in black and white compared to color. The tension between Dexter and Doakes was worth this series.Doakes character is well thought out and portrayed in proper context. Dexter's character is awesome in fluid transition and contingency mitigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Suspense","review":"Dexter season 2 is dark comedy at its best. You get a chance to delve into Dexter's complex personality (if he can claim to one) to find out what makes him tick. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever","review":"This has got to be the best series ever. At first I was a bit squeamish to watch a show that glorified a serial killer. But after the first seaon I was hooked. Through training from his foster father, he became a \\"dark defender\\", ridding the world of, well, killers. He lives by a code and never wanders from that path. He will never harm the innocent. This show explores the mind of a serial killer but at the same time looks into the psyche of us \\"normal\\" folk.The show is very well written, at times giving Dexter a sense of humor, albeit dark. The twists and turns of the second season had me so enthralled, I had to watch all the episodes in a 5 day period. I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next. In fact, I ended up cheering Dexter on as he was able to perform his \\"craft\\" while being employed by the police department as a blood splatter analyst.The show has made me wonder... If there was a person out there like Dexter, would it really be so bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter's Extracurricular Activities","review":"Terrifically entertaining, fast action, imaginative and, in some ways, perversely funny. Dexter has his own system of justice and, quite frankly, at times, it's hard to disagree with his logic, that being ridding of world of \\"scum\\". Dexter seems to have a look at his own issues and has the ability to separate himself from his extracurricular activities.He, like so many serial killers, carries on what appears to be an otherwise normal life for the most part. He shows care and nurturing towards his girlfriend and her children. They can count on him for protection and know nothing about what he does in his \\"spare\\" time.The acting is above reproach. Michael C. Hall has an excellent grasp on what makes this character tick and can even, in some ways, bring the viewer to a place of sympatico. At the very least, one can get a greater understanding of the psychotic mind, especially after viewing the relationship between Dexter and his father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy!","review":"The the DVD came right away.

Dexter is different, but high on the must see and then form your own opinion type of series list. Can't wait for the third season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show, poor DVD quality","review":"I enjoyed this program (although not as much as the first season). The biggest problem is the annoying DVD authoring. Not only are you forced to watch a couple of minutes of advertising and warnings on the insertion of each disc, but you can't even go from episode to episode without starting the disc over and going through the process again. Great if you like frustration, bad for normal people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is the best series I have ever watched (Sorry Tony, Sopranos just took second).

This is by far the best show ever. When is SEASON 3 coming?!?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter","review":"This is the best series I have seen since the Sopranos or Sex in the City. It only took one episode of Dexter to get me hooked. I hope it does not get cancelled like most shows do right when I get interested in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter is Delectable","review":"This sounded like a gorier CSI with an implausible plot, but it is nothing of the sort. The characters are fascinating, the casting is just incredible. You're rooting for and against characters all the time. Dexter himself is so fascinating, it's so cool seeing all of his layers. We can't get enough of Dexter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter loses focus","review":"Dexter's first season was pretty decent. His apathy and attitude towards life made the show interesting. In the second season, his personality changes into a regular guy who also happens to kill people. The killing isn't why I watched the first season, so this made the show uninteresting to me. You might call that change \\"growth\\". I call it de-evolution towards a stock character personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Second Season","review":"Actors in this show are ALL amazing! The story line never seems to get old and Dexter always finds a way to not get caught. And just when you think you might know how an episode, or a season, might end, it ends differently than you could have guessed.The writers of this show are so talented! I can't wait for each new episode and I purchase every season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: May cause knots in your stomach","review":"Dexter is better written, acted and produced than 95% of all television shows. And although I agree with some reviewers who say the story arc wasn't quite as strong or believable as seasons one or three, no season of Dexter has caused me more gut-churning anxiety. Lyla does become somewhat grating - but I also feel the same way about Rita every year.Michael C. Hall finally makes the character someone I care about. Don't get me wrong, I think it's almost impossible to create a sympathetic character out of a serial-killing psychopath who is incapable of human emotion. Season 2 is when I stopped watching Dexter as an awesomely written curiosity and really started rooting for him. Hall brings the depth in a super-subtle way and deserves any accolades he gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEXTER","review":"SUCH A GREAT SHOW! FROM THE WRITING, THE DIRECTING AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THE ACTING. MICHEAL C. HALL LAYS IT DOWN. HE REALLY EMBODIES THE SPIRIT OF THE CHARACTER HE IS PLAYING, AND IT'S QUITE EVIDENT WITH EACH SCENE HE'S IN. DEXTER I FEEL IS A UNDERSTATED, UNDERGROUND SHOW THAT'S GROWING THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH. THIS SHOW IS A HIT, IT WILL LOCK YOU IN FROM THE VERY FIRST SCENE. I WOULD SUGGEST STARTING WITH SEASON ONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO INVEST TIME INTO THE SHOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Lust","review":"Dexter is a serial killer who only kills people that need killing. Child molesters and killers who have gotten off on a technicality are Dexter's targets, so we actually get to forgive him for his crimes. This second season is fantastic and we look more at his sister's character and her relationships. The best of the entire season is his psycho AA sponsor, Lila. She is fascinating enough to have her own TV series. Even if you have to fast forward through the blood and guts scenes, this series still has enough good acting and writing to make it worth watching. Power Path to Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the garbage out","review":"This is one of my favorite series. I like the way in which you \\"hear\\" what he is thinking and how he comes to his conclusions. The series is highly entertaining. (I think the subject matter is not suitable for children under the impressionable age of 18.) Nice thing about this show is there is very little \\"gore\\". Things are implied and shown in a very tasteful manner. 5 stars all the way! Wish we had more real Dexter's in the world. I do endorse what the character is doing........cleaning up the trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Dexter","review":"I am so glad I preordered this set from Amazon.This second season is great!

My only question now is whether I liked the first or second season better. In my opinion, this is some of the best written film on TV right now. The story line is not predictable and I found myself in constant suspense. I'm not going to give anything away, but Dexter faces some steep challenges in this season, definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dearly Deadly Dexter","review":"I am a fan of Dexter! Why? I don't understand it, but I'm absolutely hardly able to wait for the third season to begin......yeah it happens this month.Now about the second season, I was wondering how they could top season one but they did it.....in spades. I am completely into the series and this is pretty much a first for me, I always loose interest in a series long before one season is over.

If you have never watched Dexter, then purchase the 1st season and I will bet you that you will come back to order the 2nd season before HBO begins the 3rd.

Dexter Morgan is the nicest serial killer on the block, eating his favorite Cuban sandwiches, bowling with his colleagues, spending time with his lovely girlfriend and her adorable kids.... and dismembering evil doers.Season two is stronger, funnier, and more thought-provoking than the first. Dexter is struggling to maintain his cover with his co-worker Seargent Doakes tailing him constantly.His homelife gets complicated when girlfriend Rita, sure that Dexter is hiding something, is convinced that Dexter is a drug addict. In rehab Dexter meets the darkly volatile Lila who just might see the real Dexter.Things get even worse when his body stash is discovered and Dexter himself is drawn into Miami Metro's investigation of the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\". With fantastic acting and writing, Dexter continues to be one of the most addicting and exciting shows on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball letters","review":"A collection of letters pertaining to baseball from players, pop stars, and politicians.

No dryness, or sting, very soft going on. And I felt by lips looked fuller."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising!!!","review":"I just purchased this product and am sorry I did. For the $38.00 I paid I could have bought 4 of my favorite lip glosses from my local drug store. I am 37 and have relatively full lips and was inticed by the advertising that this product would give my lips a fuller appearance. This product did nothing..I exfoliated my lips well and applied the gloss as directed I did feel a numbing effect and the color was pretty but did not get the advertised fuller/plumper lips. If Lipfusion was so confident in their product they would offer a money back guarantee! That being said they would probably go out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plumping","review":"I can't believe this company has the nerve to set a price of $38. Amazon had it for $10.59 and I got it with some other alleged plumpers of about the same price to try it out. The current price is $21 -- just ridiculous. It is a pretty lip gloss with a slightly sweet taste. It licks off easily so it doesn't last long. It has no other effect, but the company includes a long information page in many languages with purportedly scientific details and the fact that you'll get best results when it's used in combination with several of their other products. Incredible. I don't give it one star because I save that for products that actually cause harm or are extraordinarily displeasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best product for your lips !!!","review":"This is great for dry lips to get better really fast, and after couple of applications lips heal super nice.

Women dont get it, PLZZZ Stop we men dont care about this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Taste","review":"This particular color has a very bad fragrance and flavor to it. I don't know why, but it does. I won't be using this color. The actual gloss is fine, it goes on smooth, looks nice, but the smell and the taste will prevent me from using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Didn't experience any difference in lip texture, plumping, moisture, nothing. Tingly? Yes. Anything beyond that? No. Could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off. Applied it, left it on as long as possible but eventually had to remove what was left before applying lipstick. Applied at night before bedtime. No noticeable difference for me. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"lipfusion","review":"I with the lady who said this is a waste of money. If you are looking for a nice color with a shine lipstick go to a store, and get a nice one for a lot less. I was looking for the plumping, and there wasn't any."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWAK!","review":"I love Sephora's Lip Fusion. It glides on easily, is not sticky and lasts a long time. It has a pleasant smell and does not taste crappy like some glosses do. Plus the color selection is great.However, it doesn't do jack for plumping lips, (at least it doesn't for me, but that's not why I bought it to begin with. I liked the colors they offered). So if that is the only reason you're buying it, I wouldn't bother, you might be disappointed. Your lips will feel a bit tingly, but that's all. Sorry.... no Angelina lips.I buy it because I like everything else about it, plumper be damned!~ jade ~"},{"rating":"1","title":"very little of a great product.","review":"This product works as promised, stimulating a \\"slightly puffy lip\\" response within one minute or less... However, it is gone within about 20 minutes. So you will feel great walking out the door or getting a quick photo...but it doesn't last long. In my experience, a reapplication does not give the same response... unless you wait for a few hours or wash off all your lip stain or lip stick and re-apply. And, not much in the .29oz tube...for the cost.But it does exactly what it promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL WASTE","review":"This was a total waste of money for me. I wanted the best the first time around so I purchased what I thought was the best, but the only thing it was best at doing was absolutely NOTHING. If you want to waste your money, try this product. It will tingle a little, then you'll rush to the mirror and find that it's done zero for your lips.NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelf life","review":"This was obviously on sale because it's been on a shelf for awhile.

Both r good products for me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as promised","review":"Doesn't perform as claimed. Good moisterizing lip cream with a tingle, but no better plumping performance for lips than any of several brands already tried, some cheaper and many more expensive. Perhaps a topical can't really do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"too little results.....for too much $$$","review":"I have to say that over the years I have tried many different beauty products in pursuit of those lusious cushy lips all the celebrities have these days. From lip venom, to lip fusion, to celebrity sexy lips, all of these have given great temporary results, then after about 30 minutes the effect goes away and all I have is sticky, very un sexy lips. This product is also way too thick, which does help keep it on my lips, but my fiance HATES to kiss me with this stuff on. Also, this stuff tastes kind of gross so if flavoring is a factor when you choose your lip plumper then this isn't your product. My advice is to check out City Lips original formula its the only product I have ever seen any results with, and it won goodhousekeepings best plumper award twice, after month long testing sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Effect","review":"I used this product for over two months.

Even thought it kept my lips well moisturized and full, it didn't do anything more than the Blistex Ointment I use in the Winter and which costs about 1/30 of the price! It's just a good lip moisturizer. Needless to say, I returned it to Sephora."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Save your money. I only gave this product 2 stars because it does keep my lips from drying out like they usually do by the end of the day. But thats a pretty darn expensive chap stick if thats all it does.

I wish I had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"patience is a virtue","review":"When I first purchased this product, I was less then thrilled. No plumping. But it was a nice lip moisturizer. Over the winter, I started having some chapped lip issues, so I began to put the product on in the mornings before leaving the house and at night before going to bed, just as a moisturizer. I didn't even use it during the day. Low and behold, within a couple of weeks, I really started noticing a difference. I would have given it five stars for effectiveness, however, I feel like the advertising is misleading. It isn't a one shot miracle product. It requires a bit of discipline. I believe that the difference between those who get results with this product and those that don't may just be consistency of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"If hot and tingling equals plump, my lips should be obese...","review":"...and yet, they are not. To be fair, I don't really have what would be considered thin lips, but they could use a slight pump. So, I use as directed; I promise.

Good thing I only kissed him on the lips..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Femme Fatale ... for the music of Bizet","review":"Berganza isn't a tragic actress. Her bright voice is deprived of true sensuality. No sign of intensity, no \\"tears in her eyes\\". Only feeling's convincing - the hate: after her furious last \\"Tiens!\\" I understand that Jose has nothing but kill her.The vocal aspect of this interpretation is also sad: Carmen requires finest musicality and perfect voice control that Berganza can hardly provide. Her tempi are mechanical, accents - primitive, the lack of dynamic shades - fatal. Sometimes she produces beautiful sound, but generally lower register sounds rough, tremolos - not elastic enough, tops - screaming (last \\"tra-la-la\\" in \\"Seguedille\\" - just awful).Though Domingo's interpretation is as always excellent vocally, he can't touch me still. Cotrubas's charming, her musicality excites me. Chorus sounds wonderful. Abbado's button is uneven: sometimes - good ( \\"A deux cuatros\\"), most times - not (sleepy \\"oiseau rebelle\\", too fast final)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berganza is a bloodless Carmen","review":"I bought this a number of years ago and was terribly disappointed. Carmen requires fire and passion, and Berganza gives a carefully controlled and passionless rendering of the fiery heroine. Other singers are fine; I love Cortrubas's somewhat rough but expressive voice, and Domingo and Milnes are always fine. I'd say try the old recording with Regina Reznick if you really want a classic, or try to find one with Elena Obratzova --sensuality personified!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this piece is a typical case of Abbado's boring work. he sometime does impressive work such but you hardly see it. Carmen would be the ideal opera to start with but do not start with ordinary conductor. the best Carmen shoud be the two versions of Karajan's. if you doubt my word, just try listening both of them from this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring Abbado's usual work","review":"First, I want to emphasize that opera is a total work. Singer, orchestra and conductor have an equal responsibility to make a great piece. What lacks from this Carmen? It's simple, Abbado gave another boring job. If you want to feel real Carmen, try Karajan's two versions. I personally prefer the old one bue new one is more likelyh to be trendy one. I want to say one more. Afrer his inauguration with Berliner, Abbado is simply overrated. He is noting but a simple OK conductor. Muti is the best living opera conductor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite recording of *CARMEN*","review":"I agree with those who love this recording. Those few who don't, I can't understand. La Berganza sings a ravishingly beautiful Carmen and certainly no one does it better. Not Callas, not Price, not Baltsa and certainly not Resnik. Domingo as Don Jose is outstanding, and Abbado conducts with white-hot passion. This recording made in 1977 has aged extremely well, the sound is far better than the cavernous Karajan set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read my lips> this is THE BEST Carmen!","review":"Of the 7 recordings of Carmen I own, this is by far the best. I just can't understand the people who say that Abbado is incompetent and Berganza bloodless. Make no mistake> this IS the library choice for Bizet's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berganza bloodless? Oh please!","review":"Teresa Berganza is the greatest Carmen ever, period. No other Carmen has ever understood this role better. Berganza lacks nothing in fire. It's just that Carmen is NOT a pre-Pagliacci verismo opera. Regina Resnik recording is SUCH a vulgar affair, that it fully deserves Mario del Monaco as Don Jose. The only Carmen worse than that is Horne's in DG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic table, great price","review":"I shopped around a lot for an adjustable-height folding table before buying this one. I've been very happy with it. It's far lighter than the more common wood+metal tables. It has nice round edges and corners, which makes it safer with kids running around. It seems very resistant to marks or scratches, even with pretty hard use. And the adjustable height works really well (again, in my situation, it's helpful for the kids). I highly recommend this table."},{"rating":"2","title":"the rave on \\"all the rage\\"","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT'S FUNNY, SAD AND INFORMATIVE.

The author writes a one-sided \\"tale\\" of the agency, full of rumor, innuendo, and distorted history. He projects the purported colorful stories of several former employees and Berlin Base activities onto 20,000 other employees worldwide. I knew and worked with many of the named and respected persons in the book. He shows a lack of unserstanding of the intelligence process, chain of command, Agency mission and successes. He concentrates on tales of failure and penetrations, some of which are true, to the exclusion of the many productive operations. He does severe discredit to the thousands of agency employees who had dedicated careers often at great sacrifice to themselves and their famiies.

It's more like an extract of the communist manifesto, most likely aiming to stain the image of those who sacrificed everything for our great nation!Garbage!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and boring","review":"The first 200 pages are boring and are basically the same story over and over with different names. Just as in the editers review you get sick of the word \\"brillant.\\" He calls people brilliant and later in the chapter tells how inept they are. The word \\"and\\" is used to a great degree, sometime he begins sentences with it, for those of you who care about grammer. No real cool espionage stuff in here.

Burnham and Baden-Powell became friends ,Baden-Powell was a British Army scout. The British Army in 1900 was some 300 years old , I don't think they were exactly new to military scouting ![originated from the knowledge of game keepers on the great European estates.]What they did was exchanged 'notes'[read Scouting ..'.

Packed with passion and emotion, he maximizes each and every movement with fervor and despair. This symphony conveys life with all its ups and downs. In the end, you can imagine the nails being driven into a coffin as a statement of the grand finale and terminal end.

Every actor shows perfection in their roles.In a refreshing change we see the Civil War fought between,not strangers,but between neighbors and former friends.

Watch This!","review":"A lot of Civil War movies have been made over the years. Most are fluffy and politically correct and almost all focus on the eastern theatre (Gettysburg ad nauseum). Ride With The Devil focuses on the Border War between Missouri and Kansas, where the Civil War really began. No fluff, it portrays these Missourian's in the manner they acted. It is harsh, brutal, and unforgiviing, just as the conflict was.So if you are tired of the same old, rehashed over and over, Civil War movies, get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical? No. Good movie? Yes.","review":"Although Ride With The Devil is not the most historically accurate depiction of the Border War, it does give a good feel for some of the things that did happen. It was a horrible time in Kansas/Missouri history as well as American history. That was correct. The idea that some of those things actually happened, not so correct.

I've written two screenplays inside this historical universe so I've done a ton of research into this time period and specifically Quantrill's Raiders. This film does a great job of depicting the confusion of the era and the impulse driven events of the bushwackers. I do very much wish Ang Lee would have shown the Kansas City 3 story jailhouse being pulled down with the raiders' womenfolk inside rather than just telling us. That is what the passion that pushed the raiders to destroy Lawrence, Ks was about. It was also what turned William Anderson into the vengeful 'Bloody Bill' Anderson which was depicted as 'Black John' by Jim Caveaseal. The ommission of the brutality of that one event skews the balanced in my estimation. Anyway, it plays to good effect even if slanted North. Well written, well shot, well acted and brilliantly directed by the always wonderful Ang Lee. Tobey McGuire is at his best.

For guys it has action, adventure and suspense. For the gals, it is also a love story set in tragic surroundings. It is also one of the few films that stays away from the usual stereotyping of the Southernors of the 1860s. It also shows that Blacks fought for the South. And not as ignorant slaves. Yes it shows the bigotry of some. But, also that some Confederate Soldiers were against slavery. And they were fighting for states rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I was hoping to find an action-packed, Civil War-accurate thriller. FAIL.Slow and boring.

If this was meant as an anti-war movie, it succeeded as such for me, but I don't believe that was the director's intention.The cinematography is very well done, the acting is certainly favorable, and the character development is adquate, but the movie drags on endlessly. I'm sure this is an excellent composite of the skirmishes in the \\"border states\\" at the start of the Civil War, but I'm not sure what the message we can bring away from it is.Realism for the sake of realism doesn't justify the making of this movie.

Sorry, but don't see slaveholders in a good light. As a Black female, I will always root for the \\"Federals\\". It took another 100 plus years for freedom for Blacks in the South after the end of the Civil War, so I don't really see the need for movies that show the \\"humanity\\" of Southerners who fought tooth and nail for breaking up this nation so they could continue slavery.Anyway, this is not a movie for progressive minded folks. I'm sure there are movies such as Glory, which are not on the wrong side of history.Nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ride with the devil","review":"After viewing the movie I must say this it is probably one of the worst movies i ever saw! The movie was long, disjointed, boring, slow, hard to follow, and the acting was horrible. The movie didn't really have a plot either - it takes place during the civil war, is all I can tell you.

He spared Rhianna's friends from certain death, and he certainly was attentive to Rhianna. Readers should be angry with King Alfred, not Eric, because it was King Alfred who didn't have the stomach for a war with the Vikings so he forced Rhianna to marry Eric, to gain peace between them.It was a very strong betrayal of Rhianna because in order to keep her land she had to marry Eric because the King had given Eric her land to gain the truce.Ultimately Eric loves Rhianna very much, there is danger and intrigue from outside and inner circles, and it's a fun read, if you can get past feeling outraged at how little power women had over their lives in that era."},{"rating":"2","title":"I owned this book and lost it","review":"I had this book in a different cover which was probably a different issuing of it and like it a lot.

Yet this is the first Viking romance I couldn't bring myself to finish.The history is fine, but even the setting was not enough to keep my attentions. Something just doesn't work about this book.

Also, the obsession with Connie Francis songs, while intended to be clever, is just unsettling and creepy. Was it the author's joke that Connie Francis's music is terrible? Frankly, my girlfriend would leave me if I kept bringing up \\"Where the Boys Are.\\" For everything new and different about the book (focusing on a rarely seen Nova Scotia), there's an equal part that is laugh out loud funny (a Connie Francis fan club).

It ended on a tragic note but is a great book for Penman fans, history addicts and anyone Welsh. Penman's prose is addictive- once you read her, you'll read ALL her novels- they're just plain good. They all contain interesting plot, and characters, which is all the more fascinating because it's all true!

The story was a protracted agony, as the reader will perceive (or run to Wikipedia) for the history. I am forever amazed at her sympathetic characterization of men, while her women seem to be on the shallow, brittle side. Of course they may also be victims of an era and class that so limited the scope of their choices.

While Lindsey is not the adventurer that her parents are, she still shows a wealth of courage. Her temper and knack for arguing shows that she is a true daughter of her parents and when she comes up against Ryan it is like watching fireworks. It was great to get re-acquainting with Andre and Devon and see how their love has evolved. I loved the beginning scenes where Andre Raveneau, Alec Beauvisage and Lion Hampshire and their wives come together and talk about their families, catches you up on the Beauvisage and Raveneau offspring, I wish there had been more. I loved the romantic tension between the Ryan and Lindsey, and the way Devon has to deal with the budding romance, is so traditionally mothering. I totally loved figuring out who the spy was and I truly hope that leads to more Raveneau books. Another wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for potty resistors & older trainees","review":"This book helped with my potty resistant older child. There aren't a lot of sources out there for such a situation. But this book helped tremendously. We tried practically every method to train our child over the course of 18 months but she simply refused. Once we applied several ideas in this book, it was like a different child (more like a different parent/trainer).Admittedly, I had to read this book several times before things actually clicked. But the bottom line was, this book (and 'The No Cry Potty Training Solution') gave me the ability to \\"create\\" a potty plan that worked for our child.I wished I found this sooner.

This advice for women is coming from someone who understands finances in a global way. I liked her new approach to budgeting--it's fresh.

But if you get the chance, at least listen to the opening of the second movement. I swear, I never heard the drum roll and low pizzicato actually MEAN something here before. This isn't a race through the woods - this is damned serious.

After reading several of Rollins' previous novels (and raving enough about them to friends!), I started this novel off by thinking I was almost guaranteed a great read. Not so. The characters were insipid and uninspiring---I couldn't care less what happened to any of them---and the plot line was just plain ludicrious. While there is some suspension of belief needed as a requirement to his novels, this one went over and beyond acceptable levels. Buckyballs in the blood? Antimatter? Invisibility? And what happened to those terrific cliff-hanging chapter endings? This novel was a waste of time and money. BOOoooooooooring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is just plane boring. I gave up after 300 pages I couldn't take it anymore. This is my 3rd Rollins book and it's my last. What's wrong with this book? The plot, the charachters and the tempo of the book, nothing works here. There are to many good books out there so don't waste your time on this one. The only cool thing about this book is the 3D cover and it's not worth $7.99"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I'm not done yet but this book is fast paced and hard to put down.

(fictition of course)This book is the first book of Rollins that get's deeper than deep with his charictars, all of them, including the antagonist's. This book is one of the longest of Jims but keeps your attention through his tantalizing story-line and his (should be) award winning use of writing facts that don't bore you to death!

Rollins does a very good job of merging aspects of archeology (in this case the search for a legendary lost city) with technology equipped and savvy \\"super-spooks\\", and the elements of a really good mystery. This is the 7th novel containing the above combination of the Sigma Force series I have read.

I know it was meant to be exciting but it all could have been said in 200 pages, max! My kingdom for a clean, concise, exciting novel. Books are a form of escape and it would be nice to escape from the coarse language we're forced to listen to in movies and now on television.

Until then, I guess the one-star rating will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rollins is Falling...","review":"After writing such good science faction like Amazonia, Rollins has devolved into writing this bad piece, with a highly unbelievable storyline, an even more unbelievable plot, and the characters are again paper mannequins.Sandstorm is the story of the lost city of Ubar, with which the famous Queen of Sheba is also involved somehow. The story has some imaginative typical Rollins action sequences and nature-borne-surprises, but overall the story fails to elicit the kind of response that his other books have done.The cliche factor is a little toned down in spoken words, but not as far as stereotypical characterization is concerned. Rollins should seriously consider revamping his thought process, and introducing someone a little fresh and original in his stories.overall, no more than 1.5 / 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"much too wordy","review":"The basic plot and characters are fine, for an action/semi-science fiction book. But the writing style is awful in many places. Action scenes are bogged down by excessive detail. Characters stop in the middle of action to muse on some past experience, and the same memories are repeated throughout the book. Information is repeated in successive chapters, as though the reader will have forgotten what she read twenty pages ago. The book needed to be edited down to no more than half its length, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic Dribble & Poorly Written","review":"I just finished this audiobook.

Second the continous ramantic 2nd class dribble is beyond endurence for the listener. Old five cent love novels have better dialog. The over the top lines and the constant need to present contrived romance is stupid. If you have half a brain buy a comic book, it'll be better written. Also the abridged audio is only 6hrs long.

A combination of a lot of different genres.If you like adventures like Indiana Jones or books by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child you'll love this. I mention Preston and Child because like them, Rollins uses alot of different tools and settings in his stories. They never stay rooted in one place, or cover just one theme.And like Preston and Child, his books might seem a little 'out there', scientifically speaking, but he always bases his stories WITH science as a means of making them more beleivable.Great action, lots of likeable (and loathesome) characters, some historical facts, science, comic releif, and romance make this book a definite great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken by storm","review":"Sandstorm kicks off a great series of books.

The action is fast and the characters are three-dimensional. Rollins' suspension of disbelief is artfully done and his research paid off as the book is filled with accurate scientific facts. If you like Dan Brown, Clive Cussler, Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child novels then you will simply love this! I cannot recommend it highly enough for any fiction reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"Wow I thought this was well written and a real page turner. I guess the number of negative reviews surprised me.

Ice Hunt will be next.I liked the good guys and hated the bad guys and I thought there were thrills in the thriller. I thought the characters, good and bad, were respectfully portrayed.

So naturally, I had high hopes for this book. In this book, he tackles the subject of \\"antimatter,\\" in a way thats not at all in the \\"Star Trek\\" fashion. But instead, he grounds it within the main characters and story line - something most people can relate to (assuming you are familiar with the subject of antimatter). Overall, this book is quite entertaining, with the ending especially well done. However, the set up could use some more originality (Da Vinci Code flashbacks) and some more scientific conjectures (perhaps Mr. Rollin's physics background is not as strong as his biology background.)

I know there MUST be people out there with first names of Painter, and Omaha, and Coral. I just haven't met them yet. But to have every freakin' significant character show up with a wacko name is just too much for me. (OK, there was \\"Kara Kensington\\", but doesn't that sound a lot like \\"Lois Lane\\"?) All the women are beautiful and angst-ridden, waiting for a Real Man to straighten them out. Please. This is a long comic book, except the art work sucks.I give it two stars because Rollins spelled most of the words correctly and none of the pages fell out of the bindings while I was reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this audio version","review":"Let me start by saying this is a review of the Audiobook version, which unfortunately is an abridged version of this book. I was pretty disappointed. I enjoyed \\"Amazonia\\" and loved \\"Black Order\\" -- both as unabridged audiobooks (I have a long commute!). But this story and, especially, the actor were abysmal. Most audiobook actors make an effort to switch accents, tone of voice from character to character (listen to to \\"Black Order's\\" reading for a top-notch example of this). But in this story, all of the characters sound alike and the tempo is hurried. Plus, the abridgement must be amiss (or at least, I hope it's the abridgement, not Rollins' weak story) because things often don't make sense and you are left feeling like you missed too many details. Omaha Dunn is a major character? I wouldn't have known from this version. I feel cheated, like I was rushed through a journey I had been looking forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Read","review":"I bought the books weeks ago and still haven't gotten through it.

Now I'm not really a reader, the type my friends would laugh & joke if I mentioned, but the Sigma books or so good. After reading a few I had to back & read the book that started it all. Though none of my favorite characters are in it, it's good to understand the root of it all. The book is suspenseful & keeps moving. Action packed with plenty of twist. I like how James Rollins will talk the truth in things & stretch them, mend them or form them in his way to shape a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you buy a Rollins book, don't buy this one first!","review":"This is just not usual Rollins form. I got half way through the book before giving up on it. This is in stark contrast to all James Rollins' other books which I go out and buy as soon as they're available. In all his other books I find them very very difficult to put down. They are typically full of action and real page-turners. Sandstorm was very disappointing in this respect. Perhaps something interesting happens later in the book but when you bore yourself getting half way through a book it becomes a gamble to read the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one.","review":"I liked \\"Map of Bones' so much, that during the final reading, I bought; Amazonia, Sandstorm and Ice Hunt. I loved Amazonia. BUT SANDSTORM MISSES THE MARK. I'm on page 213 and have finally given up on this one. The whole first part of the book I have waited for it to take off. It is barely on the tarmac. I like the writings of James Rollings, but this one, for me, was a waste of $8.00 (Yes, I pay full price for my books).

Then, the love story. Then the asexual reproduction. Plus, everything started getting repetitive. James Rollins, PLEASE stop putting love stories in your books. It's not your forte and it ruined both this book and Black Order. Honestly, if the completely unbelievable stuff, like going invisible or asexual reproduction had happened in the beginning, I would have put the book down right there. Same with the cheesy love story. This book started out as a potential new favorite for me (I love Indiana Jones style adventure), then it just turned into a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed","review":"Good idea but poorly executed.

Everything RJ did with blueprint was amazing. I'm just not feeling this album. It sounds like something that would get lots of radio play in the 80's. There is no hip hop or turntables or guest appearances by skilled emcees. What there is is horrible voice samples and elevator beats. Track 1-4 are tolerable but I can't even listen to the rest of the album, in fact i think that track 5 is one of the worst songs ever put together.

I had no idea that the music itself would be so similar.There should be no duplicity in the fact that \\"Since We Last Spoke\\" is far from the sort of hip hop most have come to expect from RJD2 and Def Jux. That being said, I still cannot say this is a bad album. It is fantastic record to simply put on your headphones and get lost in, like a Massive Attack record for example. Far from being \\"elevator music\\", it is a liquid soundscape that proves hip-hop DJs can provide more than loop a simple \\"boom-bap\\" of a beat.I would be a fool to say that RJ is the first to try and demonstrate the potential of a hip-hop DJ, however, RJ has succeeded in this endeavour where others (like Prefuse 73) have failed.Dead Ringer was better (slightly) but definitely a four-star effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"KFC in SLC","review":"This book provides great insight into the real story behind KFC.

Instead, he gives simple, direct advice on how to act on camera. Indeed, this book might be subtitled, \\"Film Acting, the First 100 Mistakes and How to Avoid Them.\\" Funny, informative, and extremely practical. Strongly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting read","review":"I read this book on a whim, I thought it would be very insightful to get an insider's view of the movie business. This truly is a very intriguing read. Caine talks about such things as how to act differently in a closeup as opposed to a master shot, how to deal with difficult directors, and maintaining the same emotional intensity from one shot to the next. The writing style is very easy to read, and Caine has many humerous anecdotes to share along the way. It's also a very quick read, I think I finished this book in under two hours. Really, that's the only flaw in the book. The reader is left wanting the book to continue, to go more in depth. But even as it is, brief and to the point, it is a very engaging read and I recommend this to all actors wanting to do film, and to anyone interested in a film actor's process."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are interested in acting in film, buy this book.","review":"Great stories, funny situations, and excellent advice round out what should definitely be on every aspiring actors book-list.

I bought this on a whim, and I'm pretty sure it's one of the few (if not the only) successful blind book purchase(s) I've made (Da Vinci Code, anyone? blegh). I read it straight through from start to finish, and will probably reference back to it in the future. Whether you are an actor or just interested, this book is great, from a great. I gotta say, Michael Caine is pretty extraordinary and consistent. Then again, I suppose he could have written a pamphlet on hard drive installation and it would be every bit as truthful, direct, and easy to read. Michael Caine knows the film business, he knows what he is talking about. I learned so much from reading his book. This is the type of book that I could continue to read and discover great treasures each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Informative Read","review":"I believe this would make a welcome addition to any aspiring actor's book collection.

The music is non-stop and definitely sets the spooky and intense atmoshpere. After the first cut, \\"Transformation\\", an all out thriller about a guy turning into a werewolf, my two favorites were \\"Quite Child\\" and \\"Parasites\\".

Good stories, but it left me wanting more.. gonna have to get the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-Hearted British Comedy","review":"The selling point for \\"The Naked Truth\\" is that it features a young Peter Sellers. Truth be told this is more of an ensemble effort and not what you would call a break-out role for Sellers. Sellers as a \\"Scottish\\" television personality is given the opportunity to employ a number of disguises and voice characterizations that are amusing but not fitfully so. The film's central premise of a group of prominent Brits who conspire to dispatch a blackmailing tabloid publisher(Dennis Price of \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\") is played more for broad slapstick than for the macabre dark comedy of classic Ealing comedies. These observations aside this is a highly enjoyable film with a good laugh quotient. Solid cast also includes the irrepressible Terry-Thomas and Shirley Eaton(\\"Goldfinger\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"sense of humour","review":"The best of British humour.

I have the complete cycle of Beethoven's piano concertos performed by Pollini and the VPO, and was eager to get his performance of the Choral Fantasy. I have not been dissapointed. The tone is crystal clear (from both the orchestra and the piano), and the balance between the three distinct sections, choir/soloists, Pollini, and the orchestra, are superb throughout. I really like this performance. It, along with Brendel/CSO and Levin/ORR are my favorite recordings of Beethoven's most undervalued work.For the first work, \\"Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,\\" I'd recommend the John Eliot Gardiner/ORR version. For the sixth symphony, I'd again recommend Gardiner and the ORR, though this performance is very good, too.Great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warren Buffett - deja vu","review":"Mary Buffett's second book on her former father-in-law's investment techniques is a big disappointment.

In Financial Calculation # 6, the authors do a price analysis on Berkshire based on its equity growth. If you apply the formula to 10 years holding period versus 14 years you will get a different current price for the company. The current fair price of a company should not depend on your intended holding period. In that calculation using a 14 years of holding period they come up with $5499 as a fair price for Berkshire in 1986. If you change the holding period from 14 years to 40 years the fair price for Berkshire in 1986 (according to that formula) is $33,667.

My quest for the top of Mt. Rainier 25 years ago seemed like a walk in the park, compared to the peak of Everest.The rendition by Matt Dickinson was very well put to word. I see that his quest for the top came at a sacrifice to his marriage (as did Krakhauer in \\"Into Thin Air\\"). Of the three Everest books I've read in the past month (Krakhauer, Breshears, and this), Matt's book seemed more \\"down to earth\\". Sharing his passion for photography, I could relate to him more than the other two. Althoug I like Breshears technical dissertations of his IMAX filming.The only fault about his book was that is was too short. I would imagine after having reached Everest, everything else would be anti-climactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, another one - still holding the interest","review":"I read this after Krakauer and Boukreev's stories, and found it every bit as gripping.

Yet at the same time, I felt that there were certain errors and omissions from the text that detracted from the story. For instance, At one point Dickinson makes reference to Reinhold Messner as, \\"Reinhard Messner\\".I also strongly question the Author's judgement based on the account of events above the second step. When he (and the Sherpas)notices that his Partner Al Hinkes is no longer following closely behind. The two climbers had already made the poor judgement to continue climbing without fluids (Both men were carrying 2 quarts of juice that had frozen). Although things worked out in the end, I do not agree with Dickinson's decision to continue climbing potentially leaving his partner for dead.If the reader were to take anything away from this book it should be, \\"This is what not to do.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"He Can't Believe He Did That...","review":"The man who couldn't get up Mount Snowden, may in fact never even have been *on* Mount Snowden what with the rain and the dark and the half bottle of Southern Comfort, summits Everest!

Compared to The Climb this book is a little better. There's just no passion comming through from the Author. There was also much to much time and space devoted to the author and his relationship with his wife. I read adventure books(real or fiction) for adventure. I could care less about someones marital problems when reading a book about Mt Everest. The author also falls short in his discription of the actual climb as it related to his position on the mountian. I kept refering back to the map (within the book) to try to figure out where they were at any given time. In Into Thin Air you new just where old John was on the mountain most of the time. As Everest books go this one was not bad, but I don't think I will reread it as I did with Into Thin Air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another view of May 10 Storm","review":"Matt Dickinson may not be as good a writer (or climber) as Jon Krakauer, but he tells a good story with some interesting insights.

The only songs I skip over are \\"Naked in front of the computer\\" and \\"got that feeling\\". I love the keyboards in Ashes to Ashes and stripsearch. If you're a Angel Dust fan, you'll definitely find a lot you'll enjoy in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Title, But Not Very Adequate","review":"Despite some apealling moments that show this bands\` uniqueness and stenght (\\"Stripsearch\\", \\"Mouth to Mouth\\", \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\", \\"Ashes to Ashes\\"), \\"Album of the Year\\" is nothing special for the most part. The majority of the songs aren\`t bad, yet they never seem to rise above average, merely listenable material either. Overall, this record lacks personality and staying power, presenting bland and not very intense rock tracks. Faith No More can do better and quirkier music than this middle-of-the-road effort without distinction or impact.Not memorable enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the title fool you","review":"When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called, \\"Album of the Year\\", I got pumped. I knew \\"King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime\\" was a flop, so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track. I was sadly mistaken. This album, to my amazement, got very good reviews at the time it was released. I just didn't see it. \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\" was a decent song, as was \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", but other than that, I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs, most of them being more on the weak side.This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang, with \\"The Real Thing\\", and \\"Angel Dust\\". Two remarkable albums. I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things, but if you call Mike Patton's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music, all power to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Handfull of Great Songs . . .","review":"Some of which include \\"Stripsearch,\\" \\"She Loves Me Not,\\" \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and \\"Helpless,\\" but the overall album feels very lackluster and cold. Whatever spark FNM had before this had died off almost completely by the time they made this, and much of it feels forced, painfully at times.This is interesting when you consider that many of the songs could in some way be about the band coming to grips with the fact that their beautiful collaboration was ending, but not very enjoyable to listen to on the whole. (Also, I seem to be in the minority here among FNM fans, but I preffered Trey Spruance's virtuosic yet classy and restrained guitar to that of Jim Martin or their third guitarist.)Anyway, not bad or awful by any means, but the only time I've heard Patton sound like his heart just wasn't in the material he was singing, which is a shame indeed. He (and the rest of the band) called it quits at just the right time, for just the right reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"just finished listening to this cd. for the year 1997 it might have been album of the year... its a great album worth purchasing or having in your music collection... is it a classic?no. is it there best, or my favorite album?, no. but any faith no more cd is worth owning. mike patton can have u feeling all sorts of emotions with his vocal style. or should i say styles. anyways, buy this album.. also check out there other cds.. and mr bungle of course. patton is a manianc on vox"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible and fun, the Big Six perfects the new swing sound","review":"Along with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue, the Big Six deserves it's place among other new Swing bands.

Lewis and his writing.....but, after reading the Narnia books, I have even more respect for him and awe for his genius! I LOVED these books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S. Lewis is a master storyteller for both young and old.","review":"Lewis writes an amazing epic of the land called Narnia. The style is simple enough for children who will love the chararacters and the stories told, but the symbolism and meaning is complex enough for readers of all ages to enjoy. Reading these books as a child, I enjoyed the stories told, then after reading Lewis's book, \\"Mere Christianity\\" for a college class I decided to revisit this series again. I found the stories even more powerful than I did as a child. A masterfull work by Lewis that reads quickly, but makes you ponder long after the books have been completed. A must read for any child (around 4th or 5th grade I would think). This set would be a great gift for a parent to give. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books Rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great series for the young and old.Once I picked up the books it was hard to put them down!!These books are a semi-modern classics.I think that the best book that I have read in the series is the Voyage of the Dawn Treader.I like it the best because of it's Mystery and action.I agree with many people that they shoudn't change the series' order.If you you have trouble imagining the books, I recommed watching the video version of the books at your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could read them again for the first time.","review":"Have you ever read books that you wish you could read again for the first time? The Chronicles of Narnia are like that for me. I first read them when I was 11 or so. I'm now in my thirties and still go back to them to read and think about. They are beautifully told stories; all offer valuable lessons. My favorites have to be The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and the Horse and His Boy. I just sent a beautiful edition of the first to my nephew in the hopes that he will enjoy them as much as I have. If you've never read any of these books get ready for a wonderful ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"this box set is great ive only had for 2 weeks and im half way throug the third book","review":"this box set is awesome. the books are good and there is alought of mouments that make it so you cant put the book down. it was worth the buy. i also recomend wolf brother, spirit walker, harry potter series, the high king,captin underpants series,and all good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, esp. for younger folks","review":"I first read these in elementary school, and I've reread them this past year, after graduating from college, and they still grab me. These books are fantastic reading - not too heavy, and yet so profound.They're also great for reading with/to younger folks. My parents read it to me for my bedtime stories for a while. I can see this working in elementary classrooms.they're a bit easier than Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring, but they're just good to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged Audio Version cuts too much away!","review":"I have been a fan of the Narnia books for many years, and I had hoped to renew my pleasure in them through this audio version. To my great disappointment, the stories offered here are so brutally abridged as to have lost all their original appeal. They are reduced to the merest skeleton of the narrative, and all the delightful details have been ruthlessly cut away. \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,\\" for example, includes only one of the many adventures recounted in the book! Don't waste your time or money on these: both would be much better spent in (re)visiting the unabridged originals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For this boxed set only","review":"As has been stated previously, this is printed \\"out of order\\", that is not a big deal as far as I am concerned, I just read them in the order I want to.I was VERY disappointed in the binding. These books cannot be read twice because the pages fell out of the binding. I love reading, especially in bed at night. I read 5 to 8 books a week. I am careful with paperbacks so that they stay together for reading after reading after reading. 3 books in this series lost pages.Covers were nice, with the metalic effect. Would have preferred they spent the money on the quality of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the inside that counts","review":"The book was a little dirty on the outside, but everything else was great.

She has rated it a 5 star book. She has enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher has taken terrible liberties","review":"You said it, neilicus107. That the publisher would reorder these books according to their boneheaded idea of chronology is an outrage. It's no different from taking all the flashback parts from a book or a film and putting it at the beginning. I'm glad that I still have my old Penguin edition, and will be giving that to my nephew instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fantasy series for all ages","review":"This is a wonderful set of books all included in one volume. All seven of the Chronicle of Narnia books are inside, arranged in the order the author originaly intended. The print was clear and easy to read, paper was regular weight, (not like tissue paper like some lower priced books are printed on), and was well worth the money. This hardcover set was less expensive than some paperback sets of individual books cost. It takes up a smaller amount of space on my bookshelf and will last much longer than the paperback ones will last. Great set from a prompt, careful seller! I would purchase it again from the same seller if I wanted another copy for a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Doesn't Get Better Than This!","review":"Between ages 10 and 14 or so, I kept track of the number of times I'd read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe on the backside of the back cover--my hash-marks total 63 readings. The book was -that- good! The rest of the series is great, too, of course, it's just that the introduction really got my attention! As good as the movie is, the book really is better, and I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous books, horrible presentation","review":"The two-star rating is most emphatically *not* against Lewis's writing--the books are utterly and completely fabulous.This particular presentation, however, is hideous. Lewis wrote the seven books in a particular order on purpose--the first was _The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe_, _The magician's nephew_ was intended as the sixth in the series. (There are other titles that were placed in a different order than this particular set, too.) Apparently, though, the publisher thought that the fact that this runs out of chronological order would be too confusing for readers, and so changed the order around. By doing this, the publisher ruined some of the effect of reading the series in its proper order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Expected.","review":"I ordered this book a few days ago and was shocked at how fast it came; even faster than the earliest delivery date!The book is much nicer than I expected and looks WAY more expensive than the 23 dollars I paid for it.Great transaction and fast shipping. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia The Motion Picture","review":"The only problem I had with this was that there were those annoying \\"Now a major motion picture\\" emblems on all the books.I know really that's not a big problem but I could have used so forewarning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia - long live Azlan","review":"You got to read the whole book(s) in one sitting. I suggest reading in the Chronological order. Dont read it based on publish dates. For some reason, you can always reference when each book was written and then look back, but it helps keeps your \\"chain-links\\" in order. I am a linear person, and hate jumping around. either way great author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Edition","review":"I was initially wary of the quality of this edition after hearing that it was published by Barnes and Noble. With a previous B&N leather bound edition I had purchased the decoration on the spine began fading after only a few weeks. With this edition however my worry was unfounded. This is a beautiful edition that looks great on the bookshelf, a great value for the cost as it will likely remain in the family for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"Listening to the book in full theater format was very interesting and enjoyable.The only downside is that the presentation is an abridgement of the actual book and thus some information is lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent production","review":"Radio Theatre has set a standard for itself and meets it in spades with The Chronicles of Narnia. The cast is solid and gives a wonderful dramatization. The Horse and His Boy is our favorite, and it is best to listen to at night while you are traveling in the car, because the characters travel at night alot during the story -- of course, they are not in a car, they are on horseback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I have loved these books every since I was 13. i just love the fact that it's been compiled into one nice book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could they have been thinking?","review":"Really the only way to read these books is in their proper order:1 - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2 - Prince Caspian3 - The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4 - The Silver Chair5 - The Horse and His Boy6 - The Magician's Nephew7 - The Last BattleThis is the way they were meant to be read! I have no ideawho decided putting them in chronological order was a good ideabut they were wrong, wrong, wrong. You can't find them anywherenow in the proper order which is a shame.

I couldn't find a single Narnia book anywhere, and there were some pretty good bookstores to shop in.Back in the UK, i bought the boxed set and reread them., and realised why they were unavailable in a Moslem country.This book is really a crusade under another guise, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy being the holy warriors.The Calormen are the Moslems, and what an insulting portrayal is made of them.Having lived in the Middle East, and seen firthand the dignity and decency of devout Moslems, i wouldn't be surprised to learn that these books are actually banned there, and for good reason.I wouldn't want my child to read these dismal, dated, bigoted and racist writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon does not ship as promised","review":"I do not have this item, but bought an in stock item from them on 12/5/05......still have not received and have not been contacted by the company.

As a child, I loved hearing them over and over. As an adult, I was supprised to see how much of my world-view comes from them. Like all great literature, Narnia grapples with broad ideas about human existence. The children, who are the protaganists of the series, grown-up problems such as disloyality, laziness, dishonesty and greed. The utter reality of life in Narnia is almost overpowering. I think it would be depressing but for Aslan. The Last Battle (the final book chronologically), made me cry tears of joy. You should definitely purchase a copy and read it to your children, grandchildren or anyone who will listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, I'd give the series 10 stars","review":"Lewis' fantasy land of Narnia is second only to Tolkien's tales of Middle-Earth.

If you have read 'em, read 'em again.

Hopefully, they won't wait as long as I did to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"correction for the series order","review":"I noticed as I was reading some of the reviews that many people were upset about the renumbering of the books. C. S. Lewis himself told a child in his Letters To Children that he should read the books chronologically, rather than the order in which they were published. Perhaps the books actually fit better as published, so it would be best not to read them as Lewis suggested, but I suppose this leaves the decision up to the reader. But the fact remains that Lewis suggested a chronological reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic set","review":"This paperback set of the Chronicles of Narnia is a great collection for the no frills at a reasonable price.

To dwell and soar through these books took me to another world--Narnia. I was with the characters through it all and experienced everything they experienced. I still have the set in my book collection. When I am feeling I need to go back to a child-like state for a time; I will reach for one of these books and go to my other world away from the problems of this world! They have great moral and hidden truths within these pages so beware...you might learn a thing or two with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful way to visit (or revisit) the land of Narnia!!","review":"I loved the Narnia series as a child and bought this for my children (ages 5 and 9) as an introduction, hoping they would eventually want to read the books, and wanting to keep them occupied on a long car trip. We were hooked from the beginning! We ended up carrying the CD's from the car to the house and back again - unable to \\"put them down.\\" The actors did a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life and the narration filled in the gaps perfectly. I was worried when I purchased this set that time considerations would force the producers to leave bits of the book out - not so! I would recommend this audio series for anyone - whether they be a Chronicles of Naria fan or not - though some of it may be a little scary for very young children. A radio production is so much more enjoyable to listen to than a book being read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it 80 stars if I could","review":"Okay, words can not describe how much these books mean to me. These 7 books are what started my love for reading. I read them when I was in 5th grade, and I was one of those kids who loathed reading. But when I discovered these classics, I beame an avid reader.These seven tales take you on a wonderous trip throughout the land of Narnia. You follow the lives of a handful of children, and the magical adventures they play out in Narnia. They are guided by the wisdom af Aslan the lion. He takes the children on a number of amazing adventures that change their lives.Again, I really can't explain how influential these books have been on my life. My personal favorite is _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_. I truly cherish these tales, and you will to when you read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy Book","review":"The actual book was well constructed and journeyed with me all over California and Mexico. Being paperback it was a lot easier to read while travelling.The writing is similar to The Hobbit. A great fantasy adventure that is worth reading several times. This is a must read if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit. C.S. Lewis really nailed the environments of these books (the names of the talking animals are also great). I really enjoyed reading this series (in order) and look forward to reading them to my son when he comes of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this negative stars....","review":"I've always loved the Chronicles, as well as CSL's other writings, even though I consider myself an atheist.The thing about CSL's writing is - it's funny! In my opinion his observations of human nature are gentle, humorous, and NOT preachy, although he is a christian.The reason why this edition gets a \\"negative star\\" rating is because there are at least two changes in this new edition. Why would you change an author's published words? I guess to correspond with the movies, even though I seriously doubt that the thousands of kids who read these books in the original form were traumatized."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality paperback","review":"...The stories are classics as always - but this printing is on below the bar paper and covering material - esp at the asking price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T REORDER THEM","review":"you don't reorder what a brilliant author has written.

Dark skinned people worship a false-gods filthy, evil and destroying nature etc.Don't believe me read \\"Horse and his Boy\\" and the \\"Last Battle\\" and see how any non white people are depicted, this is a disgrace. ...I'm not sure if the \\"rights sort\\" of Christian message is being projected...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not received- by 1 star I mean 0","review":"Never received it and it may have been lost in the mail.

I really enjoyed the movie, so I thought I would read the story and get more of an experience out of it. Wrong. The books are boring, Yes, I understand all of the religious allegory, and I get the 'hidden' meanings. The story doesnt flow, it doesnt want to make you turn the page. If he could have used a little bit of subtlety in hiw writing it would have been better. EVERYONE gets it that the witch is BAD, but the author doesnt LET you figure that out. Over and over again he states things like 'the witch did not understand her magic; as most witches dont' Crappy, boring writing. I know its religious, and for some reason people equate that with intelligent writing, but this is not. Read something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificant rendition of these classic childrens-novels","review":"My first thoughts on receiving this book was \\"wow, this is huge\\". You've got to understand, there are seven full novels here with hundreds of illustrations, so it's going to be a large book. It's comparable to average textbooks in size and width, the illustrations are fantastic and the maps are brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole set of books just set in with another....","review":"When I started the set I was thinking it was just another one of those fantasy books. I found out to be wrong. For one thing I couldn't wait to finish the day so I could go and read the book. C.S. Lewis gets you involved with the characters so when they are hurt you feel it, and when they are rejoicing you are rejoicing. It is just wonderful how the events that happend in one book came back to another. I give the books two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved by the WHOLE family","review":"I remember stumbling across The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe when I was in fourth grade. My mother saw that I had checked it out and almost cried. She had read it when she was a child and loved it and forgotten about it. I read the whole series, loved it, and vowed not to forget it myself. Now that my 3 children are old enough to read, I am reading to them and enjoying the newness of discovery again through their eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia Chronicles","review":"A great read. I first watched the DVD. I read The Magician's Nephew and could not get enough. I wanted to read the entire set. This is entertaining for all ages. C.S. Lewis did an outstanding job writing this set. It was great to have them all in one book and to read them in the order they should be read. I highly recommend this book to everyone from 8 to 80."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Wonderful World It Is","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia - the audios were really quite good. They are each done by different actors. Kenneth Branagh, who I know from Harry Potter's Chamber of Secrets, did well with the story telling of the first book \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". All the other actors were wonderful as well. But the best, to me, was Patrick Stewart, in \\"The Last Battle\\". What a performance. He caught my attention. So very dramatic, very passionate and funny! Overall, I enjoyed it. And to me, it's almost up there with Harry Potter's audio, and Lord of the Rings audio with Ian Holmes, playing the role of Frodo. If you want to buy it go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, full of Wonder, Hope, and Love!","review":"This is an amazingly fun and hopeful set of books! I still love them even at my age - don't ask I'm not telling but my well worn and much loved childhood box set still sets in my library! ;)My one star ding is for the publisher and the book order. If this is your or your child's first exposure to these books I recommend they be read in published order not chronological order, at least where the two books \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" (published 1st) and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (published 6th) are concerned. The reason is simple, secrets that are revealed in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" lose their coolness factor if you discover them before you read the story of \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\". There is a big difference between the joy (and fun) of discovering new details about old friends (those you thought were so familiar) and learning about people and things you have never met and don't care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original masterpiece","review":"This collection comprises all 7 stories that make up the \\"Chronicles of Narnia. They are beutifully presented in hard cover and each story has the original drawings in them. The stories are pleasantly told by a master story teller. The language is easy that even my 12 year old daugther is enjoying the books. Each of the stories have an underlying christian flavour but they are so subtle that even non religious folk will enjoy each of the stories. It is clear that with Tolkien, CS Lewis was one of the great story tellers of the 20th century. I recommend this series to every one both young and old alike. My 3 children are currently reading thr stories at a great rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fiction I've ever read!","review":"As a lover of children's literature, I must say that these books are the finest fiction I've ever read.

This series is a must-read for children of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Narnia is a mysterious, magical world, stocked with mythical creatures, talking animals, and symbolism. Lewis was a master storyteller, and these tales are ones a reader never forgets. A must read for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I had read many of C.S. Lewis' non-fiction works and some of his other fiction, but for some reason had never read these. I think because they were for children.

The movie prompted me to want to read it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"classics, gems, masterpieces","review":"These are masterpieces of their genre. They are very readable. I got a boxed set when I was in high school, and read every single book. They are far deeper than the Christian symbolism some would say. Study the last book very carefully- he is talking about something Thomas Banyacya, the Hopi elder, talks about, a time when only those whose hearts and heads are joined will survive. This series has influenced other books, notablyThe Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 1: Charmed Life / The Lives of Christopher Chant. It has portals, the other worlds of Quantum Mechanics, there's quite a bit here, under a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very recommended reading!","review":"Love this book! You get all the book of The Chronicles of Narnia in one book! Very easy to read, and very compelling for avary age. It's a book for all the family not just for children!

My 7 year old son LOVES it. We listen in the car & he is always upset when we get to our destination because we have to stop the story. Very faithful to the book. The actors are great, & the music is a great addition. These are by far our favorite audio books. I'm going to order more by the same group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theres no place like Narnia","review":"I read the Chronicles of Narnia for the first time when I was in the sixth grade. I loved them. They were simple, had very nice endings, the characters were not only children my age, but in most books girls, and, above all, they made me feel both happy and safe.Now, many years later, I ordered this edition, which has beautiful colour pictures, and contains the seven books (in a different order) and decided to read them again. This time around I think I grasped how DEEP the meaning of these books really is, and understood why they make me feel so good!... Reading them again was like eating my favourite ice cream flavour...These are books for any age, beautifully written, with extraordinary characters, interesting sotries, and with a fantasy world that comes to life immediatly in your mind, and specially in your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I am excited about this product.

The author describes everything with detail and the books are exciting! They are fun for all ages. Again, these are the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"same as below: Amazing","review":"Why did they re-order the books? If you put them in chronological order you kill the magic and discovery and it takes away the challenge of figuring it out for yourself. CS Lewis wrote the books out of order and he discovered narnia as he wrote. The reader should read them in their ORIGINAL order, to better understand CS Lewis's own discovery of this marvelous place.Besides: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was written to introduce you to Narnia and the author supposes you don't know who Aslan is... if read out of order it will confuse the reader.this is the proper order: (not chronological)The Lion the Witch and the WardrobePrince CaspianThe Voyage of the Dawn TreaderThe Silver ChairThe Horse and his BoyThe Magicians NephewThe Last Battle"},{"rating":"2","title":"uplifting, magical, intriguing, wonderful, Magestic, FUN","review":"I have been reading these books since i was 7. I am now 19. you do the math. I have re read them so many times i almost know them by heart. I will never tire of reading them. these are the books you never ever pass on. you lend them (IF you are positive you will get them back!) but you keep them for the rest of your life and pass them on to your kids and grandkids and read them aloud to all of them. Rest safely in the Lion's paws"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure worth finding","review":"These books are well beyond the confines of words. I have personally read all of them at least once a year since the age of 10 and I'm now 27. They are so richly full of emotion that certain scenes from different books bring a tear just by thinking about them. After having read them over 20 times, I find them just as captivating as the first and also gain new wisdom and insight into life with each new read. These are a must have on anybody's list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine if you had your own magical world...","review":"Imagine if you had your own magical world that you could visitwhenever you wanted to...a world where you and your brothers andsisters were kings and queens...where creatures like naiads anddryads that you thought were only mythical really existed...C. S.Lewis chronicles the events of the Pevensie children as they stepout of a wardrobe in the English countryside and into the mythicalland of Narnia...a wonderful book for young readers, and older onesas well"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, but yeah - the order's wrong!","review":"I love this collector's edition box set for the quality paper, the charming, but homey, and now colored! original illustrations, and of course, the well-remembered stories. But I am disturbed by the numbering of the books in Narnia-chronological order instead of publication order - or whatever the order was that I knew as a kid. How can \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" not be first?! The mind boggles. It is on such small landmarks that we steer our little ships of faith, and ... I regret this shakeup. I'll never know whether it makes any difference to the first-time Narnia reader, but I feel like it must - the author's increasing sophistication and changing priorities must come through. Argh! I hate this theft of history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles of Narnia set","review":"Love the stories, but didn't read the product description closely enough. The books are bound together into one large book, so awkward to carry around. I would prefer separate books. It's also in the \\"new\\" order. C.S. Lewis had \\"The Lion, the witch and the wardrobe\\" as the first book (when the children first enter Narnia). When his nephew took over, the nephew changed the order and put the \\"Magician's nephew\\" as the first book (when the animals first receive the gift of speech) along with a couple of other changes. I prefer the original order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful set of a classic collection","review":"I'm not going to review the book content or stories themselves here. If you are looking at the 7 book collection of the Narnia series, you already know this is a timeless masterpiece by C.S. Lewis for children and adults.What I will review here is the beautiful publishing quality of this particular set. Each book is printed on heavy, high gloss extremely high quality paper. The print quality is superb and easy on the eyes and the color illustrations are numerous and well done. While paperback, the covers are sturdy and the book spines appear to be well manufactured to last a long time, a must as I'm sure my kids will be reading these over and over.In a publishing world where so much is made cheaply and meant to be disposable, these buck the trend and are well made to last and to be treasured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets expectations","review":"Boxed book set was in like-new condition; on line description was precise. Shipment was prompt. Would not hesitate to order from here again."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing journey by: DS from North boulevard school","review":"The book I am reviewing is Chronicles of Narnia The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S Lewis. This book is about 4 children, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, and Susan who hide in a wardrobe for a game of hide and seek and find a magical land called Narnia. While there she meets a horse man named Mr. Tumnus. When the white witch comes and takes him!!! The children go on an amazing journey to find their friend. I recommend this book to any one who loves to read. This book deserves four stars because it is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles of Narnia","review":"This is a great journey into Narnia. I enjoyed every book and every chapter. I know everyone I talked to has read this book as a child, I think they need to re-read as an adult and really dig deeper into each chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still as great as I remembered them from 20 years ago.","review":"I had this set as a child/teen but got seperated from them when I left home. Once I ordered them I couldn't wait to read them again. I got them three days ago and have already read the first three. Great imaginitive stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to read to your kids.....of any age.","review":"One of my fondest memories is hearing my wife read these to our three kids as they grew up.

Great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A big book for all","review":"It is quite a big book and every word is worth it! There are seven books in the same cover, it is easy to read and to follow. A book that is filled with magical places and people, lands of imagination and skies of infinity.A recommendation to all, don't wait until the movie comes out, I know that it already has for the second book (The Lion the witch and the wardrobe), try to read it thinking that you have never seen the movie, the movie is great but not quite what the book is all about!It even is a great book to read as a bedtime story to young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift from Narnia","review":"Purchasing the book set was the best thing I ever did. The color illustration on each book in the series sets an image in the reader's mind of what to expect, that is sets the stage for the story to come. The illustrations are very well done. My Mom started reading the books and enjoyed them so much, I bought her a set. The truth of the matter is, it was not only for her enjoyment, but also, because the books are something a person doesn't want to loan out to just anyone. On top of everything else, they're a bargain. They're truely a gift from Narnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrisian allegories","review":"I loved the Chronicles of Narnia first because they're great stories and second because they are great Christian allegories. I don't think they're literally meant to follow the Bible's story, but Aslan is clearly the Jesus of Narnia. If I had kids I would make sure they grew up with these stories.Another book that reads like C.S. Lewis' writings are the writings of G.K. Chesterton, especially a book called Orthodoxy. Another book, God Scent by James W. Miller, has the same kinds of illustrations to explain Christian thinking.The only hard part of reading the Narnia stories is that if you're used to modern, fast-paced stories, these are a little more slow, but not badly so. I think they added one big scene to the first Narnia movie to make it faster. Still, these are a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"CC S Lewis Narnia Pack","review":"Bought as a present for a 12 year old grand daughter as I read the Magicians Nephew to her. Of coourse she found it enthralling and would like to read the series so I bought it for her birthday. Has encouraged her love of reading as well as created a woonderful love of great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a classic...","review":"This is the third set of Chronicles of Narnia that I have bought for my daughter over the years. She is 19 now and pregnant and has reread the series until the books fell apart. Now that she is about to have a child of her own she wanted another set to read to her baby.This series is truly a classic that will be read for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty within Beauty","review":"This box set is beautiful and in paperback. Basically, it's cheap but quality at the exact same time. Totally worth every penny simply for the aesthetic of it. However, it is even better once immersed in the books themselves which captivate but can be read and loved at eight years old although they have a truly different meaning by nineteen. Also, rather than ordered in the numbers of chronological publishing, they are in the order affirmed by Lewis himself by the timing within the books. Wonderful and well done. Lewis would have approved and I approve of Lewis' glorious, fantastical, and unique work."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice set","review":"The book set was quite lovely. All the books came in a nice box but there were two details that bothered me, they were placed in an order that's not as nice to be read in as their original order and they put these ugly black circles on the bottom right corner of a couple of the books that say, \\"now a major motion picture.\\" other then that, great books, definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chronic-what?-cles of Narnia!","review":"I had this EXACT set when I was a kid. I think the art on the covers is the best of the bunch. I read these books 3 times through when I was about 11-12 and am now 27 and remember them almost all verbatim! The movies are going to be a blessing to all - especially those who read the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not a boxed set but one giant book.","review":"Was surprised when I ordered this that it was not a box set of 7 books but one gigantic book with all the stories in it.

I don't care to read very often & since I am a home health nurse I'm in my car alot. Books on CD are very entertaining for us folks on the road. I'd recommend this set to everyone! I saw the movie before I got this set which is what perked my interest in Narnia. I'm 35y/o & I loved it! I'm finishing up the last book now. I'm sad that it's ending though it's kept me entertained for over a month. (I did have a little trouble following the directions to my patients houses because I was so into the stories, oops!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian readers for children.","review":"These are book with very strong Christian background.Although they are nicely written I'm not sure I'd recommendthem to friends with different opinion about religion;instead, I'd rather go for Grimm's tales, or Tolkien's ringseries if you prefer the same genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The order does matter","review":"I kinda liked the first movie of the series. Kinda. I thought it strange that children should be given weapons to go to bloody battles. Anyway, since the vast majority of books are much better than their corresponding movies, I decided to give the Narnia books a go.But the first book in this compilation is not \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", is \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" and maybe that was part of my disapointment. Maybe not. What is important is that I did not like \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" and therefore could not go on reading. It is really a shame, they should not have altered the original order."},{"rating":"1","title":"modern marketing mistakes!","review":"Why do modern marketers and editors believe they know better than the author as pertaining to the order this series should be read? Forget these modern sets and go look for an older original set that hasn't messed with the author's order of titles. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first book! 1/2 the fun of reading these for the first time is figuring out that the timeline is fluid and goes back and forth, both in Narnia and in our world. I adore this series and was going to buy a new set for my young son, but have found an old used set instead because i could not find a modern one that was reodered and messed with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven...","review":"I never read these stories in my youth and maybe that's why I wasn't too impressed with them. Yeah, they are \\"classics\\" I guess, but I still found them very uneven. I liked The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader best. They were very entertaining and no so preachy as the others. I thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe to be a very empty story. It just ended. Bang. The Silver Chair was not too bad, but uneven. I didn't care for The Last Battle or The Magician's Nephew at all. WAY too religious for me. I can't say I recommend these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"These stories were wonderful! This was the first time I have read them, and they were the best stories I have read! I STRONGLY recommend reading them in the order they were written by CS Lewis - not in the order they are in the book. I think you would lose alot of the magic reading them in the order in the book. Either way - read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever!","review":"This book is exciting, fun and most certainly magical! I could't stop reading this book! When I went out to recess at my school, instead of hanging with my friends, I read the book! At lunch, after school.. I couldn't get away from it! This book is about two kids(a boy and a girl). The boys uncle is working on something in his labratory but the boy ( I won't mention names I'm very secretive about giving book secrets away!) isn't suposed to go up there. One day, the boy and the girl find a secret pathway in the girls attic. They (like any other daring kid would) followed the path witch was on the roof, and......Well,I don't want to re-tell the whole story so...You have to go out and find out what happens next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic for Everyone! Belongs on every book shelf!","review":"I read this series when I was a young kid, & now I am reading it again when I am almost 30. There is a beauty in the writing which is hard for me to express in words- you have to read it to find out. Even though this series is categorized as being for the 12 year old reader, I believe that is only because that is when the average child will be able to understand and appreciate it. In my opinion, this series is meant for anyone who can read and understand it regardless of age. It is a gem of a book and reveals the meaning of life without being pendantic and hard to understand. The only other fantasy/science-fiction books I would put in its class for quality and wonderful prose are The Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny, The Hyperion series by Dan Simmons, The Elric Saga by Michael Moorcock, Magician by Raymond Fiest, The Farthest Shore by Ursula Leguine, Dune by Frank Herbert, & finally The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Except for the Order","review":"Lewis is truly in his realm in the fantasy world of Narnia. You'll be amazed at how the wonder you experienced as a child will carry over into adulthood, as some of the more complicated symbolism becomes clearer and more powerful. Some may question the ordering of the stories in chronological order, but if this is not to your liking (and it is not to mine), then just be sure to check the dates and read them in the order published, starting with \\"The Lion, the With and the Wardrobe\\". And in addition to the great story, the illustrations are especially powerful and will further enjoyment of the youngest readers in your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless, Classic, and most of all, Enjoyable!","review":"I first was introduced to the Chronicles of Narnia by my aunt, when she reliquished her old collection upon me at the age of eleven. Six years later, I can still recount the wonder and amazement of reading The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe for the very first time. I was completely taken aback at the mystical and enchanted world of Narnia, and how Lewis' lyrical storytelling held you in for the duration of each book. I read the entire series (in their original, and in my opinion, rightful, order) each summer, just as I did when they first came into my possession. I hope to pass these books down to my children and grandchildren for generations. They speak worlds to people of life, love and spirituality. They cut through religious red-tape, and tell of the world as it is. I love them for their expanded, enlightened views and their enchanting stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book, thin pages","review":"This book is very pretty on the outside but the pages are so thin you can see through to the next page, very nice to have the whole collection together though."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!","review":"These books are a masterpiece! Perfect for any age. Even if you don't like the movies, give the books a try--they are much better! It's an easy read, but there is so much depth! There is much more to this story than the words on the page. I'm a Christian, and it gives me a new perspective of the hope I have in Christ. Whether you're a Christian or not, read these books! They're great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great packaging of a great series","review":"I was surprised that all of the books were here and the print was large enough to read.

There is no indication that it isn't illustrated like any other boxed sets that were ever printed of the Chronicles of Narnia! Nor does it say anywhere on the box 'adult' set. Also, it was sold where children's books were!I am upset that it is without the illustrations. I have personally read this set about 9 or 10 times throughout the years and have always enjoyed the text as well as the illustrations. I bought this particular set at a store as a christmas present for my daughter and I am very irate about the omission. I also duly note the price is much higher than for the 'children's version {same text with wonderful illustrations)'. I am taking it back. I don't like it and have already purchased a set with illustrations from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic listening!","review":"These CDs are great! Each CD is read by a different person and they are all extremely talented. All the voices are excellent and the characters really spring to life.

I would highly recommend this set, particularly to anyone who has not read the books-the readers will keep you enthralled and waiting to hear more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely","review":"Although I was sad that it was one big book, I really am happy I bought it.

Each book can be read as an individual story, but to truly appreciate the whole picture I would read all seven Chronicles. There are seven children in total who find themselves going to Narnia in very different situations. But in all cases, it is a magical trip. In this series you will witness Narnia and its talking animals being created, fly on a winged horse, see a young boy get \\"un-dragoned\\", sail on a ship to far off destinations, and of course ride on the Lion's back. I would recommend these books to any child between the ages of 8 - 101. C.S.

They opened a magic world for me, one that I will never forget. They translate wonderfully for today's youth, and always teach valuable lessons, while sparking the interest of the reader. Skip the movies for a while and read the originals. Forget about what you may have heard about the author's religious or political sub-text and just enjoy them for what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Narnia - HATED ABRIDGED form on Audio","review":"I have read the entire Narnia series twice, once while in Junior High, once later in High School. I loved them then, and I recently bought this audio book version for a long drive.What a mistake! The abridgement takes a story that was written on several levels and simplifies to only a child's level. I recall specific plot or character defining moments that were left out. I realize any abridged version will leave out details by very definition. However, this was done in the extreme. This reads more like Mother Goose now that the rich world the Lewis created for us.If you are introducing your children to Narnia, please get the books and read it to them. It will be a much richer experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set","review":"I loved The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe when I was young, so I was looking forward to introducing the Chronicles of Narnia to my 8-year old son. At first he balked at the idea of having a novel with few pictures in it read to him, but after the first chapter of The Magician's Nephew, he was sold! He looks forward to having a chapter read to him each night now, and loves to imagine what will happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Harry Potter!","review":"I have enjoyed these books since I was a young girl. These books have great moral lessons and excite a child's creativity.While reviews of the Harry Potter books say they're almost as good as Chronicles of Narnia - why get those books when you can have the original.Chronicles of Narnia introduce children to the lion Aslan. Aslan is capable of loving, forgiving but is also very just. He's not a \\"tame lion\\".These books whisper the love and forgiveness of God. They take a child through the depths of despair and into great hope and rejoicing.I have used \\"Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe\\" as a devotional in different Christian camps. These books are an ABSOLUTE MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book, wrong order","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia has long been a staple of literature that people truly enjoy to read. These are wonderfully written stories together in a beautiful book for your coffee table. The pictures amongst the stories are enchanting. The only thing I have against this book is that \\"Magician's Nephew\\" is first, when it should start with \\"The Lion the Whitch and the Wardrobe\\". If I had read the \\"Magician's Nephew\\" first, I might never have loved the series quite as much. Not to say it is bad, but it is more of history of a place you have already been than an introduction to the world. Everyone should read this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE LOVED THESE BOOKS FOR A LONG TIME","review":"I understand people's objections to this edition of the Chronicles of Narnia and in a way I concur with them.I have read these book over 30 times over the last 40 years and of course I know the correct order.The reason I got this edition is so that I can have them in an easily transportable form to carry with me.There is nothing better than the boxed set with them in order but for convenience sake this one is okay"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite children's fantasy novels","review":"C.S. Lewis is high on my list of favorite authors. The Chronicles of Narnia are among his best, and I was very impressed when I read these. They are very pleasant stories, and his talent as both a storyteller and a person of good character shine through. They are among the best children's fantasy novels and are a classic. I appreciate the Christian theme in these novels. He is able to weave that into the stories in such a way as to make a very good parable which helps children (and adults) better understand the atonement of Christ, and some other basic tenets of Christianity. It is perhaps not for the fervent atheist, but probably none of C.S. Lewis's novels are. They have an audience, and they serve that audience very very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical epic adventure for all ages","review":"This is the greatest series I have ever read. It's a broad sweeping tale of fantasy and the ongoing battle between good and evil. When I graduated to novels several years ago I thought that the books would be too juevinnile. When I recently reread them I found that they were just as imaginitive and rang just as true. My copy of the Chronicles of Narnia is now falling apart from having been read so much. I often wish that C.S. Lewis had written even more books,I love these! Thanks for introducing me to them,Mom and Dad And Aunt Gwen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure stories","review":"I like this stories very much.

My favourite is the Last Battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia is a wonderful series. Children love them, and so do adults. In fact, my father read the series to us as children, and then to my children when they were young. The stories are timeless, and full of magic, and interpretation is left to the age / beliefs of the reader. I have a very close friend who is not of a Christian faith, and she loves the books as much as I do. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good set of stories to relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any age...","review":"I loved the entire series. If you get this book for your child, it's a good oppritunity to bring out the christain aspects of the story. (There are lots of books out there to help you with this!) It was an enjoyable read and I loved how the last book ended. It was perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Can anyone actually say something negative about this C.S. Lewis classic? A great story for both children and adults as only Lewis can tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for kids","review":"I ordered this boxed set for my 10 year old niece for christmas and she loved it. It was an ideal gift since it is a boxed set and all the volumes are in one place. It was great to order a reading gift of a boxed set of volumes instead of ordering one volume at a time and having to remember which one the already have. The books are great for 'kid readers' as well as adults. This was a great way to get a child who is already into reading to read more and to appreciate reading and owning a set of volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA","review":"Magnificent!

I urge you to read these prodigious works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try them they way Lewis wrote them. . .","review":"There's not much to be said that hasn't already been said about this series. You just don't get any better than this. I must say I enjoyed the books much more than the recent movie. Although a beautiful production, I was quite disappointed with the movie. I don't feel the director got it. I recommend you read the books first AND read them in the order Lewis wrote them. The first time I read them I was a very young adult and I must say I believe reading them in that order does add to the \\"magic\\" of the stories. As far as productions, I recommend you purchasing the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre CD's. They are absolutely superb and captures (for me) the FULL scope of Narnia. And if you're planning a long trip with the kids, it will keep them captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the individual books","review":"I love these books. I've read them over and over again from the age of 13 and continue to read them now when I'm in my 30s. The only reason I wouldn't give this book 5 stars is that this book is really thick and a little cumbersome. I prefer the collection of individual books and would recommend those instead. After all, you can only read one at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made book. Perfect for story time with the kids.","review":"This book is very well made, very similar to a text book binding and it has become one of my family's favorites.It's a large book, with pictures, and my daughters really appreciate the maps on the front and back covers.The pages of the book have colored borders, and there are an artist's version (every 10 pages or so) that help describe the story; however, the art is not distracting, and helps to inspire the imagination of the reader.This is a great book to add to your library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read that keeps your attention.","review":"These books are all short and easy to read. They are not exactly pretty to have on your book shelf either. With that said these books are great for all ages. I'm 23 and read all 7 books and enjoyed them all. I would recomend these books to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics in the world of faerie tales","review":"O.K. The Chronicles of Narnia are children's books, but they don't have to be considered that way. If you are a Christian, you'll actually find Lewis rewrote the bible in a simple and more cheerful way, disguising Christ as Aslan and showing Israel as the land of Narnia, though this was not Lewis' original intention, nor does he mention this fact in the books. Even if you're an adult, its not hard to give way to the magic that surrounds these books. These simple stories are easy to follow, portray people we can all relate to, and are entertaining. Whether you are reading these book at the age of seven or reading these to your children at bed-time, you'll easily become hooked on the writings of one of the world's greatest modern Christian thinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this; it's also about the Chronicle","review":"Now, I have the chronicle in the ORGINAL order: The Lion, theWitch, and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the \\"Dawn Treader\\"; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; and The Last Battle. Do you like fantasy? This is SO for you! Let me explain. These ordinary kids are visiting another world! AND becoming kings and queens! AND SAVING THE WORLD. Magical animals. Centaurs, Unicorns, Pegasuses, talking animals, all fighting for their freedom! Now if that's not one of the best fantasy chronicles ever, I'm a fox!

I love to read young adult books with my 8 year old son. We each will read a chapter to each other. My 12 year old daughter usually will read the same books as she did with this one. The Chronicles of Narnia is one that is easy to talk about with your kids afterwards. There is pretty of discuss points and the books are very empowering to children especially young women.If you like these books I recommend a new author W. Thomas Richards. He has one book out the we just finished reading called The Calamity at the Devils Door. Dont let the title scare you. This is an excellent young lady empowering book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever mess with the originals!!","review":"The originals are good as they are and no one can change it's perfection.

The changed version makes everything so obvious! Never buy this, ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story good - poor quality","review":"While I was reading, the middle pages of the first book started to fall out. The binding wasn't creased or damaged in any way. Even though it's a paper back, I thought I would get a few readings out of the book, not less than one. I am very dissapointed in the binding quality.The story was great though - my daughter loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"its kinda dumb!","review":"On a personal I thought that the entire story line was kind of stupid. I read the book and then I decided to rent the movie to watch it... And I feel like they followed the book in a creepy way, Kind of when you being followed by someone you have no idea who it is. Unless the book I read was made after the movie I thought the story line was supper ...strange because why does someone go into a world in the back of a wardrobe and keeps walking alone with no parent super vision and she meets people that are not even close to being human .... At least she got her siblings to finally come with her. Having a mom that is a safety freak I have learned that this kind of stuff really bugs me! I really don't recommended it at all unless you like fictional weird talking animals that go to war... then this is totally for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 books out of seven is NOT a set","review":"Promised a set of 7 and only 2 arrived.The books were for a child who would have been excited to own and read the whole serries, now we are both disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD SET IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND YOU WANT IT AS IT IS","review":"I returned my set as I felt it was very expensive for a small and inexpensive paper back set.

I read this book when I was in the second grade of grammar school, and I payed close attention to the story of two children who were magically swept away into a deserted city. I remember that the city was colored red due to a dying sun. This was my first glimpse of a world far from my own, the first fantasy/science fiction book, and not my last. The Chronicals of Narnia are a part of the endless fanstasy of childhood, as enduring as Star Wars, as hip as the latest top ten. Moreover, these stories credit children with an intellegence. As long as there is a Narnia (pronounced Naw-nia, please) there is hope for the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic world of fantasy","review":"The series of The Chronicles of Narnia are amazing books to read.

REALLY...","review":"I'm a sci- fi and fantasy book lover, and I loved the series, and recommend this to all who love fantasy. One hint: Don't turn the series down because of others bad opinions or how you felt about the movie( most of the time the books are better than the movies), try it because it's a great series. The characters become real to you as you read and you learn to love the fantasy characters as well ( Tumnus, Aslan. and so on..). I loved all the books, even The Horse and His Boy which most claim isn't very good.

A set that was stolen from me, and I have missed them ever since. They were a security blanket for me when times were tough as a kid, and I have been searching for them to no avail. I guess my search continues. The set I got was nice, but the white box is a set from the 90's, and the set I wanted was from the 70's.

The books were not even from the same set so that the cover pictures aren't compatable. One book has someone's name written down the side, another is an old library book complete with dewey decimal system code on the binding and return slip in the inside cover. I love C.S. Lewis and all the Narnia books and others of his works and am glad to have my own copy of this collection, but I was expecting a better quality of books with a collector's box.

I'm one of those people who happen to love it! I first read the books when I was about ten years old and they have yet to grow old on me.I especially appreciate the strong parallels it shares with Christianity and Aslan's being a sort of 'what if' incarnation of Jesus in Narnia, as opposed to a mere allegory, as I, myself am a Christian.If you are not a Christian, however, you may want to steer clear of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader and The Last Battle, as these books have the strongest messages in them.This book arrived on time and the cover is very attractive, though it isn't suitable for travel usage. I am glad that the stories are done in chronological order in this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Stop ALL The Confusion..","review":"In order to get the intended story of Narnia read them in their theatrical release. At first, i must admitt, that i was confused as to why \\"they\\" (movie people and such)would release the 2nd book within the series, The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe, before the first, The Magician's Nephew, but afterward i thought of the order into which i was introduced to Narnia. My 2nd grade teacher first read LWW (#2) to us & then Prince Caspian (PC,#4) and so on with the stories containing Lucy and Edmund. Only THEN is it time to see the creation of Narnia, the importance of the lampost and other seemingly insignificant elements.So i would say that the correct (or less confusing & complicated) order of reading would be 1: LWW (#2); 2: PC (#4); 3: VDT (#5); 4: SC (#6); 5. HHB (#3); 6. MN (#1) 7. LB (#7)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifelong Love","review":"The Complete Chronicles of Narnia CD Box SetI've greatly enjoyed having these books on CD.

It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Edition","review":"Since the movie came out I have been interested on reading the books. I guess everybody knows that all these stories are great so the important thing of this review is how good is this edition. I've seen several editions of each book and I decided to buy this one because it contains all the books in just one edition. When i got the book I was very pleased with it not only because the stories are great, but also because the quality of the printing is wonderful.

Both of my libraries have all of them in there,so I can read them as often as I want to. I also own them. C.S. Lewis is a wonderful writer and a great thinker. I was so disapointed when I found out that he had died. I wish he would have had more time to write more books so I could read more of his wonderful tails.

My only disappointment was that I could not load them on to my computer to put them on my ipod for my walks, but I listen from my CD player in the house and enjoy every moment.

Well, last week I read the first book and it is as disappointing as it can get. The books seem to be writing even too simple for kids. They are so simple, it becomes hard to read. There is nothing special about the stories. The plot doesn't flow. I don't know why, maybe I was expecting too much, but I became very disappointing in the Narnia chronicles. C.S, Lewis can write so much better than this.

I read through the first one and found it nominally interesting, but not something that I would pick out on my own (I already knew the story from animated versions). I think I may have read half of the second one eventually. I was a heavy reader and followed lots of series type books, but in this case the plot didn't really flow for me. I think I MAY have heard something about a biblical connexion, but didn't think on that that much. It was only since a few years ago that I looked back at the books and saw how glaring the connexions were, and how the awkwardness with which a story was crafted to match biblical myth was the very thing that made it uninteresting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ******* sucks!!!","review":"I don't believe why this book is so good.

After reading the first 4 books, I started to dread reading the rest of them.It's true, these books do have a Christian background but being a Christian myself, I must say I would NOT recommend them at all.As for tolerance (as another reviewer, Robert J. Ruhf says we must all practise)....why should anyone tolerate racism and murder?! These books are full of it!!! Unacceptable! Sadly, we do live in a violent world but it is NEVER right to teach our children that it is ok to kill people as long as it's for a so called \`good' cause.Lewis's Aslan, who us earthlings know better as God is disgraceful! No true Heavenly being would call upon innocent children to wage war! What was this Author thinking!I wish I had borrowed these books instead off rushing off to buy them.

I had to stop, however, because the books are nothing more than advertisments for \\"Turkish Delight,\\" a candy popular in the U.K. The whole point of buying books for my grandkids was to give them a break from advertising, and here (throughout) are ads for this \\"Turkish Delight\\"! How much money is this Mr. Lewis getting from the Cadbury's chocolate company anyway? This man must be laughing to the bank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who changed time???","review":"Whether you are looking for a fascinating story to intrege a reluctant reader, a marvoulous family read-aloud, or a thought provoking parable, you cannot make a better choice than Narnia. I just bought my almost 9 year old his own set for his birthday, and was absolutely horrified that the publisher changed the order!! I showed my picky child the order the are *supposed* to be in by showing him the copyright dates, and he is reading them in the right order, but for those of you who do not know, C.S. Lewis published them in the order from simplist *story* to the story with the most profound philosophy. There is a reason the Magicians Nephew is near the end, and why the Horse and his Boy are 5th. The new illustrations are wonderful, and it is truely a treat to have a set that isn't dog-eared from years of abuse, but *please*, when you print the next run, *please* put them back in order!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing series, but they left out the best book","review":"Political correctness strikes again at Scholastic. Book 7 (The Last Battle) is the most obviously evangelical book, so Scholastic left it out.Otherwise, a reasonably well done version of one of the greatest fiction series ever written. I'd stick with the 1976 version or the recent one. They've got all the books, and the books themselves are better built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fantasy series","review":"C.S. Lewis' Narnia series is one of the best fantasies ever written. It is a rarity among children's literature-- books as enoyable and rewarding for adults as for children. An omnibus volume collecting all the books together is a welcome treasure; and this volume is only spoiled (taking it from 5 stars down to 4 in my rating) by placing the books in the wrong order. Don't believe the publisher when they tell you Lewis meant the books to be read in Narnian chronology rather than the order in which he wrote them-- that's based solely on a passing mention in one of his letters to a child who said she liked them that way. The truth is that you *must* read the first book-- \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" first! Fortunately, you can easily do so-- the publisher can put the books in the wrong order but they can't force you to turn the pages their way. So the flaw is a minor one in a wonderful collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening","review":"My two children, ages 6 and 10, truely enjoyed these books. My second graders really liked them too. They said they would have liked them a little better if the characters had the voices, like in the new The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I believe this series by C.S. Lewis is a timeless classic who can be listened to and enjoyed by people of all ages!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a FANTASTIC Audio production. The actors reading the books do a superb job: to the point that at times I don't believe it is the same person reading the different parts. They put such enthusiasm and character in to the voices and the readings that it makes the book come alive.If I have to mention a criticism it would be this: I tried listening to this on a stereo system but the volume variations in the readers intonation is too much. At times I had to turn the volume on the stereo way up to hear the softer parts of the recital and then it would be too loud.

She shares a house with two adults, two sisters, and one chew-happy puppy. Although she may later choose to collect the individual stories in separate books, this one-volume format allowed her to read each story without the hassle of lost and/or destroyed individual books.

I had heard of it, was vaguely aware of the story, but had never sat down and read it. What a wonderful read on several levels. Great kids story in general, great message for everyone. I think the series works in the order presented, even if it's different than the publish date. Each book is a great read in its own right, let alone as part of the greater story. These are \\"coming of age\\" stories in a very true sense, not only in a learning about oneself, but also in a sort of religious way. It is a highly recommended read in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best choice for avid readers","review":"My 9 year old daughter is a quick reader and wanted to read all the collection, so before going on a month long trip we ordered this book, overnight, and she brought it with us on vacation.

In this publication, all seven novels are presented in story order, not in chronological publication date. While many feel that this is not the proper way to read the books, I felt that it added to the whole idea of the \\"Chronicles\\" of Narnia, in that each novel built on the next and when you did encounter characters from the past, you already knew their backstory and it all made sense. A wonderful way to be introduced into the legacy that is Narnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do whatever you want","review":"This set is an amazing set of fairy tale literature. I loved it as a kid hearing my dad read it to us and I love it as an adult who draws on the spiritual parallels C.S. Lewis weaves so expertly. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who can read. Just be careful -- you'll want more when you're finished.Just a few comments on the chronological order debate: Who cares? You're the reader. Read the set in ANY order you want. I doubt you would get any lesser/greater pleasure from whichever form you chose. Why argue one way or the other? He happened to write them \\"out of order\\" but who's to say his intent was to have us read them that way? I have it on good authority that Lewis was FOR boxing the set in its chronological order. However, I don't think Lewis would care either way how anyone chose to read the books. The original purpose for writing the books was pure enjoyment, so bottom line: enjoy the books -- in any order you wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous!","review":"I loved the way the books were told.

To show complete despair, does it have to really be played at a crawling pace like that? Karajan's late 70's DG version is full of despair but is played at a fairly quick 9:50. Bernstein, especially in his last years, was very self-indulgent, and it really shows in this reading. Lenny isn't serving Tchaikovsky but himself. Tchaikovsky, I'm sure, would hate this beautiful symphony given this kind of treatment. The longest last movement that I've ever seen before this clocked in at about 11:30, so he's about 6:30 past that, which is totally freaking crazy!!! This is interesting to hear maybe once just to hear how bad this freakish intrepretation is, but most people wouldn't be satisfied with this kind of stuff.

It has a very strong, over-powering taste and texture which makes it hard to use in anything other than baking. It's good mixed into oatmeal or used as flour for pancakes, but it requires a lot of other ingredients/toppings to cover up the taste. I love that it's vegan, has great stats and is all natural, but I really don't like the taste. For me, the taste is pretty important. I won't buy it again.Has anyone tried the chocolate flavor?

While there are some minor technical issues (i.e., the author does occasionally use the wrong tense), this is an great read and very enjoyable. I feel the author captured a time in which things were seen more simply, felt more deeply, and judged by criteria different than the world view we hold today. I empathized with Alassandra. I could believe the frustration and inter turmoil a bright artistic woman would feel in the rigid structure of her time. Her confusion and ambivalence was a good metaphor for the great changes gripping Euorope in the late 1400s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificently spun Renaissance read!","review":"This novel is historical fiction at its best.

I thought it would be more about the history of Florence. Instead, it was about a nun and her sexual past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Fun Read","review":"This book is a fun, fast read which is hard to put down once you start. It has a great historical setting in 15th century Florence, Italy. The Birth of Venus combines romance, art, and history together to create a wonderfully written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I loved this book. It has the history, insight, and intellect of The Da Vinci Code, only with three-dimentional characters. The story is charmingly realistic but yet at the same time hauntingly and tragically romantic. The author is careful to make each aspect of the novel intricate and touching, while at the same time telling the true story of one of history's greatest cities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I wish there were more writers like Sarah Dunant -- Her writing is lush and beautiful. Dialogue sounds real, descriptions are vivid, characters act in realistic ways (not as caricatures), endings aren't always predictable or happy. Also, her work is well-researched and educational.I was enthralled with this book from the very first page (that's unusual for me) -- I loved it. I also enjoyed \\"In the Company of the Courtesan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable and Easy Reading","review":"With so many reviews preceeding this I need not recap what others have eloquently summarized. This story is well written making its reading very enjoyable. Perhaps at some points it seems somewhat unrealistic that the behavoir and/or attitude would exist in the time period. Overall, however, these flaws are tiny and the stronger points of the book's themes carry it admirably. I loved the interweaving of art, religion, history, and mystery (the painter's identity.) I wish some of the sexual episodes would have been written less explicit and more suggestive to generate excitement in our imagination. They seems almost crude compared to the beautiful way the story is put together. Fans of \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" will undoubtedly enjoy this novel; well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not actually about Venus, but still a great read","review":"This was the first Sarah Dunant book that I had read. It kept me interested throughout the whole book and am looking forward to reading more of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...up until the end","review":"This book starts off really well, a mysterious tattoo on a deceased nun, a fake tumor discovered on her body....then transition to a young girl in Renaissance Florence. Does she become the nun? Why did she fake the tumor? How did she get the tattoo and why?And while the main part of the book is interesting with it's various characters, allusions to world historical events and plot twists (c'mon who saw the wedding night revelation coming, huh??), I feel as though Dunant rushed through the ending to make sense of the introduction. My suggestion would be to read the book without the introduction and ending and focus on the middle part. It's a complete story in itself and make a lot more sense.Oh, and finding out the anonymous painter with whom Alessandra has been obsessed for her entire adult life is really the famous Michelangelo....was trite. It would have been better to keep him anonymous.Overall, a nice, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Birth","review":"I read The Birth of Venus with great hope, based on reviews. I found it silly, trite, a sort-of feminist romance novel. It certainly is a fantasy, not a book of developed characters or place. We have the heroic, self-actualized slave helpmate, bad sex and fantastically badly written sex, Evil-doers, and a precocious girl/woman. A mysterious woman-fearing man who is overcome with love for the precocious girl. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I don't think I've ever read anything so inane in my entire life. This novel seems to have been written by the love child of Joan Collins and an eighth grader who has just completed a dismal history report about the Renaissance. Even movies on Lifetime have better character development and plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Weary","review":"While I marveled at Sarah Dunant's masterful writing style and her uncanny ability to weave the time and place of 14th century Florence history seamlessly into her novel, I was let down by the story. The book's central character, Alessandra Checchi, comes of age, is deceived into marrying a homosexual so he can conceive a heir and protect himself against the inquisition, commits adultery with an artist, enters the convent, and commits suicide (because she was done). While I am not a pollyanna, I appreciate something that provides a positive message or at least has characters you can see virtue in. The story is weary and dark. Many characters are bleak and depressing. At each turn or twist in the plot, I was hoping that things would go the other direction. With that said, Sarah Dunant has great talent and I hope in future novels she can put her talents towards something a little less bleak."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all! It is SO good! It's GREAT!","review":"I just can't say enough good things about this book! It was SO good...it was GREAT!This was a book club choice and it was unanimous, we all loved it.It was juicy, sexy, political, historical...it was just so good.If you like historical fiction I really think you won't be disappointed by this story.Oh, but I do have to say that even loving it so much there was something that one character did that I didn't think she would do but that didn't take away anything from how much I enjoyed this book.I thought it was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author gives up","review":"The two stars are for the first two thirds of the book, which were sensitive, dazzling, and very informative about the city of Florence during the time of Savonarola. By the last third, the author seems to have lost interest entirely, and searched hopelessly for a way to conclude the book. The final third is disgusting, unconvincing, and totally phony. I put a red mark at the end of the letter to Alessandra from her husband, warning later readers to stop there, before being grossed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of Venus : A Novel","review":"I wish I could have given this one a 4.5. It was better than a 4 but not quite worthy of a 5. 5s are saved for the classics.Anyway, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It had more twists and turns than a maze!! Just when you thought her (Alessandra Cecchi) life couldn't get any weirder, it does.It's set in Florence in 1492. Alessandra is nearly 15 when her father brings home a painter. Since she herself is an artist, she wants to meet him. But unfortunately, their relationship is severed when the French invade Florence. You see, she told her mother that if the French did invade, she'd marry to avoid being put in a convent. She decides to marry 50 something Cristoforo Langella and soon discovers that neither Cristoforo nor the painter are who they appear to be...It has sex, murder, suspense, adultery, sodomy. What more could a person ask for??It's highly recommended if you're a fan of fiction novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I am a fan of Sarah Dunant, having read and enjoyed both Mapping the Edge and Trangressions, so I was enthusiastic about this novel. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The protagonist, Alessandra, is not sympathetic and it's very difficult to bring oneself to care about her struggles. The novel does have a few redeeming qualities - Dunant's skill with words and her knowledge of Florence. Her descriptions of life in Renaissance Florence are fascinating and carried me through the novel even when I had lost patience with the narrative. In fact, all of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Dunant is definitely a skilled writer but this book is not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressed","review":"It was hard to really relate to a simpering, self involved young woman who was supposed to be ahead of her time. While the prose does paint fleeting mental images of a period in Italy's past, the character development is lacking (perhaps it is because I purchased the abridged book on CD). I felt her suicide at the end was anticlamatic and very self serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Eating Too Much Candy and Then Feeling Sick","review":"Yes, the book was interesting and it definitely had it's moments. In the end, though, it wasn't really anything more than a guilty pleasure. I won't give the ending away for those that insist on reading this piece of pop-historical fiction junk, but it was absolutely ridiculous!!! Can I add more exclamation marks?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved some of the historical details, and parts of the plot were fascinating and had a lot of potential, but come on! This book is a heaping spoonfull of softback, catchy cover layout pretension away from being a paperback romance with Fabio on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Junkie","review":"I admit I'm an art junkie, and this book filled my hunger. I wasn't worried about total accuracy--afterall, it is in the fiction section. For me, this book was about women, how we want and need more than a man or a relationship to fill us. It is a book about need and lust of the most basic kind. The prologue is masterful, and yet I did feel that the end did not deliver quite as much as I longed for, but this is not a woman or a situation that can be wrapped up with a bow. Overall, it did what fiction should do--it took me on a glorious journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical aspect good; fictional aspect so-so","review":"What made this book an interesting read for me was the historical context. As a history minor, I love reading about the middle ages, and the author does a good job of describing daily life as well as historical events of a very interesting time period.Where the book lacked was in the fictional aspect. As with other readers, I didn't find the 'modern' woman aspect realistic. Unlike others, I didn't really find the sex scenes more graphic than those in, say, an Allende novel. They didn't bother me; it was just a waste of a few good trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth of Venus","review":"A very enjoyable read. This book gives insight into the life of a merchant class family in late 15th century Florence. It begins with the mystery of an old nun's death, and continues with her life as a young girl in the 15th century's political and religious turmoil. A great story of her life, her family, and her growth set into an historical backdrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"As wonderful as promised","review":"I picked up this book a few years ago, and just last week reread a few chapters to see if I still liked the novel as much as I did when I first bought it. I'm happy to say that it is just as good the second time around, and even though I had had read the book before, I couldn't stop myself from reading beyond chapter three. I finished it again, and I think the reason I loved this book was the vivid descriptions of Renaissance Italy. Few historical fictions I've come across evoke the Italian Renaissance with such beauty.The protagonist is an artist, and the author depicts her setting with a true artist's eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book from beginning to end. I think its a must read, but I have only one nagging question... Who was the painter? I know that its been hinted at that he was famous, but I can't figure it out. Besides that, the book was beautiful!! If anyone knows who the painter is email me at dianemolina1309@yahoo.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance Tale of Forbidden Lust","review":"Alessandra is a repressed woman trapped in a bad marriage with a much older man who at first seemed like her type but is really not at all. She begins to develop deep feelings for a young painter employed to decorate the walls in their luxurious home. This is a dangerous attraction that will grip the reader's senses. Strong elements of religious and political intrigue, suspense, romance, and violence make this an interesting read.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful visit to Renaissance Florence","review":"Recommended by a friend, I found this book charming. Having visited Florence in the past and being a big fan of Renaissance Art, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Seeing the world through Alessandra Cecchi's eyes brought me into the art and intrique of 15th Century Florence. I found the book interesting from the start and it held my interest thoughout wondering what fate would befall the precosious Alessandra, her family and the mysterious painter under the rule of the radical monk, Savonarola. If you plan to visit Florence this would be a fun book to read before going. For a more serious book on the Renaisance you might read Paul Johnson's short history \\"The Renaissance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect!","review":"From the prologue, I felt captivated by this book to it's very end. Wonderfully written! It was moving and fast paced. The only thing that may turn some readers off is some punctuation errors but they are easy to overlook with such powerful content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I generally enjoy historical fiction but I really just wanted this book to end. I thought the setting was interesting but at times lengthy descriptions just made the book dull. I could have done without much of the graphic and explicit scenes (over the top - we get the idea without that kind of detail.)Parts of it were more engrossing and encouraged me to read on but honestly it got boring and drawn out in the middle and the ending seemed so ridiculous to me.Just me $ .02 worth.P.S. If you'd like a good historical fiction novel try City of Lights set in Buffalo N.Y. at the turn of the century."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!!!","review":"I don't usually expect much from a book on the best seller list and only picked this one up becuase I am a sucker for pre-17th century historical fiction - so I was thoroughly pleased to discover The Birth of Venus an enthralling and fascinating historical read. This story is truly a fresh take on the time period with wonderful characters weaving in and out of the political and social Floretine landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical and Feminist fiction at its best","review":"I finished this book in 2 days--I could hardly put it down to go to work! What an amazing story, with gorgeous prose. The details of Florence were well done, and the political upheaval described is not irrelevent to our times. I think this is one of the best books about women that I've read in a long time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art and Love","review":"This is the second book I've read by Sarah Dunant, the first being Mapping the Edge. I enjoyed this one more. It is a love story, one of longing and loss but ultimately at its core, there is love. The political upheaval and its religious implications are also detailed in this story along with the art movement at that time.The central character is Alessandra, a head strong, passionate young girl who lives to paint and has many conflicts with her well to do family in trying to get on with her life. Her world unravels even further when a young painter, hired by her father, arrives to paint the frescoes in the family's chapel. Alessandra is forced to make choices which will forever alter her life, sometimes for the worse, but hoping still for the better.This is a wonderfully written novel and fans of \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" will probably enjoy this story as well. I know I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry- I just don't get it","review":"I read 4 chapters in this book trying to get into it. It just trips over itself over and over dropping names and historical places/pieces of art. I found it to be highly pretentious and really silly. I know many people really enjoyed it but I'm not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful!","review":"I read this book for a book club and it was really, really hard finishing it. I think I knew it was drivel at the very beginning but I like these women and wanted to go to bookclub. Does historical fiction just have a lower bar? We've also read Geraldine Brooks and the quality is just way below that of most of the other novels I generally read.There is a very good negative review already here (last one with one star - Simone) so please read that one for a detailed look at all the inanities in this book. My biggest general gripe is that like many other \\"women's\\" books, I believe it has an anachronistic feminist slant. \\"The Color Purple\\" is another example of this genre.This book should inspire me to write my own historical novel. Pick a picturesque setting, throw in some sex and lurid details - torture, dimemberment, plague, and rake in the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After reading the reviews I bought two of the trilogy. It didn't take long to feel the author's distain for men. There wasn't an admirable one in the book. I'm no appologist for the church of the time but again, the total lack of anything good associated with it's clergy, religious or their followers was over the top \\"hateful\\". It is void of any historical reality. Throw in a splash of explicit erotica and foul language to make it completely predictable and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious much?","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:There were some elements of mystery that kept me reading until the end, but I did not find the book enjoyable.

I read it three times on thefirst flight and another two on the returning flight. Hot stuff is this book !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Birth of Venus","review":"2.5 starsThe book starts when a nun dies and leaves instructions not to touch her body. The sisters ignores them and they discover that she had a shocking tattoo on her body. Then book gies back in time when Alessandra was young girl in Florence. She loves to paint and when her family hires a young painter she becomes fascinating by him. But she gets to be married to an older man who isn't all that he seems to be and learns something involving his brother.I have to say that I wanted to like this more than I did. I don't know much about Italy and I wish I'd knew more about the things that happened in the book. I didn't feel connected to the characters and the only one that I wanted to read about was the painter, who isn't mentioned by name. I did some skipping in the beginning but it did get better towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating window to a turbulent era","review":"The Birth of Venus was a random choice for the month. I acquired it from a friend who was clearing out her bookshelf and picked it up on Saturday, on the off chance that it might be a good weekend read. I ended up well and truly sucked in and finished it in two days. One review of the book I read stated simply 'not my thing' and I can understand that completely. Set in Florence in the 1500s, this is a tale of art and religion, arranged marriages and the desires of a young, headstrong woman. I found it a fascinating window into a world where artists like Botticelli were adored and enemies of the ruling elite were tortured and mutilated and where your choice of lover could be a matter of life or death. I'd recommend it, but not to everyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeously written!","review":"Wow. I don't usually read books in this genre, but this one came highly recommended. I made the wise decision to bring it on vacation to Italy with me. It was the PERFECT book to do that with. I loved going to the museum and then reading about the paintings I saw in the novel. The story was riveting and beautifully told. I will definitely read more from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I first heard about this book in the local newspaper where it was giving a summary for this book. It took several months but I was able to track it down through the library. And once I got it, I could not but it down.It follows a young Italian girl who loves to paint and is then married to an older man who turns out to be her brother's lover. The book is wonderfully written and a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern sensibilities","review":"A friend breathlessly recommended this book. I can't do the same. The plot is slow to develop. The characters, with the exception of the mother and the husband, are generally unlikeable. The mother and the husband are more modern than renaissance in their tone and character. The actions of the lead character seem implausible for the time, or indeed, any time. Finally, the writing is simply inelegant and uninteresting.I love Florence. I am a plague scholar and a \\"fan\\" of the renaissance. I would have loved to love this book. Sadly, I cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it sounds...","review":"This book left me disappointed and bored. There isn't enough depth covered in an artist's world, and the characters and interactions were flat. It started out strong at the beginning, but there is way too much filler in the part of the book where Alessandra grows up. The only interesting parts were the very beginning, when she is old and dying, and when she gets married. That is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a critic, just love to read.","review":"I am by no means a critic, just an average book reader. I found this book very hard to put down. At times this story was funny, other times, I was on the edge of my seat. But throughout I was captivated by the life of this young girl who wanted so much to be an artist, but knew her duty to become a wife and mother and was torn between her rebellious spirit and her duty. I was slightly disappointed by the direction the end went, but appreciated the spirit of the character throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, overall","review":"While reading this book I almost quit during the first chapter because it was too \\"21st century feminist plopped down into history\\". I get really tired of historical women being presented as speaking their minds and wanting a man's life, being told how they'll never find a husband, with an exasperated mother following behind, wringing her hands. Why can't we have women who are strong while being faithful to their culture and times? Anyway...This book got better and I enjoyed it until I got to the last few pages. I thought the ending was totally unbelievable.So overall, it was pretty good. Not bad, not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"who is he?","review":"instantly endearing narrator and fascinating, roiling context. may i ask any reviewers, though: is The Artist a true historical one (not Prince)... has anyone desciphered any clues or are they all background with just a wonderfully imagined imaginary Artist? this book and the heronine stay with you, and for me, so does the lingering tickle of... who is he?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Telling of the Tale","review":"I really liked this book! It gave a unique perspective to the time period. However, I suggest reading Irving Stone's The Agony and the Ecstasy first and then read this book; as it describes many of the same of events but from a woman's vantage point. I also wanted to speak to the person who said they didn't get the tattoo thing; it wasn't really about getting a tattoo, but about preserving the last gift her true love gave to her. This was the only way she knew to keep it with her forever and therefore keep him close to her for the rest of her life. I highly recommend the book. Read and Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 120+ pages","review":"I know I'm going to be in the minority here, but I could not get into this book. I tried, I really did but I found nothing to interest me, no chemistry between the two main characters, I couldn't find anyone or anything to care about and if I want to read about a serial killer run loose I will pick up the next Ann Rule book. It was all I could do to not throw the book across the room.If you feel you will enjoy this book based upon other reviews, get it from the library first. Then if you love it, buy it. I am sorry I wasted my money. JMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Shallow and Uninteresting ...","review":"The only reason I finished reading this book is because I was unfortunate enough to buy it in hardcover and I didn't want to waste the money. If shallow characters, tedious writing and overall predictability is what you consider a good read, by all means, read this poor excuse of a book. The book is over-researched and pedantic, but somehow still manages ridiculous anachronism. Don't waste any time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bodice ripper disguised as a work of fiction","review":"Yea, yea. A liberated woman ahead of her time, trapped in a world she can't control, passionate about art and an artist, unconventional and willing to take risks - a plot as predictable as Dick and Jane. The only saving grace: historical references to the Medici and the religious fervor that gripped the city in the 15th century, and descriptions of buildings in and around Florence. But way too few to give this book any right to be called historical fiction. This is a bodice ripper with the pretensions of being something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic Harlequin","review":"I thought I would love this book: it covers a time of art history I am both familiar with and enjoy, it centers around a girl who loves art, and it had romance. I was wrong.The plot is redundant and obvious and the prose cliche. The character's thoughts were full of self pity and self aggrandizement ad nauseam. When \\"big plot twists\\" are revealed at the end of the book, all I could think of was, \\"Oh! please.\\" Even these were cheap and predictable. I found my art history text books on the subject more enjoyable.The only redeeming points were a few well-produced characters and some descriptions of Florence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a decade!","review":"I loved this book and it's stayed with me. The kind of book you want all your friends to read as well. Just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful... (4.5 Stars)","review":"I bought this book and Sarah Dunant's newest book, \\"In The Company of the Courtesan\\", at the same time. I read \\"Courtesan\\" first and was fairly disappointed (see my review). Because I had already bought \\"Venus\\", I decided to give it a go. This book was beautiful and compelling and even a week after I have finished it, I find myself thinking about the story. The author captures the main character's voice perfectly. I felt like I truly knew Alessandra. Unlike \\"Courtesan\\", the characters in this book are very relatable and substantial. I felt their pain, passion, and joy. My only complaint is that the story was too short. Selfishly I could say that the last chapter feels rushed, but only because I wanted more! I wanted Alessandra and her painter's story to continue so I could share their experiences. If I could rate \\"The Birth of Venus\\" 4.5 stars, I probably would, but I rounded up because of the way I felt while I was reading the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Amazing!","review":"I was very impressed and moved by this novel- who could not be moved? the writing, story line and research were wonderful.The premise is of a young girl coming of age during a Florentine time of religious repression. A young painter comes to her family home to paint their chapel, and has educational opportunities which surprise and shock him. Alessandra is caught up in his life and learning in ways that were unacceptable to most of Florentine society, most shockingly by learning to paint. The young man is not identified until near the very end of the book when we are treated to many more suprises about these people and the changes wrought in their lives by art and repression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Romance Novel With Some Forrest Gump","review":"Basically a light entertaining read with a little history (I think) thrown in for good measure. I mistakenly thought it would be a thought-provoking novel about some piece of art only to find out that it was a disguised romance novel set in Florence in the mid 1400s during a time of religious upheaval and fervor. The heroine is an awkward, unique woman (who of course doesn't know that she's beautiful) who first fights with and then falls in love with a reclusive (but fascinating and mysterious) painter. She marries another man out of necessity but still longs for the man she could never have (because of her position or whatever -- in other words, fill in the blank). At the end the reader is shocked at the actual identify of the painter. The first clue was when he was never identified by name -- only by the term \\"the painter.\\" Hmmmm could that be a hint that this is referring to some famous painter? Definitely a beach read -- just hide the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story Falls Flat","review":"The setting and story of The Birth of Venus were engaging enough, but the writing left me feeling flat. Too often the author used excessive adjectives and adverbs and melodramatic language rather than really making me understand the characters through their dialogue and action. The book seems a good first draft, and with some revision it could be a great novel, but as it is the characters are flat, uncomplicated stock characters, and the reading felt too plot based. I never really felt the complicated emotions of these characters and this setting, and though the plot pulled me forward, it was not a memorable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved and believed everything but the ending","review":"With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"the birth of venus","review":"i'm glad i borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. the characters are so not believeable. for a fourteen year old she seems too knowledgeable about history and politics, and what is with her very hostile relationship with her brothers? Sure there is a lot of sibling rivalry, but don't these characters ever grow up and develop some kind of maturity and insight? The prologue was remarkably interesting, and I was hooked, but it was a downward plunge till the end. the painter seems to have made a 180-degree character change when he reappears in the end after a long absence. the plot, characters and coherence of incidents are very loosely interwoven, and very inconsistently developed. a very unbalanced, tedious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written. Gratuitous violence added for shock value.","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book, and I returned it. It was difficult to read because it was so poorly written. In addition, the story contained too much unnecessary violence added for shock value. I don't think it was necessary to be so graphic; a good writer can describe these things more eloquently. I have read much better books on this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Graphic","review":"I chose this book for my book club based on reviews and a recommendation from a friend. However, I would warn other book club leaders to read it first before including it as a selection. It is extremely graphic and this detracts from the story. The author certainly researched her subject very well but why she had to include such explicit sexual passages is beyond me. I received phone calls from club members very upset with the book and I'm embarrassed that I ever selected it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you're looking for a romance novel","review":"I read a few very good reviews of this book, so I picked it up. What a disappointment. The author tries to hard to disguise this trash as historical literature and it comes off as neither. It's not bad enough to be a good summer romance novel and good enough to be called anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"I didn't read much of this book. I didn't want to give it one star because it sounded like there might be an interesting story hiding somewhere in there.If there was, I didn't get to it. I read the first 50 pages of the book, and then skipped around a little bit. I was extremely annoyed by the writing style and I wondered how something like that could have been published.The writer kept switching tense. One paragraph she would be talking in present. The next paragraph she was talking in past. No, it wasn't because she was talking about different times. She would be talking about the same exact incident in different tenses.How can an author who can't even keep their tenses straight write a novel that gets published and goes to the bestseller shelf in barnes and noble?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Birth of Venus, A Bit Like A History Course.","review":"The Birth of Venus may be more enjoyed by those who have a deep (very deep) interest in frescoes, france, and late 1400's politics. I am not that person. I felt that the author used a painful amount of details about the politics of the time to fill pages. Some of it was necessary for the story, but most if it seemed a bit like a history buff that likes the sound of their voice and depth of their own knowledge. I could have gotten beyond that if the story's ending had not left me wondering: what was the point of telling this girl's story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring......","review":"I was actually amazed at how boring this book was. The characters were not really expanded upon, and therefore I felt no connection to them. The \\"intimate\\" sections of the book were so ridiculous, that I was almost embarassed for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me dissatisfied","review":"I read this book fairly quickly and it was an easy read. I kept waiting for the book to pick up... but it never did. The ending was abrupt and left me dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Novel Material wasted","review":"The beginning of the book is catching enough to alure readers to unfold the story. But as the pages turn, the fascination is changed to impatience. The writer has unnecessary descriptions to occupy too many paragraphs, and the heroine, who has totally gained reader's empathy at the beginning, shows her egotism and narcissism which grew unbearable especially after she finds out her husband to be a gay, which fact seems to give her a perfect excuse to indulge her long-developed fancies upon the young painter."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Right Elements -- But Fails to Deliver","review":"Dunant's book doesn't live up to its rather shockingly theatrical first chapter \\"hook.\\" It has all the right elements for an intriguing historical fiction but Dunant fails to link them together in any coherent, compelling way. Moreover, her protagonist, supposedly clever and extremely well-read for a woman of her time, is remarkably naive and addled-brained, constantly taking direction from her clear-thinking, authoritative maid.

The swing on this disc is moderately paced, and performed with precision. I love this disc because it makes me feel as if it could actually be on the radio back in the 40's. I love that nostalgic feeling, but that doesn't mean that the recording quality is excellent, for a band this size it is. I love where they've taken a few of these classic songs. They aren't extremely innovative, or new approaches, but they impose their own style and flavor unobtrusively making this album extremely enjoyable. Check these guys out, they aren't Cherry Poppin', Squirrel Nut Zippers, or Royal Crowne, but they are great. We need more classic sounding swing like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic treatise on post-WW II American pop culture","review":"I thought I was fortunate when I was able to find and check out this book from my local library; now being able to own it outright is a wish fulfilled.Hine presents what many consider to be the definitive treatment of American popular culture in _Populuxe_. From its roots in post-WW II mass consumerism to its demise in the pre-Vietnam global technocracy, Hine provides a comprehensive analysis of the commercial design sensibilities that defined the era. I'll bet those Nickelodeon TV Land folks have a copy of this book locked in a protected vault. If you're into Retro, or are a serious or casual student of Pop Art or American pop culture, you've probably seen this book often referenced as an authoritative work. Once you've read it for yourself, you'll know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive, visually stunning, hip, wonderful book!","review":"I stumbled across this book in the library several years ago and loved it! This book is a true literary treasure and the ultimate guide to life in America after WWII. What an enjoyable trip back in time!

I was disappointed that the pictures are scanned ads and images from the same easily found 50s magazines that are stacked on shelves here in the house. There is nothing here you haven't seen or read before. This would be a GREAT gift book for someone who'd enjoy reminiscing about their heyday in the 50s, or a gift for a person who is just being introduced to all things mid-century.

It's a small book geared towards the internet savvy bride/groom-to-be, full of url's and references to their own website (which is pretty much blank and 'under construction').Maybe I've done more online research than most, but I didn't read anything new here. Yes, it's nicely organized and if you've just recently begun to consider eloping and/or haven't hit the 'net, this is a great starting point.I would have given it 5 stars if the content was a bit more in depth.

It spurred him to start conversations with me about what *he* wants in the wedding.

The internet is boundless in the information that it can provide on this subject and it can be overwhelming. This book provided a skeleton of the essentials of what is available on the internet. The book provided scenarios which I liked and in my opinion, a good overview of what is available globally. I did some research on the internet before I bought this book. It was after buying it, I was able to narrow down where I wanted to get married. I also used one the the suggested locations and was more than pleased.

I am a swing fanatic, I read about the group in a book. Lee seemed very knowledgable about swing, and also seemed like he would put out a good C.D. When I purchased it I had very high hopes. After about the fifth song I had to take it out. The vocals are terrible, his voice is nassaly and is modeled after bad punk bands. I went back and re-read the interview and found out that infact some of his influences were bad punk bands such as \\"Gwar.\\" The band modelled thier music after punk so much that it sounded like a punk band with a couple of horns. I know that sounds like a ska band but its not. This band destroyed classic songs like\\"Powerhouse,\\" and \\"Sing,Sing,Sing,\\" and \\"I'm beginning to see the light.\\" The only good thing about the band is that Lee is very,very,very fashionable.

It is just so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"This is an attempt at swing gone horribly, horribly wrong. Let's start with Mr. Press-On. His singing transforms what might be a passable band into a fiasco. If singing ranges were highways, Mr. Press-On would be a two rut dirt road. He seems to model himself on Cab Calloway but is missing one key ingredient: talent. His intonation is bad, his range non-existant, and his voice uninteresting. The Nails have a heavy cross to bear with Mr. Press-On but don't do much to lighten their load. I'm certain there are a few good musicians mixed into the cacophany but they are mostly submerged. They don't seem to have the concept of \\"dragging the beat\\" that is essential to good swing music.

You can really hear every last mistake and flaw. The poor sound quality really puts a damper on what would otherwise be a real five-star recording. If, for their second recording, they just did studio versions of every song here, it would be just amazing.

It got more violent, conjuring images that are too gruesome to recount. Perhaps if Donaldson were not so good at writing, it wouldn't be so bad. I've read horror books that were not as disturbing as what I found here.I got halfway through and just couldn't go on. The shame of it is that this wasn't necessary. The storyline was compelling. I was truly interested in the characters and the plot twists were complex and gripping. Donaldson is a master. But the themes degenerated to an almost Dahlmer-esque level.What is even more disturbing is that so many reviewers gave this nonsense such high marks. I found it revolting and sick.

Whereas I enjoy his concept of drama vs melodrama (in melodrama, you have a hero, the oppresed, and the oppressor; in drama you have the same characters but through the story they change their roles) the characters demonstrate their changes only through an ever increasing cruelty. While this can be interesting, it very soon becomes tedious and purposeless. 15 years after reading the \\"Lena\\" chapter of Lord Foul's Bane, I remember the scene vividly because it carried such a punch.

Everything is in place for fabulous telenovela viewing experience, but the editing is brutal. After watching and thorougly enjoying \\"Mi Destino Eres Tu\\", my Spanish II students and I were primed to enjoy Amor Real. Unfortunatley, we had a near impossible time figuring out story lines, plot twists and new or minor characters.Why didn't the producers and editors use both discs (since it does come in a two-disc set) rather than only one to condense the 95 episodes? (I know, let's save a few bucks and ruin the product!) Bloopers are fun, but not at the expense of a coherent story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I was so disappointed with the DVD version of this wonderful novela. They edited a 96-episode novela down to 1 double-sided disc. The second disc is basically Carla Estrada congratulating herself and the crew. They actually filmed the crewmembers being thanked for their work on the novela and ones who spoke, of course, thanked Carla Estrada. They showed bloopers and talked about the costumes. This is something that should have been a special feature on part on a disc. They should not have wasted two sides of a double DVD for this boring pat on the back for Carla Estrada. I don't understand why they couldn't have released the entire novela. Even if they had used both the double-sided discs for the novela the story wouldn't have been so chopping and confusing-even for someone who saw the novela on TV. I feel so cheated.Disc 1 chopped up novelaDisc 2 celebration of Carla Estrada/a few minutes of bloopersThe subtitles are only in English.

The relationship between the two main characters doesn't make any sense, probably some crucial parts were cut out. I mean, come on, they want you to believe that a woman fell in love with the man who raped her without showing you why. And the secondary story lines make even less sense if that's possible.

As rehersals go, they aren't bad performances, but the mix is muddy. I've long since sold my copy.A better live album to buy from this time period is, MADE IN JAPAN by Deep Purple.

Ms. Henderson really took you into the pain that Jennifer and, toward the end, Scott were feeling.I also love how Ms. Henderson writes her romance. It is truly romantic, but always clean. I am a great fan of romance, but I don't find smutty \\"romance\\" really romantic at all. Also, I appreciate Ms. Henderson's lack of curse word's in her writing.The only problem that I found was that at times the dialogue was stiff, since Ms. Henderson rarely used contractions. This, however, is very small in comparison to the book overall.Ms. Henderson's first book published, The Marriage Wish, is a truly romantic book that makes you experience the story along with the characters, and makes you feel emotions as if you were really there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and poignant story dealing with loss and hope","review":"This story was poignant from the beginning.

What sparked the interest was a CD that came into my possession of Beehoven's 7th & 8th, conducted by Claudio Abbado. The CD does not have a case, it vanished long ago (the result of raising three teenagers). Since then I have purchased a few dozen Beethoven CD's, including the entire cycles by Karajan (1963 edition) and Bernstein. Without a doubt the Claudio Abbado 7th and 8th is VASTLY superior for my tastes. It is played with rousing vigor and enthusiasm by the Vienna Philharmonic. While the Karajan's and Bernsteins may be more \\"classical\\" by most standards, the Abbado is played with punch, vigor, and enthusiasm. It could be I apprecaited it more being raised on Rock and Roll, but I can clearly hear the differences and make the comparisons without hesitation, and I like what I hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound And Tempo Are Perfect For Me !","review":"What a genius Beethoven was ! What a fine cd to own with jubilant sounds from 1812.The clever first movement of the 7th symphony, to me, is unlike anything else Beethoven did. The second movement is friendly and calm without being lullifying. \\"Presto\\", the third movement, is adroit and exultant. The 4th movement is a mixture of all three movements splashed with triumph and thoroughness.The first and 2nd movements of the 8th symphony have reserved sounds of bourgeoisie and stateliness without being ostentatious. the 3rd movement, the \\"menuetto\\" is short, sweet, effective, and befitting with the previous movements. The 4th movement was simply, for me, maybe a bit overactive and choppy, but still fantastic like the rest of the symphony!Great sound, and production! Abbado and The Vienna Philharmonic did outstanding work with this presentation, but this is what one comes to expect from Deutsche Grammophone!!Good day friends !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these so much","review":"I've had my snips for a couple years now, and look forward to using them for years more.

Easy to use and well built without costing a lot. They go through aluminum cans very easily and also work very well on copper foil to make tooled pendants and such with. The edges of thicker metal don't seem to need much filing to get them smooth again and it doesn't warp my foils all out of place.You do need to take care of them though, make sure you oil them every so often to help prevent against rust forming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing snips","review":"My dad bought this for me when I was with him as a teenager in a local hardware store.

This improvement is slowly helping me understand how to plan in unclear positions. It has also helped in seeing opponents threats before it is too late.If you find that most chess books are interesting to read but have not made much of a difference in your playing strength then you might try this one and go back to the others later.The last section of the book is very inspiring on where to go to improve after you master the material in this book.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burner Covers","review":"I like my burner covers very much.

Many resources are listed by name and described in detail. The amount of information included is comprehensive and can be a bit over-whelming at times. I would recommend this for Library Science students or professionals wishing to know more about reference materials or wishing to enhance their library's reference collection. The detailed bibliography at the end of each chapter provides supplementary resources for each topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but...","review":"I had to get this book along with two other books for a reference class. Not only is this book long, but it's large so it's even longer than it might appear. What may look like only 30 pages for a chapter would consist of 50-60 pages in any regular-sized book. The writing is also very dry and reading it is like wading waist-deep across the Atlantic Ocean if it the Atlantic Ocean was thick mud. The pages contain huge chunks of text that just look like a vast ocean of letters that makes reading it intimidating. Sure it's a text book, but the other two text books I had in the class were on the same subject, seemed just as informative, yet arranged in a more bearable way and the authors do not write as if they were machines (meaning their writing had a human quality and they had a sense of humor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reference and Information Services: An Introduction","review":"I used this book for a reference class in the Fall of 2006.

It has moderately good sonics, nothing special. I put this comment first (even though it is the least important thing about this recording) because it is by far the most favorable thing I'm going to say. Bernstein sounds totally at sea here, sometimes directing what seems to be random wandering by the Concertgebouw when he loses the line of the symphony's development. The vocal part, sung with empathy, is one of the great vocal moments of the entire literature. It *can* melt titanium, but Helmut Wittek is either off key or has a very unsympathetic mixdown. He is unmoved by the score besides, to judge by the unpersuasive result. I really love this symphony; get the Szell/Cleveland/Raskin (or even the 1960 Bernstein/NY Phil/Grist) version and do yourself a favor. Even those who are willing to have more than one Mahler #4 don't want this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis- represented","review":"product was supposed to have a timing tab..i paid 22 dollars for an eighteen dollar item even after contacting customer service..........i'm disappointed but not to where i'll never order again...i've ordered several items since and they were right"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Maverick too slow","review":"James Garner is one of the best actors of our time,and he is the only part of this show worth watching.

We get further acquainted with Rand's brilliant philosophy of \\"objectivism.\\"Rand's perception of human nature were far ahead of her time. I like Rand's idea that once politics and human discourse becomes more honest and straightforward...that is when democracy becomes a much more powerful force for good. Right now politics is mostly smoke and mirrors and anything but honest. In Rand's world, politicians would be respected for their ideas and the good they construct in the world.Thanks to my friend Chris Artig in college for introducing me to Ms. Rand. I now wish I would have begun reading Rand a lot more seriously a lot earlier in my life.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of \\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire, vacuous and bitter.","review":"This book is a compression of Rand's philosophy with chunks taken from her other works. It achieves its goal in terms of providing a summary of her \\"philsophical\\" work, but on the down-side it quickly becomes apparent that she has little to offer. Her understanding of Western philosophy is surprisingly poor - she adores Aristotle and loathes Plato and seems to miss many of the similarities between the two. Worse, her metaphysical claims are the very worst of amateur philosophizing.If you're serious about addressing libertarianism at its best, I recommend you read someone like Nozick instead. He offers intelligent, often compelling arguments for a minimal state, while Rand simply offers slogans, dogma and resentment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choking from the Smoke is a liar","review":"Choking from the Smoke is a lying second-hander, parasite, looter, value-destroyer, and hater of the good for being the good. Ayn Rand discovered and integrated the ONLY COMPLETELY TRUE AND RATIONAL PHILOSOPHY. We who agree with her are not 'cultists' but are RATIONALLY PERSUADED that she was RIGHT - because she WAS, and to deny it is to deny reality. Those who disagree are merely revealing themselves as the subhuman wretches that they are. These lice who evade reason and reality have FREELY CHOSEN the premises of DEATH - and when the principles of Ayn Rand are put into practice, they will be put out of their misery as they so richly deserve and WANT.Anyone who wants to work for that future can LIVE IN IT TODAY by reading the works of the greatest genius who ever lived: Ayn Rand. This book is a good introduction to her thought.Fight for the DEATH of the looters!In the name of the best within us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There IS NO other kind of Objectivism.","review":"The 'sickening mess' of which some complain is the DIRECT result of books like this one. Rand herself fostered the 'cult' mentality and it is woven into the very fabric of her 'philosophy'. This volume is a very good example: she presents a 'history' of philosophy in which she classifies every major thinker other than herself and Aristotle as either an 'Attila' or a 'Witch Doctor'. There have, in Randworld, been just two philosophers in all of history who were not out to destroy the human mind, and Rand is the only one who got things altogether right. The ENTIRE purpose of this propagandistic little book, and of the 'Objectivist' movement itself, is to create a class of New Intellectuals who unreservedly agree with this assessment and will act to keep the One True Philosophy from being compromised while the rest of the world hurtles to its death a la ATLAS SHRUGGED. So if you think there's some other way to be an 'Objectivist' - check your premises."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"This is definitely the best book I read in a long time. Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy is fascinating to anyone that loves freedom, capitalism, and reason. This is not a book that any closed-minded socialist-like thinker should read (i.e. people that believe in increased federal government control over our lives). This book rightfully criticizes the intellectuals of the 20th century that promoted socialist programs and even socialism itself. Ayn Rand was a real thinker that reminded me of how great this country was and still could be if we return to what we were when this country was created by our democratic, capitalist, and intellectual founding fathers. I am looking forward to the Atlas Shrugged movie that is in the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't dare read this!","review":"This is an awful book: Ayn Rand is insane. I couldn't stand it, and barely read any of it, but I didn't need to read any further to find out what a sick, twisted fascist Rand was. Don't ever read anything she wrote, especially not Philosophy: Who Needs It or Atlas Shrugged (her cult's bible). No, I don't hate Ayn Rand, since hatred is evil, but I sure don't like her either! Just don't read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well bound, low cost and durable","review":"the binding seems to hold up well through a full reading and multiple reference readings. even in my back pocket while biking around you dont see page losses, just some minor bends.

Read this and you won't have to wade through any of her stupefyingly boring novels. Read this little book and you'll get to spend time in Rand's fantasyland of isolated egos, a world that resembles a godless mathematical machine made of flint in which humans only \\"deserve\\" to exist if they can meet the Darwinian demands of Supply and Demand. This book, like much of what Ayn Rand wrote during her benzedrine-driven career, provides the perfect excuses for every egomaniac banker on Wall Street who wants to grab all the loot they can get their hands on and pillage every retirement account that comes their way. For Rand and her followers, \\"deregulation of the market\\" has been a mantra they have all chanted these past ten years while they legally bled the country dry, fair and square."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it; try P:WNI","review":"Boy, I stay away from these pages for a while and look what happens. My old review is buried somewhere under \\"click here for all customer comments,\\" so here's another -- a short one.Skip this book; the main essay is mostly polemic, and the excerpts from Rand's novels are available in the novels, where they belong. If you want a fairly good introduction to Ayn Rand, try _Philosophy: Who Needs It_ (but see my review there for warnings).

I hate nature, higher powers, religions,altruism, and I love myself more than you. I'm tired of helping the poor- they should starve and die.

Thanks Ayn Rand for giving me an excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mat","review":"Anyone who starts their review of this foul book by saying that it is \\"one of the best philosophical books I've read\\" obviously hasn't read enough philosophical books.Ayn Rand is the Ann Coulter of the 1960's; The \\"new intellectual\\" she praises in the title is actually her romanticized \\"Businessman,\\" or he who applies his mind only to the creation of profit for himself and thus security for his family and ideas. She essentially argues that any effort that does not contribute directly to a free-market economy is counter productive. A truly ugly set of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Ayn Rand overview!","review":"It helps to have read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, for anyone wanting to understand the immensely intelligent and sane world-view of Ayn Rand, but For the New Intellectual is a splendid overview of that philosophy and of the high points of those books. Not only does the volume provide important excerpts (e.g. the John Galt radio address from Atlas Shrugged, Ayn's philosophy in a nutshell and something unequalled in all of literature), but also has an introduction which alone would be worth many times the price of the book. I have given copies of this volume to friends and relatives as a good way to become acquainted with Ayn Rand. Her philosophical message is crucial today as never before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly radical critique of philosophy.","review":"Encountering Ayn Rand's work when I was fifteen was a stuuning moment, an epiphany. It forced me to question everything I'd ever believed and been taught. More than a decade later, I am still deeply impressed by the scope and force of this book's indictment modern philosophy and culture, even while there are aspects of Rand's philosophy with which I fundamentally disagree.I recommend this book, and all of Ayn Rand's work, as a means for young people to stop living with unquestioned assumptions about life and value and forcing themselves to define what they truly believe. In the first few pages of \\"For the New Intellectual\\", you will discover that many of the beliefs and values you may have taken for granted are far from obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"George and the Dragon","review":"I first saw this movie on cable a few years ago and instantly liked it. This movie is definitely family friendly and is peppered with many familiar faces. The language is clean, there is no sex and the violence is kept to a minimum. No blood and gore so your kids can still watch it. Yet, the scripting and acting are good enough to keep the adults entertained, too. It gives good life lessons about not letting fear cloud your judgement, working together for a common goal, and protecting threatened species (even the ones that aren't cute and cuddly!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"George and the Dragon","review":"A nce little movie - James Purefoy is a pleasure to watch.

Don't expect historical accuracy or big budget special effects in George and the Dragon, but James Purefoy as always delivers a good tongue in cheek performance.

Wagner is an excellent material for him to fully develop this propensity. The overture for Tannhaeuser and the Siegfried's Idyll are passionately played in this syle, so we are thrown into violent or intense ecstacy and yet the most beautiful and symbolic melodies are clearly floating before our mind. Wagner is clearly analysed in ecstatic passion....to such an extent that we are slightly reminded of Wagner's and Hitler's racism which were so violent and so merciless. Clearly melodious, passionate and not a little ominous.As for Jessye Norman, I feel she is no less a superb exquisite musical instrument rather than a human being.

The good thing about this toy: You can imagine a lot of things when you're playing with this toy, if you're like me. The extra wings can come out easily, four of them.

He was very excited about it. When it arrived, his parents were quite amazed at just how big it is (I know, we should check the dimensions first). It's really big; too big, I think to really get much playing value out of it. Also, it does not stay together. It has not broken, but the wings and guns do not stay on under even light play. My son still is proud of it, but he does not play with it any more. He just told me he wished he had bought something else with his gift card.Not the best toy for the price.

Abbado conducts with a warmth, cohesion and tension that is wonderful to hear, and his orchestra is positively radiant. Unfortunately, the principal singers are not up to their roles. Grundheber barks menacingly but is extraordinarily sloppy and inaccurate with his note-values, making a mess of the title role; Hildegard Behrens, though more musically accurate, is about 20 years past her prime, and her voice wobbles all over the place.What I'm wondering is why the classic recording with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Evelyn Lear and the fabulous conducting of Karl Bohm (also on DG) is out of print. When it came out about 8 years ago, in a 3-CD set with \\"Lulu,\\" I snapped it up, and have enjoyed it ever since.Save your money on this one.

Lally describes Babe Ruth as \\"A baseball revolutionary, a Che Guevera lacking fatigues or philosophy,\\" describes Lew Burdette's sneaky fastball in this beautiful sentence, \\"Though he hailed from Nitro, Virginia, his best fastball was more expedient than explosive,\\" and likens the Yankees first glimpse of Mickey Mantle to the debut of another phenom, \\"Watching him take his freshman swings against major league pitching, these rookies must have felt the same blend of awe and envy Salieri experienced when he first heard the adolescent Mozart tinkering at the piano.\\" Pure bliss for anyone who loves the written word. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who don't like baseball. Just a great, great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW...","review":"I wasn't paying that much attention to it when I began, I was fidgeting with my Blackberry and watching random scenes. 20 minutes into it, I told my friend I'll talk later because I have something interesting at hand. I didnt get up from my seat until the end of the film. Mind you, I was watching this in the living room on my laptop. And then began the most intriguing of storylines.You will not believe what happens in the film if you haven't already seen it. It goes from one end to another. There is no party you feel like siding with. In certain characters, I saw myself. The film has shock value and eventually it's humorous, this is one of the most simple unique films you will ever see.

The acting in this film was very impressive. And I liked the Jose cameo.

Don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Really disturbing\\"","review":"I gotta say, this movie was really disturbing. Of course, shock value was something that they were going for, and the film maker totally achieved that. I loved it because of that. The reason that I was able to laugh was because it was overly shocking. There were some times that I didn't know whether to cringe or laugh. When Adrian teaches Lichi how to feed the snake, I was cringing in my seat. But at the same time I was laughing a little. Is that wierd?...Oh, well. I felt for her, but at the same time, I could not restrain myself from laughing at her.

Everytime my friends call me, the first thing they do is quote lines from the movie.I was really surprised to find out that Mail Order Wife is a mockumentary and not a documentary. It looked so real!

Perhaps the only thing remarkable is the vocal performance of Cherubbino, the other singers though good aren't outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" About As Enchanting As A Root Canal\\"","review":"This production of \\"Figaro\\" has to rank as one of the most ungainly ever staged. Although it has a cast of distinguished singers, they are sabotaged by a conductor bent apparently on proving the old canard that Mozart's music has too many notes. Perhaps this is why he lingers unduly over each one, moving through the score at an elephantine pace. Similarly, the stage director has eliminated whatever in the text is light, bright and sparkling, matching the conductor in weighing down this sharp comical satire with an inappropriate dourness. I agree with earlier critics of this DVD, wishing only that I'd read their comments before I purchased it. Question: Are there any productions from M22 that seek to do other than be ugly and boring in novel ways?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"My best advise is to watch a couple scenes on You Tube, before committing to buying this. It is by far the worst opera production I have ever seen. The director must have a real disdain for Mozart, because he did everything is his power to minimize Mozart and Da Ponte's genious work. It's one thing to see a work in a different light, but this production was all the about the stage director's ideas. Mozart's and Da Pointe's intentions were just in his way. Not even a great group of singers could turn this ugly stage direction into something of value. The direction was ridiculous and many times laughable....the Countess writhing on the floor during \\"Porgi Amor\\", Susanna and the Countess making out with Cheribino during the dressing aria, this Eros dancer on the Count's shoulders during \\"Hai gia venta la causa\\", Bartolo in a wheelchair and so soooooooooo much more. This experience was nothing but a very bad memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I, too, wish I hadn't wasted my money on this recording which I bought having seen Anna Netrebko in L'Elisir d'Amor. But for Le Nozze di Figaro I much prefer the Peter Hall Glyndebourne production with Kiri Te Kenawa as the Countess, although Netrebko's acting was worth watching in the Salzburg production. The introduction of the cherub distracts from the music, the camera, and viewer, spent more time watching that ridiculous character than attending to the music. The cherub seems to have been introduced to entertain jaded Salzburg habitu��s who have seen this opera too many times already and clamour for novelty for its own sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Nozze di Figaro Mozart","review":"Musically excellent especially the lead performers. However, too many feathers in actual performance. I have seen many productions of this opera without the feathers.

The opera was, however, well worth the price I paid.I really enjoyed the performance but could have done without the feathered addition.Christine Harris"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination!!!","review":"If I had been in the audience at this performance I would have booed from the very beginning and throughout this horrible production. The singing was OK, the recits too slow and ponderous and WHAT was going on in the pit with all those pauses that added beats to pieces?The Eros dancer was unnecessary; the Count wa a simpering idiot and I couldn't decide if he was sweating or had allergies or a nose bleed. Bartolo in a wheel chair? COME ON! It became about picking up papers and how he would get back in the chair! The \\"non piu andrai\\" was the worst travesty. I'm sorry the Salzburg audience had to be subjected to this at those prices. I will have a great deal of trouble watching the rest and THANK GOD I didn't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better listened to then watched!","review":"What a missed opportunity! Great performers, great orchestra, in a perverse, misguided direction! An extra character has been introduced who goes around grimacing, juggling, tossing oranges and apples around the set during the action, or caressing or making teasing actions at the characters distracting from the action. And talk about sparse; Susanna sings her opening aria about her hat without wearing or holding one! Most of action takes place on a bare set with no furniture. This is a travesty and a disappointment. I was so hoping for a new production with wide screen, superb sound and top performers but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"Mozart would be ashamed.

His piano music, so different from that of Beethoven, pulsates with this innate lyricism. The two sets of impromptus, not fiendishly difficult to play, require a pianist who can make the piano sing. Such a pianist is Krystian Zimerman. Indeed, his use of rubato and minute tempo fluctuations might seem excessive to some, especially in D 899 No 1, but I find them well-judged.

His wack lyrics don't even make up for all the trash he's talking.Its this idiot who's giving rap a negetive image.

But other than that, I would've never REALLY paid attention to him until I heard \\"Play.\\" That beat is dope and then the edited version was tight. Then I got a mix tape from DJ Ktone (Denver, CO) with the unedited version and cracked up. But what made me buy his album was another mix on one of Ktone's other cds with \\"Ain't Got Nothing.\\" I had this EXTREMELY dependent, begging ex-boyfriend and as soon as I heard the second verse, I thought of him. I bought the cd the same day. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the whole thing. The man has a head on his shoulders and goes past the hood, poverty, women, and money to talk about some relevant political issues, relationships, etc. I can listen to this whole cd all the way through, minus that dumb song with Too Short (all Too Short's songs annoy me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinctive!","review":"I bought this CD today, but not because of the first single, the infamous \\"Play\\". While listening to it, I realise that David Banner introduces a plethora of artists into his tracks to flavor the songs, which was a smart idea in my opinion. Gives them more exposure. Also I note that Banner has 2 distinctive styles he uses, one is the more hard sounding Banner you hear on \\"X-ed\\" and \\"On Everything\\", the other being that lower, albiet quiter and more sexual whisper that you hear on \\"Play\\". The only reason I give this 4 stars is because a lot of the songs have the same kind of beat to my ears. I could barley distingush between \\"Lost Souls\\" and \\"Treat Me Like\\" when they switched in my CD player. However, if you've been a fan of Banner before, I'd highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Der Deutsche Mensch","review":"The print format used capital letters which distracted the reader and made reading more difficult.

India points out though that there is a price to be paid.

Some photos of the white houses from outside show grass and green palms. The Hicks' office has RED walls (oooh so daring).Somewhere there must be an outside place for guests to scrub themselves with very strong soap and change in to a white bathrobe before entering the house.

Because I am preparing to become a full time rv'r, I needed a grill considerably smaller than their suberb big six burner I had used for the last 6 years. It looks sort of outer spacey and flimsy but is anything but. A very heavy cast iron grill allows all the searing, etc needed for good grilling and then---after it cools of course---you can fold the wings up for very compact storage. My one quibble with it is that I cannot seem to get full heat from the little propane bottles it is made to use. Weber tells me a hook up to a full size bottle will do it.

It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Q Grill 220 - Very Nice!","review":"I have owned Weber grills in the past, and still have one that is about 15 years old.

I got the colapsable stand also, and of course the cover. Well worth it.I like to camp also, and like to be able to take a decent grill for cooking on. Before I bought my grill, I borrowed a friends Q 200 for a few camp trips. Travels great, fits in the bed of the truck or the camper nicely. We didn't take the stand as we had other folding tables to put it on. But I am looking forward to taking it camping this summer and enjoying something great to cook on.I highly recommend this grill.

The base we bought with it does hold a 20 pounds gas tank and it look like a real BBQ, We can use also 14on propane cans while on the road. It was well worth the investment.

I have had no problems cooking anything on this grill that I used to cook on a much larger 4 burner grill. I even bake pizza on it (real pizza from scratch, not frozen. You should try it. Keeps the house from getting hot from the oven being up so high.) The heavy cast iron grate really holds the heat. The sides fold in for compact storage. I also bought the folding stand, the bottle adapter and a cover. All work as advertised.The reason I chose this model over the 200 is that it has a temp guage which I find really handy.I only gave this 4 stars, though, because I find it hard to light. The lighter element is sparking but the burner does not ignite. I have taken to leaving the lid closed and turning on the gas. Eventually there is enough gas built up to light the thing. There is a slight woosh but nothing blows up.

My Weber Q also is very temperamental when starting with the full size tank - it often trips the regulator which restricts gas flow.

Most of the time I use aviation snips to cut 016 and 020 aluminum sheets. The main problem that I have with the Wiss offsets is that the nut which helps hold the blades together, continually loosens off. This causes the metal to curl between the blades, leaving an undesired \\"lip\\". In some cases, this causes the blades to not cut at all (during precise/short cuts).Another issue is that from new, the spring binds and does not offer a smooth cutting action. Sometimes the blades do not fully close because of the binding. I do like the non-offset Wiss snips, but I find them more awkward to use.If you are interested in offsets, I'd recommend Midwest. Fellow workers swear by the Ridgid offsets (actually produced by Midwest). I have not used Klenk snips, but I have used Malco offsets, which share a similar design.

Ms. Sumar lists the benefits of each pose and if certain poses should be avoided due to a child's condition.I have decided to expand my own daily yoga practices by becoming a teacher and will be looking into attending one of the Yoga for the Special Child trainings this year.

I went out to a natural foods store and bought everything. Well $70+ later, I did exactly what she said and had horrible results! My skin broke out in a rash! My skin turned red, burned, and developed red bumps everwhere. This wasn't after multiple uses - this was after 1 use after 5 minutes. I should have known this would happen as she says you should use orange peel, rosewater, rose oil and sandalwood oil - all of which aren't good for sensitive skin but for some reason I believed her.

The project sounded simple until the builder began asking questions about the details of the final look and finish last fall. We didn't know where to begin to get ideas. I searched for \\"fireplaces\\" at amazon and found this book, which is excellent. There is a lot of information in the book but just as important as that are all the big color photos of all kinds of fireplaces. We were able to mark all the ones we liked and then show the builder exactly what we had in mine. In our case, he was going to build a big boxy thing right up to the ceiling, but we showed several examples of chimneys that stepped back from the fire box. Inspired by the cover and another shot inside the book, we also decided to angle the sides of the chimney enclosure and add textured plaster for an old world look. The book also helped us create a better furniture arrangement to focus on the fire and to \\"direct traffic\\" around the furniture grouping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a single idea for me","review":"Like another reviewer said, The Fireplace Design Sourcebook by Melissa Cardona is a much better choice. Why he gave this book 5 stars anyway I can't figure out. I have over 20 postits marking pages in the other book and not a single one in this book. Not a single idea for the stone, mantle, or anything worth using. Way too much filler writing that didn't apply to anything, describing styles and types that are never applied in real world designs.\\"The Inglenook is a charmingly old-fashioned idea and the word itself is equally quaint. Ingle is a British word for...\\" Well, you get the idea.I can see the point that this book has a good decorating focus, but I still don't think it is a great book even for that and if you are just looking for fireplace ideas I think you will find this lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really gets going","review":"Some recordings grow on you over time; others diminish. This is one of the latter. On its first release in 1988, I thought this was one of the singularly great Mahler Fifths; now I think it's almost inert. A great interpretation, no matter how willful or idiosyncratic, has you convinced--even if only while listening to it--that there's no other way to play the piece. Here, you're all too aware of a ham-handed conductor exercising his prerogative and missing the point. The thread of the musical argument is lost amid overemphasized incidental details and preciously mannered phrasing. There ARE a couple of passages which stop you dead in your tracks--such as the lamenting cellos in the second movement, sounding almost like a human voice--but mostly it's the music which stops dead. Actually, it never starts. The CDs by Zander, Gatti, Inbal, Boulez and half a dozen others all convey this difficult work much more cohesively, engagingly and movingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all, I decided to give this recording two stars, onlybecause I don't think any recording deserves less. I had read thereviews for this recording and saw they were quite good, so I decided to give it a shot. I thought his interpretations were horrible, and the orchestra did not play up to its potential. I have some very good recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic, and I do not doubt that they are an excelent orchestra, but this recording, well, it stinks. To cite some specific examples, the brass has quite a few intonation problems in the first novement, and they also do not play together (when they're supposed to) in one section (around 8-9 minutes through the movement). The third movement is way to slow. The tempo marking means \\"not too slow\\", but Lenny has the orchestra moving at a snails pace! I normally adore the fifth movement, but it was a disappointment. Again, Lenny's tempo's were too slow. I thought the balance of the orchestra as a whole was terrible as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mahler Fifth that Works","review":"One wonders how many times Leonard Bernstein conducted the Mahler 5th symphony in his lifetime. Even the most obscure recordings are rich in the pathos and beauty of this symphony. This recording dates back to 1990 with Bernstein conducting the venerable Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. As expected the sound is lush and velvety with just the right balance of the brass sections and solos with the sonorous strings. The Adagietto in this recording is for his listener the finest Bernstein ever preserved on CD. This is one recording of the beloved Mahler 5 that deserves a place in the collection of every Mahlerite - even if it is simply for this luminous Adagietto movement.

As it says in the introduction, \\"We've taken great pains to select stories that the general public will find gripping and entertaining.\\" In other words, these stories qualify as literary fiction, but they are not pretentious or boring.

They did suggest I do some upgrading of my existing Dell XPS 400 as it was over seven years old. I still intend to keep this computer along with the new laptop. The upgrade cost $70.00.

You can easily install other firmware (such as DD-WRT which is Linux based), use it as a repeater if you need to extend the signal (using the Linux or other firmware), and is still extremely reliable.

I hooked it up in my bedroom, and when I am out in the living room, on another floor or out in the yard, the signal works just fine. The product also comes with a disc that allows you to set up security protocols and keep others from piggy backing off of your connection. That was easy to set up as well.

The first wireless router I bought would repeatedly lock up, requiring me to restart it, and the range was terrible.

Huh? Maybe its me, but I don't expect my signal strength to drop to low until I am across the street in my neighbor's back yard!

The 54GL handles P2P, Hulu, other streaming sites, and gaming without skipping a beat. Most notably (and specific to this model), I've had no issues with needing to reset the router on occasion, which is common for Linksys routers. This model can stay up for 30+ days without a power cycle, which really increases the ease of use for people who want to hide it away in a closet.

It is junk. Buy a more reliable brand. Linksys support is weak and unhelpful. The modem is cheaply made.All I wanted to do was to get a replacement. They make it VERY difficult.

If I weren't capable of following instructions, I would have given up after popping the installation CDROM in my computer. Now, every now and then the router and the cable modem don't get along and even when the cable modem is on correctly, I have to reset both to get my computer to recognize that I have more than a local network connection.

Even after all this, and upgrading the firmware, the wireless connnectivity still keeps dropping frequently.All in all, I would say for those of you who are not interested in the Linux compatability and are looking for a simple wireless router with good range and stability of connection - STAY AWAY from this one.

To save a few cents on RAM, Linksys changed operating systems and other details on that model, and advertised the WRT54GL as the model similar to my old one. I bought it, put it away, and finally got to it recently. I was shocked when I opened it: the WRT54GL has no wired ports, only a wireless transmitter. Maybe someone will find that useful, but it's unlikely -- someday you'll have a PC or laptop with a wired port that you want to plug in and cannot because this unit only talks wireless. It's useless for me, and now it's been too long since I bought it to return it. Why does Linksys cut corners this way? Cutting the wired ports cut their costs by $1 or less.

The product manual is useless as is the Cisco-Linksys website. Their website is one of those nightmares written by the marketing guys, not their company techies.There is a workaround discussed on techie chatrooms which are not affiliated with Cisco-Linksys. But it involves rewriting some of the firmware on both boxes, which gets problematic when the phone company owns your modem. And when you can't connect the router to the internet to access OEM firmware updates for the router. So forget it. I'm sending mine back.Any Cisco-Linksys marketer reading this needs to know I consider failure to openly list known compatibility issues (in some obvious place like the box or the Amazon page) to be questionable practice.

The instructions were very clear, easy to follow and set up was fast. We had to switch to a Mac, which initially was seamless because the Mac recognized the Router. However, our network service provider had outages and we experienced a power outage at home leading our computer to prompt us reset the Router. What we didn't realize was reseting the Router requires a 35 second uninterrupted period of pushing; we only pushed it briefly. We then contacted customer support and several hours later after outstanding support, we realized that resuming full operations after a partial reset is extremely complicated. e.g. IP addresses need to be re-established, wireless needs to be reconfigured, the Mac can't read set-up CD, etc. Overall, fantastic product.

I was able to connect my PS3 and laptop very easily and fast, something that was always an iffy chore with the Belkin.I'm very happy with this router and would recommend it to anyone.

I guess you get what you pay for. Now I know why the model was so cheap compared to the other Lawn Boy models. Also, there are no speed controls or any significant features to this mower. It's the definition of simple. Basically it's either on or off - and that's it. No choke or acceleration or adjustments. That could be good or bad, depending on your preferences.

Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore. Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history? It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration. He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true historical classic.","review":"I had taken an interest in Arthur Schlesinger when he passed away. I picked up a copy of his book, \\"A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House\\" from a used book shop in NYC. I had known that this was an award winning book. After Mr. Obama's election, I decided to read this book to find common threads between the Presidency of JFK and Mr. Obama. I was suprised by the similarities of these two men and their message. I strongly urge that Mr. Schelsinger's work be read by the historian and the non-historian. Although it is a big book, it had a good flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Days: John F.

Two reasons: first, it has an in-depth section on the basics of the medium, including a list of all the materials and equipment you might use. (I was surprised by how many ways papier mache can be used for totally different results, both arts/crafts and fine art.) Second, the remainder of the book provides many, many different projects with a list of the materials/equipment you will need and then the step by step process in creating the item. All with clear and beautiful color photographs. I first used the book for the how-to information since I have enough \\"projects\\" of my own. Now, I return to it for inspiration as well.

This book kept me hooked from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"I normally enjoy Gena Showalter's books, they are sweet and great escapism. I found this book so 'try hard'. The heroine was so immature, and such a cow to the hero, her relationships with her cousins were at a 13 yr old schoolgirl level, and the situation with her spying on her stepfather was just ludicrous. The heroine wanted to be a strong woman...she failed, she came over as a selfish, self-centred, whining manipulative, controlling brat. The hero's patience with her patterned an abuse victim relating to his abuser. Thank goodness, for her other books e.g. The Nymph King, The Pleasure Slave etc. If I had read this book first, I would have never read any of her great books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and sexy --- pack this book for your next weekend away!","review":"I've read other books by Gena Showalter and loved them but they were paranormals so I wondered how a straight romantic comedy would hold out against my admiration for her other books. I was not disappointed. Animal Instincts had me laughing from the very first page. Her characters are funny and original and the vulnerable-yet-trying-to-get-over-being-a-doormat Naomi is not your typical heroine. The story opens with her attempting to \\"unleash her inner tigress\\" and the tug of war between what she wants and what she thinks she SHOULD want makes for an engaging and page-turning story. Naomi is feisty and loveable and Royce (the beyond sexy hero) is compelling and adorable as he attempts to show her that good guys do exist. This is an excellent read if you want laugh out loud funny -- a modern chick lit voice and a fresh, sexy plot with original characters. I need to make room on my \\"keeper\\" shelf for Gena Showalter's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO ENGLISH LIBRETTO???","review":"Why, then that's a wonderful chance for you to learn italian.

It mostly depicts the efforts of the Moslem religious leaders to protect people during the massacre. But even more, it presents a view of the conflict and its aftermath from all sides. The film is broken into titled sections that first seem loosely related. But as the film progresses, it all falls together toward an uplifting and reconciliatory ending. It is well worth obtaining or seeing. Some subtitles are used when the characters speak in their native tongue, but throughout the film the main characters speak mostly in English. Violence was a big part of the genocide. Rather than graphically depict it, the film implies it will occur and cuts away. Nonetheless, as a viewer, you do get a good sense of the fear and sense of impending those being targeted felt. Finally, in the aftermath, you also get a good sense of the regret and shame felt by those perpetrating the massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Coming from the former USSR, I was curious to see this movie, but I have to say that I was quite dissapointed. It was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Cheap looking sets, characters one does not care about, annoing music behind the camera, lack of plot...

And by the time of this one they were really getting to be as good as any male band. This live cd should be in any rock and roll fans library. In fact it's great melodic metal/hard rock done with true fever. Songs like \\"gettin hot\\" , 'wild thing\\" and other songs slam right into your face with fierce all girl power. Back then alot of people were angry saying that this band shouldn't even exist! But they really proved that even live they were as good as any rock band out there. It's well recorded and tightly played. Soon after this the lead singer would depart which was a shame. But drugs suck in any decade , they take away the future and for the runaways they had only two years left really at this point.

It has been the open door to the path to my inner dreams and hopes. Nothing comes automatically after reading any sort of inspirational or reference material and the Author does not suggest that this book will do anything of the sort. She just very kindly, with logical order, presents the concept and inspiration to apply the simple living way of life to those who wish to learn and be supported in their dreams.

We were both disapointed when he tried getting the blades to come out of the glove because it has a piece of plastic that his fingers are supposed to grip that slides on another plastic bar. When the hand is pushed down, the blades are supposed to come out and then back up to get them to go back into the glove. It would be a good gift for a much older child because the plastic that he holds onto slides with the movement of the hand, but in his case didnt give him enough leverage to push it all the way down since his arm is so short. To try to fix the sliding handgrip, I had to put tape on the plastic bar to keep the hand grip from sliding down to his wrist, it helped just a little, he still has to use both hands to get the blades to come out.

Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts,\\" as if we needed another), sets it in Finland, and leaves its viewer stranded. The film is structured around a woman who appears to be attempting suicide by drowning her and her baby in a river; the side-stories follow from there. Unfortunately, the \\"we're-all-connected\\" theme of the film feels less genuine than even the the most uninspired of the subgenre. The film feels more like a bunch of half-assembled ideas patched together solely because the director didn't know how to conclude (or leave interestingly inconclusive) each story. The sad part is that the film is far from dull; yet your endurance through the entirity may seem futile by the end-credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set of cutters","review":"This set of cutters does a nice job.

The series itself is remarkably well done. As a staunch Morse fan, I was terribly pleased. If you are like me and do not want to spend the high amount for the full Morse Set, this is a very nice consolation until, hopefully, a more afordable Morse set is released.

Although The Magician's Wife does have a moral quandary, I wouldn't liken it in any other way to the writings of Graham Greene. There is one exciting, interesting scene in this novel, which doesn't happen until the near end, and it isn't worth reading the rest of this dull novel. None of the characters are fully developed. The main character is sucn a boring and emotionless woman, it is difficult to read the tale from her point of view. Three quarters of the novel is just filler, meaningless description, not even beautifully detailed description, just padding. I give it two stars instead of one because it was an interesting idea, and it does have the one good scene (the magician truly put to test). I...will give Moore one more chance.

I found this book extremely helpful. It provides insights into what goes on in abusive relationships and it helps to answer the big question you've been asking: why does she stay? It has a chapter specifically for friends and family of victims suggesting how to help, what to ask, and how to react if an abused woman confides in you. I wish I'd read this book *before* that happened to me! I could have avoided some mistakes.The book also includes practical (not rosy) descriptions of what abused women can expect if they file for a restraining order, stay at a shelter, bring in the police, etc. There's also advice on choosing the right person to confide in, the right counsellor, and the right advocate.If you have (or suspect you have) a physically or emotionally abused friend or relative, you owe it to yourself and to her to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best A-Z book on relationship abuse.","review":"I have recommended this book over and over again to my clients.

While I do appreciate the author's point that the abuse is HIS problem, she fails to cover what to do when one extricates oneself. The fact is that if the abused does not seek help to change her coping mechanisms, she will repeat the relationship over and over again. She ALSO, must learn to change. The author blames society too much. Puts us in a victim role with respect to that. Just as it was HIS choice to batter, it was ultimately HER CHOICE to stay. This book was WAY off base where it attempted to address the families with substance abuse.

Monte Walsh is just plane awesome and Selleck and Carradine make the movie a classic. What I enjoy most about these movies is that you don't have to run for the remote and shut it off just because your daughter or son come into the room. In fact, you WANT your kids to watch these movies. There is no bad or unnecessary language,,, I mean NONE, and of course, while there is some violence (as is the case in Westerns), its done with class and is not done to shock your sense of propriety. When the bad guy gets it,,, you say \\"yeah!.\\" When a good guy gets it, or a child is hurt, or a woman is hurt, you sympathize! Awesome drama.

I found the ending very different than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"Clipping Adam is a very moving story about a 14 years old boy dealing with an incredible loss. One that no one can truly understand unless they've gone through it themselves. The story takes place 2 years after the accident and shows a still very grieving family headed in the wrong direction. Adam on the verge of high school, needs to turn a corner, and attempts to do so with the help of a new best friend and a priest. It didn't sound very appealing to me either, but I decided to give it a shot and I am sure glad I did. Evan Peters is terrific in his debut performance. This movie is heart felt, genuine, and real. It showed me the best way to get over your problems, no matter how big or small is with the help of others. Hiding away and drinking, or not cutting your hair is never the answer. A truly inspiration film, with no Hollywood influence or unwanted story-lines. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance Brilliantly Portrayed","review":"This CD is simply one of the best recordings of the Mozart Clarinet and Horn Concertos (or for that measure, any music.)

Anyway, it's not a really bad choice if you want to try something different after enjoying too many Beethoven's Symphony cycles. However, it would be better to try Bohm/Wiener Philharmoniker, Karajan/Berliner Philharmoniker, Szell/Cleveland, Masur/Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Klemperer/Philharmonia, Solti/Chicago Symphony or Haitink/Concertgebouw Amsterdam first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard Bernstein Beethoven Collectors Edition","review":"This Collectors Edition is a complete waste of money.

The orchestration was not well balanced between string and wind sections, which can be easily noticed in the 6th Symphony particularly in the 4th and 5th movements, as well as in the 3rd and 9th Symphonies. The sound quality is also not good enough since it's a live recording. The overall performance of this cycle shows that the Wiener Philharmoniker acted as a third class orchestra and was not well trained under Bernstein, much worse than with Karl Bohm and Herbert von Karajan. Bernstein may be good at conducting Gershwin, Copland, and probably Mozart however, in my opinion, he was not the right person to conduct Beethoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have Meadow","review":"Over in the Meadow is my favorite children's book.

New experience on this genre.","review":"To begin with, you never expect these string quartets look alike those of Haydn, Boccherini, Mozart, or any other peers of romantic period. They seem to derive from the late Beethoven's. Emerson's performance is still greater than hyperion CDs performed by Budapest String Quartet in terms of sonority, clarity,etc. Personally I dare to recommend these CDs to whom already experienced a lot of the same genre. But, while keep listening over and over, I found why they were on a recommendation list in this genre. First I heard, very difficult to enjoy the music itself, with no easy-to-hum melodies, difficulty in recognizing the main theme, etc. More and more over and over, I turned used to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent recording of the Bartok quartets. This music requires careful and repeated listening to really appreciate the structure of Bartok's achievement. The effort is quite worthwhile. Common criticism of this recording is that the Emerson isn't 'rough' enough, presumably meaning even and relatively conventional tempi and intonation. These performances, however, are the work of musicians who aim at being a vehicle of the music rather than drawing attention to themselves. For someone like me, who is listening to these pieces for the first time, this is probably a particularly good introduction to the Bartok quartets. There are other highly praised recent recordings and differentiating among them is a matter of taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"As usual, the Emerson's just don't get it","review":"Yes, they play very well, they are always in tune, and they can play as fast as they choose - but they don't understand the music.

To really grow in our prayer we must think very hard about what prayer is and what happens as a result in our own hearts. Forsyth helps the reader to examine his/her own heart with complete ruthlessness, and yet the process does not result in fear, but joy. Joy, I think, because now we are freed a little more from the bondage of our perceived self and have come to know our real self. \\"The Soul of Prayer\\" is not a \\"quick fix\\" for obstacles in our prayer life, rather, it delves deeply into our motivations; into our values; into our convictions about why we are involved in prayer at all. The reader will find numerous ideas in this book to which the only reasonable response is an immediate prayer of thanks to God. A book about prayer that prompts the reader to pray with each turned page is a book that should not be ignored. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my header from welding","review":"vehicle 2000 Honda Civic SiI thought I was going to need a new O2 sensor and bung but it turned out it was only the O2 sensor threads that were corroded (120000 miles).

I heard Son of Sam on the radio a few times and picked up the Beatles-esque Figure 8, declaring it one of my favorite albums of all time (I gave that CD five stars in my review). I also picked Elliott's older releases though I didn't enjoy them nearly as much. A common observation on Figure 8 by Elliott's fans and critics is that it is overproduced. I'm not sure I know what that means, but if there was ever an overproduced album, \\"from a basement on the hill\\" is it. Hmm, how to articulate this? On many of the tracks, it's as if someone in the background is trying to ruin them (much as Jonny Greenwood tried unsuccessfully to do on Radiohead's Creep) by adding a dissonant something extra to each of the songs. I've listened to this album three times now, and shaken my head in disgust after each listen.

To be brutally frank, the tracks on this album have far greater effect than any of his previously released ones because he proved that he wasn't overreacting or overdramatising his heartache or existential woes - they were real. If anyone else had written the line, \\"I can't prepare for death anymore than I already have\\" (King's Crossing) you'd just label it as angst. That it's so openly confessed in this album makes it one of the most confronting lines ever written. But this album is not consistently what you'd expect from a man on the verge of suicide. It also features some of his most uplifting work like Pretty (Ugly Before). Sometimes the emotional intensity of From A Basement On The Hill is a lot to take, but it is a beautiful album with Smith's delicacy and rawness displayed to full effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Basement on the Hill CD","review":"So many gems on this album.

The album flows perfectly, every song is good, and it's my opinion that this is Elliott's best album.

And usually once they take hold, I cannot stop listening to them. From a basement is no exception to this. At first listen, his raw pain and emotion are too much to handle. But after letting the feelings sink in a few times, it has shown itself to be an incredibly vital recording, equal at most moments to his very best. Pretty (Ugly Before) swings from happy highs to frightening lows on the self-esteem rollercoaster of the singer. Fond Farewell is bitter-sweet, of course, yet just like a moth to a flame you return to it again and again. Twilight is the emotional apex of the album for me. The images his words paint take on a personal context, yet also makes you feel like you are there with Elliot at his most intimate and desperate.Not for the weak hearted, From a basement is an inspiring and depressing work. Smith's death is a terrible price to pay for such a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful window into an amazing family","review":"Darwin fanatics and Jane Austen fans will gobble up this delicious dessert.

I don't get what's all the fussing about this recording at all but... to me, this recording does not lose to the 1956 one w/ Schwartzkopf/Ludwig/Stitch-Randall (which I also own) at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I bought this book because I was starting a math club at my son's school. I was hoping that it would have rhymes that would stick in the kids' minds so that they could remember their math facts. Instead, the poems take some interpretation, and after that is done, one finds that the poem was about a circle (for example). But it does not teach anything about the circle. I thought the book would be useless, but we have had some fun with it. The children take turns reading the poems aloud, while the students listening say things such as, \\"Huh?\\" or \\"What?\\", or they just fall out of their chairs laughing. This book doesn't help with math, but it gives the kids a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will change the way you think about the Bible.","review":"We use the phrase \\"Judeo-Christian\\" constantly, implying that there is a common faith tradition between the Christians and the Jews. But the history of biblical interpretation by Christians has usually relegated the Jewish contribution to the past, treating the Old Testament as a kind of prologue -- an old testament -- which has been superseded by the truth -- the new testament. Dr. Soulen points out the tragic error in this approach. The book is neither liberal nor conservative, not fundamentalist or deconstructionist. It is a confident and hopeful basis for Christians to understand their faith and their Bible while still recognizing the ongoing reality and necessity of God's covenant with the Jews."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best refutations of \\"supersessionism.\\"","review":"It has come time for all thinking Christians to re-examine the issue of God's \\"irrevocable\\" covenant with Israel (Rom 9-11). In this book, Soulen has given the Christian community one of the best tools available for dismantling traditional theological \\"supersessionism.\\" This book should be used by all Seminary's for instructing the next generation of clergy. Soulen provides sound theological foundations and demonstrates thorough historical understanding. This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who cares about Jewish-Christian issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good assessment and conclusions drawn","review":"Soulen's book will get you to rethink OT theology on a few levels. first is supersessionism and the place for Israel. Second, is God's dealing with mankind through the Promise(s) given to Abraham. This he says is a key to understanding many OT issues and passages and governs how God deals with Israel and the nations. Many other positive things to say, it is definetely worth the price, even though it gets a little thick in chapters where he traces the development of supersessionism (ie when talking about Rahner, Barth, etc). Not a long or hard read either."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than useless","review":"I have been taking Sytrinol for over two months and tested my cholesterol a few days ago.

If you are not planning to use Cold Fusion then I would say definitely avoid this book, since some of the chapters required Cold Fusion to work through the examples. It is poorly organized and I quickly got tired of working with the Newmanzone sites that are used as examples (\\"all profits for me\\" is cute, but gets old fast, especially when the step-by-step instructions don't work).

I opened it up and it was written exclusively for Windows users. :-( I wouldn't have ordered it had I known.Additionally, the projects are not anything I will likely ever do and some of the step-by-step instructions are somewhat on the basic side and a real waste of space.

The story is moving, and very accessible to young readers, but also long-lasting. It's rich mix of symbolism and reality is smooth with no transition necessary to change styles. It will appeal to both the avid reader and the new. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly imagined and Beautifully Written","review":"With Firegold, Dia Calhoun has established herself as a writer of great promise. Set in a world like, but then not like, our own, Firegold is at once a coming of age story and an immsensely satisfying parable. It is easy to identify with Jonathan's confusion about his identity and physical changes as he struggles to distinguish himself and find his place in society. The atmosphere of ignorance, mistrust and betrayal that pervades his valley has an authentic feel to it, while the perceived threat of the Dalraida nicely parallels many circumstances in our own world where a fear of the unknown is often more destructive than the thing itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"The book jumps from 1 thing to the next. I never wanted to turn the page, but I am the kind of person who starts a book and has to finish it. The boy has a journey, which could be exciting to some people--but wasn't to me or any of my friends. Almost all of my class was in agreement, the book was HORRIBLE! The 285 pages of it (paperback) were almost all about brown and blue eyes. The repetitiveness totally ruined the story. Maybe if everything hadn't been said 50 times the book would have been better...but everything was said 50 times! I say if you read the book and find it to be good...you must be reading a different book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful compilation from an intelligent author.","review":"This book gives a great overview of the philosophical underpinnings of modern thought, as told from the perspective from a Neo-Thomist. Gilson is a master of his trade, as evinced by the fact that the book is very readable (at least for students of Philosophy!). In my lowly opinion, this is a definitive work that should be on every serious philosophy student's shelf, and it is a shame that no one is reprinting it at this time, so grab up all the available copies while you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great children's writter","review":"Vivian V.

After her visit to my small school about 4 or 5 years ago, I became really interested in her books. Actually, her speach made me come to love to read. Before then, I hadn't really liked to pick up a book unless it was for a school project (even then wasn't so fun)! So I bought \\"There's a dead person following my sister around\\" and \\"smart dog\\" and got them signed by V.V.V.

The word 'dry' pops into my head when I hear this recording.Not quite enough sound? Not quite enough passion?

But there are better interpretations out there than these. Recommended only marginally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard","review":"Over my now fairly long lifetime, I have heard many different recordings of the Liszt Piano Concertos, but this is the one I keep returning to.

It gives you lots to think about in our computer-centric world. Cochrane may come off as a little odd at first, but the more you read the more interesting points he brings up.

Definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants to hear someone blaming everyone for their problems","review":"I got this book hoping for an inspiration.

I have enough problems in my life without paying $20 to hear someone whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad performance","review":"I have always been a great fan of Ludwig and she does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast, I am afraid, are not satisfactory. Morris, Lakes, and Levine are adequate, but their performances are not worth the price of the CD.

What Levine may not provide much insight to Wagner's splendid drama, his interpretation is dramatic and flowing. This surely is the sets greatest asset.Unfortunately, the performance is let down by the cast. Gary Lakes is just a mediocre Siegmund. Jessye Norman's Sieglinde is vocally shining but dramatically unconvincing. James Morris's Wotan is quite authoritative. Unfortunately, his voice is not of great quality and his singing can sometimes be monotonous. Hildegard Behrens disappoints as Brunnhilde, for his voice, though shining in the upper reaches, sounds rather slender and is not heroic enough for the warrior maiden.A pity that Levine and DG cannot get a better cast to record this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from the orchestra pit!","review":"I am very glad to see the complimentary reviews on this recording. I am a member of the Met Orchestra and found it thrilling to record Die Walkuere with this cast and Levine. I am very surprised that nobody mentioned Kurt Moll as Hunding. It was the most amazing singing I ever heard. I would shiver as soon as he opened his mouth, such a menacing other-worldly sound. Unlike many singers who make several takes and some who go over and over their high notes, Mr. Moll recorded everything on the first take, one time and one time only."},{"rating":"2","title":"now here's my coffee table book","review":"very similar in content to the other bennet book, but definately worth it. nice photography, plenty of muddy rovers, as well as a lot of cool shots of the rover assembly line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good name, bad gun","review":"I used it for about 10 minutes and the gun smoked from the housing and then died right there in my hand.

Kneen gathers all kinds of critiques of the technology into one source, making this book very handy. On the other hand, he admits an opposition to biotech in any form, and in fact to much of technology in general, and this bias and one-sided view seems evident within his writing. One may well leave with a false impression that all Monsanto's critics are so close-minded - if you can tune out his rhetoric though, this is certainly recommended as a warning sign against genetic engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A textbook for advanced students","review":"This is a textbook for advanced students of Human Resource Management, but even old hands in this field can gain a new insight on different topics which are very often neglected such as career development or separation and retention.

If you want a good story to get caught up in, I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like junk food","review":"Reading The Wives of Bath is like eating a candy bar that isn't your favorite; it's fine while you're reading it -- entertaining enough -- but after you're done, you're still unsatisfied. The characters are a little too extreme (the environmentalist is way over the top with his reusing prophylactics, the magazine writer a little too self-absorbed to be real), the situations beyond contrived. Nonetheless, it's not the worst way to spend an afternoon -- provided you really have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book based on period memoirs","review":"This is very well written historical fiction which deserves to be much better known. Fowler clearly read many historical memoirs before writing this, and recaptures their flavor so well that I occasionally found myself forgetting I was reading fiction. At the same time, the narrative is more continuous and dramatic than one would normally get in a memoir. There are a few very minor historical errors, but in most cases the research seems impeccable. If I have a criticism of this book, it's that it doesn't transcend its memoir basis quite enough: it could use more drama, more extremity. Still, it is very, very good, generally on a par with Killer Angels and much better than the wordy and hyperintellectual Cold Mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best American Civil War Novels of All Time","review":"I re-read Jim Mundy this past week - for the sixth or seventh time. As I read this time, I kept wondering why no one has ever made a movie or mini-series based on the story. The story has everything - action, intrigue, back-stabbing, romance, and the other things that make a great novel. Most of all it goes deeply into the bonding that happens between among combat soldiers who, while perhaps not liking each other personally, grow close as they learn to depend upon each other in literal life-and-death situations. Another great aspect of the story is the sense of personal honor and responsibility exhibited by most of the characters. My copy is an original 1977 hardbound which I acquired in the mid-1980s. The paper is brittle and the glue is cracking and falling out. I'm glad the book is still in print so I can get a new copy when I finally wear out my old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful resource for knowing the faith","review":"Describes the Chrisitian faith.

I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it. First of all, it is vile. My husband tried it also and agreed it is like the taste of acid, and burns the throat just as bad. I purchased this in hopes of getting some relief from my anxiety and also to relieve my IBS. To put it nicely I'm lucky to \\"poo\\" twice a week, but when I'm stressed it is non stop. So every week is different. This product boasts its ability to regulate you, as well as to relieve stress and anxiety. I have not found this to be true so far. The taste is hard enough to get over, but it is not the worst part. After drinking it my stomach fills with air to the point that it is painful. I still can't \\"poo\\" but my husband will not be pleased tonight while I fart all over him in my sleep.

I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb.

This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication.

It tastes a lot like Alka Seltzer, only stronger. This product works really well. Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed. Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it. The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system. And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state. At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product. But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop. I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well. But you do have to watch your own body and adjust your dosage accordingly. I still take this product, but just not as often, and not on a regular schedule. Maybe that's just me.

I normally HATE live cd's, but the sound quality on this one is VERY good and Spike's voice sounds amazing as usual. The only problem is that there is talking between every song, meaning you have to hit that stupid \\"skip\\" button right after every song to keep the music coming. But the songs chosen on this cd are very good and the Gimme Gimmes are brilliant as usual. I personally think this cd should be $10 at the most however, just for the fact that the time of actual music is probably only around 20 minutes. If you are new to the Gimmes, I would suggest getting \\"Blow in the Wind\\" first, but if you are alerady a fan, you need this to complete your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen, and Have Fun!!!","review":"Where else could you find a cd where you could get punk rock versions of The Beatles 'Strawberry Field's Forever', and The Carpenter's 'Superstar'?

To hear their version of Helen Reddy's classic 'Delta Dawn' will bring a smile to your face, as with their version of Blondie's 'Heart Of Glass', one of the best versions of that song yet.

I like a lot of Me First songs, even the imperfections in some songs (like the 'i know, i know...' part in 'ain't no sunshine'), but here it's just annoying.The idea for the record is that Me First are playing live at a bar mitzvah, and that they're not very good. so they screw up in half the songs, and make a lot of jokes and remarks about eachother's playing capabilities.ofcourse it's part of the idea that the songs aren't too good, they're not supposed to put on a good show here. but i think it's kind of cheap to make a full-price CD of this thing.OK, it made me smile a couple of times, but i'm not buying this record. if you're a fan and want to have all of their records, or you've got just too much money, then go and get it, but the whole thing will get old really quickly, and you're probably not going to listen to it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfactory especially the features relative to the cost","review":"The receiver was easy to set up.

And even though they had tremendous power onstage, their studio recordings truly have a power of their own. This very jazzy rockstyle is played with such high musical ability in the arrangemens and solos. Also, they keep shifting themes and though there are many solo parts on saz, organ and guitar, it all fits in and never gets dull. This is a true classic from the swedish 70's and very, very original. If you like BO HANSSON and especially his second album \\"From the magicians hat\\", then this is a must buy for you.

Amazon's Packaging Stinks Big Time","review":"I was in shock when my Republic Gunship arrived without being packed in a second box to protect it. Amazon put the shipping label right on the box of the ship. It was not even packed in another box to protect it. If you want the actual box to be in good condition don't buy it from Amazon. My box was destroyed and had holes poked in it. I don't know what is going on here but if you plan to open box and don't care about the packaging being in good shape get it at Amazon. I had heard horror stories about other peoples packaging experiences but never thought it would happen to me.

Further, any book that can drag us guys into the kitchen to actually cook is a win-win for the whole family. I've made about 6 of the several dozen dishes and all of them have been great and relatively easy and inexpensive.

If you want to understand the dynamics of what caused the World Wars, you must understand 19th century power politics and the wars of unification. To do this, you simply must read this book. It fills in much of the gaps between the Napoleonic Wars and the Wars of Unification in the mid-19th Century.It is a well-written book, exaustively researched, and very detailed. It was a great book filled with interesting people. I also felt this was a a very good gateway book, as I like to call them.

I've had enough of pain and abuse as plot-points, and I can tell you that *this* writer's never goes near that kind of exploitation. Instead, he shows the reader the anatomy of evil -- so we can *recognize* it when we see it in the real world.

The one thing all have in common is their truthfulness: not a single phrase rings hollow in any respect. This collection is as solid as a rock; any reader who picks it up will find true gold here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short, sharp blade","review":"Andrew Vachss is a decent novelist. Decent meaning that for his books, it is the content that draws the reader in and makes you hang on. All the descriptions of his work you can find in any reviews are applicable: taut, sharp, hard-boiled to the core. It is in his short story prowess that he excels. These stories are quick and to the point. There is hardly more than the bare explanation that is his style and it sometimes takes the reader a moment to catch his breath and say, \\"Wow.\\" Yet, there is enough to drag one's attention into every character and make you sweat, wondering when vengence is going to come and how. Another great collection of Vachss stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this Book!","review":"I have seen the future of short crime fiction and it (he) is Andrew Vachss.

Everything in this movie is a tongue-in-cheek joke parodying horror/creature films. From the unattractive naked women, to the horrid CG, everything in this movie is intentional, and everything is a joke.The greatest thing about this movie is the fact that it gives the viewer the feel of watching an unintentionally funny film, without ever presenting itself as being a comedy. Everything in this film is so tongue-in-cheek that you will be asking yourself if it is intentional, or just terrible film making.I loved everything about this movie. It is wonderfully cheesy and thoroughly enjoyable; the absolute perfect movie to watch with a group of friends and make fun together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this one. And, like some of the other reviews mention, it is funny at first. In fact, the first half-hour is hilarious. However, once the unintentional comedy begins to die off, all you are left with is bad acting, bad writing, bad CGI. The main reason I even gave this one two stars is because I absolutely love this kind of stuff. I love cheese movies like Silent Venom, Dinocroc, Snakehead Terror, etc. This one, though, really just bored me. It really seemed like it was taking off at first. The piranha were growing exponentially, doubling in size every 36 hours. Cool idea. But, like I said, after that first half hour the filmmakers goof it up. No more really funny stuff, no good gore, just a by-the-numbers race-against-time that fails to thrill or induce chuckles. A fun idea that never reaches its full potential.

Nevertheless, Cullen is also careful to avoid over-inflating his subject's importance, even while placing him alongside Emerson, Twain, Martin Luther King, and Elvis.

Very informative material as his days as a Dustoff pilot in Korea to his time served in Operation Just Cause.

Mike Durant is a true American hero whose message of mission, honor and sacrifice is an inspiration to people around the world. Steve Hartov, the book's co-author and one of the finest espionage novelists around, has helped to compose a beautifully written story that should be on the book shelves of every American home, and anywhere that valor is respected and freedom cherished.Buy this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Company of Heros","review":"Having never been in the military I cannot easily relate to what Mr. Durant must have been feeling in captivity. However, being a military wife I can understand the terror and frustration felt by the family members of the deceased, as well as Mr. Durant's family.This very engaging book is quite interesting. If it were not for heros such as Mr. Gordon and Mr. Shughart, as well as the team from Task Force Ranger, we would not be able to experience the freedom that we do by living in America. God Bless those heros and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I loved this book, I had pre-ordered it and when it finally came I read it in 24hours...yes I stayed up all night and day!!

I was in the military during this time period and I had no idea what was actually going on over there. Support the troops!

I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't put it down. And I'm a tough old goat, so I don't find myself tearing up over a book very often! Durant tells his story with courage, humility, and a sense of reality (and humor, at times) that draws the reader right into the action.

This is an indispensable companion to Black Hawk Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an amazing book that should be required reading for everyone 16 years of age and older. Uplifting, inspiring, terrifying, compelling, tragic, funny, informative, educational--all of those things. I welled up with sadness several times while reading this. Other times my heart swelled with pride for my country and fellow Americans. Durant is a great American. He even has a great sarcastic sense of humor, even in the worst of times. I was laughing out loud at a few of his comments. Read this along with Black Hawk Down and you'll get a great perspective. Never once did I feel that this book was somehow redundant for me after reading BHD.BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeptical","review":"I was anxious to read Durrant's personal account flying over theMogadishu fire-fight scene. It should have reflected the sober andarticulate demeanor of a combat pilot who shuttles dozens ofsoldiers to very dangerous areas on Earth. Instead, the book wasriddled with Hollywood cliches and highly inaccurate statements. Ihave been involved with Naval aviation since 1976. I have workedin and on the A6, P3 and H60 and NONE of these aircraft have aouter skin of steel or is their construction primarily made of steel. Ihad to put the book down after reading these statements made bya commisioned officer possesing at least 10 years in the H60.

You want to make as small a hole as possible but getting the connectors through that hole is tough. A connection in the wiring just a short distance away from the connectors would allow a much easier and better installation. Trying to get the connectors through too small a hole can damage the connectors themselves. Other than that it is a great camera. Good vision and sound. Well worth the price.

I live in a very bad neighborhood and I have very bad neighbors whom I suspect have been tampering with my car, so I was eager to set up the cameras as soon as possible to catch them at their dirty deeds. Opening up the package was difficult because it was sealed in tight hard plastic that everything electronic seems to be sealed up in nowadays. I set the cameras up to my televisions and I could not really see the images clearly beyond 4 feet. At night I could not see anything at all. The picture at night was totally grainy even with light in the background, and it was just very disappointing. I did receive a refund after I returned it within two weeks.

I'd buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what I expected but plesantly surprised!","review":"Admittedly I tend to purchase cake decorating books based off of customer reviews and pictures and not actually reading what the book is about. So when I first opened this book I was a little thrown by the content. I expected to see pictures of pristinely decorated fondant covered cakes. Instead what I found was no fondant at all and lots of fun whimsicle buttercream covered creations. I do feel some of the designs wern't as perfect as I thought they should be given an expert created them (butter cream applied kind of haphazardly on the borders etc). However that somehow made me feel a little better about my own skills as a new decorator. One thing I LOVED about the book was her use of chocolate for decorations. It had never crossed my mind to make decorations out of chocolate and I was so excited to discover this that I can't wait to put it into action. All in all the book was a good find if you are looking for something besides fondant work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you like that style of cakes!","review":"I really do love this book. I have been a cake designer for only a few years. They (the authors) give wonderful instruction on making the chocolate decorations that they use on most of the cakes featured in the book. They give wonderful cake, but especially icing and filling recipes. This is totally worth having in your cake book library. The only negative is that there really isn't a lot of variety in the book. The cake featured on the front cover is the same type of cake shown throughout the book. There are a lot of different versions and themes, but they are mainly the same brighlty colored, whimsical style cakes. In their defense, they totally admit to this, and I am not complaining about it because I love thier designs, but I just didn't expect when I purchased the book that all of the cakes would be so similar. Again, I do highly recommend it if you like wacky whimsical cake designs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-catching, easy cake decorating","review":"I purchased this book to make a shower cake for a friend. I am so glad that I did. So far, I have made the chocolate butter cake and the cookies and cream filling... it was delicious and very easy to make. I learned how to make melted chocolate designs which I morphed into a white chocolate facade for my version of a stadium cake. The directions are easy to understand and the designs are eye-catching and the cakes, fillings and frostings (so far) are excellent. I highly recommend this book for artistic bakers like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one goes to \\"11\\" :-)","review":"I'll borrow the old \\"Spinal Tap\\" line, \\"This one goes to '11'\\" :-) and add that I'm sorry I can only rate it a \\"5\\". It's inspirational, fun, and will have you making a mental list of cakes, fillings, ideas, etc. that you won't rest until you've gone through them all.

Every one turned out great, well, except the choc. chip pound cake, but that was my mistake.I will say it once, a picture for every cake!!! I hate books that don't have a picture for every item, it drives me insane.The recipes in this book are great, the method of making chocolate decorations has turned me into a family hero (ok, exaggeration). I have made chocolate cars, horses, dogs and plants for presents, people get a thrill out of it.The only problem I have had with this book is getting the buttercream to hold up to some of the heavier cakes, but I will figure that out.

They are really into vibrant colors and give a lot of helpful hints about that but the cakes themselves were only okay, nothing earthshakingly different or unique. They give tons of advice from beginning to end for creating a cake, this is especially good for a person new to decorating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"This book is not all that great. They spend more time on all the chocolate decorations to put on the cake, than on the actual cakes. Most of the cakes are covered in these chocolate designs, not much instruction on actual cake decorating. I am a very experienced cake decorator and I was extremely disappointed with this book.

This book is full of edible cakes- in other words, they look like something you want to eat rather than stick on your shelf. Whimsical is the word to describe the designs.

I absolutely love it. The icing recipes are amazingly yummy. They are all buttercream recipes. They only decorate their cakes with chocolate decorations and buttercream icing, so they all taste wonderful. The best part is that they look just as good as they taste! The techniques are fairly simple. The cakes are sooo cute. All the recipes I have tried have been extremely good! No really, I now use the white cake recipe for my own. And I don't adopt a recipe unless it is the best I've ever had!

Though it purports to be a doc about Vietnam from 1945-75 this is mainly about the Green Berets and other military forces with little to no focus on American or Southeast Asian politics. This is not a historical documentary as it simply does not provide the needed historical context.

It has 2 main sections: The Byelorussian-English and the English-Byelorussian. In the back, there's also the English alphabet, as well as the Byelorussian one (the Cyrillic one, not the original Lacinka). It's kind of hard to read it (the dictionary) at first, because it seems like it was originally written on a typewriter, but you get used to it and find it convenient. There's also a phoentic section for the ones who are too lazy to learn the Byelorussian alphabet, which is helpful if you're one of those kind of people. Overall, a pretty good book for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"because i was told by several native belarussians that they could not understand a word i was saying, if not for my enlgish translation with it? so must be wrong somehow who knows ????! i am giving it away paranoid to use it now"},{"rating":"1","title":"INACCURATE AND DISAPPOINTING","review":"Hard as it is to find Belarusian-English dictionaries, this volume does a disservice to the Belarusian language and hardly fills the void. It is grossly inaccurate in some respects -- for example, substituting \\"g\\" (a sound not native to Belarusian) for \\"h\\" in its \\"pronunciation\\" guides. The vocabulary is limited, and in some cases marred by Russianisms rather than genuine Belarusian words. It also provides only imperfective versions of verbs, rather than their perfective versions too -- a very important distinction in any Slavic language. Plus, sloppy editing results in poor cross-referencing -- some words appear in the Belarusian section, others only in the English section. Unless one is familiar with Belarusian already, this book can be extremely misleading, more a hindrance than a help. Hippocrene Books needs to maintain better standards of scholarship before publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"pronunciation","review":"While visiting friends in Belarus, they informed me that the examples for pronouncing some Byelorussian words is incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for academic reading","review":"This dictionary might be fine for tourists, but I bought it to try to read entries from a Belarusian archaeological encyclopedia. None of the words I need help with are in the dictionary. The dictionary doesn't give any information on figuring out the Russian equivalents of Belarusian spelling, either, so there's no way for me to use it to look the Belarusian words up in a Russian dictionary. I wish someone would publish a Belarusian dictionary suitable for English-speakers who are trying to read old Belarusian documents and books about Belarusian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical lessons from ancient prophets","review":"\\"Elijah\\" is a decently written book that covers the life of Elijah. The main purpose of the book seems to be bringing present life-lessons from the prophe's life. This book is not a history book, instead it reviews what Elijah experienced, considers how he responded to those experiences, and then relates these responses to present struggles that the modern reader might have. The book is good for what it is meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read on the Life of Elijah","review":"Elijah is an excellent introduction to the life of Elijah the Prophet, a man who stood up to Ahab and Jezebel, defeated Baal priests, was fed by ravens, and saw mighty miracles by God. Yet he, like the rest of us males, was just a man who was vulnerable to the struggles and issues we face today.The book is around 180 pages and consists of 12 chapters that deal with various aspects of Elijah's life, whether he was standing up to the idolatry prevalent in his day or his need for deep spiritual and physical rest.Elijah is one of the titles in the Men of Character series and is an excellent introduction to the prophet's life. Admittingly the writing is tailored more for the layperson or the Christian leader who wants a spiritual growth read as opposed to a deep theological study.Highly recommended! Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly overrated","review":"A minor talent--both as a philosopher and as a novelist--whose posthumous reputation among his admirers so far exceeds what the reality warrants that it verges on the surreal. Look, this book has many amusing moments, and a few passages of genuine intellectual nimbleness, but as a whole it's only so-so, passably clever, often dreary and clumsy, and utterly lacking in aesthetic merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Disappointment","review":"Comparing Wallace to Pynchon is like comparing a kettle of sponges to Disney World. One is pointless inanity, and the other is entertaining and interesting.I tried, very hard, to like this book...I tried for years. I finally broke down and read analyses of his writing, critiques and speculation about the meaning of the writing... ...and it appears that he is that guy in the college coffee shop, scribbling in his diary because \\"no one understands the profound truth and emotion that he has discovered.\\" I get it. I just really don't care. There are plenty of those people who do appreciate DFW...and I likely wouldn't be able to stand those people.If you want 'highbrow reading with menaning' Read Kafka or Sartre for more prosaic insight into the human condition, or Dostoyevsky for a better narrative. If you want intellectually elitist literature, read Foucault's Pendulum.

Even so, I remember the reading experience as vividly as I remember eating oranges for breakfast this morning. When the covers of the book were open, I lived in a different place and among a different group of people. I loathe sappy love-notes to writers and books, particularly those penned by the Gen-X crowd, but the world DFW created in Infinite Jest was for that month or so as sharply real -- as sad, funny, bawdy, dumb, pointless, meaningful, infinitely inconclusive -- as the actual world that pushed back in when I closed the book's covers. I am a jaded reader to whom that never, ever happens. For it to happen at this stage of my reading life is a gift, because it means that I will continue to read good hard books forever, confirmed in the knowledge that it is possible for someone to create something this good, and that if I keep working and reading I may once again be fortunate enough to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one nude regent!","review":"Perfect marketing: I fell for the \\"challenge\\" Infinite Jest was presented as; also, I happened to have read Wallace's essays in Harper's and loved those.IJ shows that what's great in small doses is terrible in large ones, and IJ revealed exactly what someone mentioned earlier: \\"Too many words, too little story.\\"People seem so brow-beaten by the vocabulary and pharmaceutical jargon that they are left too cowed to step back and deem the book a monumental stylistic exercise with no character development or emotional depth.Read his collection of essays, have a good laugh, and stay way from IJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only person who doesn't like this book?","review":"Infinite Jest reads like a math textbook, and I question my sanity for pressing through till the end. The plot, if that's what we're to call it, is motionless. The characters are as sterile and flavorless as hyperbolic topological expressions -- it's not exactly that they are flat or dimensionless, they're just dull. Wallace inexplicably includes mathematical equations as part of the text, rather than in the footnotes ( ! Too full with the real plot events already?), and these equations are either simplistic or just wrong. Perhaps the nicest thing I could say is that all this is intentional, an attempt to match the style to the central theme of addiction, and if this is the case, Wallace's succeeded brilliantly: this book has all the coherence of the verbiose ravings of a strung-out cocaine addict. If you want verbiage as well as a decent read, I'd suggest Pynchon, Gaddis, or Eco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joycean!","review":"Attention college students: Just because it's long, doesn't mean it's Joycean.In reading these reviews, I notice that people who made it through this monstrosity tend to give it five-star treatment. For their troubles, are they rewarding themselves by way of praising the book?I got midway through. I think this book owes no small debt to the word processor. The author had a built-in Thesaurus, and he used it to the hilt. And the word processor came in very handy for entering and formatting all those footnotes!Far from being Joycean, this book represents to me the tyranny of the English Department.

Those at the tennis school are addicted to success; those in the halfway house are addicts of a different sort. Infinite Jest consumed a week of evenings, then came to a depressing, but hardly surprising conclusion. The author is quite talented; he created a memorable character in Gately, the halfway house manager. I stuck with this mainly to see what would happen to him at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the slog","review":"I made it to page 800 before I decided I was sick of this book. He's brilliant, yeah, and he never lets you forget it -- but God, he just goes on. I found the tennis academy sections borderline unreadable, and for the last 300 pages or so before stopping I was so tired of how every character needs some grotesque quirk, some ridiculous deformity or absurd method of \\"demapping\\" her/himself. (I like that term, though.) I just wanted him to stop the circus for a while and follow some of the absurdity through, develop a few points. He does that in a few places, especially with Gately in the halfway house, and in those moments he manages to be funny, mind-boggling, and moving all at once. But ultimately it's just not worth the slog. His essays are terrific, and I like what I've read of his short fiction. In those genres he gets the same basic points across that he's dealing with in Infinite Jest, but without the piles and piles of chaff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"First off let me say that I didn't finish the book, but I had high hopes of enjoying this read--even anticipated setting aside time in a busy life to accomplish that which many posters have claimed is near impossible, a complete reading of Infinite Jest. I read for pleasure and prefer books that offer \\"enlightenment\\" or fresh perspectives of social/psychological issues. The narrative just never seemed to get off the ground. Should I have persevered and given it another chance? Probably, but there are too many other books I am compelled to read. I really wanted to enjoy this after reading many positive, albeit cautious, reviews. It is the first Wallace that I have attempted, but I found this both ponderous and pretentious.

The premise of this novel is interesting, but it takes far too long to get to the meat of the matter.

However (and I don't know if this is typical because it's my first Kindle book), there are *so* many typos, this reminds me of some pretty bad software I used many years ago that would scan text from a print document and then supposedly translate it to computer-readable form. This software sorta worked, but it was messy, often inaccurate, and required lots of by-hand editing. Is this how Kindle editions are being created? If so, the software's still pretty bad, and it's really not a lot of fun to read a book with typos.Not a good first impression, Kindle.

That is the only possible way I can attempt to sum up Infinite Jest in just a phrase.This sprawling (900 pages plus footnotes!) novel is set just outside Boston, and primarily takes place in a breeding ground for future tennis pros and a halfway house for recovering drug addicts. Wallace's non-linear storytelling makes for some confusion, especially at first when we know nothing about the new calendar used in the book, and makes for some interesting storytelling.Wallace uses a fascinating, involved story to comment on the interplay of addiction and entertainment in our society. He uses emotions and imagery ranging from stark and harsh to warm and familial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've just had three weeks of my life sucked away","review":"I would derive sincere pleasure in hunting down this Wallace character, wrapping him up in a burlap sack, and beating him senseless with a two by four. His pedantic, painfully forced, prose makes text-books seem fun. I should have known - whenever the word \\"post-modern\\" (a term that no one, not even its users, can define) is used to describe something, my eyebrow raises.

I barely made it through 150 pages of Infinite Jest...there is just too much to figure out! I didn't like so many characters (I would have just liked to hear about the one family), and I think that you need to be doctoral student in literature to unravel all of the language. I am not one to give up on books (I read The Corrections!) but I was starting to dread my nightly reading times thinking about returning to this maze of a book! No offense to the author's triumph...I guess I am not that smart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"I pick up on this book when Wallace's editor recently published a book that he had left unfinished. The reviews sounded interesting and made Wallace sound like some one I wanted to read. The book is about addiction. You almost need to be an addict to appreciate it. It digs deep into the 12 step program and occasionally throughout the book has insightful asides (sort of like Meville describing very species of whale). But it is a poor read the story does not flow. I was more than 1/4 of the way thru before it made any sense. And then at the end it just stops, does not tie the stories together in any way.As you can tell from my title I find the hype on this book pretentious. It is a long slogging read find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read every damned word. I was robbed.","review":"I will readily admit that Wallace has done something no other author has done for me: he has made me care less about his characters at the end of the book than I did before I even began. Other authors have provided dull, dreadful stories where I cared less by the end than at the beginning - but Wallace goes deeper. Imagine an \\"interest index\\" with boredom as zero: only Wallace has taken me into negative numbers. Unfortunately, the book has its bright moments. There are perhaps a hundred good pages buried in layers of pasty muck - just enough to string you along and make you think that maybe, by the end, there WILL be a payoff. Let me save you the trouble. There isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes For A Nice Doorstop","review":"Urghh, I'll never forget the summer I wasted trying to get through this book. Can you say, uh, boring? [Insert worthless footnote here].I think I got to page 700 or so before I stopped caring about the life of adolescent tennis pros, football punters, garbage collection, and all sorts of non-sequiters.Clearly the most over-rated piece of literary diarrhea ever written. It is almost like Wallace wrote a computer program to generate massive paragraphs filled with random sentences that individually made sense, but collectively were incoherent. And to mock the reader, he filled it with worthless footnotes that pretend to enlighten the victim of his prose, but only served to lengthen the torture he inflicted on the reader.I will never get those weeks that I spent reading this trash back...I was in the prime of life, and to waste it reading such garbage...arghhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it's infinite","review":"The incredible praise for this book is further evidence to my theory that the world has gone temporarily insane. So what's wrong with this book? Quite simply, it's lacking both a plot and compelling characters. However, it is quirky and goofy at times and long and has lots of big words and lots of detailed information about nothing in particular.

Academic intellectuals praise it because it does have a wordy cleverness but, as I asked a writing teacher at Pomona College - where I believe Wallace taught, 'Why is a piece of writing is better simply because it's full of inside references that only a few academics understand?\\" There are a few sections that show a bit of story telling, but about 950 other pages of sleep inducing nonsense.

There is no question about the author's ability to write, or his quick mind, but I tired of reading about potheads years and years ago. There is now no more tedious subject in literature than drugs unless it is self-gratification. And in the early portions of this book the dope stories follow each other like penguins in a queue.

Never have I read such brilliant fiction, and although I'm moving on to Pynchon after finishing this novel, I'm finding it hard to not just go back to page one.. Quite easily the best novel I've ever read (although I'll admit I'm not that well read). Infinite Jest is not nearly as difficult as some reviewers have made it out to be, so if you're considering attempting to read it, go for it. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Version: More than worth it","review":"The only drawback to reading the novel has been the weightiness, and the need for two bookmarks while looking up the hilarious footnotes.

Since this same accusation has been levelled against James Joyce (author of Ulysses and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man), it seems appropriate to use a quote by Paul Smith explaining Joyce to give a little insight into Wallace's novel: \\"We have come to see that Joyce (or Wallace) is no mere trifler with Gertrudesteinwayed words; no Greenwich-Village- Montmartre sensationalist, striving to astound the bourgeoisie; no manufacturer of privy-poetry for smart young intellectuals; but a sensitive, scholarly craftsman, a-search for a new way to record the secrets of the human soul.\\" Infinite Jest tackles the job of recording the soul's secrets, whether beautiful or ghastly, more effectively than any work of art I've ever come across. And isn't that the point of art in the first place?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know if it was good or bad but couldn't stop.","review":"You can read the rest of the reviews for a discussion of theplot, characters, etc., but the way I read it best describesit.

Aside from a smattering of brilliant passages addressing various addictions and compulsions I found the book shapeless and essentially without vision. I keep hearing about Wallace's \\"genius\\" but mostly what I picked up on was an almost ridiculous obsession with minutia and absurdly arcane detail. I probably should have started with his essays. As it is, this book pretty much put me off. I'll go back to reading Pynchon whose fluid and ambidextrous prose makes reading Wallace like plowing through the unrelenting monochromatic drone of a term paper written while under the influence of methamphetamine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinite Jest","review":"The shipping was very quick and the service was great.

By no means is this an easy read, but worth the time. Despite the humor, it is very dark. Or it could be said, despite being dark, it is very funny. Having learned that the author killed himself, it makes me wonder about all the map-eliminating going on in the book. I am still reeling after reading it. I will be thinking about this book for a long time.Note to kindle users:This book is great on the kindle. With all the vocabulary, a dictionary is a must have.

This one I found myself thinking not about what I was reading, but rather how much more of it I had to read. When I got to page 230 (still over 750 pages to go), I couldn't take anymore.

But they don't really add up to much.Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Cover - Stops There","review":"Ok - I am pretty hard to chase away from a book, espically one that got as much hype as Infinite Jest. Is the praise for this book some kind of publisher-sponsored cabal?This thing wanders around worse than Blog. Does the next wave of fiction not require editing? Is there a voice in there? I confess, I couldn't even pick it up anymore after 150 pages. I came to this site just so I could rant somewhere.Comparisons to Pynchon are perhaps the greatest jest of all. Pynchon's work has a voice and a world. This book reads, at best, like the notes for a book. The first draft maybe, or the spewings of someone with a serious case of hypergraphia.And what's up with the middle name? Why doesn't the author just go all the way and call himself D. Foster Wallace? That's the pinnacle of pretense, which perhaps is the wellspring of this tedious tome.A bit harsh, to be sure, but with so many pages, I expected so much good reading. This soup needs reduction. There - now I can move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I have ever read","review":"This was one of the two worst books I've ever read in my life. I had hoped it might be like \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" by Umberto Eco (a book I like), as some friend suggested. But it bore no similarity at all, except in being dense, long, and somewhat difficult to follow.I found \\"Infinite Jest\\" to be plotless, self-absorbed, and wallowing in pointless cruelty and hideousness. It gave me a clear image of the author as being arrogant and self-congratulatory, and completely lacking in any kind of moral or ethical center.Life is just too short to waste on stuff like this. I only wish I could get back the time I spent reading this horrible book. I stuck with it all the way to the end hoping for some sort of payoff, something that would tie it all up and make the experience worth it, but there was nothing.

Although it purports to be \\"accessible\\" - and is so, in a fashion - I would not characterize this as a light read. The book requires a commitment of time, intellect, and emotion. But it is a suitably worthwhile and rewarding investment. I found myself interacting quite a bit with the substantial end-notes, and kept a dictionary on hand to extract the most from it. It takes a bit of work to parse everything that is going, especially in the beginning, but it is exciting as you start to see it coalesce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must own this book.","review":"I loved this book.

I have to own this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculus to our counting","review":"David Foster Wallace is a writer who leaves me ruptured in mind (his genius) and body (his humor). The human universe we see with the naked eye, Wallace views thru his own personal Hubble Telescope, and describes with a language that is calculus compared to our own simple counting. Reading Wallace was like looking, for the first time, at the drop of plain, ordinary water we call life; under his intense magnification, an astounding other/same world suddenly appears, leaving one in complete and utter awe. Wallace does owe me for a new dictionary though as he set my poor Websters paperback on fire and burned it to a dull gray ash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinitely hard to read","review":"I don't know, maybe it was just me, but this book was all over the place and hard to follow.

However, it's all downhill from there.The book seems to spend forever talking about tennis and drugs, without particularly wanting to tell a story.

I suspected it was written by an intellectual who was overstuffed, yet cool and who probably used a lot of big words and deep concepts while still being a very dry writer. A lot of people who were reading what they were supposed to read had this book in their hand and that also made me suspicious that I would find it very boring.And so I never read it.Until I saw that it was about tennis, and I love tennis. So I thought I will pick it up on amazon for cheap.I wish I had thumbed through it at a bookstore before I had done this.It was exactly what my first impression is.

Hip. Difficult? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.The setting: near future. The subject: an elite tennis academy, Quebec-separatist terrorists, and a drug rehabilitation halfway house become entwined in the search for an avant-garde movie that's so incredibly entertaining that viewers become unable to do anything at all besides watch it. The plot takes quite awhile to start to come together (hundreds of pages), and the lack of certain central info can be quite befuddling (i.e., a narrative gap of an entire year's events). Reading through the other reviews, it seems that this atypical narrative arrangement seems to be the cause of some unrest. All i can say is: sorry boys and girls, the days of exposition, rising action, climax, and denouement are long gone.A postmodern masterpiece. Quite possibly the best novel of the 90s.Read it. Love it. And for god's sake use 2 bookmarks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinite Jest is a good read","review":"I like this book because it describes drug use and its effects from a large range of situations.

In many parts the book is super intelligently hilarious, albeit sad. I did not choose \\"I love it\\" because it often overly describes the environment, setting or surroundings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Lord....","review":"...it would take more space than I have available to talk about this book, which is already one of the most talked-about books of the last century. If you love books and love clever authors, this is a wonderful if challenging book. If you are looking for a quick or escapist read, move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect mix of pure fun and truly thought provoking, mind-bending art. A masterpiece!","review":"One word explains it best: mindf&#$. The somewhat autobiographical, definitely bizarre, and extremely funny outpourings of a genius. The strings of the story sometimes appear to be hung in the air, attached to nothing, and yet when you step back you see how they interweave to form a work of true beauty, unparalleled in its time. And while such a description might make the novel seem like some arrogant art piece, I felt so connected to the well-defined characters that even when the story took a back flip or a bizarre turn I was still hung up in its net. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the novel is that it lingers with you. For weeks after finishing I found myself thinking and wondering about the characters, projecting futures for them, and then flipping my new endings on their head to see how that would work. Not light reading, you have to invest and dive in head first, but worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could marry an inanimate object it would be this book","review":"From start to finish it was amazing.Only DFW could achieve such a feat of mental agility.A million stories all bound together in the same anguish."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT AUTHOR,GREAT BOOK","review":"WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BOOK..JUST STAY WITH IT & IT TAKES ONE ON A JOYRIDE RIGHT UNTIL THE VERY LAST WRITTEN WORD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've become addicted to this book.","review":"Okay so I'm not finished with the book yet, but I have a good reason: I don't want it to end. I've gone without sleep for too many hours, slugging coffee down my throat and chain smoking because I love these characters, the multiple story-lines, and the writing style. I've found myself actually cursing at the novel, threatening to throw it hard if something even more awful happens to so-and-so. I even love the footnights, which can be frustrating and rewarding at the same time. And I've never laughed so much while reading a novel. There are moments of horrible pain in this book that turn into something like watching a complete stranger fall off a bike--something inside me just splits. The dialogue is first rate, and I like how I have to break out the dictionary ever so often.

If you combine the total page numbers of the last three books you read, it probably adds up to about the same as Infinite Jest. So, just think of it as three books and plow through it. This novel is not as difficult or scary as it looks. There is humor on every page and it is very rewarding. The endnotes are a bit annoying, but you get used to it as you read on, and, as one reviewer already suggested, use two bookmarks.Be brave, and give it a try.

It doesn't work. The book ends up being a pretentious and self-indulgent mess. Wallace wants to posture himself as a Joyce or a Pynchon or even a Fuentes, but falls woefully short. The characters are shallow; many sub-plots are left unresolved; and too many witticisms are purloined from other sources. If this is the new direction literature is taking, please God, let me off of this bus before it crashes and burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Long, Bad Joke","review":"Well,what a mind numbingly boring,pretentious book this was.I'm sorry but life is too short for such turgid prose as this,and I'm sick of books that are all just literary allusions,please,enough already..The only reason I trudged though the morass of DFW's 1,000 page plus post modern conceit was because I had wasted so much time already,also I had the perverse hope that the hype was about something.I was wrong.Don't buy this book,and if you do don't read it,use it for weight training or toilet paper or anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"That isn't writing, it's typing.\\"","review":"Once you've discarded character and plot as essential elements of your fiction, what are you left to work with? Description, some shoehorned essays, perhaps a bit of meta-commentary on your chosen metier. That's not enough to keep me interested. If you're asking me to wade through 1000 pages, I want a *story*. Without story, all you're doing is showing me how clever you are.As Truman Capote famously said about _On The Road_, \\"That isn't writing; it's typing.\\" That pretty much sums up _Infinite Jest_, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Genius","review":"There are a lot of ignorant reviewers both praising and bashing it. And I'll say this: You can not read and understand this in a week. The slower you read it, the better. And you'll probably end up reading it twice! This book is the work of a genius and is really nothing like Pynchon. His prose is different; his goals were different, and his story's mystery and complexity has to be discovered. And on that note: If you felt that this book was banal, bloated, and lacked interesting content, he succeeded in manipulating you into believing what you were reading was normal. And yes, this was one of his goals. Simply put, he's a literary magician. This story has so much misdirection in it, that you'll wind up feeling humbled when you finally get a glimpse of what's actually going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?!! Long OVER-rated.","review":"I've rarely laughed out loud reading any novels...and this book was no exception. If I had read this novel when I was in High School I might have thought differently about it. I may have enjoyed the sophmoric humor or marveled at the descent of a drug addiction.So what? Wallace never convnices me that he has any more profound a view of the world than I did at sixteen...and that's the waste. I can appreciate new and novel approaches to even the most tired of experimental fiction but, his is neither. I believe he's decades behind his time. Don't listen to those that are fighting to be the first to proclaim the next Joyce, Faulkner or Pynchon. Even the novel mocks itself...and for good reason...a long, bad joke. By the way, I also used to think that the \\"Doors\\" were cool...then you grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and overrated","review":"Driven by some work ethic perhaps or maybe guilt, I rarely fail to complete a novel once started. In the case of Infinite Jest it got the better of me. Length is not a problem. Craft is. Themes are. Too much has been written about this bloated piece of work already. Reading it is just not worth the effort, and effort is the right word here. For a comparison try a page of two of The Wind-Up-Bird-Chronicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I got to page 500 or so and realized I had no desire to continue reading this book. Of what I read, I'd say maybe 25% of it was character-driven and the rest was setting description and fictional history review, which is really boring. I kept expecting it to get through the drawl and into the so-called \\"good stuff\\" (like in 1984, that horribly boring explanation of world and country history halfway through the book,) but after 500 pages that was looking like it wasn't coming. From reading other peoples' 1-star reviews it doesn't look like it ever picks up. So I give up. I wasted $17."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"I just finished laboring through Infinite Jest, and have to say that this may well be the most incoherent, unsatisfying novel I've ever read. In short doses, it's intriguing, but the sheer length (about 1,000 pages, and boy do I pity the editor) would suggest that there would be some degree of resolution by the end of this arduous journey. But there isn't.The book starts with an interesting set of scenes (a top-ranked tennis player getting rejected at the University of Arizona after a medical/psychotic meltdown in the Admissions office, a set of odd interactions around procuring drugs in Boston). But we then go back in time, never to emerge. When I finally got to the novel's conclusion, I just couldn't believe that so much undisciplined, rambling prose would leave the reader out in the wilderness.Save yourself lots of time and find another book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy But Works","review":"The oil is heavy and thick but it is fabulous to use if you have dry creased eye lids.

A very satisfying point : the photos are well chosen the most of which not already seen in other books. There are errors in the black and white drawings, a non-uncommon fact in Squadron-Signal publications. The color drawings are pretty good, some minor errors occuring here and there.

I loved this movie so much as a kid and held it with me as somewhat of a child's wish, I think we all wish we could fly when we are young. Paticularily if we have painful situations going on at home.Today there are a lot of films that make it hard for the whole family to sit and watch, this isn't one of them. A very good, heartfilled, touching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites of the 80's","review":"The Boy Who Could Fly is a lovely family film with dark overtones that for the most part keep it from becoming too sappy. I love coming back now and then to this film to watch it, even though I find the ending to be a bit too literally fantastic when everything leading up to that has been in a more realistic or dream-like vein. The cast is excellent, and like everyone else I love Lucy Deakins and want to see her back in films...what a natural, heartfelt performance. Jay Underwood is also heartbreaking. Little Fred Savage is wonderful; I love the scene where he runs out in the rain to dig up his buried toy soldiers--it reminds me of the scene in Meet Me in St. Louis when Margaret O'Brien knocks over her snowpeople.I'd like to make a special mention of Bruce Broughton's lovely music score, one of the best of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOY WHO COULD FLY","review":"The Boy Who Could Fly is an excellent movie for all ages.

My brother has autism, and this movie gives out an untruthful message about this disability.My parents, younger sister, and I watched it, hoping to see a good film about autism, but we were disappointed and angered that the producers of the film did not know any better.If you are interested in seeing a movie actually about autism, watch Rain Man (Raymond is autistic), or What's Eating Gilbert Grape (Arnie, in this case).Don't waste your time with this film. If the screenwriter did not do his or her research to the extent of realizing the mistake, the research was not done well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie of all time!","review":"I saw this movie when I was little and I didn't like it.

I'm just not sure if I should feel guilty about that!","review":"First off, I have to say that, IMO, the first one was better. It's usually true of sequels, so that shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone. As for the movie? Many of the jokes were crude and/or offensive to any number of religous/ethnic/political/ect. groups and/or peoples. But, you know what, if you can't take a joke then that's too bad, so although the jokes might be offensive, I don't think anyone should take offense. That being said, if you saw and liked the first movie, this is essentially more of the same. Harold and Kumar are the same likable loosers they were in the first film... and they're still getting high. Also, they're still getting lost. It's still funny though. Oh, and NPH steals the show. Again.No special extras to speak of on this DVD, but I don't know that they're really needed anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"The first Harold and Kumar film was funny and uplifting. I enjoyed it very much and recommended it to friends. This sequel is mean spirited and just plain not funny. It's not even stupid funny. Many scenes lead nowhere. It doesn't even approach clever or creative. A good film you can watch many times and enjoy it. This film was a slog to watch even once. These two make a great comic pair, I would like to see them togeather again, in a worthy script. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hate on this funny movie!","review":"Everyone loves to take a shot at light hearted stoner movies.

This one was a complete disappointment. Filthy, vile, disgusting -- moronic at best. I very much like Kal Penn as an actor (esp. in \\"the Namesake\\"). He has already made a name for himself and has a bright future. I have no idea why he would agree to do a movie like this. I now have zero regard for him as an actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't White Castle: Greasy, Empty Calories","review":"A four year hiatus from the almost-cult classic status of H and K Go to White Castle was not long enough to pull off this sophmoric film.In a desperate attempt to appeal to young males as its target audience, it features grossness-- such as explosive diaherra, killing Bambi, inbreeding, and gratutious, bottomless (as opposed to topless) parties-- in place of humor. White Castle made us laugh as it took us on the road to nerdiness,kindness,impossible situations and improbable coolness. In this film, all of that is replaced by prison rape, dopers and a sadistic Dougy Hooser. Where did they ever get the idea that misogyny was funny?It was not successful at the box office. It won't be any funnier in your living room. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as funny as the first, too political.","review":"The movie just like the title is too political, it tries hard to be funny. part 1 is way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel is even better.","review":"Ok so it is sort of a guy's movie. I, however, am female, but still LOVED this movie.I really enjoyed the first one, and the second (Guantanamo) is far funnier. I rarely buy movies (since I don't usually watch them more than once) but I bought this one.Not really for those with weak stomachs. Also, Neal Patrick Harris's cameo in this - incredibly enjoyable.Rent it first, but seriously, if you liked the first one, you'll LOVE this one.I <3 Kal Penn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Sequel","review":"Utterly lacking the charm of the first movie, this one bypassed the clever and jumped straight to the crass. It's guilty of the worst sin of bad comedy: making us feel embarrassed or disgusted rather than giving us something funny. I guess the idea is that nervous laughter is as good as real laughter. But to me, that ain't comedy. For example: Kumar masturbating in his bed and ejaculating on himself; or Harold & Kumar being forced to fellate a prison guard. I suppose either situation might have been made funny, but they weren't. We were merely expected to laugh at the outrageousness of seeing these things in a movie. Genius.Not to say the movie didn't have some genuinely funny stuff in it, but mostly it was just tedious. So unless you think films like American Pie III are the pinnacle of comedy, do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, not appropriate for most","review":"I wasn't expecting much other then to be entertained. I watched Harold & Kumar's first movie about White castle and had a lot of laughs. The movie was funny, enough said.This movie however is totally inappropriate. It is filled with extreme nudity and inapprorpiate content. My nephew watched the first movie and wanted to see this one, I figured it would be similar comedy and. Nope, this was totally in approrpriate compared to the first movie. I am not sure what happens near the end because I turned it off before it got half way through.If you are looking for good family comedy look elsewhere. If you are looking for nudity (and lots of it), sexual references (and lots of it) then check this movie out.You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"One of the worst movies ever.

It's like telling college freshmen that state law prevents them from reading Chapter 3 in their geology book.

I learned a lot about the space business, too, from a real insider. Cape apes, pad rats, they're all in here. Jack and Penny are a couple of great characters. Now that they've gone to the Moon, let's ask Mr. Hickam to send them to Mars! I heard he calls this a beach book. It is in the very best sense of the word. Open this book up, sit down, and you're go for launch for one fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fantasy to be a good techno thriller.","review":"I looked forward to this book because I really enjoyed \\"Rocket Boys.\\" I'm a space enthusiast and have been in the aerospace industry for almost 20 years. I was willing to suspend my disbelief, but this was too much. The characters are stock ones, the plot has every device thrown in (evil international cabal crontrolling everything, tough guy protagonist meets tough girl,etc.). All the good guys live and even get girl-friends, all the bad guys die, SSTOs are quickly built and all is right with the universe. Sorry, I wish with all my heart we go back to the moon, but this one ain't even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"First cat in space!","review":"This is a great book! I went to bed with an advanced copy prepared to just look it over. Fast forward til morning when I finished. I got up and told my husband - I just read a book that we're going to see as a movie, mark my words! I can't wait to see how they get the cat to float in space. I loved the love story, too. I actually teared up when Jack Medaris found what he found on the moon - can't say too much or I'll give the plot away. Anyway, want to enjoy a thriller which is also a love story which also tells you a whole lot about getting into space and staying there? You can't go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To The Moon","review":"I have recently finished Mr. Hickam's book \\"October Sky\\" and I have to say it was great. I am sure \\"Back To The Moon\\" will be equally exciting and entertaining"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a poor book, unlike Rocket Boys.","review":"I agree with Herndon, Virginia - this book had too much fantasy to be enjoyed. It's much like James Bond - the bad guys' bullets always miss, Bond has some techie watch/pen/car/etc. up his sleeve, only his exploits can save the world (in the book's case, energy usage), he gets the girl in the end.The prose of this book is not up to what we read in Rocket Boys. I suspect a ghost writer in one of them.Please buy and read Rocket Boys if have not done so already. You won't be disappointed.This book, however, was a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Science Here!","review":"This book isn't even worthy of science fiction.

This one will go in the Goodwill bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"sexist dinosaur","review":"SOMEbody needs to point out that the author whose book was made into a delightful movie, OCTOBER SKY, has made an entire crew of female astronauts into sexist caricatures in this book, and his new book, DINOSAUR HUNTER, which i bought from audible based on douglas preston's recommendation, is right wing anti-environmentalist...hickham, however gifted a writer he may be, is the dinosaur. buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts, but cardboard characters","review":"I felt the characters were weakly drawn and their reactions to plot developments pretty formulaic. The plot itself pushed my credibility a bit too much, and resolutions were all too neat. Hickam's purpose in writing this novel is to challenge our failure of imagination in manned space exploration since the Apollo missions. His creative adaptation of well-known shuttle technology to a lunar mission is meant to awaken us to \\"possibilities.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful surprise","review":"This a great book. It reads fast and it packed with detail without becoming tediuous. I really enjoyed the story and plausible approach to space flight. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Homer really work for NASA?","review":"It's hard to believe from this dreck. I don't mind suspending my disbelief for a good fantasy, but this is ridiculous. The absurd plot gets more and more implausible as the story progresses. Add to that stock, one-dimensional characters (I will give Hickam credit for developing the character of Penny High Eagle nicely), half-hearted attempts at suspense that are far too quickly resolved to be suspenseful, and an absurd ending, and you have a very silly, very bad book. Beyond that, Hickam insults the reader's intelligence by assuming that if he throws a little technical jargon into the dialogue, the reader will not notice the bad science pervading practically every page. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, awful book","review":"You have to wonder about some of the reviewers who are calling this a great book, great writing, etc. Have they ever read a GOOD book? It was a good concept, but it probably was rushed into print to meet the 30th anniversary of the moon landing since it shows no signs of editorial advice. His characters and their motivations are unbelievable and the dialogue is wooden. He is worse than Tom Clancy in trying to string together some scenes with international ties, and Clancy is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"credibility problems for Homer","review":"Sorry to rain on the Hickam-is-great parade, but I found the book completely implausible. So much so that I was unable to enjoy the ride. But let me say I LOVED Rocket Boys, and will try another Hickam book again.

Many unforgiveable mistakes. For instance, the opening date and hour of National Gallery, one of Oslo's major highlights, is wrong. It is close on Monday instead of Tuesday. I met a number of people holding this book standing outside National Gallery on Monday, and, unfortunatly, my wife and I were two of them. Other mistakes includes the business hour of some restaurants and background information of certain cities. For instance, the population of Voss is 13,000 instead of 5,500 (p.189)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Kindle edition!","review":"For only $1 less than the print edition, I expect exactly the same quality of presentation from a digital edition, which should cost far less.

Unfortunately the use of the guide was rather disappointing. The maps were in fact useless, because they were spread over different pages without a zoom function.There is no index. If you try to find information of, for example, a stave church, the search function of Kindle offers you a large number of hits you'll have to try, hoping to find the wanted information.The general information on Norway is ok, but I expected (much) more information on travelling options as well as accommodations.I'm afraid I would not recommend this guide to fellow travellers, certainly not in Kindle format.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"This travel guide was very hard to use...maps were cut up into parts, and further they could not be enlarged so were pretty useless. It was not possible to search on a particular topic.

The install is very straight forward, and was complete in 5-10 minutes.This drive is very quite, almost silent even when at full operating speed (writing a 40-60gb video file, etc)I like having everything organized, and this drive really helped with that, since I can keep everything on it until I know what to do with it...or get time to work with it.

Mistake. It comes with an SATA data cable but warns you - in the installation booklet - that no SATA power cable is supplied. Must be a simple item to buy locally, I thought. Wrong. Office Depot, Staples, Radio Shack, and Best Buys don't sell it. After chasing around and wasting time I ordered one online. Meanwhile, my computer is sitting on its side on the kitchen table with parts hanging.Somebody at Western Digital probably got a promotion on the strength of saving the company $1 on every unit sold. But in my view, shipping out a product such as this without including what's needed to install it is not simply short-sighted, it's unforgivably stupid.

So I sent that one bag, and Amazon sent a replacement VERY quickly and I was very happy. Two weeks after using the replacement, I notice that the top handle has started to fray off, and in a few days, it was already half frayed and I couldn't use it.

The laptop pocket is actually suspended off the bottom of the bottom of the bag so maybe that makes up for it.UPDATE: Now seeing that the price is back up to $45, I would not recommend this bag to anyone.

Chess Tactics for the Tournament player is a disappointing book.The themes presented in the chapters are in no logical order! They are just randomly slapped there for you to study.As another reviewer mentioned, the commentary in this book is very sparse. Sometimes they give examples to easy for the intended audiences (1 or 2 move combinations) and then give very difficult ones right after it (6 or 7 move combinations).Thye book crams many themes, sometimes 3 or 4, in one chapter. At the end of the chapter, they only give 12 excercises! How are you suppose to learn this stuff if they give an average of 3 excercises per theme?!Overall, I was disappointed.I own Just the Facts!, the 7th volume in this series, which is very good.

It may even make you want to purchase the rest of the \\"comprehensive chess course series\\"!!!. This book should be in any improving player's library and after going through it you will notice how your tactical recognition is improving, and the book is so well structured that you can go through it many times within a short period of time.

Oh well, at least Eagles of Death Metal still rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok, but \\"G.T. and the Halo Express\\" is much better","review":"My girls (ages 6 & 9) like these CD's \\"ok\\". Of the three CD's, I like the 3rd the best.Instead, I would recommend any tapes of \\"G.T. and the Halo Express\\" by King Communications. These tapes share musical bible verses in the context of a story, which makes them MUCH more memorable. Their music is original and very high quality. My girls and I LOVE all the G.T. tapes and have learned a lot from them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these CDs...","review":"We really love these CDs... One of the main reasons is that they grow with your child. The first one is kind of corny and drove me a little nuts, but my daughter really clicked with it at a young age. Then as she got older, the next CD fit perfectly. She memorizes verses at church and time and time again, she already knows the verse from these songs. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that I wished they put the reference in each song. It's only in some of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge","review":"The product information lists the measurements for this unit, but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much. This MP3 player is huge. One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket, well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size. Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac.The sound quality is very good, but not better than my wife's Samsung, which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket. Putting this thing in my shirt pocket makes my shirt sag and putting it in my pants pocket . . .well, you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. Buck's work. I read and loved 'Pavilion of Women', 'Imperial Woman', and 'Peony', but this book was lacking. There were just too many things left unexplained. Her husband's disappearance seems more of a cheap plot point than a real plot device. The death of her daughter felt again like a cheap plot point, and her son's death... ehh. I enjoyed this book at first, but as it went on, the story didn't feel as coherent as it had before. Sorry to say, but this isn't the best of Ms. Buck's stories. I guess you can't win them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by Erik Marcus!!!!","review":"A must read for anyone interested in animal rights. Could spur fundamental changes in animal activism. Give this to a non-vegetarian today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"There really isn't a reason NOT to buy his book. The price is very reasonable and the information in it helpful. I do not only suggest this book for vegans/vegetarians, but for everyone. In fact I would suggest that more people who are *not* vegan or vegetarian read it.Marcus is objective in his information, and the facts are undeniable (and documented). Everyone needs to know what is going on, what is really involved in the products they are buying every single day. I really felt inspired by this book and I cite it often in conversation. It is an easy read, very informative, and is divided up nicely for quick reference.I am sendng my parents a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool for people who want to end factory farming","review":"Erik Marcus succinctly describes the problems plaguing the animal rights/animal welfare movements, and offers practical advice for moving forward as a peaceful, effective activist. This book is concise, easy and quick to read, and is of great value for those who are aware of the needless suffering of factory farmed animals but can't quite figure out how to make a difference. Recommended for both veteran \\"animal people\\" and those new to the realities of factory farming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read Book for All Particularly Vegetarians and Animal Protection Activists","review":"Marcus writes one of the best book of 2005 with many unique ideas and honest evaluations concerning the state of animal agri-business and the effectiveness of the people who wish to improve the lives of our farm animals. One of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not as profound as I'd hoped","review":"The book was fine, I found the articles interesting but some of them were not as thought-provoking as I'd hoped they'd be. I bought it as a gift for a friend and decided to read it first. Some of the chapters just sounded like they were written by academics with too much time on their hands or grad students making a first attempt . . . a lot of analysis without any really profound conclusions that I wouldn't have drawn on my own. The more interesting ones were \\"Tony Soprano as ethical manager\\" and \\"The Sopranos and subjectivist ethics.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this so much on my little one, now I use it too!","review":"I love the smell of this spray and it hydrates really well without being greasy or oily at all.It keeps my DD skin fresh and sweet and I noticed how nice my hands were feeling, so now I use it too and I love it.I rarely like lotion at all because it leaves me feeling shellacked, but this really sinks in and feels light and fresh.The outer cap fits very snuggly so it doesn't pop off and mist the inside of your diaper bag, which is a real asset.This would be great in a shower gift basket since the scent is gender neutral and the spray's technique of delivering lotion is so quick and easy to apply.I use many of the Mustela products and am always impressed at how great they work and how great they smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to a New Series For Me","review":"This is the first Janeway book I have read and if, as other reviewers have said, it is not among the best then I look forward to reading the earlier efforts. I found the story held my attention to the very end even when I had begun to figure out what/who the nexus of the scam was. I started the book without realizing the author was the same who wrote the worst book I have read in at least five years \\"2 O'clock eastern war time\\" which is awful. But to give the devil his due I like this series and will read more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura","review":"In an inventive, imaginative plot, John Dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation. Each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who, about what? Cliff Janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent, canny, suspicious, and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself. What makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles, regardless of risk. An intriguing backstory, twisty subplot, and surprise ending make Sign of the Book another page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salo the remake?","review":"This movie reminded me a lot of the movie \\"Salo\\" (1975). Summarize it in one sentence: Torture for the sake of torture and zero redeemable qualities. There's a few fun gimmicky details: let's hit the rewind button! Let's include the audience! If you want to see a Haneke film that actually has meaning and plot (yet is still twisted) try \\"The Piano Teacher.\\" It really is a great film, unlike this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring .....","review":"Why does everyone put four or five stars for this movie? . This is a most boring movie I ever seen. I shouldn't of bought this video and I wish my money will come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time","review":"That was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not the acting so much as the script. I love the actors, which is why I rented the film, but the story itself is just so terrible. The odd little quirks meant to make it more interesting just made it more unbelievable and ridiculous. Don't waste your time. It's not scary. There is zero suspense. It's just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good - gets tiresome","review":"I was struck by the brutal realism of the first half, but then was highly disappointed by the time it was over. The problem with this movie is as follows: the family that's being terrorized is left with NO options and NO way out. Frankly put, this gets boring. Even if you are a sadist that simply wants to see graphic violence, there's not much of it, and nothing is what I would consider 'graphic'. This movie plays on the terror of a husband, wife, and small child being held captive by two \\"psychopaths\\", which is VERY scary and disturbing. However, when one of the psychopaths \\"rewinds\\" the movie to change an outcome, or when he stops to converse with the viewer, I felt the director ruined a perfectly good film to try something \\"different\\". I condone experimentation and breaking away from the norm, but it does NOT work in this film. Prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most horrible movie I've seen!","review":"I recently viewed this movie, and I have to say that it has few or no redeeming qualities.I chose this video because it was in German, and because it was rated with 3 1/2 stars, but this was very misleading.The violence in the movie was senseless, perpetrated by a couple of sick, demented men who had a taste for playing with people's minds and emotions, and who had no value for life.The couple of times that it seemed that the movie could take a turn for the better, it left the viewer disappointed.The movie dragged at times when there was no action, no music, and no dialog.Definitely not worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great german-austrian thriller","review":"A great thriller, which creates a lot of tension without any special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thriller for sympathizers of passivity","review":"although this film tries it's best to be both clever and experimental (the remote control scene would've worked in a different movie) it still misses it's mark in obtaining a plateau ot \\"truly disturbing\\". the innocents in the film were paper thin, uncannily passive, and totally unbelievable. the evil pair are quirky but are absurdly thrown together characters that never actually feel threatening. maybe one day there will be a remake. this could have been a contender"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off","review":"Usually I read the reviews of IMDB and amazon.com before I even consider buying a movie. 98% of the time they have been on point. This case however was the 2% where they weren't. I was expecting to see the most hard to watch movie of all time. Give me a break. This movie was so boring that I couldnt even finish watching it. The acting was good, the plot was decent but the rest of the content of the movie was highly overrated and very disappointing. If anyone else is going to watch this. Watch it with a CLEAR mind. Dont go into the movie thinking it will be some horror masterpiece like I did because like me, you will be disappointed too"},{"rating":"1","title":"German Nihilism","review":"This film seems to have no message, except the absurdity of unmotivated violence.

It is simply the most terrible film I think I have ever seen. It is killing without motive. It makes me realize why I like American films and tend to loath European films.

Boring movie","review":"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. It is so ... dont by this film.or else you would have just lost money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Bruckheimer Production this ain't","review":"A family goes to their remote vacation house and is visited by two seemingly harmless boys. Unfunny games ensue. Haneke likes to provoke, and this movie is no exception to that rule. He has some very interesting ideas about onscreen violence, and how the audience likes to participate and interact with it.This is definitely a movie to watch with several other people.I watched it with some friends and there were moments where everyone would applaud or squirm or groan in boredom in unison, but if you're like me, and you like to observe the reactions of your friends to movie scenes, you'll enjoy the effects of Funny Games.Of all of Haneke's films, I like this one the best, because you can atleast identify with someone, even if it's the doomed protagonists.4 stars doesn't mean you'll want to watch the movie more than once. So perhaps you don't want to buy it, but it's definitely a movie that once you see it once, you'll know whether or not it's one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Points for originality","review":"While I definitely can't say this was in the top ten best movies I've ever seen, it is by far the most unique. The viewer is kept in a very uncomfortable state throughout the film. There are several scenes where you may be pulling for the victims to get away only to have the rug pulled out from beneath you. Some have found the torturers' inclusion of the audience to be a detriment to the film, but I found it to be just different enough to hold my interest. Sometimes it's a nice change to watch a movie without a heroic victim who saves the day. Overall you may find yourself thinking of what you'd do if this or that happened, but you will be entertained in a sick sort of way and for that....4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold. Emotionless. Meaningless.","review":"This tragedy deserves only a cursory review:A literalist's nightmare of absolute sadism in a raw, vacuous form. As another reviewer stated, this sadistic film appears to have the same intentions as a snuff film. If you can actually sit through the two hours of this relentless sadism and walk away thinking, 'I really enjoyed this film,' you need serious psychological help.Cold. Emotionless. Meaningless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thinking Person's Horror Film","review":"There is nothing funny about Michael Haneke's Funny Games, included in his seven film box set. You have to see the director's video interview to realize that, with none of the conventional slasher scenes, Haneke is playing with our heads. The two terrorists seem like nice people, but they ignore all the accepted rules of a civilized society. As a result, we don't know how to deal with them and neither do the characters in the film. The viewer wonders what he would do in a similar situation and comes up with no answers. But he will not agree with the actions of the family being terrorized. That leaves him with a feeling of disorientation with no answer as to how he would have acted in a similar situation.This is a thinking person's horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh. my. god.","review":"s:no.no....no.m:this raging POS could not possibly result in entertainment. i only finished watching this because i wanted to get my 3 dollars worth. you can't possibly justify watching this. if it were good, i would say it was good. this is not good. it is bad. pretentious. and bad. you can watch it. i am sure you have your reasons. but i hope you feel as cheated as i do. good day sir. i dare you to explore the \\"meaning\\" of terror, torture, and callous brutality in the most boring way imaginable. seriously, go ahead. intellectualized violence is like processed fruit. or like watching the act of toe nail clipping: visceral, but boring. i said good day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the most terrible films I have ever seen. It is awful in its violence and at times the unspoken is even more dreadful. Basically these guys go on a rampage of killing yet there is never an explination why. They seem to just kill and torture for the fun of it. The acting is good but at times hollow and not a realistic depiction of fright. Basically it is a flim that should have never been made and would be better left in the box. If you are a serial killer or death is your thing then you might enjoy it. Otherwise take my advice and stay away. It reminds me why European cinema does not work in the U.S. We want tidy endings or at least to understand. This film provides none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Perhaps I'm used to the American habit of rooting for the victim, but I disliked the movie greatly. The family accepted their situation with little or no struggle and the director relied on us accepting too many things. There was no gun in the house. When the bad guy was on the dock with the mother and the boat pulled in, she didn't shove the bad guy in the water and then beg the three people in the boat to help her subdue him. Too bad Germans weren't this passive during WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who put their thumb in my Pi?","review":"Simply awful from start to finish. Arthouse films are dying and this production does it's best to accelerate their imminent demise. i won't disrespect any REAL films to make a comparison, but i will compare the pacing, direction, and acting to having a 600lb. crossdressing gorilla twist my four front teeth sideways with a rusty pair of pliers. The concept was intriguing but the delivery was borderline hogwash. Poorly directed, written, acted and executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still the worst...","review":"This is still the worst movie ever made. It is pretentious, self-indulgent, and meaningless. It wants to be cooler-than-thou, but it ends up embracing the very concepts it wants to satirize. Ultimately, the most that could be said about it is that it is an interesting failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinematic masterpiece","review":"This makes most so-called \\"thrillers\\" seem like Walt Disney features.Part of the unsettling genius of the director is the use of sound. The opening scene contrasts Mozart and John Zorn. Outstanding NON- USE of sound too. Touches, such as the wearing of white gloves by the duo, are brilliant. Must be seen uninterrupted from the very beginning.The casting is faultless. Moral? Evil resides in the ordinary.

He even paid the freight and said I could keep the helmet shipped incorrectly! ANOTHER Rawlings showed up! Now I have two helmets I didn't order. I did notice on the upc sticker on the helmet it said B90. Has Rawlings bought out Macgregor? Was the helmet mislabeled? Either way it's false advertising.

This program is a great mix of information about your body, simple straighforward exericise you can modify and start with less reps if you need to as well as exerices to advance to so you don't feel that it only is good at one stage of your program.

I would have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over 15 Minutes and No Relief","review":"This book falls short of its promises. I have followed the core and weight-lifting programs for two months & continue to suffer the same wrist/finger pain I had when I started. Based on the reviews here as well as the author's claims, I would have expected relief by now. Second, I have yet to do the core or weight-lifting programs in 15 minutes--both claims the author makes. Lack of exercise alternatives for weight machines is also a complaint.On the positive side, I have gotten more limber and certainly stronger due to following this program. I have also learned that some of the exercises I was doing may have caused more problems.All in all, I think there are better books out there focusing on Pilates/yoga or weight lifting that are more flexible. Their programs may not take 15 minutes, but neither does this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for any training level","review":"I am a personal trainer and was actually introduced to the book when one of my elderly clients brought it to me and asked me to help her learn and remember the exercises.

I haven't found anyone, yet, who cannot benefit from at least some part of The Core Program.What a well written book!! I'm excited to see what her new book holds in store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For all those people who thought they could never exercise","review":"I bought this book last November and read it through completely. I also performed the basic tests that determine each person's level of fitness. This week I finally got around to starting the actual Core Program and I can't believe how good I feel after each session. The most appealing thing about the program is that you don't have to be young and fit to do it and it's designed particularly for women. I have experienced immediate relief of hip pain and discovered that some of the strength building exercises I had been doing with hand held weights are not good for me. This book is really life changing. I wish she would make a tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it","review":"If the book attracts you at all, buy it. I have used it for over 6 weeks and have been amazed at the results. I spend more than 15 minutes/day on it, though. Usually I average about 20-30 depending on what else I do. Yet, the program is the \\"core\\" of what I do. I am now looking for a supplemental book since doing any series of the same exercises over and over again can get boring. Even so, I intend to return to these same exercises again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!!","review":"This may be a good book, but I highly recommend anyone experiencing health problems consult with a professional before going directly to a book. I tried using this book after having some back problems. After trying the excercises for almost a week my back pain became so severe I could not walk. My husband had to carry me to the clinic. My doctor had to shoot drugs into me at the clinic because I was fainting onto the floor from the pain. She said to stop those exercises immediately. I also spoke to a physical therapist and a naturopath and all were horrified at recommending anyone doing \\"the Cobra\\" without direct observation (I think it was that stretch that disabled me). I am worse off then when I started.So, please be careful becfore using these excercises without talking to a professional first and making sure you are doing them properly. I am only 34 years old and and went through childbirth 2 years ago with no painkillers. I can usually handle pain, but this was unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary","review":"Lou will always keep himself busy.

And many songs of 'Emoh' can be included in it as well.His songwriting hasn't changed signficantly since the last Sebadoh albums. But this time it's acoustic and more refined. Just Lou and a guitar, with some instrumentation behind it, most on the beautiful 'Caterpillar Girl'.'Legendary' is a beautiful soft song, and so is 'Puzzle'.

Then, the catwalk can fall down. You could hang Vader and Obi-Wan and spin them around. Then you send Vader falling into a pit of lava (and the set makes it seem more dramatic). But there are some flaws in this set. First of all, the catwalk can pretty much fall o its own, and Anakin and Obi-Wan can't hang for long. >Bud-Du Bum!< But at least this one does something else.

Many of the entirely new findings add to the flavor of Sigil as well, and the ending leaves the PCs open to solve post-war conflicts. Addressing the comments made by those that disliked this book... I found that most of the negative remarks did not speak to this issue of book's quality, but rather personal opinions on whether Sigil should have a war.

Quite a bit is made in this book about how choirs are not \\"elitist\\", but absolutely nothing is said about how sexist they are. Don't talk to me about \\"tradition\\". Choirs are part of worshipping God, and God's tradition of creating both male and female singing voices is far older than the human construct of English choirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"change for the worse!!!!","review":"The blend of this mocha java harrar has completely changed since 2007. For Years I have drunk this blend from coffee masters, ordering usually 8 x 12oz packages at a time . It was high in complex flavors, mellow, soft, mouth coating, low acid, with a faint background of chocolate, and low in bitterness, wonderful after taste -- Outstanding in anyone's book.The previous 8 packages (somewhat stale- from age?) and the most recent 4 packages I received are a completely different coffee!!!!!Very little flavor -single flavored/no complexity, medium to high bitterness, bright-not mellow, tinny and high acid - like columbian blends!!AND the cost is up 30%-50%. Coffee Masters should apologize to coffee drinkers and explain why they would sell a different blend under the same name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Kushner: Gardens of Earthly Delight","review":"Very disappointed with the book.

There's absolutely no information on the artists (or the recording years) on the CD! There's just the one sided card (the picture you see above) as the insert ... . Most of the tracks seem done by one group that's totally instrumental, the last couple tracks by one that uses a vocal chorus. Most of the tracks sound fine technically, but the last track sounds HORRIBLY muffled as if transferred from a 42nd generation tape copy. If you're not going to care what artists you put on a disk, why use such a horribly mangled track, Madacy??? And finally, all the tracks are rather lacking in inspiration. If you want a Tijuana Brass knockoff on CD with at least SOME redeeming values, search out one of the 4 Mexicali Brass CDs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my choice of Neil!!!","review":"This is solely a CD to make a statement for the politically advanced. I love everything about Neils music, except this CD! It is not my thing. He had a mission to state how he felt.

The choir may have seemed like a good idea at the time, and a lot of people probably dug it, but I certainly didn't. And-- surprisingly-- the DVD is worth watching. Most 'bonus' DVDs are rubbish, and detract from what should be a purely musical experience. But this one places Neil's anti-war fight in clearer perspective, with video clips in a mock-up CNN style. It also contains interviews carried out with him on the original album's release--forever enshrining one reporter's stupid questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"Some of these bios are simply fascinating, especially the ones of Lycurgus, Alexander the Great and Themistocles. Plutarch tends to do character sketches, as opposed to lenghty reports of battles. For example, most of the military campaigns of Alexander the Great are simply glossed over. However, he does show the moral actions and personalities of his characters. He is also a very good writer and fun to read; not too dry at all. I would suggest this book for several reasons:1) To decide if you would like to read more Plutarch. 2) You have mastered ancient history and are looking for character portrayals of these people. 3) You are looking for in introduction for study of the ancients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched Sister","review":"This collection of poetry is written from the point of view of an African-American woman who truly knows her station in life.

The very first since I started shopping from Amazon many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"The German Raider Atlantis","review":"A most excellent book and read. This book brings to life the true story of the German merchant raider,Atlantis. She was the most sucessful ship of her class. A freighter equiped with guns like a warship,their cannons hidden behind flaps,she was able to approach closely to Allied merchant vessels without suspicion and order them to heave to or if not, fire upon them. Atlantis captured as prizes or sank many unwary ships in this way. The crews of these ships were treated as fellow seaman and were in fact treated as their own ship mates. All sea worthy prize ships made it back to Germany with the prize crew. The realism and authenticity by far surpasses a book later published by The Naval Institute Press about the Atlantis,which I have read. Captain Rogge's book is by far the best book on the subject to read for realism. First person accounts are always best. Captain Rogge died as a Vizeadmiral in the Bundesmarine.

No one likes to hear about suffering for righteousness sake in our American culture, but if you're after the Lord's heart, forgiveness and trust in Him are imperatives. Bevere richly explains how to do it right and reap the blessings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lilly Sells Out","review":"I'm a sucker for a good historical romance, and I'm mildly obsessed with the Lowell mills. Sadly, this book failed to satisfy either of my passions. The writing is clunky and the historical accuracy dubious in places. The religious messages seem awkwardly inserted and more appropriate to modern Christianity than that of the 1820s. And Lilly is an unsympathetic heroine who causes a near-fatal accident--to which she never confesses and doesn't even seem very sorry about--in her misguided attempt to bring down the mills, and then happily abandons all notion of doing anything to improve the lives of the mill girls once she gets married. This book had the potential to make some important points about the consequences of industrialization, but it, like Lilly, gave up that notion in the pursuit of romance. Hooray for internal improvements!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christian Novels","review":"I must admit I have not read a lot of Christian literature, not as much as I would like, so Tracie Peterson's BELLS OF LOWELL were a great introduction to the genre.

I Could NOT put these books down, and in the process of collecting more of this woman's wonderful work. This series is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"No, this is not a book that I would recommend. It was a very, slow start and was ready to put it down. I continued after reading one review that says that it gets better. But I do not see how a heroine can commit arson that almost caused a death and there be no consequences. Did you say that this was a Christian fiction book? The fiction part, I can believe, the Christian part...not so believable.

This type of electronic game is primitive. It is so much harder to operate than the standard button types. If a stack of cards has more than 5 or 6 (#?, 12 is a full stack)cards in it you can't see the bottom, or top, card without touching a spot then touching the bottom card repeatedly as only one card at a time is moved(and the top card disappears) and so it goes to get to the last card. OR if you want the top card that may or may not be hidden you have to do the same thing. It is tedious and it is small screen which makes it worse. But it does allow you to move the stack, if you have the patience and the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"(Reviewer:Minionette)If your goal is learning about Cuban cuisine, this isn't the cookbook for it. There are no recipe introductions/descriptions, no traditional menu combinations, and not even an index. I'm also puzzled by the heavy dependence on lard, when olive and vegetable oils were prevalent in the cooking of my extended family and their friends. In fact, olive oil is an important component in the authentic taste of many Cuban dishes, inherited from their southern European origins.For an excellent introduction to the food of Cuba, try <Memories of a Cuban Kitchen>, by Mary Urrutia Randelman. Her recipes invoke the delights of my own mother's kitchen.Here's a 'recipe' for Cuban comfort food from my childhood. Heat a few spoonfuls of olive oil with 1 or 2 crushed cloves of garlic. When the garlic is golden & the oil aromatic, remove the garlic. Immediately drizzle the garlic-infused oil over mashed potatoes. Delectable--& healthier than gravy.

For the most part, these are academic essays not easily accessible to the average reader.

The show CHUCK always likes to end a season strong and this episode is no exception. This episode culminates the last four years of Chucks involvement with both the CIA and the woman that he loves; Sarah Walker. It is a race against time for Chuck to save Sarah life from death by radiation poisoning as he battles both the CIA and Volkoff industries to get Sarah the antidote. This episode has so much going on in it that they even had to shorten the opening credits. In usual CHUCK fashion there is also plenty of heartfelt moments and comedy.

I was hoping this would not be true, but it is. The smudge is not too bad, but it is annoying since the original wipes off 100% cleanly. However, an extremely faint smudge is 100% worth the reduced odor to me.I would like these more if they had no odor, and it would be nice if they didn't smudge.

I didn't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery. Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment. I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery.

Jacobs loved the city that she saw from her Hudson and eleventh street apartment New York City apartment. This was not the city that the master planners Burnham, Mumford etc idolized. Her city was small stores, and businesses, and the greatest possible diversity of buildings and architectural styles. People doing all kinds of different things. Life on the move. Density and diversity. Short blocks and lots of people out walking on different destinations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suggested movie to set the tone for the book","review":"I highly reccommend that anyone who reads this book download the movie \\"the dynamic city\\" (its free and legal) from the Prelinger Archives at archive.org - this video will show the reader the ideology in the urban planning world at the time this book was written and what Jane Jacobs showed us to be ineffective. A high speed connection would be best for the download.This is the best book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes understanding how cities work easy","review":"The book is written in simple enough language and concepts that you only have to live in a large city to understand what she is saying.

It's as applicable today as when Jacobs wrote it, maybe even more so. Jacobs gave me language and described how I see the world around me. She's totally right on about liveable cities and cities who adhere to her principles are thriving economic areas and those that don't, have seen a huge decrease in value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Shipping took a while, but the book is great!

I don't recommend this edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-have!!","review":"The Death and Life of Great American Cities is a genius book. Words cannot explain how powerful and convincing this book is, you have to buy it yourself to understand. Even at her elder age, Jacobs is still very involved in urban issues in the City of Toronto where she now resides, but even half way around the world people have been affected by her stance on issues surrounding cities, as many municipal politicians use The Death and Life... as their policy bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This is a great book.

If you get this wrong you get urban America.A few years after writing this superb book, Jacobs moved to Toronto, which the UN, Fortune magazine, and a lot of the rest of us think is one of the world's better addresses.

Ethics is the apex of philosophy and Motherwell's work was a visual search for a parallel to his ideas on philosophy. His elegies raised modern arts stature in his Spanish elegy paintings,because of the combination of radical visualization and intellect . Robert Motherwell On Paper isn't just about repros of work on paper such as the the collages, the ink drawings etc. this book has a good discussion of RM's knowledge and influence from Zen Buddhism.I have Motherwell's collected writings but refer more to this book. Expensive but worth it for those wanting to know a lot about Motherwell and Abstract Expressionism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and profound","review":"We glibly refer to our Founding Fathers as though they were beyond human imperfections.This book illustrates how Jefferson struggled and often failed, working toward his ideals.WHen I was a college freshman, the History instructor said Jefferson is one of the greatestPresidents. JFK once said the highest level of dialogue was when Jefferson dined alone. I know why now.IF the Founding Fathers had such barbed wired fences to work through, it's no wonder Congress today is so ineffective. It's an inherited political gene. The direct quotes from Jefferson show the eloquence of his language as compared to the 10th grade level of communication of our Congress members today. I'm off to Charlottesville Va next month and this book is the best preparation. On hallowed ground shall I tread.

One can see that nastiness and bitterness have always been a part of American elections, but in the end, good people usually triumph. That's not to say, that committed politicians--like Thomas Jefferson--don't pay a price for their involvement in politics--certainly they do--but their achievements endure for all the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overview of TJ","review":"A short very concise biographical look at the important factors and contributions of Thomas Jefferson.

Bernstein's masterful grasp of our third president's life and legacy allows him to peel back Jefferson's accomplishments and ambiguities layer by layer, while respecting the essential mystery at the core of his being. Generalists will hail this thorough and concise account of this multifaceted individual. Historians will appreciate Bernstein's meticulous use of source materials, his thorough familiarity with the latest scholarship, and his professional detatchment (unlike so many, this author does not obscure Jefferson with his own agenda, preferring to let his sources speak. As a wordsmith as well as an historian, I particularly relished how this book elicits one of America's gretest writers in language both incisive and elegant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"An brief, engaging overview.

It might be a bit too good to him, but it helps one understand the many facets of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I found it interesting and fun to read. I was epsecially interested in Jefferson's life in VA before he became president because he knew one of my ancestors and his political views influenced my ancestor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Tired Repeat","review":"Whatever inspired the author to write this when there are already so many books out there about Thomas Jefferson? And, this is merely another book of opinion rather than something new resulting from bonafide historical research. These Jefferson books that are slanted negatively with no real new information are getting to be a bore. Although I'm a Jefferson buff, I'm tired of them. No need for you to make the same mistake I made. Nothing new here. This is just another tired repeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good first book on Jefferson","review":"If you have read several other books on TJ, then this is probably not for you. This is a very concise 200 page book that somehow covers his entire life in seemingly precise detail considering it's short length. Very well written and difficult to put down. I also liked it because it seemed objective - Bernstein discusses some of the negative attributes that some viewed Jefferson as having. He also discusses the Sally Hemings issue at length.Great starter book on Jefferson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and bad writing","review":"Unless you know nothing about Jefferson and the period of American history in which he figured, don't think about buying this book. Don't even think of borrowing from local library.This is a rehash that could pass as a high school review book. And the writing? Well, bad writing, I think, always reveals the shallowness of perception. Example: Bernstein's Introduction begins with the epitaph on Jefferson's cemetary stone; Bernstein follows through with a few observations and then writes: \\"In life, Jefferson never found the quiet that surrounds him in death.\\" And who does? The rest of the book is even worse.I wonder how books like this get past the first gate. It should never have been published. It's certainly not worth a glance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meager product","review":"Why did Mr. Bernstein come up with such a meager product?--as though someone with an \\"in\\" suggested, \\"Hey, there's a commercial niche for a small book on Jefferson.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"This book is hard to follow, and written as a suspense book. I really thought this was going to be more of a history type book.

None of the previous reviews mention that they were discovered and picked up by Scratchy Records, the label of James Iha, (of the Smashing Pumpkins).

It was sort of unbelievable at times, with a teenager moving in with an unknown middle aged man. The actions that the teenager takes in the most part are understandable and teenager like. The biggest part the explosion, was extremely short and hard to picture. The ending just ended. I did not like the book. I read the whole thing and will most likely NEVER pick it up again. Rent it from the library, save the shipping cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"split second","review":"I am very disappointed with this book and probably will not even complete it.

What the reader is stuck with is an inane compilation of action scenes and half-realized sex scenes without much of a solid story beneath. Lucy, who in the end comes off as a sort of spineless character, is dragged through one bit of trouble after another. None of the cast lives up to a partial potential. The overall moral message of the book is lost in layers of vapidness.Having liked all of Ms. Davenport's books I've read up to this one, I'm sad that this one didn't join in with that club.

I used to run the pulp through at least once more with my Juice Man in an effort to get more juice. It cleans up easy enough with just some soap and water. I do not put it in the dishwasher.

It is not worth the bother of cleaning. The cleaning instructions state it is dishwasher safe don't believe it! I have had the pulp guard and the receptacle melt in my dishwasher. The time it takes to take the juicer apart and wash by hand is just not worth the effort. The more I used and washed the components the noisier the machine became. I thought it was the filter not setting right when assembled. That was not the case it was the receptacle being warped from the dishwasher. Causing the filter to rub against the pulp guard. Which in turn created plastic debris from the filter.The cost of fresh veggies and fruit makes a big difference too. A fresh vegetable juice cocktail cost 2-3 times as much as a bottle of juice. I am all for healthy foods, as far as I can tell a bottle of fresh juice is as healthy as freshly squeezed."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off on replacement parts","review":"It has small rubber stopper to stop the juice from dripping.

The pulp is very wet, so clean up is difficult, plus, there is too much waste. I have to spend more time preparing the items for juicing. All in all, I much prefer the old little juicerman jr for juicing, even with the warped plunger. I feel I got \\"taken\\" by falling for the TV commercial for Jack LaLannes power juicer. If you are buying your first juicer, don't fall for the commercial like I did. Save yourself some money and go for the juicerman jr.

My first impression was that it seemed very sturdy, very trust worthy. For the first two months or so, we juiced every day with great satisfaction. One day, however, we tried making a very large batch, and got a good deal of pulp in our juice. We stopped and cleaned the juicer, but every day after continued to get a small amount of pulp in the juice. The juicer would tend to off balance and vibrate as well. We changed blades, but to no effect.Last week, my wife tried turning on the unit and got only a humming noise, no spinning blades. She took it apart, and there are no blockages. Possibly motor failure. It's past the sparce 90 day warranty.

I'm not one of those who are totally into juicing as a way of life. Rather, I enjoy cooking and sometimes a juicer is used for a special recipe. In any case, I figured I'd give it a try to see how it worked and enjoy some fresh juice.Maybe I'm just not a \\"true juicer,\\" but to me, the amount of produce I had to buy, the amount of time to prep it, and the amount of time spent cleaning up afterwards is really quite a bit more than I'd like to spend for a measly 2 cups of juice.Thank goodness all the parts do come off and go into the dishwasher. However, pretty much every part was caked with pulp, so I had to rinse it thoroughly first. And, after washing, some of the parts were stained by the carrot juice.I did not find that this was convenient at all. It probably took me a total of 40-45 minutes to wash, prep and juice the produce, and then clean up afterwards. That's a lot more time than I want to spend for a glass of juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spout problems","review":"I dont have a problem with the motor (as yet) but do have problems with spout, it appears that a small piece has gone missing leaving it unable to click up to stop it dripping, also the hole that it left just lets the juice run down the side I have asked for a replacement but it doesnt appear to be coming, so its back to the telephone, apart from this it is a good juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"The plastic threaded shaft the cutter attaches to cracked and eventually fell apart so the cutter could not be installed.

Once I got it home, I juiced one apple and six carrots. On the last two carrots, there was a 1/2 inch of carrot that I could not push entirely through, and I was putting a good amount of pressure on the juicer. It looked as if the blade was filled with pulp and nothing would go through. This is not worth the money I paid. Once I was done I washed it off and packed it up to take back to Costco. I have a $[...] Krups juicer that works a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, spent too much money on Juicer and veggies","review":"Do not buy this Juicer, no matter what they claim.

At first it worked as well as my Krups juicer, but its big advantage was the large aperture, which allows me to juice three carrots at a time. A big time saver. The first thing that went wrong was that it just stops when it gets too hot. Some blog I found said to let it cool off and it will work again. This does work, but is a major pain.Recently, one of the screws that holds the plastic bottom casing tight has stripped so the plastic casing vibrates. It vibrates so much that the blade is somehow scraping the plastic from the case. The plastic scrapings end up in the juice, so it's just garbage.What a piece of crap! Sorry I bought it. REALLY SORRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic in your juice","review":"I just purchased the Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer Ultimate from Costco and am taking it back immediately. After making my first batch of juice I noticed black plastic had melted from the receptacle piece onto the bottom lip around the filter and yes, you guessed it, I found tiny pieces of the plastic in my juice drink which I had been drinking. Terrible flaw to this product, and very dangerous for those who don't notice it and are drinking plastic with their juice. I will not buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"good juicer until its rotor broke!","review":"Hi. I just noticed some people have the same problem as I do.

She is a great author and 'mother\\" of the religion. This book does lack actual ebbos(spells), but it is a great learning tool and helps take out some of the ignorance and hate that people (who arent aware) of the religion and what it stands for.

I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, one of the best I've ever read.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a Santero as my interest in Santeria has recently been piqued.Whether or not you have an interest in The Religion, this is an excellent book.It moves slowly in the beginning, and sometimes, Moreno Vega's jumps from past to present can be confusing. However, this is a beautifully written story of Moreno Vega's life, and her journey in Santeria.If you are reading this book just to read an autobiography, it's a great book. There's no way, however, that you can read this book without becoming even slightly curious about Santeria!Definitely buy it and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Altar of my soul","review":"The Altar of my soul was a wonderful teaching and learning tool.

Whoa, what a pleasant surprise! Anybody with a taste for supreme powerpop would be doing themselves a major disservice by passing this by. Every song is good...real good. In fact, I almost burned this out by playing it for my kids (ages 7 and 4). One spin and it was a must play for EVERY car trip. Interesting to note that \\"Bubbles\\" owes a huge nod to The Free Design. Oh yeah, the dialogue between the songs is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomended, especially for a fan of the Powerpuff Girls","review":"The songs all good, except for the mediocre \\"Go Monkey Go\\" and the bonus song.(Why didn't they just use the original version from the show?)

What a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Monkey Go!","review":"Shonen Knife, Devo, Frank Black, Bis...an great assembly of Power Pop/Punk bands doing what they do best, with a Powerpuff Girls twist. Even if I didn't like the Powerpuff Girls, I would want this CD. An all-star cast of hits, someone involved with this show cleary knows their tunes.Every song has a \\"wake you up in the morning, feeling supercharged\\" type of energy. They all work well together in tone and theme, without a loser song in the lot. The type of CD that makes you bop around the room dancing, even if just doing the dishes.In addition to this, there is a little Powerpuff Girls storyline going along with the CD, with each song focusing on a different aspect of the story. All the gang is here, even....Mojo Jojo!

I was a little leery of buying it due to several negative reviews but I have had no problems with it at all. Highly recommend it for saving numerous games."},{"rating":"1","title":"This does not work on any PS2!! Don't buy!","review":"Bought this for my son for Xmas. What a piece of junk. It says that there are \\"0 mb available\\" on this memory card. We tried it in several different versions of PS2's (his friends), all did the same thing, or just did not recognize it at all. I'm glad I bought mine from Amazon - no hassle return. They should trash it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst card EVER!!!!!","review":"This card didn't let me put ANY MEMORY AT ALL on it!!!When i go into the card sellecter that card said \\"0 MB avalable\\".The card is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"This card filled up with only 12MB saved to it and corrupted my save file. Completely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its breaks","review":"I got this years ago and I tried using it and it caused corrupt data in some games, I contacted Sony and this brand is illegal and will have your warranty voided if you tell them this brand was used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage device for PS2!","review":"8 times the amount of storage than a standard Play Station 2 memory card. What could be greater?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't use this with Kingdom Hearts 2!","review":"Overall, this is a good memory card. It just randomly doesn't work at the most unfortuante times. My two biggest complaints were:1. When I tried to save Kingdom Hearts 2 (which takes 90kb) it said that I had \\"insufficient memory space\\" even though I had well over 10000kb.2. I had a huge town on Sims 2 Pets, I had been playing for well over a month and had a full town, when I tried to save and it just said corrupted data. I reset the game and looked at the memory card. Instead of the Sims 2 Pets icon it just had a little block. So I had to erase all my Sims 2 Pets data and start ALL OVER AGAIN!In conclusion, this is a great memory card... IF you are willing to risk losing all your data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Memory Card 64MB","review":"This item is very good, and it is big enough to hold all of my data including system settings and network settings.I will always use Max for my gaming memory needs.Also when moving data from card to card, Max is really fast and you will never have corrupted data..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Buy","review":"Dont buy this card it only holds 6 games for a 64MB card.. ?? No matter what game it is. Choose something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"You're basically asking for all of your vital saved game data to become corrupted. I lost a vital 1300 KB file for my Warship Gunner 2, Soul Caliber III, Air Force Delta Strike, Lethal Skies II, and so many more of my favorite games!Steer very clear of this; it must be nice for the manufacturer to get away with selling you plastic incapable of anything useful at a price like that.In a nutshell, this is JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is very fickle...","review":"I bought this card for about 8 bucks elsewhere and I have found it is selective in what game data it corrupts and what it doesn't... I've played both Japanese and American games on it and about 75% of the time it works perfectly. It's good if you have way too many games and never enough space and don't mind taking a test run of the save feature to see if it will pull through for you or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangit","review":"this memory card wont work with kingdom hearts 2.i dont know why.it works with my others games(dragon quest 8,gran turismo ,x-men legends).it always says insuffient memory when im trying to save to kingdom hearts 2.dont buy this memory card ever!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Piece of @*%*","review":"How can retailers sell this product? It does not work with tons of games on the slim PS2s. They should be sued for not warning consumers that their product does not work with most games. Stick to the Sony 8MB cards. This is a waste of time and money, I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Playstation 2 Max Memory Card 64MB","review":"The card does not function! The PS2 keeps looking for a Sony 8MB card. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with your PStwo","review":"Picked up a PStwo, a couple of games and this memory card. Get it all home, and I can't save. A quick internet search finds I'm not alone. Loads of people having all sorts of problems. DO NOT BUY THIS MEMORY CARD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"Well, I got this memory card to go with my PS2 slim about 3 years ago. It gets 2 stars for having lasted so long. When I bought this I didn't know about all these negative reviews here, so when I tried to load my game save today and it said \\"corrupted data\\", it came as a bit of a shock. \\"Corrupted data? But I was just playing this yesterday and it worked fine\\", I thought to myself. Then, a second game save became corrupted. So then I went to Amazon to see if others had experienced this problem, and, lo and behold, they had. Personally, I consider myself lucky that mine lasted so long at all. Still, the knowledge that any game save that you are working on could suddenly corrupt at any time for no apparent reason is unsettling. I can't really recommend this item since there's no guarantee at all that your copy of the memory card would even last as long as mine did. In this case, it seems best to shell out the extra money to get the Sony memory card instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max Memory Card can ruin your PS","review":"I bought a couple of these for my kids to save space and $ from having to buy multiple 8MGB cards. What a mistake! If seems the card and included CD adds software code that overwrites and modifies the software for the console can damage your machine. Eventually our machine would not work at all so we had to send it back to Sony. They informed us that the problem was indeed the way the Max Card Software changed the machine, which had caused it to lock up. They strongly recommended we no longer use it as this is rather common according to Sony.Avoid!!! Do not buy or use this as it can ruin your machine. It WILL modify the code which can cause the console to lock up and no longer function."},{"rating":"1","title":"D:","review":"I bought one of these cards and it died and took all my data with it! This has happened to myself and many people I know, don't waste the money! These memory cards are by no means reliable or a good investment.It will most likely take an Action Replay or a codebreaker to get your data off of it if it dies like mine did. Even with that I couldn't get all the data back.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is not a game but a memory card. I bought this product brand new from Wal-mart with my brand new PS2 and it didn't work at all. Just as life happens I lost the receipt and just threw it away. What an embarrasment as it was a gift for my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!","review":"Over the past 2 years i have bought a 32mb and 2 64 megabyte memory cards from the max memory company. Each one has either had all files corrupted or is not able to be saved to. Tonight i went to turn on my guitar hero 2 game and for the 3rd time the memory was corrupted and i have every song which took me about 2 months to get and it was all gone and you cannot get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABYSMAL SERVICE. Stay away from Safeshopping!","review":"I've not yet received the item I ordered, even though it is past the delivery window. A simple inquiry as to its whereabouts was greeted by an extremely rude and unprofessional reply from Safeshopping. What you read in their feedback section is not necessarily the reply sent to the customer. They also violated Amazon's rules by demanding I remove negative feedback. Steer clear of this seller if you want to avoid problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this piece of junk","review":"This thing was a complete waste of money. I've had good luck with 3rd party memory cards on other consoles, but with both the PS and PS2, 3rd party memory seems to be garbage.So far with the Max Memory device, I've only gotten two PS2 games to successfully save. Every other game I've tried fails to save and tells me that the device is corrupted. Bottom line, do not waste your money on this unreliable piece of junk. They're more expensive, but you'll be better off sticking with Sony memory cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for the first three months...","review":"I have bought this product a total of three times in my life. I bought one for me and my brother about 18 months ago. It worked fine for about 3 months until it just stopped working altogether. I cursed lots because I had a lot of saves. 8 months ago it was the the only PS2 memory card they had so i bought it. YET AGAIN. 4 months later it stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"The only problem is the save and loading time is slower than a nomal card.Games than already have slow saving time will be increased.This card is good sports and racing lovers.Its' take a while to fill up this card.Buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Dont waste your money of this piece of garbage, I would not take another one of these or anything else made by Datel even if you paid me. If you want a card that may or may not be recognized by your game, corupts the saves it does acept, and just randomly decides to reformat then this is the memory card for you otherwise stick with the sony brand card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful who you buy from","review":"I spent more money thinking I was getting the real US version of the Classical and Statistical Thermodynamics book by Carter.. Instead I ended up receiving the international/Indian subcontinent edition. It was not listed as that and was being sold under the black and yellow US version. If I would have known that's what I was being sent, I would have bought from someone who was selling it advertised as that and therefore would have gotten the book for cheaper. Although the version of the book I received is in fact the same content wise, the quality of the book is much worse than the US version. I would just advise caution when buying this book if you're really wanting the US version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who learn by examples","review":"If you learn by examples, this book isnt for you! There's hardly any examples...While the first 3 chapters are mighty neat, from the 4th chapter onwards the lack of examples starts to be a real problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"a young Ford and Down","review":"A bad Harrison Ford movie. Those who like the simulated sex may rate it higher, it wasn't much better than fair (2 stars) though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clich�� Dipped in Cheese","review":"This movie appeared to be a horrible romance novel made into a bad film. The pillow-talk between lovers seemed to be from the imagination of a fourteen year-old girl. The banter amongst the flight crew sounded like someone desperately trying to be funny.IF YOU ARE A GUY - Don't bother. The action and brief nudity isn't it worth it.IF YOU'RE A WOMAN - The only tears you'll shed will be from laughing at what the author thinks is believable romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrison Ford and Lesley-Anne Down fall in love during war.","review":"Yet another World War II picture of a war-torn young man and a young woman who meet by chance and quickly fall in love. It all happens so quick. But what makes this film different than the others is a 36 year old Harrison Ford (who looks like he's 23) and Lesley-Anne Down star in the film. Harrison Ford did this film before he made Raiders of The Lost Ark and the other \\"Indiana Jones\\" films. This film plays like a soap opera and tries really hard to stir up emotion for you. This story has an interesting twist. Also in the cast is Christopher Plummer, Richard Masur, Patsy Kensit and John Ratenberger. DVD is in wide-screen format. Also includes Director's Audio Commentary and bonus trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUND -- GOOD MOVIE","review":"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR A WHILE. I REALLY WANTED IT FOR MY LIBRARY. I AM A WWII \\"NUT\\" AND THIS FITS RIGHT IN WITH MY COLLECTION. I PURCHASED THE NEW DVD AND IT WAS AT A GREAT PRICE. PLUS I CHOOSE THE ONE THAT WAS SHIPPED FROM NC AND GOT IT RIGHT AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have seen this one before...","review":"This is a very \\"flat\\" filmed thing with close to no story whatsoever - platitudes piled on top of another! Pitty, it had potential tough, with a better director... (It is most famous because Harrison wrecked his first marriage when he had a relationship with Lesley during the filming) Whoops, gossip! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"This is an absolute stinker. Harrison Ford with a 1970's haircut in a 1940's film. The complete lack of basic attention to the realities of how the French Resistance was planned and run from England by the OSS completely overcomes some of the reasonable acting. I am tempted to say why let the truth get in the way of a good story but this is not even a good story.I am afraid this falls into the category of films such as and U571 that paints a view of WW2 that the USA viewer would like to think actually happened but is sadly far from reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Romance","review":"Great Cast and what a romantic story. Typical World War II Drama and a good movie to watch when the mood is right. Harrison Ford is a charmer and portrays a WWII pilot very well.
