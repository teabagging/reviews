Sometimes you could not select any channels without having to pull out the tuner from the dock and reinstalling.When it worked it worked OK. But when we bought a Toyota vehicle I was surprised that I would not receive any discount for having more then one receiver? The only discounts XM radio gives is if you pay ahead by a year or so. Great for them because they get to keep your money and invest it. After less then a year I have cancelled it because it really is kind of expensive when you considerits content. Even music only is $10 a month and if you have two receiver that get's doubled now! I certainly do not like commercial radio anymore but not because of the commercials.

It covers beadweaving (off- and on-loom), wire work, soldering, tambour stitching, knitting and crocheting with beads, and a lot of use-it-right-now information on bead sizes, threads, cleaning, stone hardness, metals, and glues.The shortcoming of the book is that it may be too broad in scope and not deep enough in detail. But that can be an advantage: if you are struggling with a technique, you can learn enough from this book to know what to do next, whether learn a different tecnique, go to a specialist book, or take a class.

So I bought one by VDO and another one by Dorman. I was happy with the Dorman because it came with a rubber boot and 5 rivets (two of which I used for installing the VDO actuator). The VDO does not. But the VDO seems to be more solidly built. I know that VDO makes some OEM parts for BMW, so I expect it to last longer than the Dorman as the Dorman housing is actually plastic with a fake metal can on top. We'll see how they flare, but I hope I never will find out as I will probably not keep my car more than another 5 years. Oh one more thing, the VDO fits perfectly into the original bracket but I had to drill and file the bracket to fit the Dorman unit (3 mins job). If another one of the door actuator craps out on my Chevy, I will probably buy a VDO, though it cost $5 more. I could go either way though."},{"rating":"1","title":"VDO Unit Is Better Choice","review":"I tried both the Dorman 746-014 and the VDO AC89312 and the VDO product is much better,VDO AC89312 Door Lock Actuator.

Most films today do have sub titles. I don't hear some TV films as well as I once did, though I'm not hard of hearing ordinarily. Most films I hear are OK, but this one was a NO. And worse than that, no subtitles. So even though the dancing was a 5 and the storyline was a 5, I had no idea what they were all saying to each other though having seen it in the movies years ago, I knew what was going on most of the time. Bad idea not to include sub titles. English films, especially the series type English films rarely have them, and often many of the characters have strong dialects, so I can't understand half the stuff they say.

I may agree with others on the right casting, but this was not my genre. I mean, I love watching ballet but I hated to see ballet connected with divorce, alcohol, sexual relationships before marriage, jealous, mean words and actions, and swearing words. It was a very ugly movie with a beautiful ballet. The dance was exquisite but I didn't enjoy it at all because I didn't like the characters at all.

Every word that Catherine writes is steeped in deep spirituality, belief and purpose. She not only explains the different types of prayers and how to use them, but gives examples of how others got their prayers answered.

As I continued to watch it became clear to me that something was terribly wrong with Meat that night.The band is hot but because of Meat's poor performance I'm sure I'll never watch this again.

He chooses to change the vocal melody on so many of the songs & often finds himself rushing the end of each line of lyrics to catch up with the next line! It's infuriating to listen to, especially when he's rarely in tune.I hate to say this, but he should have overdubbed most of this performance & he should listen back to the performance & realise that volume does not make up for singing flat!I wish I hadn't bought this, although I give it one star for the great backing band & vocals & a good documentary included on the bonus disc (UK version)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm a long-time Meatloaf fan and was really looking forward to this.

Absolutely both funny and silly, the movie is one of the best of its era: the script is a good mix of making fun of Zorro's and his and our time's machismo, the main characters are all played tongue in cheek, it's an ensemble picture. Many scenes are so outrageous and unexpected that you can only laugh and laugh all the time. It's not Love at First Bite, but still it is a solid comedy.Best line: Diego Vega's \\"You are sitting on my foot\\" to Florinda, with the best ever seen \\"almost I'm going to die\\" face by Mr. Hamilton.Best scene: the whole Diego Vega's and Esteban's \\"walking and running and jumping in place\\" with the final \\"Florinda you aren't hurt\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zorro","review":"One of the best classic movies of comedy out there.

The \\"humor\\" in this film is so heavy-handed and forced that very little elicits laughs. There's really nothing terribly funny about George Hamilton playing a flaming faggot and dressing in outlandish costumes. There's nothing terribly funny about Rob Leibman screaming constantly. What was clever and gentle and affectionate in the Dracula spoof is simply offensive and tedious in this. Had it been made 20 years earlier, I could see where the creators of it might think they were ground-breaking; in 1981, no way!

The guy that plays the Alcalde is perfect for the part, a real tyrant with a Napolean complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great!!","review":"This griddle can cook 8 pieces of French toast at once, without excessive crowding. The pan heats very evenly, so that even portions not over the burners are hot, and the parts over the burners are not too hot! Nothing sticks (of course), and you can feed a crowd. This is a great buy. We own several Calphalon hard anondized pans, but this was my first nonstick. The nonstick surface seems much more durable than that of my T-fal set. This griddle is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Double Griddle","review":"My children LOVE pancakes & bacon, and what a great griddle for providing it.

I still can't get over metal blade hyping up this no talent trash but then again metal blade have had several steaming piles released over the last few years.The sound is just revolting almost as if the producer pluged the mics into the room next to were cd was recording.

I have come to the conclusion that the humorously named band Cattle Decapitation has to be one of the most talent-less bands on the planet.

Again, a great kitchen tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good kitchen gadget","review":"I was reluctant to add another gadget to our kitchen, especially one with a motor. But I knew my husband would really like it, so I bought this one. It's a winner. I haven't used the ice crusher yet, and I probably will never use the wisk, but the other attachments are very useful.As a stick blender, it purees sauces and make quick smoothies. With the two chopper attachments, we can chop up onions, make pesto, etc., without getting out the food processor. The Braun does a good job of chopping. Not quite as good as my full-sized food processor, but with a lot less mess. And much faster than using a knife to chop. I haven't used it on anything that slowed the motor down. Lots of power.The price from J&R; Music couldn't be beat, and service was fine. The box arrived crushed, but the contents were fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"braun hand mixer","review":"slightly heavier than expected but still able to use with one hand. mixes and whips well. excellent choice for all around hand mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"My wife and I loved this mixer. I wasn't sure we needed it, we have a blender that works well. After the first use, we didn't used the blender again.That was until last week, a few months past the one year warranty. It just stopped working. I expect a longer lifetime for a premium kitchen appliance that costs this much. Customer service asked many questions for their quality control, but would not assist with any warranty work. Only one and a half years of use out of this blender is not worth the price.I took it to the repair store. They said they cannot repair it. It was made to be disposable. There is no way to open it without breaking it.I would recommend any other less expensive hand blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and disposable","review":"I had less than one year's use with this product and it broke - and I mean light use. It broke when I was was grinding parmesan cheese. It's obviously a disposable item, as i can't find a source to fix it. And I paid $20 more than it is being offerd for now. I'm going back to more manual ways of doing things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until it stops working a couple months after warranty","review":"I loved the blender and all its many attachments, but it just died while I was using it to chop herbs. The local service center said that it wasn't worth repairing as it was no longer covered under the warranty. The first time it broke, the store replaced it, but now I am without a blender and have tons of attachments just wasting space. I think I'll go with a Kitchenaid as I have always had good luck with their products...for the price I paid for the Braun ($99), I definitely feel like it should have lasted much, much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cool Gadget!!!","review":"This is a must have gadget.

I saw this film many years ago, and it still stays in my mind as a \\"trip.\\" Of course being made oin l968, it is thematic for the times. It's got the music of the 60's and the styles and the language, but the character is out there, and the ending...you've got to see it to believe it. And this is many years before the Columbine massacre. All in all, though, I'd classify this movie in the dangerous realm, but interestingly provocative. Recommended!! (Not for the kiddies, though!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited film","review":"One of the memorable moments in the orginal occurred when one of the faculty matrons took up arms and joined the climactic rebellion. That moment and others inexplicably did not appear in the dvd I received. It was as though someone thought these images too offensive or scathing or something, and decided to take sheers to them.Considering what's out there nowadays on video, this is a most disheartening act, and I'm sorry to even have to report it. Thus, \\"If . . \\" receives a less than perfect rating from this quarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick's Inspiration","review":"All I knew about this film before Criterion released it, is that it won a Palm D 'Or at Cannes in the late 1960's (thanks to all you other good-for- nothing American distributors for not releasing it sooner). After seeing it, I understood it's influence on film history. This Malcolm McDowell performance is nothing short of Clockwork Orange Lite (and I don;t mean this is a negative way at all). A big notch randier than Belmondo in Breathless, but not quite the psychopath as in Clockwork. While we were busy going bonkers over the Vietnam war and fermenting revolution, English schoolboys were plotting their own deadly revenge....a crystal ball of a film that foresaw the potential of a Columbine 40 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it?","review":"Turned it off halfway through.Okay, it's this \\"great escapist fantasy that is a landmark in film making\\" you all cry, but is it?As a piece of entertainment I found it cold, unengaging and also boring.I'll give it an extra star for Malcolm McDowell, he's superb in anything he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original version","review":"This is not the original version of the film. This is the censored version. As such, it should be labeled that way. The fact that this film has been released in a censored version so many years after its original release is a sad testament on society today. I have lost respect for Criterion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebellious youth","review":"I don't know much about English boarding schools, but I did spend my fair share of time in a military school. I can understand the defiant attitude in the film. I appreicate the rebel mentality that Mick Travis and his friends personify. This film shows the boarding school life which has many parallels to military school and how they breed the rebellious youth to go against the system. Mick Travis is the defiant leader who rallies his troops for the ultimate act of terror at the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF... one of my top 5 fave movies","review":"Well ho hum. I love this movie, it's flawless. Unfortunately haven't been able to view it as it's the wrong format for my country.

The hole appears to be aligned horizontally with an element inside the screen base and may have been caused due to friction during shipping. The manufacturer needs to package the item properly (e.g. cushioning between the screen and the element).2) There was a bent round metal piece loose inside the screen base. It appears to have broken off from the mechanism that keeps the middle of projector screen attached to the horizontal pole. As a result, the screen hangs slightly down in the middle. This issue is unlikely to have occurred during shipping.3) The screen tilts backwards quite a bit more than what I expect from a pull up design (and certainly more than what is visible in the picture of the screen in the manual).Returning for a refund as it's likely another unit would also exhibit one or more of these defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad screen!","review":"I am working on my home theater, and just ordered this Elite EZ Cinema Plus screens from Amazon.

I always love shopping from Amazon, and I have many good shopping experience. But this time is really bad. It's a 74 in long & 30lbs big item, and not easy to repack and send back.

About a year ago I found it and read it. I loved it. Its got family life, friends, healing, and it strongly emphasizes the importance of love in a young girl's life. Though I am 15 and bought the book when I was 7, I still think its a wonderful story. I even read it for inspiration. I've read it numerous times, and its still an adventure every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light reading, but good fun","review":"As \\"chick lit\\" books go, this is decent fare. The storyline is certainly different than any other books in this particular genre (if you can call it that): psychologist is mistaken for call girl, and plays the part because she's interested in the cop who made the mistake. Oh, she's also supposed to be doing it for the book she's writing, but that's a pretty weak part of the book.The side storylines are a little distracting, because the interaction between Joe and Marlowe is the best part of the book. For example, I didn't care at all about the client of Marlowe's who's killed - it was just filler. However, I think the main characters are enough to keep you interested.I was reading this on the train, and while I didn't miss my stop because of it, I did hope that I'd have a few minutes before getting picked up to finish it off. Worth your time if you like this type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's gotten me glued to my couch","review":"I started reading this book and it was so hard to put it down.

It seems like a teenager tried to fantasize what a relationship might be like once you have a profession. Too much talk about getting heated, wanting one another, misunderstanding one another. Definitely not worth the money. Very dumbed down. The author needs to give the reader's more credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"But don't take my word for it...","review":"This book is nothing but fanfiction using pre-defined characters and settings from Sex and the City. It was so rife with rip-offs that I had to put the book down to roll my eyes about two dozen times, and many of the 'twists' were blatently contrived. This book was not even saved by the sex scenes, which were no better than a scene from your traditional sausage-inspired romance tripe. It's only saving grace was that the cover skipped the fabio-style long-haired blonde guy with a nipple peaking out of his poufy pirate shirt, and instead went with a cute little kitty. Awww...However, this book is a quick read, I'll give you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, uninspiring book","review":"How a novel with such a titillating concept could be SO boring, I'll never know. Marlowe is a psychologist who pretends to be a hooker to get information for her research project. Joe is cop who pretends to be a client to find out if Marlowe is the \\"escort\\" who killed a man. Both characters are dull and unbelievable. The plot developed SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOOWLY, I gave up about half way through and never finished the book. I read another of Author Alisa Kwitney's books, \\"The Dominant Blonde,\\" and enjoyed it, but after reading this one, I'd be reluctant to try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable read","review":"A very well put together book, recounting the original sinking of the Andrea Doria, the \\"Mount Everest\\" of scuba diving, and early attempts to salvage it.The second half of the book features the later popularity of the wreck for recreational divers, and early diving expeditions by recreational divers seeking to recover the ship's bell, china and other artwook and artifacts as trophies.For serious divers, the book provides an excellent insight into deep wreck diving in the days before \\"technical diving\\" existed as a distinct sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of life","review":"A new inductee to India Arie.

I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it.

These people swear in every sentence they speak. If you're a kid, make sure you turn the volume down so mom doesn't hear it. If you're a parent, don't buy this for your kid. There are so many fantastic anime movies out there. Please don't waste your time with this one.

Solid State records has just been off the wall with these great cds lately, it's like they are a gold mine for these great bands and records and this one is totally one of them! This cd is pretty heavy. I would def describe it as Meshuggah meets Sepultura and Slayer and then yells at them, a lot! This one is also a step up from the last cd, which was great on it's own. The cd has a lot of variation between the song styles, like one would be pretty deathy then going to a very 'metal' part, and then just when you think it's not gonna be there, the melodic parts come in to play. This one is off the charts, check out \\"subtille Alliance\\" and \\"Separation\\".This cd is just another reason to check out Solid State, with bands like ZAO, Norma Jean, Eso Charis, and more, how can you go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P","review":"It's sad that Living Sac recently broke up, but at least we have this and every other awesome album by them, to listen to.

Its a must if you want to complete the whole LS cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Death Metal","review":"Call it hardcorethrashgrinddeathmetal, or what you will this album rocks. There is no let up in the raging guitars and deep roaring vocals. If you didn't know better you might think the guys of Living Sacrifice were in desperate need of counseling. The truth is they just love music infused in raw energy and that is what you get. Fans of Disturbed might not enjoy this as it is much harder and lacks the pop elements that have marked most of the so called hardcore bands you hear on mtv (played right after Brittney on TRL). The only downside is their songs tend to sound fairly similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hardcore Album To Date!...","review":"this is one freakin' heavy Album from Living Sacrifice!! They have quite a few albums out, but this one, this one is just awesome. If you're a fan of hardcore, death metal and grindcore, THERES NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE DISAPOINTED!... Bruce (the lead singer for Living Sacrifice), with his low deep growls, he puts every hardcore screamer to SHAME! he is deff. an influence on me vocal-wise.

I've listened to many of their songs, cd's etc.Now the problem with this band, is that they just get boring, plain boring after a few listens, there's nothing new the next listen, especially on this album.

Which is to say it's all bigtime yawning material.I give it two stars for the two songs that I actually like to listen to.It's worth a buy if you're into your songs all sounding alike.

This book heads in a completely different direction than the previous controversial best-seller. And how ironic: The previous book's successful legal defense was that it was a \\"parody,\\" yet not in the \\"parody-funny\\" sense. This book, while not a parody, is far more humorous than her first work. Indeed, while Randall's first book will likely be taught for years to come, this I believe should be treated as her \\"first novel.\\" It has more of a voice that must surely be hers. It is both sweeping and fragmented, yet tightly and economically written.

Its sad that retards like this can make names for themselves in Hollywood. But to Arnold's credit he did come out with some good ones like ( Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Red Heat and Junior ).

This is exactly how me and my best friend felt in 1986. We thought it was the most aptly named film ever.In general, a film isnt necessarily good because it has AS in it. Its usually great because it is directed by James Cameron (T1, T2, True Lies) , Ivan Reitman (Twins, Kindergarten Cop), or John Tiernan (Predator, Last Action Hero).

It still has good fight scenes, some very nice gun shoot out scenes and the brother's standing up to the law and what they believe in the principle of the matter never lay down for anyone, stand your ground.

It would be hilarious if it weren't so obvious. There were really no likeable characters to feel any sympathy for. Yeah, I know moonshine is big again these days for some unknown reason, but this attempt to cash in on the craze really falls flat. Not enough action, poorly paced, and half the cast mumbling all their lines. Save your money.

This movie had a great cast which was totally wasted on an unbelievably bad script that took the movie nowhere. The level of violence is very sudden and ridiculous. I can tolerate a violent movie if there is a good payout (think inglorious basterds) but this one contained all the disgusing violence without any reward for viewing it. Guy Pierce (great actor) played the bad guy who was written more like a psychotic comic-book villain than anything believable. He was clearly trying to channel Christopher Waltz as Captain Landa? from Inglorious Basterds, but it just came off silly in this movie.

Not sure what he was trying to accomplish but he barely said a word during the entire movie and when he did, he mumbled.

The characters don't make you care about them, and it is fairly predictable and uninteresting. The only thing that keeps your interest are the over-the-top violence scenes (SPOILER ALERT: neck slicing, sadistic tar-and-feathering) which punctuates the film like bad car crashes along a boring drive. About half way through, I could not wait for it to end and felt like I wasted my $4.99 and 2 hours of time. I am not a prude and understand some violence in a film, but not as a substitue for an interesting story to go along with it.

Virginia, three restaurant entrepreneur brothers operate an illegal moonshine business. Unfortunately everyone wants a piece of the pie, one that they are not eager to share. The brothers consist of Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains and philosopher of the group. Howard (Jason Clarke) is a berserker, and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) is the shy driver. Jack is sweet on a Mennonite preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) who likes his \\"bad boy\\" image.Guy Pearce plays Charlie Rakes, a one sided unlikeable crooked deputy who makes us root for the moonshiners. Jessica Chastain provides a little style to the film as a city girl (former feather dancer) who wants to get away from Chicago and winds up working the restaurant for Forrest.As things pan out, young Jack must suddenly grow himself a set and take over the family enterprise against the odds. Good acting. High intensity.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Malinda Baker), implied rape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie and Well Worth Your Time","review":"I really enjoyed this movie despite the reviews at the time it came out.Ignore any online reviews by the so called media reviewers because thismovie is well worth it.I enjoyed it so much I bought some books here at amazon regarding this slice of historyof alcohol prohibition in America.The acting was superb.It shows the rampant corruption among politicians and the police forces and shows the story of one family (3 brothers)who refused to pay the currupt politicians who had the police do their dirty work.Rent it ..it's a 4 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been waiting","review":"I was waiting for this movie to come out to rent.

I think that the storyline could have been portrayed in a more interesting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawless","review":"I wanted to see this movie because it appeared to be great a period piece in the tradition of Bonnie and Clyde. This movie did have some interesting segments and the acting was pretty good but, the pacing seem to drag and my interest kept fading in and out. Be prepared for some very graphic violence. Was this movie bad, I don't think so, but I do think it had the look and feel that could have made this into a real winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bootlegging At It's Bloodiest","review":"Don't want to give any plot points away so I'll just say wow. What an intersting supposedly true story of a family of bootleggers. Loved Hardy's character the most out of the three brothers. Shia's character for the majority of the film on the other hand was somewhat of a coward. Guy Pearce's role was fantastic I must say. He was one of those villains you love to hate and wait for his demise. And Jessica Chastain vava voom. Good job honey as usual. Gary Oldman should had had a more prominent role but I understand this is about this group of moonshiners not this particular gangster he executes very well. To those who are on the squeamish side of brutality on film I think you people in particular should stay away from this picture at all costs.

First of all, moonshine business is not this violent. This movie is very over the top. The acting it horrid. The story is a disgrace.

It was exciting and entertaining. I usually can't sit for a whole movie - I get bored. This held my attention and was fun to watch.

This book was intended to study the anthropological aspects of the early American meatpacking industry and the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the workers involved in the industry and instead all it did was utilize reverse racism and political ploys to try and convince the reader that the reverse racism and extreme feminism are justifiable. In addition it is written by a feminist who states throughout the book that it's acceptable for women to do less work than men and still demand equal salary because men are the ones to blame for women being incapable of equivalent work productivity.I would never recommend this book to anyone.

Though a couple of channels came in reasonably strongly on the TV-55 reception is very poor over most of its range and the included amplifier make absolutely no discernable difference to anything. How poor is the performance? Well, I got a better picture on a wider range of channels by touching my own thumb to the coax connector than by leaving the TV-55 connected. Since my old rabbit ears get far better reception for less money than it will cost to return this dud to Amazon.com, I'll stick with them for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"I cant believe that I paied 60 bucks for this wothless piece of plastic, I hooked it up and the reception absolutly sucked!!

I used to have a cheap antenna that would get me two channels with decent picture and that's it. I wanted to get all the broadcast channels, and according to the box I could get better with this antenna. While it's true I do get more channels, they come in horribly- and the two channels that I did get with the old antenna well, they come in worse now. I live in San Jose, and all the transmitters are on hills and we live in a valley, so mountains and hills shouldn't be an issue. I will be packing this antenna up and taking it back. I STRONGLY recommend you do not purchase this antenna. It's definately not worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 6 months","review":"I purchased the antenna 6 months ago and had great difficulty positioning it for the best reception.

BIG MISTAKE!! I do not understand the good reviews unless they are plants, because this antenna is completely useless for VHF and makes no difference over ordinary rabbit ears for UHF (its actually dramamtically worse). I am not kidding or exaggerating when I say the bare antenna wire got better reception. Sticking my tongue on to the end of the antenna cable and using my body as an antenna was better for all channels than the TERK TV 55 (though not nearly as good as the rabbit ears). By the way, I used the very best antenna cable from monster cable. Beware. You will regret buying this antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I bought a couple of cheap rabbit ears type antennas for TVs in each of the guest rooms and bought the TV-55 as an over the air antenna for a new LCD in the master bedroom. After trying all combination of TVs and antennas, this is by far the worst performer.

Save your money and look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Performer","review":"I have purchased 6 different antennas, all of which received 8 digital channels if placed in different locations. I'm still looking for an antenna that gets all the channels consistently. Of all the antennas, this one was surprisingly the worst performer (And Im also including 15 year old bunny ears). I got splotches of the channels, but this was total junk.I have a feeling people who say this worked for them, never actually used another antenna. It works, but BARELY.

I actually got better reception on some stations with a cheep set of rabit ears. This antenna might work great for VHF, but I bought it for HDTV on UHF. Your 99 bucks gets you a very pretty antenna that works as well as some 25 dollar antennas. IF your location gives you great UHF reception, then a cheap set of rabbit ears is all you need. If your locations gives you poor UHF reception, the TERK TV55 won't help. Even with the high price, you still won't get better than light green reception (as measured on antennaweb.org). Save your money, or try a cheaper antenna first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but sensitive","review":"This antenna works well after I got it properly installed. The antenna is very sensitive to location and orientation, need to try diferent positions until getting the right one. Indoors, it is about the same as amplified rabbit ears but outdoors worked much better. Also need to use RG-6 cable for the lead-in, not the the cheaper RG-59. Reception was bad with 50 feet of the cheap lead-in but greatly improved with the better cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned!","review":"Like other reviewers, found this was a bad antenna.

It never did a terribly good job, but I had DirecTV as well, so I didn't care that much.I'm about a mile from Sutro Tower (where the vast majority of signals are broadcast in San Francisco), with a direct line of sight occasionally attenuated by trees, so I should have a crazy strong signal. After ditching DirecTV last week, I spent a few hours with the antenna on my roof, never getting very consistent results. In fact, a long strand of coax gave me similar reception.I just picked up a Mohu Leaf, and stuck it in the window. It blows away the Terk, at least in the urban environment I'm in. Strong signal on everything broadcast here...The Terk TV-55 is terrible. It's discontinued for a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is pathetic.","review":"This is a terrible antenna.

Just look up the direction of the transmitters of the channels you want so you can properly orient the antenna. I literally tossed this antenna under a bed on the floor (pointed in the right direction), patched the coax from the bedroom through my home's pre-wired infrastructure to the living room, plugged in the little amp, and picked up all the major network stations plus a ton of other channels I didn't even know were being broadcast.

About 10 to 12 inches into the cut the blade binds, the saw kicksback and even the powerful Bosch motor can't turn the blade. I've had to stop the cut and wedge a screwdriver blade in the cut behind the saw as a makeshift kerf spreader. I think the problem is that the blade has almost no set and so is very susceptible to binding.

Run Lola Run is Tykwer's most widely known film in the U.S. but Winter Sleeper is his best. The Princess and the Warrior is not up to paar with Run Lola Run. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN WINTER SLEEPER DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY IT BEFORE YOU CONSIDER THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a look for the curious","review":"Another movie from the director and star of the cult hit RUN LOLA RUN . Franka Portente plays Sissi, a nurse who is injured in a car accident but is saved by a criminal who, in a gruesome scene performs an emergency tracheotomy on her with a Swiss Army knife and a drinking straw. After her recovery Sissi sets out to find him and thank him for saving her life, but she discovers he doesn't want to know her. However little do they know their paths will cross again in a bank robbery.Despite sounding interesting PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR is absorbing only in fits and starts and is mostly dull and overlong to boot. Director Tom Tykwer again makes full use of elaborate camerawork, but this only helps up to a certain point. That said, the movie is still worth a look, if only for curiosity's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"I never saw the thrill of 'Run Lola Run.' To me, it was trying a little too hard to be hip, and not really succeeding.'Princess and the Warrior,' however, is a different story. Both visually breathtaking and thought provoking, the film brings up questions about love, death, and destiny. Franka Potente is absolutely stunning in her role as a sheltered nurse who pursues the man who saved her life . . . and who appears in her dreams.Many people are reluctant to watch a foreign film, uneasy with having to read and watch at the same time. Yet when the foreign film is excellent, something magical happens. You forget that you're reading at all.'Princess and Warrior' is one of those films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achtung Achtung Another stunning film by Twyker","review":"This film in a gorgeously crafted film that teams Benno and Franke again(they starred together in the German thriller Anatomie). Der Krieger und die Kaiserin also hide a deeper meaning to this film that almost all Americans will miss. The backstory of the Austrian Kaiserin Sissi gives a profundity to the story that is both beautiful and disturbing.For those who enjoyed Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior provides stunning performances from some of the same actors. After Lola Rent this film is a strong departure and truly another jem to German Cinema. I would strongly suggest it to anyone who can apreciate excellent cinema and prefers not to have their stories spoonfed.A haunting question is open for debate on this film, Who was Sissi's father? Some say Walter others say it was the character portrayed by Lars Rudolf. What do you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Franka Potente is fantastic!!","review":"Franka Potente is brilliant in her portrayal of Sissi, a shy nurse just trying to make her way through life.

I suppose it takes a lot of practice to stare at another person for 2 straight hours. Okay, maybe it was more like just one hour because the characters in it spent just about half the movie doing that. I was somewhat expecting another \\"Lola,\\" but I found just the opposite; that is, a film that trudged along like molasses. I love Franka Potente, but her makeup was horrible compared to her looks in the aforementioned movie and \\"Blow.\\" If one was going to watch this movie, they should either be a student of German or someone who is interested in cinematography because those were its only outstanding assets (well, to me at least... of course they speak German well... they're German).

But LASER MISSION is so poorly written, directed and acted, it only serves as a tribute to a young man who was heading for better things. Debi Monahan as the love interest is pouty, unconvincing and in need of acting lessons; even venerable Ernest Borgnine can't rescue this dumb, over the top actioner.

When this occurred on my replacement DVD, I had to come to the conclusion that this was a flaw of MPI, who distributed this disc. While they present a great product in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes films, they do nobody any favors with this slipshod transfer. It only gets the one star for the solid visuals, but unless you want to crank your TV volume at full blast to even hear a bit of the soundtrack, this is a product that I recommend avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"fills the eye but NOT the ear","review":"I'm just another customer who was very disappointed to discover that my new DVD of this title (as well as the replacement DVD MPI sent me) had such appallingly bad audio (the actors sound as if they're speaking through wads of cotton). It's also worth noting that MPI's DVD of \\"Turn of the Screw\\" has the exact same problem. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Version of Dorian Gray","review":"This film seems rather hokey compared to the earlier theatrical version. The production is uninspired and lacks depth into the character of Dorian Gray. The DVD transfer is not very good either but that really doesn't seem to matter. This film can't match the cast of George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, and Angela Lansbury of the 1945 version. Shane Briant's performance as Dorian Gray is no match to Hurd Hatfield's outstanding enigmatic performance. Hurd Hatfield owns the cinematic version of Dorian Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely different direction-pop","review":"This album is completely different than any of the earlier works. It is kind of along the lines of when PFM was backing up an pop Italian singer. It isn't very good pop music either. One song does start out promising, but that fades by the end of the tune. It is the only high point on the alburm. Sometimes, an album will have one song worth recording before you dump it. I don't think this one song would make the cut....."},{"rating":"2","title":"With this album I met PFM","review":"This album has been unfairly undergraded in prior reviews here published. I was introduced to PFM's music with this album, when I visited Italy for the first time in 1981. I cherish this album. It may not be the progressive PFM of the 70s but please note that this PFM was also changing, as much as the rest of the world was. This is more commercial pop, \\"pop for the masses\\". However, the lyrics and the music are neat. I love Patrick Djivas' bass technique and sound, it's awesome. \\"Meno male che ci sei\\" is carved deeply in my mind as a beautiful love elegy.If you are curious to know PFM, I advise you start with this album or its sequence, the unknown \\"PFM?, PFM!\\" (1984). Then proceed to PFM from the 70s and 90s. That way you all be able to understand and better gauge this album which I insist, has had very unfair critics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!!!","review":"Although I didn't watch this all the way through, it gave me what I wanted.

They strip in front of him, take his clothes off, and spoon with him. I would love that if it happened to me.

The fact that it borders child pornography only by a thin line is no surprise in this poorly made foreign film. The \\"voiceovers\\" were pathetic. I suspect the boy's voice was done by a girl or young woman and did not match the boy's person at all. The same poor quality applied to all the rest of the characters as well. The incest scene with the boy and his Mother was not the worst part of the film. Other scenes depicted a so-called war or conflict happening or about to happen between two countries or cities of which which I have no clue as to the reason or what countries. This conflict had little or no bearing on the plot of the story. Much of the conservation between the other characters, during a party and other times, made absolutely no sense whatsoever and appeared to be used as \\"fill-in\\" for the purpose of using up time in the film.

It made me chuckle and feel guilty for doing so all at once. Simply couldn't put it down.For those unfamiliar with Drinnan's work, what you will find here is a beautifully woven tapestry of darkly humorous (and sometimes downright debaucherous) anecdotes that fit together to create a complete and satisfying tale.This one stood out to me as something of stepping stone for author Drinnan. I felt it drew on a more existential focal point, which was evident from the very beginning and captivating until the very end.I look forward to more from this writer. He has a unique voice; a style that is like no other and a view on society that cannot be ignored.An excellent read.

If you do not have a lot of time to work out, this is a great video to help tone your legs quickly. The moves are tough and definitly make your thighs burn! I actually break a sweat while doing this! My only complaint is that Denise Austin makes a lot of mistakes and is very annoying at times. She is encouraging, but after the first few times, you don't notice that. You only notice that she miscounts, speeds up her rhythm to get the 10 minutes in, and just sounds ditsy at times.

I love Ana and Ravi's instruction and cannot do this video too many times. It is very invigorating. You will begin to notice results in your additude and your body immediately. I recommend this video to anyone who is looking for something other than holding poses. Who knows, you may fall in love with this DVD as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transforming!","review":"I think your body gradually adapts to the demands you place on it. Yoga has reshaped my body until I am finally liking what I see and feel.I started doing Ana & Ravis DVDs in 2001. When I started I could not sit cross legged on the floor without pain, nor could I touch my toes without bending my knees. Now I am very flexible and have obtained a deep strength that feels more integrated then what I used to achieve through weights and running.This workout like all of the Ravi/Ana workouts is exhilarating! It is probably their most advanced so I recommend starting with their Beginners and Beyond although,if you, like I was, are attracted to the Warrior title I say give it a go. Instructions are easy to follow and Ana makes it pretty easy to know how a pose ought to look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kundalindi Yoga and weight loss","review":"Hi, I just would like to pass on some information. I have been actively participating in the Kundalindi Yoga tapes by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh for 5 months. I Have the Warrior, Fat Free Yoga and Dance the Chakras. They are all wonderful and give you a great work out. I have lost 25 pounds. In addition, I add aerobics every other day and swimming. NOt only have I lost weight, but I have benefit of feeling great, greater flexibility , a sense of well being and peace. It has increased my focus and feelings that are very positive. I would reccomend the series to anyone.Pat"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Matrix Version Rocks","review":"I make a point of doing this one when I need energy or feel a little down and it never fails to boost me up! This is one of my favorite Ana & Ravi DVD's, and I have almost all of them. It's a powerful workout which leaves no stone unturned in its quest to deliver one of the most complete workouts you can imagine: body, mind, & soul. If you think you've seen it all in terms of approaches to exercise, you're in for a surprise. Kundalini Yoga, even though it's ancient, is completely original, and Ana & Ravi have turned it into a viable form of fitness for everyone. This one starts with some warming up and then goes right into a continuous routine which has cardio, strength building, ab work, flexibility exercises, and more. YOU WILL SWEAT. As in most of their DVD's, it ends with a deep relaxation and meditation. Type A personalities will appreciate this for its power and directness and everyone else will appreciate it for its beautiful undertones of Spirit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleansing","review":"The first time I tried this DVD I thought it was pretty challenging.

I am so super motivated because I've already gotten results and the workouts are so enjoyable to do. I do this one at least twice per week. I've gotten great tone in my arms and shoulders and I can feel that my circulation has improved. I also can see some definition in my abs which is a miracle! I sweat while doing this and I swear that I can smell toxins coming out of me. Even if you haven't had live instruction you will find this one doable, challenging most definitely, but very user-friendly. Kundalini Yoga is probably unlike any other fitness system you've tried, but you will probably find, like me, that is your new favorite thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Yoga Sweat Fest","review":"This DVD is a high powered sweat fest. It's pretty much non-stop until the deep relaxation. Every single muscle gets worked, as well as your nerves, glands, inner organs, and more. Flexibility and strength are equally covered. There's sort of a Down Dog to Up Dog chattaranga sequence which is like a workout unto itself. On all of the Ravi & Ana DVD's they include a lot of great ab work. The demonstration by Ana Brett is inspiring to say the least. She's a real yoga athlete, right up there with Rodney Yee. Their instruction, is perfect. Also, their inspiring little quips stay in my head all day and make me a better person. There is so much to like about this DVD, I could keep writing and writing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Strengthening, Cardio, & Elimination of Toxins!","review":"This is one of my favorite Ana & Ravi DVD's.

It's also great when I get gym-resistant and want to get everything covered. It has upper and lower body strengthening, stretching, a very definite cardio element, as well as overall health benefits. I wore out my first Warrior Workout disc and I'm on my second one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WooHoo!

Their are some more alignment tips (courtesy of Ana who is simply gorgous with her black hair - though I think the blonde suits her too!). The workout is challenging but a total joy(!!!!!!!!!) and I am so grateful that Ravi and Ana work so hard and creatively to always give their very large fan base such a vast variety of excellent DVDs that are so fun & easy to use!

Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, Playtime] were in Full Screen format (only version available) and so some of the humor was not on screen that I recalled from the Wide screen versions I had seen in theaters.\\"This is simply not true. Criterion *always* presents the film in one of two ways:1) The director's preferred aspect ratio2) The original theatrical ratioIn the case of these three films all have been presented in their *original* theatrical ratios. In the cases of 'M. Hulot's Hoiliday' and 'Mon Oncle' the ratio is 1.33:1 (same as a standard TV) while 'Playtime' is (and was) presented in 1.85:1 ratio. Why are the first two the same size as a standard TV? A lot of people don't realise that the television borrowed it's ratio (4:3 or 1.33:1) from movie theater screens.

Absolutely charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still hilarious after all these years","review":"The DVD of Mr. Hulot's Holiday will have you chortling, snickering and flat-out laughing all by yourself. Although it is in French, with English subtitles, no knowledge of French is necessary because humor transcends language. Mr. Hulot is quite oblivious to the quirky situations he creates at the seaside resort hotel where he is spending his holiday, always maintaining his cheery spirit in the face of the catastrophes of others.It's a must-have for anyone who appreciates the art of sight gags and old-time silent movie humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The US video version a sad disappointment","review":"I saw this film when it was first released in 1956 and enjoyed every minute. I bought the US video version as a Christmas (2001) present to give to friends who also saw it on its first release and was very surprised when they said they were very disappointed with the video. I understood why when I, too, saw the US video version with US-English sub-titles that were superfluous and completely wrecked the concept of a film that depended entirely on sound effects rather than dialogue for comedy. I had thought of buying 'Mon Oncle' as well but, having seen what was done to Ms Hulot, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on another disappoinment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have seen better","review":"I am sorry that I do not have the same enthusiasm as the other reviewers.

The original, tho' hard to find, is a better film. Thoroughly delightful tale of an everyman bumbler who takes his yearly vacation at the beach, and adversely affects all those around him. He manages to draw affection from some of those he meets, including the film audience. Tati was a genius at the study of human nature, and a superb director of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clumsy comedy","review":"Mr. Hulot is a funny guy. He has this run down car that has a horn that makes meowing noises that he takes to a hotel by the beach for a vacation. While he's there, he does a lot of funny things. One part I liked was when he was kayaking and the kayak broke in half and then he was sandwiched between the two parts. He kept on lifting up the top and closing it, making himself look like a sea monster and everyone on the beach was scared and they ran away. He is a guy who doesn't behave like the others who are staying at the hotel. They are busy talking about the news and playing cards while he's listening to music. One time he helped this boy carry his things up a hill. Everyone congratulated him for making it to the top and then they offered him a drink. He took the cup and arched his back and he fell down the hill. If you like comedy, you'll definitely like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulot's hilarious!","review":"If you don't know Jacques Tati, you should acquaint yourself with him and his screen persona Hulot as soon as possible. This is a terrific movie, with unbelievable visual comedy. The tennis playing scene alone is worth the price of the whole movie. It is truly charming and funny, without anyone being made the brunt of the jokes. It is acceptable and entertaining for any age viewer. The only thing it is missing is letterbox format."},{"rating":"1","title":"second-rate version of first rate film","review":"I saw Mr Hulot's Holiday at its first U.S. showing on televsion, probably in 1953, and became a lifelong fan.

While I like the variety and quantity of pieces in this set, I had a horrible time with everything sticking. (In fact, a store employee told me that the reason Calphalon was discontinuing this set is because not many people care for \\"stick-resistant\\").

I e-mailed calphalon direct and asked if it would stay flat on the bottom for use on a glass top stove, and the answer was that it would. However, the first time I used the pans (not exceeding reccommended heat settings), they became round on the bottom and only contact the cooking surface in a small spot in the middle of the pan, which of course does not cook evenly. Now I have had this problem with other cheaper brands of cookware also, but thought that a good brand would be better. I would have been a lot of money ahead if I had a bought a cheaper set. It certainly couldn't have performed any worse. I suppose they would replace it, but what good would that do if the new ones are going to do the same thing when they are used?I also find it very difficult to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% FANTASTIC","review":"I could not ask for a better set of pans.

Only reason I have it at 4 stars not 5 is that they really should include nonstick coating on the smaller fry pan for omlettes. Some observations:- You need to warm the pans and any oil up before putting food in them to prevent a lot of sticking. Also, sticking can be minimized with a little lower heat setting.- If you don't want to clean and hand-dry your pots soon after using them, get the nonstick version for a little more and use the dishwasher. These need to be kept very clean to cook well. A little orange citrus cleaner removes gummy buildup nicely. With a little soaking and a Scotchbrite pad, even baked on stuff comes off easily (much better than stainless).- Food cooks very well in these pans, the heat distribution makes a difference.- Handles are excellent, don't get hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds my expectations","review":"My daughter received Calphalon for her wedding and wanted more. After 40 years of cooking on and discarding many pans, I bought this set and many extra pieces and bakeware for myself five years ago. They cook everything with a minimum of coddling. Pudding doesn't burn, eggs don't stick (I use butter). Even rice or sauce boiled over and burned on the outside cleans off easily. So far the pans show no wear, no staining, and only minimal baked residue on the outside bottoms. I use a gas range; perhaps that works better than ceramic top or electric. The pans work as advertised in the oven. I brown meat on the stove, bake it in the oven, and serve it on the table, all in the everyday pan. They cook evenly, have close-fitting lids, and look good. I have bought many pieces as gifts. Calphalon is my brand for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality - much better than all-clad","review":"I've used calphalon commercial for over 10 years and the performance is fantastic.

I didn't expect much from it because of its small size and omni-directional signal pickup. Outside installation took about an hour, which could have been shorter if I had a good ladder. Inside installation is a snap.The reception is actually much better than I expected. It got decent signals for all the major channels in the San Jose and San Francisco area, except for KTVU, which is probably too far and in the wrong direction.In general, it's a good buy for dish owners who want free local channels.

Despite there are a lot of bands, the songs are very alike and I simply don't like it...even Soundgarden which I've loved them, sounds very similar to the other bands there...but if you are interested on this kind of sound just let me know and I can sell this album to anyone of you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informitive","review":"It is unfortunate that most scientific information is controlled by the major universities and not open to question. Even scientific magazines have political agendas to promote rather than the examination of accepted scientific \\"fact\\". Adam Cochran both explaines the accepted theories and then gives his take on why they are wrong. This could have been a very dry and boring effort but he effectively uses humor to help you understand.Where this book really misses the mark is when Adam tackles religion. He does it very badly and it is evident that he spent very little time studying this subject. It should have been left out all together if he wasn't prepared to do it thoroughly. Other than that, I think you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Spiers first illustrated book","review":"This first book illustrated by Peter Spier shows his early style.

An excellent introduction to Eastern Asian philosophy. Actors who guest starred were varied. Watching Keye Luke as a mature man is fascinating to anyone who remembers the old Warner Oland \\"Charlie Chan\\" series when Mr. Luke played 'No. 1 son'.

Iam not even going to go thru the entire set and plan on returning this as it is defective. I purchased it at a major warehouse club. Has anyone else had this problem?

It includes articles by leading scholars, doing serious history and cultural anthropology. But the orientation of the journal is not dull and \\"academic.\\" It is intended for those who, discovering these traditions through serious intellectual detective work, intend to actually PRACTICE them. The journal also has extensive book and music reviews. I cannot praise this journal highly enough. It fills a great void.

In his exposition, Dr. Pickover touches on the various perspectives of the characters--the nobility, people in the medical profession as well as those of us that are looking at the story in hindsight. This gives the story a very unique flavor which ultimately forces the reader to think about the text, and come to a better understanding of the world in which Mary Toft lived as well as the world in which we live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot..Slow/ Animation...Good/ Music...Better","review":"In short, new crew of a new solar sail powered ship find young girl in space.

Yeah, the guitars are low, but if you listen you will find out that this same ...band that delivers the off the wall hardcore that makes them the best of their genre. There are few bands that don't know the meaning of the word sellout and Biohazard is certainly one of them. \\"Kill or be Killed\\" is nothing short of amazing. Some standouts are \\"Never forgive, Never forget\\", the title track and \\"Beaten Sensless\\" which is exactly how you will feel after hearing that song however, the whole ablum is stellar from start to finish. Also featured on this album is the latest in Biohazard's revolving door of lead guitarists. This time it is Carmine Vincent.

This album is very different than their debut self titled album but through out their career you can see their progression. Kill or be Killed was originally supposed to be titled, Never Forgive, Never Forget but after a delayed release they changed it. Kill or be Killed is probably the heaviest album Biohazard has done. They have always been hardcore but the tone of this album is darker and co-singer, Evan Seinfeld, reaches deep down for a hardcore bellow that he had not used on the earlier albums. Biohazard has often focused on world issues and general politics and Kill or be Killed is no different. Released in the wake of 9/11, one can tell it affected the album. Songs like Never Forgive, Never Forget and Hallowed Ground are examples of it. This is a great and innovative hardcore album but if you are looking for something a little more traditional for Biohazard, check out their new album, Means to an End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!!","review":"I'll give it 2 stars cause it's BIOHAZARD, but this tuned down new metal sludge is just terrible!! At their best BIOHAZARD rules, this is a sad exception. Best song on the album is the title track \\"kill or be killed\\", with a pretty awesome break toward the end of the song. Actually that part alone almost makes the album worth listening. Check out \\"Means to an end\\" the last BIOHAZARD, its much much better!!

Killer tracks like \\"Kill or Be Killed\\" and \\"Never Forget\\" make this a worthy purchase for longtime fans and may bring a few new followers to the fold.

I used to be a fan of this band.No more. Musically, this is as good as Biohazard gets. A read through the lyrics though, and it's nothing but reactionary racist hatred of Arabs. I wonder what people will think of this album once the anti-Arab sentiment of the US public subsides -- as I hope it will some day.You might call it \\"angst\\" or something but it's just simple-minded racism. Al-Quaeda is bad. Most Arabs are not supporters of Al-Quaeda, or at least they weren't. Maybe after hearing Biohazard they'll change their minds about the land of opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Annoying","review":"This CD is unlistenable to me. They will never top their 1994 effort, \\"State of the World Address\\", if this is the direction they're headed in. The low bellows of Evan and others are just too \\"death metal\\" sounding.

By the way, I saw them in Philly in 1995 where they opened for Slayer, and they got booed off stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip-off from a previous release","review":"This album is a rip off.

The stories are loosely constructed excuses for bump and grind sex scenes. Character development is a foreign concept for this author, and plot is apparantly a waste of time. Considering that this is intended to be hot fiction, I was intensely disappointed, and ended up skimming through all of Nathan's Cirlce, the first novella, in search of something stimulating.I suppose if all you require is a graphic depiction of clothes tearing, overwhelmed by lust sex scenes, you'll be very happy with this book. But if you enjoy a bit more realism, emotion, and character involvement, you'll be as disappointed as I was.This book is clearly written by an emotionally immature man, and may find some fans in men of a similar disposition.

There's no place to go with this series or this character any more. Luther started out complex and 3-dimensional, which is what made the series so promising. Now he, and all of the other characters (caricatures?), are right out of a comic book, 2-dimensional at best, and with apologies to the author, boring. The same goes for the plot.

Skies of Arcadia is a really classic style, old-school RPG with incredible, \\"new-school\\" visuals. The world of Arcadia is really mesmerizing; it's one of those games where you can't wait to move on just so you can see what the next area looks like. Those guys at Sega... they're very creative. You can tell the probably had alot of fun making this game.Anyways, SOA is a really cool game, and the first in like 5 years to really captivate me.

Not only are the graphics the abosolute best I've seen on the market, but the story is so rich. Despite the fact that you can't name your characters, their weopons and spells are awsome. The \\"Special Moves\\" option is a brilliant addition to any RPG. Unlike many games, which have me jumping at flying objects or fearing death by falling off cliffs, \\"Skies\\" has easy moving. The best part, however, is the colors. The colors are supurb and they even added sun beams when your rotate the camera. If you don't like RPG's or you do, this game is for you.

I'm 21 now, and \\"Time Runs Wild\\" has much more meaning now than it did when I was 10. lol. go figure.The best way I can describe this soundtrack is to compare it to an old high school yearbook. I will agree with the other reviewers by saying that each song does transport you back to that particular scene in the movie and to really appreciate the music, it would help to see the movie.I'm really glad to know that there are other people out there who enjoy this movie and soundtrack as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must soundtrack.

Spann and Lindh will come face to face in Afghanistan, a meeting with a tragic ending, but what are the global circumstances that the world powers put into motion that led to this fateful rendezvous? Mahoney takes us into a historical perspective spelling out the wheeling and dealing that went into supporting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the plan to build oil pipelines, the Saudis financing terrorists, and how the United States, rather than submit to an investigation that would reveal its duplicity and involvement, dropped nine out of ten charges against Lindh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does A Good Job Given The Price","review":"This is the first rice cooker I've ever owned.

I've been using this more than I originally anticipated as it produces a nice meal in tandem with the steamer insert. I bought a rice steamer cookbook so I have been finding this appliance versatile in regard to various cooking options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday rice cooker!","review":"If you cook rice everyday and you need it done fast.

It is supposed to be for 5 cups but the problem occurs even with only one cup. I called Panasonic who were extremely unhelpful, passing me from tech to tech, putting me on hold, and asking me to repeat the product info and explain the problem 7 times. After almost an hour, I was told that this was normal but if I wanted, I could take it to repair two hour from where I live. According to them, most likely nothing was wrong and they would not take it back. Apparently Panasonic does not stand behind their products and there is no such thing as \\"satisfaction guaranteed.\\" Worst $70+ I've ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming and Spitting Rice Cooker","review":"Overall this rice cooker is doing the job.

I would very likely buy this flavor again. It has a good amount of protein 32g, although 20g would also be enough. The 410 calories is just enough to replace a meal. It keeps me feeling full so I'm not craving for other foods. It's convenient and less messy than a protein shake. The biggest con is the price. It's a big pricey at >$2 a bar, but cheaper and healthier than fast food value meal. I'm not sure I would take this to work or school as a replacement meal bar...if you know what I mean. I like that is flavor is crunchy. I tried another protein bar and it was disgusting and very chewy. Not what I like. I recommend this bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate protein bars, but this... I can get used to","review":"Just wanted to comment on this bar. Now i am not saying that you can compare this to a high fat, moist, out of the oven brownie. I don't think any protein bar will ever be that. However, for a protein bar, it is very good. I barely taste the protein. The chocolate is overpowering (thats good). I would also recommend storing it in a cool place as you don't want to eat that if it's a bit melted. Also of note is the fact that it still does have about 25g of sugar, but if your going to work out and then eat one instead of lunch, I think its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"lunch","review":"YUM. i eat like candy bar. so good. other bars taste chalky, dense. this is crunch like oreo cookie. many calories so i make meal and not snack.

I did grab a little nibble, however, and they are really tasty!! :) Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar in a noisy bag","review":"Incredibly rich and tasty! Lists lots of protein, so that's good. But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 25 grams of sugar in the Cookie Crunch! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it.

The combination makes the rooms uncomfortable to both modernists and traditionalist alike. If you want an inspiring decor book, try \\"White Hot\\" by Tricia Guild.

There's also a lot of breath work, some meditation, and unusual movements like arching your spine back and forth while sitting with your legs folded beneath you. You don't need the flexibility or endurance you do for some yoga practices. Also, the DVD version is relatively well-chaptered so you don't have to do the whole thing, though I felt funny starting in the middle of the practice. So this might be good for someone new to yoga or someone looking for a unique practice.I personally prefer Yogilates 2 or Baron Baptiste's Core Power for yoga-based ab work. I usually do yoga to relax, build strength, or focus on my breath within the context of controlled moves. This one just didn't fit my idea of an ab workout or a yoga practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listing:","review":"Disc One:1 Surfin' U.S.A.2 Surfer Girl3 4094 Surfin' Safari5 Little Deuce Coupe6 Catch A Wave7 In My Room8 Fun, Fun, Fun9 Shut Down10 Your Summer Dream11 Be True To Your School12 Spirit Of AmericaDisc Two:1 I Get Around2 The Warmth Of The Sun3 Dance, Dance, Dance4 Don't Back Down5 Wendy6 Do You Wanna Dance7 Hushabye8 Help Me, Rhonda9 All Summer Long10 Little Honda11 California Girls12 Girls On The BeachDisc Three:1 Don't Worry Baby2 Sloop John B3 Wouldn't It Be Nice4 Barbara Ann5 God Only Knows6 Then I Kissed Her7 Good Vibrations8 Wild Honey9 The Little Girl I Once Knew10 Do It Again11 Girl Don't Tell Me12 I Can Hear Music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Anna","review":"Dearest Anna,I finished your book about madness, about inner poverty, about redemption and the mystical obsession with death.

It is an enormously powerful song of great emotional depth sprinkled with a little frustration in the knowledge of how life can be and humble enough to be without guilt in wanting it. Many of his songs are excellent, raw, passionate and realistic without being corny or pretentious. Exciting use of male emotions without remorse, brave and welcome. Tapping nerves is never easy but accomplished beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed trash from a has-been ! ! !","review":"Not again!

This guy has been milking his popularity in several regional areas (I'm from central New York) for the last 20 years or so, and the guy looks like a sad version of Elvis in the mid-70's. He's a singer who had promise 20 years back, but screwed up his career with bad business deals and substance abuse.

Okay.The other four strike me as having started out as novels, then Fowles ran out of steam when he realised that the premise couldn't bear the weight of a full-length treatment. In computer terms, it's as if these stories were in the recycle bin but Fowles didn't want to kill his \\"children\\" so he did some cosmetic work to try and rescue them from oblivion.Dialogue: appalling.

The book is terribly dry and while it is not strictly limited to a list of archeological finds, that is clearly the forte of the author. The style is way more awkward than the average scholarly text, the photos of which there are many are absolutely substandard (this must be the fault of the printer). But more substantially, I came out of my struggle with this book without even a half way understanding of what distinguished the Moche from the previous civilizations, from the contemporary ones, and from those that followed it.

Anna and her family are coping, at times quite desperately, as refugees in London as war finally breaks out for England and then the U.S. This continuation of a young girl's coming of age in the midst of Hitler's attack on Europe, illustrates the hardships that Jews were confronted with who escaped Hitler's final solution. Since Anna's family were Germans, even though they would have been annihilated by the Third Reich, they were not allowed employment and other essential means for survival. How they survive, and Anna's and Max's (her older brother) coming of age in such conditions, are told, miraculously, without bitterness. I am now reading the final volume of Anna's story, A Small Person Far Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great biography on Dylan, told by those who were there!","review":"This is an excellent read. Heylin's clear narration is coupled with many excerpts from interviews from Dylan, as well as from those who have been involved with Dylan's career.

It is essential!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed but boring account of the great one's life and music","review":"Bob Dylan would be one of the most difficult subjects for a biography you could think of. His enigmatic statements and constant reinvention make him hard to pin down - not to mention the way he protects his privacy, giving few revealing interviews. Heylin attempts to make up for this by describing lots of often irrelevant details but never succeeds in giving you a sense of the man or his music. Heylin declines to make his own analysis of Dylan's music, perhaps feeling too scared he would make a fool of himself if he did. After a while it just becomes boring. Oh and what a terrible title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written, but.....","review":"This book is probably rightfully touted as the definitive Dylan biography. It's exceptionally well researched, and the author is clearly very intelligent. The book is very well written, and a pleasure to read for anyone interested in learning more about the enigma within the enigma that is Dylan.All that said, Heylin dismisses \\"Time out of Mind\\" early on in the book as \\"built on sand\\" and says it doesn't stand up to some of Dylan's all time classics. He also says nothing Dylan has released since \\"Oh Mercy\\" is any good, and predicts he'll never release any more masterpieces (although, to his credit, he hopes he's wrong).I think he is wrong. \\"Time out of mind\\" and its successor, \\"Love and theft\\" both stand with any of Dylan's classics from previous decades (arguably more so as far as \\"Time out of mind\\" is concerned), and I suspect Mr. Dylan has more than one more classic in him before his final biography can be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I find it surprising that so many reviewers seem so delighted with Mr. Heylin's book. While I did enjoy learning bits about the origins of songs and Dylan's studio methods, I found that for the most part Mr.Heylin was falling over himself to express just how much he dislikes everyone in Dylan's life with the exception of the man himself.For most of the book, Heylin treats Dylan like a talented golden boy, whose personal habits he finds highly distasteful, but is willing to overlook. But by the end of the book, I think maybe he has spent just a little bit too much time in his room thinking about Bob Dylan, and is clearly quite tired of him.800 pages of humorless crankiness makes for a very tiresome read.My recommendation is to just listen to the albums and let old Bob keep his personal life to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and condescending. What about the music?","review":"I read this biography not just because I'm a big and longstanding fan of Bob Dylan, but also because of the strength of many of the accolades the book has received, both in Amazon and elsewhere. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The biography is clearly well-researched, despite Heylin's proud but unconvincing defence of the fact that he has never met Dylan. However, the biography lacks any warmth or feel for Dylan and the huge and deep contribution his music has made to modern culture. The book comes down with detail, but much of it is incidental and irrelevant. While there is plenty of gossip around Dylan's fondness for women, drugs and drink, few original insights are offered about his music. Indeed, Dylan's music is hardly assessed at all, apart from occasional references to the views of other critics. Dylan's life and music deserve a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't get it right","review":"Clinton Heylin's book is filled with misinformation, inaccurate quotes and pirated material.

When I watched the first scene for the first time I thought that the movie would be great, but that and the nike commercial parody was the only good part of the movie. Everything else was just [bad]. On the cover to Scary Movie it says \\"No mercy. No shame. No sequel.\\" Well they should have kept it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, LORD, WHAT A WASTE!","review":"THis is the typical career-threatening movie: the kind of movie that threatens the careers and reputations of all involved in the bomb, for which a certain ammount of time is necessary for them to recover and to regain professional respect again.The original SCARY MOVIE was stupid but fun, it had a history line, a defined plot and defined characters, constructed basically around the SCREAM characters.But this sequence, shot less than a year after the first one, is a disgrace. It is just stupid, bad tasted jokes all the way. I think the Wayans brothers should think seriously about the example of a bad movie that they have directed, facing it as a lesson, not taking in consideration its success at the box office.I'm easy to enjoy stupid comedies. I enjoyed AIRPLANE, NAKED GUN, TOP GANG and SCARY MOVIE.

I was pleased to see that they didnt over do it with the whole teen slasher genre, but I was hoping to see a little spoof on scream 3, or Urban Legends.One thing that confused me was that, why was there several people in the film that were killed off in the first?????????All in all its a pretty funny film with lots of crude and disgusting humor that will please all audiences.WARNING: DONT GO SEE THIS WITH YOU'RE PARENTS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pointless !!!!!!","review":"This movie was just plain stupud.

The characters were not developed and it seemend as if they rushed just to get it out on time.There was one point where they didn't have enough money to purchase walkie talkies...

If your gonna go to a movie, I suggest \\"The Fast and The Furious\\", or maybe \\"A.I.\\" The sequel was the exact opposite of the first; the first one was hilarious, to the point of tears, and this was unfunny to the point of tears. As far as sequels goes, I suggest waiting for \\"American Pie 2\\", or \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\\". Those two look like they have more to offer.

It is a poor remake of the 1st movie's jokes etc and the choice of actors this time is pitiful to say the least. The most obvious of them all is Chris Elliot. Not only can a kindergardner act better than he can, but he totally ruined this movie which otherwise might have been at least bearable to sit thru.

I had to leave a little over an hour into it. I didn't expect a great movie but wanted to at least be able to laugh. The main characters in this are staying in a haunted house. Thats about it. Marlon Wayans is as UNFUNNY as ever and Tori Spelling is still zero dimensional. There are a lot of jokes in this movie that probobly looked good on paper but with this cast acting it out, forget about it!! As far as the comedy genre goes, this is truely the worst comedy I have seen since Howard the Duck. If you want to see a goofy spoof type comedy, go rent The Naked Gun or Airplane or even the first Scary Movie. Do not waste money on trying to sit through this.

The only plus side for me, was that I rented the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary along with this movie, not knowing that Dr. Frank N Furter, Tim Curry, was in the movie.

The first 20 minutes were funny (and that is pretty much what you see in the trailers) but after that, it did nothing for me at all. I didn't find it funny.

The undertaker is also a funny character with his disfigured arm which adds many scenes of laughter.Sure, the plot is kinda weird but it's very funny and mocks those films we love including \\"Hannibal, Charlie's Angels, House on Haunted Hill and Mission Impossible 2\\". The scene where Cindy and her new love interest are trapped in a walk-in freezer (Hollow Man) mocks that tear-jerking scene in Titanic (where Leo and Kate are freezing in the water) and made me laugh very hard.So, anyway, go and see it and I'm sure you'll love it.

The jokes and humor all seem to revolve around sex or breasts, and they all fall flat.The plot is something about the lead character being invited to some spooky old house, where some other people have been invited too, and from there the fun picks up.

DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE OR YOU WILL HAVE ENTERED THE BOWELS OF HELL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to EXPECTATION!","review":"The first Scary Movie, and the second one are complete opposites. The first part of this sequel was quite hilarious,and actually made me laugh more than once! The 2nd Scary Movie?? It was the worst I have seen. Other than the opening scene, this movie has no real funny parts at all. I bought the Dvd and watched it with great anticipation with my friends. It was the worst we watched! This movie was too hyped, and did nothing at all to make me laugh! And that bird in this movie.... Not funny at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Movie 2","review":"This movie is pretty funny and slap-stick silly, but it isn't as good as the first or the third (and the third wasn't incredibly good either, but it was funny, though). The constipated priest was funny and so was the sick little girl. Excluding certain scenes, this movie is basically a showcase of disgusting, raunchy teenagers caught in disgusting, ruanchy situations that end up poking fun at horror movies in a disgusting, raunchy way. The crude humor is as bawdy as it gets, pushing the envelope for an R-rated movie. The only part that truly satisfied my craving for comedy was the part where they parody that part in \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" where the two guys have tatoos on their backs that say \\"Dude\\" and \\"Sweet.\\" Otherwise, this F-word-every-five-minutes movie is excessively adult content that destroy the whole idea of a spoof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... Pass me a toilet bowl please...","review":"I love comedy, and I love horror. I didn't worship it, or even love it for that matter, but I did find the concept of Scary Movie to be amusing and original. This one just plain stinks! All of the parodies were predictable, and most of the jokes weren't even parodies. Most of them were just cheap jabs at sex jokes. Pretty much everything in this movie is sick.By the time the movie was over, I literally felt sick to my stomach. Sure, a couple of scenes made me chuckle, but nothing came close to even making me laugh, since it was all so appalling. You have to be pretty twisted to really find this type of movie funny. If you're still going to see it after reading this, I don't suggest eating anything while watching it. You'll probably want to hurl by the time it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"as a followup for 2000's funny Scary Movie and a movie with two of my favorite actors of all time (Tim Curry and James Woods), this should have been a hoot for me. but it wasn't. the gags in this installment try far too hard and miss the mark most of the time. every time it builds up with a little steam with one or two funny lines/gags, then comes another barrage of tired being-gross-for-the-sake-of-being-gross gags and lame one-liners to set it back in its place. what's more, where the first movie knew stuck to (mostly) just parodying Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, along with tired horror cliches, Scary Movie 2 awkwardly goes through new and old horror films with no rhyme or reason. I can't understand why they couldn't have put up a better effort with this considering the many great actors in the cast. a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice...but not as good as the first","review":"Some scenes are repeated from the first. It is not that bad thats all I can say.I think I over rated it with 2 stars too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED BIG TIME!","review":"I watched this movie with my cousins last year. I thought it sucked big time. The whole Exorcist part was funny, but the genitals for door-knockers? I mean, come on, give me a break. The movie was sick, and gross. I walked out of my living room during the movie, and I came back in 2 or 3 times. The plot was stupid. The turkey scene was sick, and I walked out. I give it a big 0, and It was the grossest movie I've ever seen. I hated it, and I recommend not to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid for the sake of being stupid..","review":"All freshness and originality displayed in the first \\"stupid\\" Scary Movie were lost in this one. The first movie had a clear plot for all to see. This one here have none. Why? Simple. Just because it was produced ina hurry seldom seen in sequences! In less than a year the second movie was made!!The Wayan brothers wanted to capitalize over the success of the first movie and throwed all good taste to the wind, and came out with this sad excuse of a film.This is the kind of movie that makes you leave in the middle of the film.... An people give it a five-star rating.... Weird..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OHHHH WHHHHHHYYYY?????????????","review":"Every spoof in this movie was already used in the first. Let's hope that Dimension Films will realize that the Wayans brothers have pumped their wells dry and have no more funny things to say. Let's put the money into more creative movies like Joy Ride, The Fast And The Furious or Moulin Rouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, worse, Scary Movie2","review":"The problem with Scary Movie 2, aside from the fact that it skimps on the promise of te first film ('no shame, no mercy, no sequel'), is that the targets for parody are movies like Hollow Man and The Haunting, which are pretty lame themselves. Much of the humor is forced, let's-do-something-stupid-for-the-sake-of-doing-something-stupid...and a lot of it's feels stale. Here's hoping Scary Movie 3 will never surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all !!!!","review":"The plot, such as it is, has the same cast from \\"Scary Movie\\" staying at a haunted house over a weekend. This is all set up by Tim Curry, playing an evil college professor whose motives are not really explained. Suffice it to say that some spooky things happen and there are parodies of The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal, The Haunting, Charlies Angels, MI:2, Hollow Man and What Lies Beaneath. The plot is so much more disjointed than Scary Movie, which is, in and of itself, kind of scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED !!!!!!!!!!!!! [ZERO STARS]","review":"This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen in my long long life. The only part of this movie that was okay at all is the preacher's solo on the piano. This movie parodies every scary movie it can find and it does it truly bad. A group of mentally retarted 4 year olds with A.D.D. could have written a better movie, and it is so unfortunate to see Marlon Wayans in this movie after starring in Requiem for a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than the","review":"part with James Woods, which is truly ill but hilarious, the rest of this movie falls flat compared to #1.

I should ahve left the theater while into the first fifteen minutes into the session, as my brain had told me to do since the movie began!! My God, bad taste comedy reached an all-time low level, thanks to the Wayans Brothers... And to think of a time when he had great comedians like Walther Mathau.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!!","review":"This one of the worst movies of the summer, it really is that bad!!! The first Scary Movie was a novel and original idea that had some genuinely funny parts in it, but the second one has been made just to make abit of cash. There is no effort put in by the cast and more importantly, the writers and director(Wayans brothers). The story is useless and the jokes in it r just not funny! The only decent scene is right at the start where the always reliable James Woods plays the role of a priest in an exorcist spoof. Apart from that scene the rest of the film sucks! The talking parrot is just annoying, the butler with the disgusting hand is not funny and the cast as a whole embarass themselves by being in such a crap movie!!! Please, please dont make a third one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The first part of the movie was great....then they did any thing for a cheep laugh,and they didnt even get any. The Plot if there was one was notthing but throwing things in and makeing fun of them. The first one was original and funny,but how many times do you really wanna see a guy smoke ... or watch a million jokes about guy's ... I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree, it is better than the original","review":"One of the funniest movies ever made!!!! Its especialy funny since each character has their own unique personality and funny behavior. Unlike other teen movies where everyone acts exactly the same.There are a few gross parts, so its more suitable for the 17 and older audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I enjoyed this movie alot . I dont know why nobody likes it it is very funny and creative. people just dont have a sense of humor anymore. This about a bunch of colage students who are tricked into going to a haunted house and must battle there way out and destroy a polterguist tobefore time runs out and they are all captured by the ghost . I recomend this to people who like Comedys and the dvd has some pretty cool special features buy this you wont be disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had funny parts, but overall not great","review":"I saw this movie yesterday and it did have funny jokes in it, but they mostly stopped after the middle, of the movie and I just got boring. The first Scary Movie was defintely better than the second. I have to say I was very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"no shame, no mercy, NO SEQUEL","review":"The film opens with a spoof on THE EXORCIST. Which sort of gets your hopes up for the rest of the movie. After the spoof on the DUDE WHERES MY CAR? tatoo scene, the movie goes wayyyyy downhill. With so many gross out scenes (which are never a bad thing for a spoof), it looks like the writers focused more on out-grossing the first Scary Movie instead of trying to be funnier.Remember the slogan for Scary Movie I \\"No Shame, No Mercy, No Sequel\\"? I wish they would have stuck to their promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Funniest Movie of the Year\\"","review":"This is by far one of the funniest movies of the year!

There was no tie-in to the original movie. The plot was pointless, the gags were ridiculous, it looked like a 5 year old created them.The beginning was completely pointless and gross, it didn't even belong with the movie. The characters were not developed and it seemed as if they rushed just to get it out on time.There was one point where they didn't have enough money to purchase walkie talkies... So, you guessed it, they used paper cups with strings... It was completely stupid...Sorry I am using the word stupid so much, but it was a complete waste of film. The entire movie was a waste of everyone's time, the actors included.Ken"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had me rolling!","review":"I don't know what all this negativity is all about!

I also think the crude humor went further in the second which made it more enjoyable and more laughs for the fans of the scary movie set. But if you don't get gross out by crude sexual humor and sugesstive wording then pick this second movie up in the set and enjoy laugh after laugh all evening long."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Skips though it was supposed to be New","review":"The DVD was supposed to be new. It took quite a few minutes for it to even start playing on my Xbox and then at the end it wouldn't stop skipping and I got the \\"trying to read media\\" message every couple of seconds.

These guys have revolutionized the parody genre with movies like Don't Be a Menace..., and now the Scary Movie series.This movie is just as funny , with parodies they didn't hit on like What Lies Beneath and parodying the Exorcist/Stigmata type movies. This will soon be considered comic brilliance along the lines of Mel Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF GARBAGE","review":"I don't know what went on on the Wayans brothers minds (Money, maybe...) to release such a disgraceful picture, disguised as \\"comedy\\", but in truth just a mere vehicle for some of the worst dirt jokes ever created for screen. There's no semblance to a plot, no chemistry between actors (due to the lack of plot!!). You gonna tell me this is a movie to forget about plots and just enjoy. But it is impossible to enjoy. I hope this movie flounders in the cash office, so they can never make a third SCARY MOVIE! But, reading to some reviews, I think that willl not be the case: this movie will be successfull and they will make another one.... Where are your brains, people ???!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a candle to the Original","review":"After enjoying the original Scary Movie, I was quite disappointed with this sequel.The majority of the jokes were dopey or stale, and I just didn't find myself laughing that much during the film.Tori Spelling was just *awful* in this picture, and it's no wonder that the majority of her efforts ended up on the cutting room floor (you can view them as deleted scenes on the bonus disc if you feel like punishing yourself).The talented Tim Curry is totally wasted here, as well. Another big name, James Woods, was pretty funny as the priest with bowel problems.I very much like the lead (Anna Faris), but she's not enough to save this poor production.

It had the lamest jokes ever executed in the history of comedy. The Exorcist spoof was stupid and I wasn't laughing at most of the time, but I have to tip my hat off to The Wayans brothers anyway. They proved that they know how to execute a comedy, and because of that I'm going to give Scary Movie 2 a rating of zero stars for an outstanding job. I would've given them an additional star had they included scenes of me and my wife Cerina Vincent from Not Another Teen Movie doing things that Andrew Dice Clay would be turned on by, but the scenes of me and her together would've had Scary Movie 2 banned in about 50 countries.And I'm looking forward to Scary Movie 3 so when I watch it I can throw popcorn and soda at the screen.

Some good actors and actress also waisted their time and reputation in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly, truly awful in every respect","review":"Scary Movie 2 actually starts off strongly with a short, totally self-contained spoof of \\"The Exorcist\\" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film. It's got the flavor and energy of the Wayans' old show, \\"In Living Color\\"...over-the-top, wacky, and outrageous, but intelligently handled.Then it all goes to hell and never comes back. The movie after that point is disgusting, crass, cheap, and perverse...all of which would perfectly fine if the results were funny, but they're not. There's not a single chuckle for the run of the movie. The spoofs are just excuses for gross sex jokes and bodily functions. Chris Elliot is guaranteed to make you cringe as he licks cake frosting off of his whithered hand. In another gag sequence, a handicapped fellow pulls himself up a flight of stairs with his arms. Yes folks --- that's the level of humor I'm talking about.Avoid, avoid, avoid.

She doesn't seem very suited as Holly Golightly, who is a girl about town and seems so glamorous and carefree, even though she struggles with her life. I think that though she appeared to be carefree, she was actually quite depressed. The only thing that can cheer her up from 'the mean reds' is to go to Tiffany's.Hepburn is just beautiful in this movie and it's a delight to watch her. One thing that really annoyed me was the Asian guy who owns the apartment builing. He was SO annoying and such a bother. Was he meant to be humorous? Because he definitely was not. Anyway, her costumes were just fabulous, since after all they were designed by Givenchy. It's a fun movie, and Audrey Hepburn does shine, even if it is not the most suitable role for her. And obviously there's 'Moon River', one of the most beautiful songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting story, haunting characters","review":"A strength of a movie is measured by how much I remember 15, 20, 25 years later.This movie I saw only once in the mid 1990s, and I remember so much of it: the Moon River song, the Kansan ex husband, the gigolo, the mole...It is really haunting.Too bad the movie in typical Hollywood style changes the ending from tragic to happy all ok, in denigration of the original Truman Capote book on which it is based.Also very typical Hollywood: racist, unfunny Japanese man portrayed in yellowface by Mickey Rooney. That part was disgusting. It was, \\"let's depict the humanity of the beautiful white female low social class prostitute, but let's stereotype the Asian man.\\"Despite this huge flaw and handicap, it is still a great movie, that's just how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Rats here! ;P","review":"I received this version of Breakfast At Tiffany's for my birthday this year.

Peppard's Paul Varjak is struggling to make ends meet while he writes; Hepburn's Holly Golightly is simply struggling to fend off loneliness and the panic attacks caused by her precarious future. They find each other and a very touching love story unfolds, culminating in a wonderful rain-drenched finale. It loses a star from me because of Mickey Rooney's offensively stereotypical performance as Mr. Yunioshi, the Japanese landlord.

In fact, Patricia Neal's character does not exist in the book. Capote's description of Holly Golightly does not make one immediately think of Hepburn either. However, anything that Audrey Hepburn made (with the exception of Two for the Road) simply can not be bad. The story is captivating. Hepburn probably plays her most famous character. Mickey Rooney is hysterical as the landlord living upstairs. Breakfast at Tiffany's has all the elements of a best picture winner; why didn't it win? Hollywood likes musicals I suppose (West Side Story won that year)."},{"rating":"2","title":"how old is holly?","review":"Overall, this is a well-done movie, with the exception of Mickey Rooney.My problem is not in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella--it IS a very different story than what's being told here. Could you film a version that's closer to Capote's story? Of course. But this film works as a stand-alone piece.My problem is: how old exactly is Holly supposed to be? Audrey Hepburn was 31 when she made this movie, and while she's absolutely enchanting in it, SHE LOOKS 31. But when Buddy Ebsen shows up, he tells George Peppard that Holly was just shy of 14 when they married, and that his first wife died on the 4th of July, 1955. Since the movie is set in 1961, that would make Holly (at most) all of 20 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Purchased Breakfast At Tiffany's - Paramount Centennial Collection (Mastered in High Definition along with Audrey Hepburn Collection (Breakfast at Tiffany's / Roman Holiday / Sabrina). After watching both, there was no discernible difference between them. Save your money and purchase The Collection.

I agree with the observation that audrey hepburn is very classic and elegant but I found the movie to be extremely boring!!!! In fact the only part I did enjoy was the music. Perhaps I went into it with too high of expectations since it is such a revered movie, but good acting or not, it was very slow paced and I fail to see why this was such a hot movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"neurotic","review":"This movie does not age well so it really isn't a classic that I will be recommending to future generations (unlike My Fair Lady.) It's not the prostitution that bothers me but the main character's not at all charming behavior. She's very tedious and pretentious despite being played by Audrey Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn was wonderful but not all her films were successful. I bet James Dean would have been tiresome too if he hadn't died while he was ahead. Unlike Elizabeth Taylor (and her modern day successor of adiposean beauty Scarlett Johannsen), Audrey Hepburn could not make a bad film watchable. Elizabeth Taylor was in a lot of strange films and very few perfect films but in some of her lesser films, she managed to make a better mini film inside of the bigger movie. She did it with The Last Time I Saw Paris despite having no chemistry with Van Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I've loved this movie for too many years to count, & I've loved Audrey Hepburn for longer than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I eat Breakfast here?","review":"My all-time favorite movie! Aubrey Hepburn shines in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella as the flighty Holly Golightly. Living in a small New York City apartment, Holly earns her living by going to visit a convicted criminal in Sing Sing, and spends her mornings wandering down 5th Avenue window-shopping at Tiffany's. Her love affair with the handsome author who lives in the apartment upstairs is the core part of this movie. This is a must-see classic; one of Audrey Hepburn's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could'a been a contenda...","review":"This movie would have been fantastic if not for Peppard's boring or Rooney's racist acting. Peppard was really miscast. It's like watching paint dry. He's so boring as much as Hepburn is charming. I don't see how anyone would not agree that Rooney's portrayal is anything but racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic!!","review":"I gurentee, you will fall head over heels for this enchanting movie!

She represents the ultimate urban chic that is being told in almost all fashion books-the huge sun glasses, the trench, black little dress with pearls. Surely, the movie is more than that, a lonely lost woman who feels she does not belong to anywhere and anyone,but still partying and charming men fulltime-very elegantly. That is really outstanding-Holly's pursuing men seems so effortless and carefree, but still persistent. The opening scene is so striking-Audrey having breakfast at Tiffanny's with her party clothes looking at the windows displaying jewellery. However, I found the movie a bit slow paced. I also could not help but think that \\"Sex and the City\\"and the character Carrie (mostly the book)adopted a lot from this movie. This may be the movie starting it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but cuteness doesn't count..","review":"Holly Golightly is no doubt adorable. What frustrates me is that the director and producers think that 2 hours of Holly acting cute counts as a movie. The plot is simple and doesn't make much sense: A young gold-digging Holly Golightly is obsessed with the idea of marrying a rich guy. She then takes her equally money-obsessed neighbor shoplifting and true love somehow instantly sprouts from there. This movie is not for me, but you might like it if you believe in \\"love at first sight\\" and have a thing for Holly's classic charm and silly but cute antics.Another thing, the one and only Asian person in the movie was portrayed as a buck-teethed, rude, socially-retarded, and all-around pathetic loser. I am Asian myself and was deeply offended that Asians are stereotyped in this movie as being the stupid and ugly people of American society. The thought of the general public laughing at an immigrant's accent and lack of English skills is disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Understand Why This Movie Is Such an Icon","review":"I've wanted to see this movie for years, but was very disappointed.

It greatly differs from the book but I still feel that it is perfect! Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful choice for the 'tres chic' Holiday Golightly. The music, by Henry Mancini adds to the movies charm and appeal. I am very glad to have seen it and it always puts me in a very happy disposition after I watch it, but my advice is to not watch it too often and too many times in a row because then if you watch it again, now matter how long from then, like with any movie you could easily get sick of it. Breakfast at Tiffany's is however, a great movie classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audrey is amazing.","review":"Breakfast is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all time, a true classic. Ms. Hepburn is completely believeable as Holly Golightly. The movie touches your heart. You can't help but love Holly and \\"Fred-baby\\". Two powerfully moving scenes: When Holly says good bye to Doc at the train station, and the most amazing and moving performance I've ever seen, the last scene when Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard are in the cab on the way to the airport. \\"You're already in that cage, baby.

This movie was definitely not my favorite of hers, Roman Holiday is. She doesn't seem very suited as Holly Golightly, who is a girl about town and seems so glamorous and carefree, even though she struggles with her life. I think that though she appeared to be carefree, she was actually quite depressed. The only thing that can cheer her up from 'the mean reds' is to go to Tiffany's.Hepburn is just beautiful in this movie and it's a delight to watch her. Her costumes were just fabulous, since after all they were designed by Givenchy. Anyway, it's a fun movie, and Audrey Hepburn does shine, even if it is not the most suitable role for her.

It combines everything a classic should have - great actors (Audrey is tops and Peppard was never better), a great screenplay, a perfect score and New York (as usual) doing its best. The screenplay departs from the Capote's original but it does so in a way which makes the story work and which could be presented on the screen in 1961 - actually, the story is quite daring for the early 60s but you have to read between the lines every now and then to get it. Anyway, why shouldn't you reach for the original book once you are done watching?In short - How does it look? I must say I'm amazed.PS I wouldn't, however, recommend the movie to anyone who wants to quit smoking... ;)PPS If you need more, you should also reach for Love and Other Disasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audrey is one classy and funny lady!","review":"I hadn't really been into the old flics, til I saw this one on television, I had to get it.

My daughter had seen the beginning at a friends house and we rented it to finish watching, but my husband and I were unable to watch it and stopped my daughter from watching it. The premise of a humanized Devil with a son who cares for him could be presented and palatable if it was done with respect. As it is the comedy was vulgar, the attitude presented towards people was demeaning, Little Nicky was presented as a caring, feeling son abused by his siblings because he was not evil. I do not recommend this movie for either children or teenagers (at least adults have enough sense to realize when something is not funny). It presents abuse, vulgarity and disrespect as funny attitudes towards life. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't know they made movies that were this awful","review":"I thought Sandler's \\"Mr. Deeds\\" and \\"Happy Gilmore\\" were awfully stupid movies, but then I had the misfortune to sit through \\"Little Nicky.\\" I realize now that \\"Mr. Deeds\\" & \\"Happy Gilmore,\\" by comparison, were absolute artistic masterpieces.My God, how does a movie as uniformly awful manage to get past even the executives that approve a script for production? It just boggles the mind how bad this was, on every level. How respectable actors such as Harvey Keitel could associate themselves with this cinematic vomit is also mind-boggling.This was a truly painful movie to sit through, and is angling for a spot on my hallowed list of 10 All-Time Worst Movies (alongside Mannequin & Baby Geniuses). I still feel the nausea induced by this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow ..... what a piece of garbage!","review":"This movie almost (by itself) destroyed Adam Sandler's career. Not that its much of a career, he plays the same character in all of his films .... but it's a likable character. By the end of this film though, I wanted to reach through the screen and smack Sandler so bad to make him stop that ridiculous voice.His friends were their usual funny selves, but the talking dog (Smeigel) was just bad. I expect higher standards from the same guy who does Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.I do agree that there are some great cameo's though and Keitel does a great job in his limited role. But these do not save this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE IN MY LIST","review":"This move is so funny, I love it. You need to like silly stupid stuff to love this movie, you know not be too serious. It's an excellent movie about the sons of the devil, adman sandler being the sweet innocent one. This movie always keeps me cracking up, even when I keep watching it over again. I love stuff like this, fantasy and comedy...so great. I would so buy this movie if you love silly comedy that will have you on the floor cracking up. I also like the movie airheads and idle hands so if you liked those movies BUY THIS!

And boy am I glad that I gave this movie a chance! It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny! This is some of Sandler's best work yet.The Hell costumes and sets were fabulous, and I thought that it was remarkable that Adam could keep his face in that weird position for such a long time.I also found that Little Nicky, and an Adam Sandler character from SNL (Gil Graham) share many traits. If you have ever seen this character then you'll know what I mean.Overall, this is a HILARIOUS movie, and I highly reccomend that you rent/purchase it!:-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb and pointless...","review":"I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Pointless and dumb. I took it out of the DVD player half way through it. I didn't laugh, at all, during the parts I did see. There is nothing else I can say about this movie...definitely pass on it. It's not even worth the ONE star!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've always LOVED this movie...","review":"I have loved this movie ever since it came out. It's so hilarious!

That is what I would have said if I thought this film wasn't funny. Actually I thought debutant Aaron Sandler produced one of the funniest performances since Mason Howard in Monkey Mayhem. I did not stop laughing all the way through. Superhuman efforts from the majority of the third unit only served to increase my enjoyment of every scene. Well every scene apart from the obvious one. By utilising a combination of audio and vision, 'the directors director' has plucked a metaphorical rabbit from his metophorical hat. If there is a funnier movie this year all credit to the cast and crew. A classic of its kind, Little Nicky succeeds in genre-bending to moving effect. Congratulations. Top marks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I was really looking forward to another Adam Sandler movie, but this was really disappointing.

They couldn't save it though...spend your time with another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will have one hell of a good time.","review":"Little nicky is a very funny movie.

Buy it, you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, no","review":"Wow, was I ever dissapointed, this is just another wonderful example of how ignorant the people of this country have become. I mean, even Happy Gilmore was a bit of a stretch but this proved it, idiocy sells. It makes me mad that people like Adam Sandler make millions while doctors and educators scrape by, god bless america I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"jamon","review":"of course the dvd has got more to offer - what film hasn't. but what i feel is important in this film is the questioning of our ultimate fate. very rarley does a work of art challenge our expectatiioons of what a work of art should do. but this film does it. in spades. for me, the crux was methusala challenging travis to a vocabuulary test. which obviously is an easy contest. but then again, how does one square the root problem of disenfranchisement? by ignoring the poor beggers, of course. the poor are obviously a burden on capitaist society, which little nicky excpresses beautifully. adam sandler is probably the greatest ever melancolic fool since jim robinson died of a coranary disease. and one can only hope that sandler befalls a similar fate. soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sandler movie.","review":"3 and 1/2 starsThis is one of Sandler's best. I was laughing my head off the first time I saw it on TV. That prompted me to buy this one. Well, the plot is centered around Nicky who'a a shy dude that has two mean brothers. But he's a unique guy because he's the son of the Devil. When his father is dying because of his brothers, he needs to go down to earth to retrieve his brothers as that's the only way he can save him. It's funny to see him there because he keeps on dying. He gets hit by trains, busses, etc.. but then just respawns. He is met by a talking dog and they become friends. This movie's about a really \\"foreign\\" guy that's got to go on a journey to save his dad. There's a good cast with Adam Sandler, Harvey Keitel, Patricia Arquette, Reese Witherspoon and a brief appearance by John Lovitz. The movie is sacriligious and quite stupid but it still delivered laughs which is always good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Funny!","review":"I thought Little Nicky was funny. Most of the critics dispised it, but I bet they don't even like Adam Sandler. If you're a big fan of Adam Sandler, don't let them fool ya! This is one of his best movies. I especially liked the surprise appearance of Reese Witherspoon as his mother in heaven, and all those cameos at the end sequence. Patricia Arquette, wearing those geeky glasses, looks unnoticable after seeing her in Stigmata and NOES 3. Anyway, you're in for a good laugh, so I recommend Little Nicky. Plus, the DVD has good features!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"If you like Adam Sandler, this is a great movie! It's funny!

It wasn't red (as was the previous bottle), and it smelled watery and stale. Big disappointment, but thankfully, Amazon refunded us.Guess the takeaway is that when you buy perfumes long-distance, you may get a cheaper version, but you may also get an old bottle, which was, we assume, the case with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Love the smell of this perfume. I have been using it for 5 years and the only place I could find it in recent times was the middle east and europe so I would buy a million when I went on vacation. At this price it is a steal. It is also great that it is a genuine product and not a fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Universal","review":"This is one of the worst professional DVD's I've ever received. The compression is so poor that chunks of color information are clearly visible even during the opening credits. Also, it comes with a warning that it may not even be playable in computer drives. What's most frustrating is that the print is obviously a pretty good one. The levels are all good. All Universal needed was to take some care with the compression of this dvd. I can excuse the fact that there's no booklet or further information about the film aside from the unimaginatively designed front and back of box. This would be fine if the dvd looked better. But it just looks completely cheap and unprofessional. Worse than Netflix quality. For this they have the nerve to charge nearly 20 dollars! What a shame!!!! I wish Universal would just let Criterion license the film and do a proper release. The film, which is very curious and great, deserves a whole lot better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice true widescreen transfer","review":"It's Fellini, so of course it's very good. But I couldn't tell when I ordered this made-on-demand release whether the DVD transfer was 'letterboxed' or true widescreen. It is true widescreen, and a nice transfer with very good image quality. I think now only Fellini's 'La voce della luna' remains unavailable on DVD. I hope someone is able to remedy that absence soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved Fellini's Satyricon, you'll find the same mysterious wanderings and shocking masks here","review":"A passionate fan of Fellini, I managed, with some difficulty, to view Fellini's Casanova around 1977, never to watch it again until I bought this DVD. From the fragments I could remember and from what I read about Casanova, I was expecting a Fellini film of greater self-indulgence and less seriousness than many of his other films. I was pleasantly surprised to find this Fellini project is very nearly as delicious as my favorite Fellini film, Fellini's Satyricon. The two have much in common including the exploration of dream imagery and broken significance, dislocation in alien worlds of half-understood signs and mysterious threats, the pathos of loneliness, aging and mortality -- not to mention Il Maestro's lavish use of color and visual distortion to communicate the ironies of artifice. I quite loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fellini than Casanova","review":"Artsy, boring and empty. Unsuccessful in delineating Casanova, but maybe Fellini had his reasons. Mediocre print. Speech does not match the actors' lip movements. Score is good - Nino Rota is always fun. I say not a masterpiece, but to each his own. Read the Casanova memoirs instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cheese EVA!!!!!","review":"Was It Nothing At All is the best song ever!

And so carefully and respectfully shot. It shows how we are more humane to animals then ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly Compelling","review":"This is a surprisingly engrossing documentary on the \\"death with dignity\\" act in Oregon. It is impeccably executed with lots of emotion and little opportunity to really consider the question apart from the personal stories of those in the film. As a youth leader in my local church, I plan on showing this film when it releases next year in order to spark discussion about a very difficult subject. However, the creators obviously had an agenda. I still disagree with \\"death with dignity,\\" and I think films have a way of forcing us to disengage intellectually and just \\"feel\\" our way to a decision. In this case, the decision is in favor of, essentially, murder. It is important that those of us in the Christian community be careful not to make cold, snap judgments, but it is also important to carefully consider these questions in light of clear Scriptural teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite documentary","review":"I watch a lot of documentaries and this one is my favorite.

The Hare Krishna Temple used to use this incense, and that's where I first smelled it. It has a lingering aroma long after the incense is burned, and I'm frequently asked what type of incense I use by people who come to my house. Its formulation may have changed slightly from its original, but it still is some of the best incense on the market, and reasonably priced. I always have quite a few boxes on hand at all times. I store additional boxes in my lingerie drawers, and it gives the clothing a wonderful scent--not too strong...just right.

It burns slowly, yet with a constant stream, it's long lasting and has an excellent rich and complex fragrance that lingers true to the scent long afterwards. So many incense sticks have creative names, packaging, and smell interesting before being burned; but then totally disappoint by smelling like dirty socks as they burn. Nag Champa is not only an excellent incense, but it is one of the most economical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a calming wonderful aroma","review":"This is the ONLY brand I will buy.

The incense and the box did not smell like Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa (the box from Amazon was slightly different than the one from the local store, suspect counterfeit).Please do not buy into the few reviews saying the formula has changed to explain away these discrepancies. Boxes I have purchased less than a month ago with 2012 stickers on the box smell just as great (and the same) as this incense smelled in the early 1980's when I started using it.

So, I would purchase a dual voltage travel hairdryer if you need one. Also, due to its weight, once you connect the appropriate adapter, the voltage unit will tend to pull out of the wall outlet.

Great, soulful old-school rock steady and reggae. If you like this check out the CD \\"My Best Girl Wears My Crown\\", from the Paragons (if it's still available...)

It's extremely well made, very easy to install with the enclosed hardware, and very inexpensive compared to comparable models. The tilt feature is great-- once the TV is mounted, the unit is so well balanced that you can tilt the TV up or down to any position and it stays in that position without even tightening the knob that holds it in place.

All the needed hardware was enclosed to make it possible to mount this bracket to wall studs or to a concrete wall (glad I did not have to do the latter installation though). Once the bracket is in place, you can adjust your viewing angle up to 12 degrees and have a bit of room for lateral positioning the TV as well. My son and I successfully installed both the bracket and TV in less than an hour, and much of that time was spent measuring and positioning before we committed to a location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screws break - stay from this product until its fixed!","review":"Had a terrible time mounting this on the studs since 3 screws broke simply when tightening them (and not over tightening)!

I have removed and remounted the first mount three times with the same bolts and and no problems. The kit also includes a plethora of different sized bolts for mounting the brackets to a TV. The only downside is that when mounting a larger TV it is hard to get your arm to the angel adjusting knobs because of the TVs proximity to the wall.

The hanger will adjust well horizontally (L or R) but does not adjust Vertically (U or D). You must be VERY level on your hole drilling because it will affect how level your tv hangs. Also, if pulling the wires thru the wall and coming thru the circular openings, keep in mind, the hangers on the tv CAN NOT slide past the wires - they will catch - so your left/right adjustment (which is a great feature) will be limited once your wires are pulled thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"jack","review":"I have a 42\\"panasonic plasma that I decided to hang on a wall.

The product is easy to install and is of excellent quality. Very heavy gauge steel.My set is about 40lbs. so it easily holds my T.V. and much more. A word of caution for Panasonic users. This mount allegedly holds up to a 56\\"set but my 42\\" just fit withnothing to spare. That is because the Panasonic mounting screws are very wide spread only a few inches from the sides.

Some of Sadler's books are good in parts, others good all through. This was assassinated after about one third of the way in! Maybe it was written in one afternoon and there were cakes in the oven... not one of his best but a few good points? Well, the induction into the Assassins was well written and the Arabic characterization was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Assassin","review":"Further to my review below it seems to me that many of Sadler's later books were written by ghost writers as the style widely differed. In this book it first began to be noticeable, and really is a bit too neatly packaged, particularly at the end where everything is neatly and conveniently tidied up. Its a little too unbelievable which spoils the storyline.Otherwise the story is ok, without being anywhere near the classic of early Sadlers in this series.for more Casca see www.casca.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse than \\"Harvest\\"","review":"This Book has to many repeatitive things going on.

If you do not share my dislike of books which fail to contain an entire storyline within one pair of covers, consider this a three to four star review. But given that we not only don't complete the story here, but we don't even find out who the bad guys are, this is a truly annoyingly incomplete story. I'm not objecting to the fact that the storyline has continued on into this book from the previous one, as that book completed its primary plotline; what carried over into this book are essentially subplots, which is always acceptable. But to leave the primary storyline so completely up in the air is to beg a grade of, at best, \\"incomplete\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"We don't guarantee that this remote control works.\\"","review":"I bought this one as a replacement remote for my Sony television.

Her parents, while played for comedy, are in fact emotionally abusive. They don't appear to have any interest in Amy as their daughter. They see her simply as the potential breeder of their grandchildren. Her publicist is controlling, manipulative, and that is when she isn't completely out of line. (Amy fires her about half way through the film. One wonders why it takes that long.) Her \\"friends\\" are a mockery of the idea of friendship, since they do not appear to be capable of accepting her as she is. As for the relationship that is at the core of this movie, the premise is that a bimbo-a-week guy could at the drop of a hat turn into Mr. Sensitivity if only he met the right girl.There is also a shtick with a Catholic priest, that is so contrived, so stupid, so out of touch with what Catholic priests do that it is hard to conceive that anyone ever thought it was amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was horrible.

I thought it was a little slow in the begining but once it picked up it was quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"durn good book.","review":"what i love about this book is that it exemplifies l.m. montgomery at her best. It has themes that interest and relate to an older audiance, but also appeals to the younger reader throught the sheer ridiculousness of some of the characters.Plot-wise, I feel there are a lot of parallels to Jane Eyre, but more \\"modern\\" and far more flippant.This book is just excellent for all dreamers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather like a fairy tale","review":"An enjoyable book- different from LM Montgomery books in some ways- sweet. And with a typical fairy tale happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story for grownups","review":"I read the Anne books over and over as a kid. Having grown up, I read those books (and all others) differently. It was a pleasure to find a story for grownups in Montgomery's oeuvre. Excellent story. Would recommend to anyone. I haven't seen it in print, but the kindle version was unobtrusive."},{"rating":"2","title":"My very favorite book","review":"This is my very favorite book. I have read it at least 20 times. I love Anne of Green Gables and all of L. M. Montgomery's work but The Blue Castle is by far my favorite. It is predictable and kind of cheesy and total wish fulfillment but that is ok. Sometimes we need a little wish fulfillment and L. M. Montgomery by the time she wrote this book had so perfected her beautiful writing style that she could have written a story about smelly socks and it still would have been brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite book, comfort food for the eyes","review":"I can honestly say that I have probably read this book at least 2 dozen times and it is my favourite Montgomery novel. I read the book most often when I was in my teens and had run out of things to read, but even now there is something so satisfying in reading this story, savouring the situations and Valancy's triumph. I enjoy Montgomery's style and recommend her short stories not be overlooked by people who appreciate her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"Easy read, not to exciting? The story was very basic in character and plot.

You can't help but fall in love with Valancy, Barney, and Roaring Abel...even Barney's cats are characters unto themselves. With these fascinating characters and a plot that is eminiently satisfying, nobody could help enjoying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an all-time favourite","review":"this lovely, inspiring book! what can anyone say for it?the plot is terribly original and exciting, the love story is the sweetest in the whole world.however, the most important thing in this book is the message! the message about accepting who you are, no matter what people say. to be brave enough to be who you are and enjoy it! this may seem so difficult to live for some people (like me), and this book may seem more like a fairytale.....however, with God on our side we can do it too.so the story of this book inspired me to start enjoying my life and accepting myself. i was amazed at the change it brought about with God's help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming book!","review":"I'm a long-time L.M. Montgomery fan, and The Blue Castle is definitely my favorite of her stand-alone books. L. M. is wonderful at illustrating the trials and tribulations of large extended families, and Valancy's family tops them all! This is a sweet love story, with many funny parts and a surprise ending. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, Beautiful, and Breath-taking.","review":"This is by far one of L.M.'s most wonderful books. It is so lovely it hurts. I have read it a countless number of times; so many times, in fact, that I can open it to any page and know exactly where I am in the story. After all those times, it never loses its beauty. It is wonderful to witness Valancy grow and blossom and finally receive the love she so desperately deserves. More than love, Valancy gets justice. After years of being robbed of beauty and kindness, she gets both, and more, in spades. L.M. does an incredible job of describing every small detail and making the reader feel as though they know each character personally. I know Barney; I know Valancy. It is incredible read and one that I will cherish all my life. There are not enough words to describe this book; it is genuine treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fav Montgomery story","review":"I grew up reading Anne, Emily, and Jane. I found this story when I was a bit older, late teens or early 20's I think. In any case, this is one of the sweetest, most memorable stories I have read in my life. It isn't a child's book, but fine for older kids and teens. This is a wonderful story about love, fear, life, joy, true beauty, heartbreak, and redemtion. Now that my on daughter is a teen, I'm getting it for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light reading","review":"I was always attracted to this love story because of the picture it presents of society at that point between the uptight, upright Victorian era and the freer modern era. Although some of the characterizations are stereotypical, its humerous, easy and light."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone's blue castle","review":"This is one of my favorite L.M. Montegomery novels. As usual, she does an excellent job on character development. Valancy is one of the characters I've enjoyed the most (other than Anne). I relate quite well to Valancy's 'split-personality;'by this I mean, she presents one personality to the world and is a completely different person on the inside in her imaginary 'blue castle' in Spain. The book chronicles her decision to reveal her internal self to the world. The results are humorous, but believable (at least in how her family reacts). For as much as I enjoy this book, first time readers should remember it's fiction and Montegomery uses this to her advantage when writing parts of the plot.Great novel to escape with, particularly if someone is already a Montegomery fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like The Blue Castle","review":"The Blue Castle is like a reworking of the Cindarella story. There is also a repetition of themes from the Anne series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of L.M. Montgomery's best books","review":"L.M. Montgomery is my favorite author and has been for the past 14 years...ever since I received my first set of Anne books for my 10th birthday. I have read most of her books (all that I have been able to get). The Blue Castle is one of her best books, and one of my favorites. It's every bit as good as the Anne series and the Emily series. I highly reccommend it to anyone who loves L.M. Montgomery's work or anyone who is just in need of a simple, innocent, perfectly enthralling book to escape into from this crazy world we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good you'll wear it out!","review":"Anyone who thinks L.M. Montgomery is just a children's author should read this book. Although it's appropriate for younger ages and its reading level may not be very demanding, I think adults would appreciate the wit and insights in this novel more than younger readers might. I discovered The Blue Castle at 25, at a time when I wasn't all that interested in adolescent literature. Reading it felt like discovering a long-lost friend. Montgomery's keen sense of human nature shapes characters so real that I'd swear I've met them. I've read this book so many times that I've worn out two copies of it. This is my favorite book by this author and one of my all-time favorites, period. As much as I like Anne of Green Gables, it pales in comparison to The Blue Castle. The story is so much better than the synopsis sounds, but it's hard to say much about the plot without giving away the best of it. This is also the only book Montgomery wrote which is *not* set in Prince Edward Island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This book has no chapter which is less delightful than another. Just good reading from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I expected too much, but...","review":"I read the reviews for this book and immediately ordered it, but I was incredibly disappointed at this book's cliches, and overall unbelievability. It was occasionally entertaining, but the end was predictable and dragged out. True, we should all aspire to be a free spirit like Valancy, but a free spirit should be ORIGINAL too. To me this book's only interest was that it gave a rare look into LM Montgomery's thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Anne, Forget Valancy!","review":"As a loyal Anne of Green Gables fan, having read all of them twice and the video series multiple times, I was expectant when I discovered this book by L. M. Montgomery. After the glowing reviews I read, I ordered it eagerly. Reading it, however, was a disappointment as the tone is a somber, repressed one, not saucy and bright, like the Anne books. I didn't even give it to my sister, who is another Anne fan, as it would be a waste of her time. I slipped it into the airport trash on my way home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet, fun story","review":"It's been years since I read anything by L.M. Montgomery, although I loved the Anne books in my youth. While this story is a bit dated, it is a fun book to read. Montgomery has an uncanny knack of creating utterly realistic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Grownup L. M. Montgomery Book","review":"This Book is the only novel in which L. M. Montgomery has a heroine that is an adult (if you don't count the later Anne books). I have read EVERY book and story that she ever wrote. This is one of the funniest, and most romantic of all of them. It has an uncanny character of its own and is obviously meant for older readers.Some of the content deals with Cicely Gay's illegitimate child.There is also a very drunk character, though this is more funny than anything else. You can't put this book down from the first irresistible paragraph."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Uplifiting Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It has just the right amount of mystery, interest, love, and peacefulness. I believe its main theme is that of life's preciousness and Carpe Diem. It is not the kind of book you can't put down, but a good one to slowly finish. I would recommend it to anyone, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great book by the author of Anne of Green Gables. A cute love story, a fun and fast read. Very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"As a librarian I see lots of Encyclopedias. I was very impressed with this one in particular because it is full of color photos, and children always like pictures with their text.

My next goal is to try to get one into each of the seven classrooms in my school!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be any better","review":"I bought this for my son on his 3rd birthday. He is very interested in books even though he can't read yet. I had to buy him 3 or 4 books a month to keep him occupied. My son loves this book. He loves the pictures and somebody has to read him articles from this book every night before bedtime. This book will keep him satisfied for several years because there are so many articles. We have to translate the articles to Sinhala because his English is not that good yet. But it's worth the effort since his knowledge is improving fast. I think buying him this book is the best thing I've done for him so far. I've found some mistakes in certain articles.

I watched PE first which set my expectations for the Blue Planet (BP). I was extremely disappointed. The narrator was extremely monotonous, and did nothing to really add to the experience. The viusals were good, but the stories were disjointed and brief. I expected more. The duration of the film was also very short. I really expected to see a full length video documentary on the oceans, seas, and lakes. PE has sections that cover oceans and seas and that rendition is so much better than Blue Planet. I can see why now it is sold with Planet Earth as by itself it would be a flop. Great pictures though."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMAX: Blue Planet & The Dream Is Alive","review":"This blu-ray is absolutely phenomenal.

I think we would have rather received the Planet Earth series, starting with the ocean one. That may have been more interesting.

In comparison to the BBC line of Blu-rays available, this Blue Planet pales in comparison (not 100% certain that this is not part of the BBC line, but just by comparison of the quality, it definitely does not seem to be).For really stunning visuals, great narration, entertaining and suitable soundtrack, and an enjoyable, engrossing learning experience, get Planet Earth, and the remaining BBC line - Galapogos, Wild China, Ganges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool as Luke","review":"My older comp was running again a brick wall.

Having read several of Thomas' other books, I expected quality writing presenting prophetic truth.This book, however, disappointed me because the snippets of chapters on various virtues were so clipped that they were shallow on substance. I thought it was a bit presumptuous of the author to extract many of his own quotations to sandwich the chapters--a couple quotations is tasteful, but so many made me question this decision. I also thought the font was too small.Overall, the eyestrain that the book requires makes it even more not worth reading.I do highly recommend Mr. Thomas' other books, though. Especially \\"Sacred Marriage.\\" \\"Authentic Faith\\" is good too, as well as one of his earlier books that introduce the reader to Christian devotional classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real journey here","review":"This is a slim primer on being virtuous, promising much and delivering little.

Highly recommended for all children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent but focused on producing consumers instead of phonics.","review":"I had the advantage of renting both this and Leapfrog: Letter Factory one after the other, and the differences are stark. Leapfrog: Phonics Farm has catchy songs, bright colorful characters, and a plot.... that are devoid of learning material. And some bits about phonics thrown in there for the parents. When me and my son finished watching this one, my son kept humming the theme song (about the leapfrog branded characters) and couldn't remember anything about actual letters.On the other hand, after we watched Leapfrog: Letter Factory, my son couldn't stop quoting, \\"Is this the 'E' room\\"? to me. (Appropriate response: Ehhh??\\".In short, if you're looking for a Leapfrog DVD about phonics, get the Letter Factory and leave this one alone. Where the Letter Factory is about teaching letters, this DVD is about getting kids hooked on Leapfrog DVDs. (on the other hand, DO buy Letter Factory - it's freaking brilliant.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute.","review":"My 2 yr old likes this a lot and will repeat the letters.

Take it from a former elemenarty teacher this is a wonderful way to learn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for learning ABC recognition for a 2 year old","review":"This DVD is great it teaches letters upper and lower and their sounds as well as matches up an animal that starts with each letter.

Sure she's a bitch. Sure she has a bob. Sure sure sure. We knew that walking in. And ???? Maybe because I'd read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" I was prepared for the personality but still, this seemed very thin. As the old joke says, \\"It's just like the plains, you keep driving and nothing ever happens.\\" Quoting everybody's veiw on the personalilty doesn't explain why the success, what really happens to make a magazine successful, why does it work. Generally a biography gives you some insight on the industry of the subject but I know little more about fashion, publishing, etc than I did before I picked up the book. There's no real meat on the (however scrawny) bone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...copy editor, anyone?","review":"This book has plenty of entertaining, juicy gossip. But I cannot get my head around the fact that a book with this many spelling mistakes was allowed to be published. I swear I found 20 or more blatant mistakes. For an example of the utter lack of proofreading, Issey Miyake's first name is spelled correctly on one page and then spelled \\"Issye\\" on another. The worst error? On a single page--340 to be exact--Ben Widdicombe's last name is spelled correctly, and then not five sentences later, it is spelled \\"Widdicome.\\" Unacceptable! The non-existent spell-checking made me wonder if anything I was reading was FACT-checked?! I concluded that this book is quite disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"the only reason i finished this \\"book\\" was because i just wanted the information. To say Jerry Opennheimer's style is disgusting would be an understatement. I cringed at every line and his pages were so leaded with stupid, crude metaphors and ridiculous over dramatizations that i wanted to kill myself! There was distict rat-like quality about the whole thing. When writing about Wintour- rival Grace Mirabella's last days at Vogue, he said: \\"Just when Mirabella thought she was finally safe from that skinny shark draped in Chanel, she started hearing the Jaws theme song ringing in her ears again.\\" come on! YUCK. enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darin Gregus","review":"Loved it! Yes, I'm surprised because I'm a novel reader who never picks up a biography. Oppenheimer's gift for story telling, however, made this one read more like a wonderful work of fiction.

What a bizarre world behind all those fashion mags and the big \\"philanthropic\\" events of the New York aristocracy. Bottom line...if you're not the type to read this kind of book, you'll love it.

It's a heavy and boring read.Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on...","review":"Give me a break.

I rotate the various Ana Brett and Ravi Singh videos (AM & PM, Beginners, Dance the Chakras).I'm in pretty good shape but, every time I do this workout I'm sore for 3-4 days. There are a ton of hamstring stretches. They are spread out, so you may not feel the strain in the moment. I always feel great during and right after the workout. The next day -- OUCH!!So I warn you, be cautious with the forward bends and hamstring stretches. You may want to sit out the second part of the set that has repetitive seated bends."},{"rating":"1","title":"O_o","review":"I attempted multiple times to try and get through this video... The thing is, the lady is less like a mentor and guide, and more like a slap in the face.... Instead of allowing you time to try and mimic her movements, she bends herself in half at speeds that would put Usain Bolt to shame. She doesn't attempt to give pointers, it's just kind of, \\"All you have to do is this *ties herself in a pretzel* see, wasn't that easy.\\" This isn't for the beginner's to Yoga... or even the Intermediates.

Exercises are boring and each exercise takes forever to complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just stretching... couldn't take it seriously","review":"When I bought this dvd, I was hoping for a good stretching routine to practice along with my husband. I was not expecting it to be quite so new-agey. We quickly realized that the first part of it was not what we were looking for (chanting, etc.), so we skipped ahead to the first stretching chapter. As we tried to do the stretches, we kept being distracted by the silly things the narrator was saying (such as \\"remember to remember to breathe\\"), and finally we both collapsed in a fit of giggles and turned the thing off. I'm sure that this dvd could be entirely meaningful and helpful to some people... my husband and I are just not those people.So, maybe this video will be good for you if you're really into yoga and whatnot. But if you're just an average person or couple looking to get a good, basic stretch routine in, and you don't want all the fluffy feel-good stuff, I would say to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't consider chanting ultimate stretch","review":"I was expecting an hour of stretching, but that's not what this video offers. It offers approximately half an hour of stretching, the other half consists of vocal cord stretching with chanting and singing. The stretches, the little that there is of them, are good and work the body. The video is well done, the workout model is lovely, and the commentator's voice is soothing and calm. The poses are easy, although challenging because one has to hold them for extended periods of time. I was disappointed that this wasn't a traditional yogaish type of exercise. The singing and chanting mumbo jumbo was a little far fetched for me-but others may enjoy it. I prefer the Shiva Ria and Deb Dobbin videos, which offer a more comprehensive practice. I would have been more comfortable with this video if it offered an hour of exercise like it states. The ~half an hour of exercise was not sufficient for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Mistake for Beginners","review":"This video was a huge mistake for me at the moment. I am 47 and trying to get back in shape and if you are not already flexible and doing yoga for the past 20 years then pass on this video. It starts out with her sitting in a completely impossible position for me to even attempt. Then the video wants you to start chanting in a foreign language which is not only culturally and \\"politically\\" incorrect I am sure that evangelist type Christians may find it absolutely OFFENSIVE in more ways than one (I'm Buddhist by the way so little offends me personally). It just got worse from there until I turned it off. I am going to shelve it just in case 5 or 6 years from now I am fit enough to give it another try. I found Tammilee Webb to be much better for my level and she's more like doing it with a friend than a mystic. I finished Tamilee's entire video and look forward to doing it regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, bordering on creepy...","review":"Very strange. The instructor performs the routines on a raised white platform in a small room surrounded in cloud backdrops. Her strange facial expressions trumped in weirdness only by the chanting that starts via a male voiceover.

I question whether these are actual techniques. They're weird, they hurt, they are not relaxing. At one point you are asked to hold a squat for over five minutes and breathe rapidly in order to, \\"massage yourself from the inside out.\\" It was so bizarre my friends and I watched it with popcorn for the entertainment value.2)This video is also practically porn. I'm almost positive Ana Brett is doing sexual favors for Ravi Singh who then allows her to be a \\"yoga star\\" or some sort of absurd relationship like that. She also does these exercises in her underwear on a cloud in the video. It adds to what is already a bizarre tape.Do not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Ana & Ravi!!","review":"I am a certified Pilates instructor, practicing yoga enthusiast, and former dancer...I recently purchased a few of Ana & Ravi's dvds from Amazon.com out of pure curiosity and the desire to learn something new.

Not only did I feel connected POWERFULLY to my core by the end of the first session but I also felt a tremendous release in my entire body followed by this amazing energy that actually lasted for quite a few days!I have now made this dvd a 3x weekly addition to my fitness rotation and I do not know what I would do without it!I am amazed how quickly this has brought changes to my body!I was actually resistant to yoga since I had been bored with all my yoga experiences so far but Ana & Ravis type of yoga is so much fun!!!!!!.

I guess that's some kind of mystical thing but I since I couldn't do it, I just sat down on the couch and laughed at it. I sat on the couch for most of it.If I were twenty, had her figure and her degree of flexibility, I would probably rate this production 4 or 5 stars; it is that good.However, if you have trouble tying your shoes, this DVD ain't for you! My recommendation for us older folks is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People with Maggie Rhoades. It's a whole lot easier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 stars!","review":"This is my favorite yoga DVD. I don't know how they could have made one more perfect. I have been doing pilates since its conception and thought yoga was just a watered down version of pilates until I discovered Ana & Ravi. This whole approach was a revelation to me with all the dynamic moving and breathing in sync.I also thought I had reached the limits of my flexibility but the focus on releasing the solar plexus, spine and core using movment & breath to give the body an authentic release was a real eye opener for me.I plan to try their Navel Power next and hope it is more of the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Workout","review":"This DVD is a sensational product.The workout is so simple, easy, and gives great results.I love turning it on first thing in the morning, evenbefore I drink my green tea, and get my blook pumpingand muscles moving.

I am from India and have grown up seeing my family members practice yoga. I have never formally learnt yoga myself and though I have been exercising for a few years now, my flexibility is not good. I bought this DVD to improve on my flexibility.I was a bit surprised to see that there are no standard asanas - not even the surya namaskar. Ravi Singh and Ana Brett have really created their custom routine. The good thing is that it does challenge you. The production quality is very good - Ravi's voice is calm but firm and is cueing is excellent. This is very important as in yoga your eyes are closed during several sessions. Ana's on screen presence is inspiring. I will buy a more traditional DVD but I would definitely recommend this for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I've seen","review":"I ordered this based on all the five star review's. I am a very picky customer when it comes to yoga/ workout DVD's. This one actually lives up to its reviews. After \\"tuning in\\" which is a mantra kundlini style \\"ong namo guru dav namo\\" instead of the usual yoga \\"om\\". We go into a series of warmups and flexes and the body gets warmed up, worked, and stretched from the ground up.I like the guys voice and the girl is fun to watch. The stretches are good and not like the ones you find everywhere else.This was a real yoga experience - just what I was looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally A Fun Stretching Yoga Workout!","review":"I usually skip stretching because it bores me to death. I recently bought some of the Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's because I'm turning 50 this year and I want to get in the best shape of my life. I decided stretching should be part of my routine as well. The rest of their DVD's I've tried were so much fun, I hoped that they had made stretching fun and I was right. These are not your same old workout/yoga stretches. There are stretches I've never seen done before and they actually work! I like that it's also a workout so I can do it and not feel I have to add to it to get some muscle burn (thighs etc.). I swear my legs and waist look longer after this one and I feel like I'm walking more lightly on this earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little difficult to do the specific breathing exercises but great dvd","review":"The breath of fire is hard if you have never done it as you have to breath from your stomach or belly button and fast. The dvd has some advanced yoga moves an is weird at the beginning with the chants. The stretches are great, the breathing exercises really help circulate oxygen and blood, but warning: I thought that this was just a great stretch dvd.... I woke up the next day and could not walk. That is how much they stretch and work the muscles!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just My Speed, Great Fun Stretch","review":"Stretching has never been one of my strong points, or favorite things to do, but this great DVD made stretching very enjoyable for me. This warm-ups on this open up the midriff area and work on loosening up the spine. Then you do a great standing stretch sequence. My doctor had talked to me about increasing the oxygen saturation in my blood and he couldn't believe the improvment after I had been doing this workout. He assures me that because of this type of yoga breathing I will live longer and look younger(the fact that doctors are now talking like that means we've come a long way!). This DVD also has ab exercises and things which work the upper body. I can't quite get into Wheel Pose but they give a good modification. Overall, this is one of the best DVD's I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but...","review":"Speaking as an experienced Kundalini yoga student and classical Pilates instructor, this is a very good set of yoga exercises, staying true to the principles of Kundalini yoga. But for someone who is already very strong and very flexible I would prefer to remain in most of the stretches longer, the body does not get warmed up enough to stretch the hamstrings safely, and the chanting meditation at the end really should be twice as long. I would recommend this video for after a pilates work out when your body is already warm and pliable. Not for people that are stiff and brittle."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific for beginners or intermediates","review":"I am new to yoga and have purchased several yoga dvds..this one is definately the best. I purchased this particular dvd because I was looking for one that would really stretch my overly tight hamstrings. This dvd does that and more. It was very easy to follow and flows easily from one move to the next, in fact, as I did the workout for the first time, it felt too easy...was I mistaken!! I was sore for 5 days after my first workout which tells me this routine really worked my leg muscles. This is by far the best yoga dvd I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I have a problem with my knee occasionally so I cannot always run...This DVD is very effective and I don't have to put stress on my joints...The first time I did this dvd I couldn't do all the moves, but did the modified version (Because of my flexibility)now I am so much more flexible.

Anyway, this is a great movie for cheering yourself up when you are sick, or watching with your best friend. This is for all intents and purposes, a buddy movie for girls. Are any of the Lethal Weapons plausible? No, but that's what makes them fun. I thought I'd add my two cents since all the reviews I saw were from guys. My girlfriends and I laughed our asses off.

Well I can honestly say he loved it as much as I did (yes I spelt humour the English way before you ask).Being British myself I love our sense of humour and that we do not take ourselves too seriously and this is exactly what this film did. It is there for entertainment purposes only (not to give you a lesson on life which too many films do these days) and it was a truly funny film from start to finish.It doesn't go on forever either, meaning if like me, you like to watch more than one movie in a night you can.Watch it for yourself, I hope you will be pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for starters and experienced programmers!","review":"This is a great book on embedded C programming. Although it focuses on the Atmel AVR microcontrollers, it is a useful reference for anyone doing embedded development!

This one is great for first timers learning microcontrollers. I picked up the Dhananjay book, never having done any microcontroller stuff, and was jamming in a week!!!This C-programming book starts out a little slower, as it has to teach some C-fundamentals....nevertheless, both are excellent books for one of the best 8-bit microcontrollers out there....a great starting point for students and engineers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter-Cable wants return customers....","review":"The 7216 Omnijig comes with a template guide which unfortunately will require you to find, or make, a new sub-base to accomodate it. I fabricated one but the time consumption seemed unnecessary.The only other weakness witnessed in the unit was the scarring on the template where the guide rides it. It is about $80 to replace and seems to new to show such wear.The tool does as advertised and performs flawlessly once you have peformed all recommended settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend another 100.00 bucks and buy a Leigh!!!!","review":"I spent a lot of time and effort reserching dovetail jigs before I made my purchase 2 yrs ago. I decided on the Leigh D4R 24\\" dovetail jig, the best woodworking decision I have ever made. Unlike Porter Cable, the Leigh jig is made from a \\"extruded hunk of aluminum\\" and CNC'd to within 1/10,000 of an inch. The other nice thing about the jig is its ease of use compared to a lot of other jigs. Leigh just dropped their price on the DR4 to 399.00, and its worth every penny, go to their website before you drop 300.00 on a Porter Cable jig!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songwriting triumphs over production values","review":"It pains me to give any Ron Sexsmith album less than 5 stars because he's as fine a songwriter as there is. He has suffered the curse of being a \\"songwriter's songwriter\\"--Costello and McCartney among the longtime supporters--but he usually connects with listeners in such an intimate way that I found the intrusive production on many of this CD's tracks to interfere with my overall enjoyment of it. A few listens later I felt able to live with the sound effects and odd choices made by the producer, since some of the tracks were treated more mercifully. \\"God Loves Everyone\\", \\"Gold In Them Hills\\", and \\"Heart's Desire\\" really stood out for me. This is not an album I would play to introduce someone to Sexsmith's music, but it is to be admired for its ambitious change of direction, however misguided it might have been. Great songwriting triumphs in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull pictures, some out of focus","review":"While there are some good pictures in the book, many are dull (as if the film wasn't processed properly) and some are out of focus. Also, many pictures run across two pages, with the middle of the book obscuring the subject of the picture. For example, there is a picture of Bill Clinton hugging someone who had lost her firefighter husband. The center of the book runs straight through the back of the woman's head and part of Clinton's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a better photo history of 9-11- Aftermath by John Botte","review":"This book pales in comparison to John Botte's photo book- \\"Aftermath- Unseen 911 Photos By a New York City Cop.\\" I was John's NYPD boss that day and I can honestly say that he did a tremendous job capturing the overall experience from the perspective of someone who had a front-rwo seat to the event and the aftermath. John is a gifted photographer with an eye for poignant moments that stay with you long after you've seen the photos. The text that accompanies makes the book as solid a work as anyone could ever expect.I think that anyone who wants an outstanding photographic tribute to the heroism and selflessness that ruled that day, and the months that followed, should definitely buy John Botte's Aftermath. Everything else just doesn't encompass the entire experience like John's work does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad photography. Useless book.","review":"I don't know what to say -- the photos are just BAD. The development is fine, but the subjects of the pictures are just uninteresting and unremarkable.

The \\"hardcover\\" was cheesy -- like on kiddie books.The photos were ordinary, inferior to many I've seen of 9-11.

Give it a MISS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you","review":"What I wanted and what I recieved were two different things. This was an array of mainly individual survivors aroung the WTC sight. Thats fine. I however, was looking for more truth. I wanted something to memorialize being a NYer myself, knowing people that had to escape, I was looking for realism. I wanted to open the book to see two tall beaming towers in their prime pre 9/11. I wanted to close the book in tears to the true after math. No such luck. Indiviual photographers took an artistic array of pictures of individual people in their own greif. Harboring no morbidity, we can not sugar coat this horrowing tragedy. Thousands of lives were lost. When my childrens children read this book to see what we all went through, I want them to know people had to do horrendous things to try to fight for their lives.

All of them, it seems, look and feel the same to me. Here a sloppy idea is poorly executed. Good pics but bungled by a mishmash editorial efforts, below average presentation and printing. I can see that the publishers have certainly $dollar sign in their minds (i.e. inquiries for international licensing encouraged?!?) Opportunity for the quick buck for Magnum and Powerhouse. This is sad -- what is Monsieur Cartier-Bresson thinking now? Ashamed at his collegues?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DO NOT LIKE IT","review":"Not worth spending the money on. Low quality binding and printing. The photography is probably the worst ever produced by Magnum. Again everything gravitates around the phortographers.

This book completely misses the big picture.

I wonder how much 'a portion' of the proceeds is, how much is really being donated. Magnum is broke, it would be even more pathetic if they're taking advantage of people's charity. True documentation of this event is not over so how can it be time for this book by so called photojournalists. Seems a little desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par effort","review":"I was very disappointed by this effort, esp. from Magnum, a name I associated with quality photography. Some pictures were \\"new\\" -i.e., not the usual crop of pictures we've seen. But even allowing for the fact that many photos were taken in the aftermath of the fallen towers, almost all the pictures looked \\"muddy,\\" grainy and/or dull. Few, if any, of the photos popped out at you with clarity. A real disappointment. Life's commemorative issues (paper and hardcover) did a much better job, though with more predictable photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"As a resident of Hillside NJ, the twin towers were always in my view whether i was coming home from work or school.

Waste of money, i recommend purchasing a different book. pictures are dark.

Whether I was coming home from work or school, i would always stare at the twin towers from a distance. This book does not help me with my memories at all. The pictures are very poor quality. The book and the pages feels and even looks cheap. The pictures are dark and out of focused. I've seen some of the clips on tv, and they were nice and bright, i look at the same picture in this book and it looks like it was in the evening time.

I cannot believe that in this time where both the TV community and Hollywood have both restrained themselves in a noteworthy fashion that the publishing industry would stoop to such a level. This is only one of the growing number of publications coming out to cash-in on the tragedy. If I only had enough time on my hands to review all of these \\"insta-books\\" on the September 11 attacks... Oh, and though it's a nice gesture to donate part of the proceeds to a related charity, it's still all too blatant exploitation. We aren't all suckers, though P.T.

Shameless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite right","review":"It seems like a good purchase when you first begin to flip throught the pages and pages of pictures. But when you come to the end, you realize there is something missing and even a sort of mis-representation. Our current president of the United States, George W. Bush, is not pictured. Neither is the Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani. Two men who have done so much for America especially since this event happened and they aren't even included in this book. There is something wrong with this picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"Way over priced. Not a very helpful resource.

This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful to My Clients","review":"Cohen-Posey has packed this book and disc with a great deal of useful information which, although very helpful to a professional, is not at all helpful to my clients. I deal with college students who are reluctant to do yet more \\"homework\\". The handouts presented here are so full of information that one senses they might need a several hours just to comprehend the directions for the assignment. Additionally, the layout of the exercises is awful -- not enough white space and attractive lettering to invite someone to dig into the assignment.

If you want to have any fun with this game play it with NO computer players.

I successfully programmed the RMV401 to recognize a GE TV, a JVC VCR, a Pioneer DVD, a Sony Sat., and a Sony CD. I was getting excited. Then I tried to get it to recognize a Sony Receiver (STR-DE685). It wouldn't. Went through all troubleshooting. Called Sony help line. They walked me through all troubleshooting, then finally said: \\"We don't guarantee compatibility with all components.\\" Ok, I can understand not being compatible with a component made in Finland, but a SONY! Unforgiveable. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. So I have to return both of them (long drive back into the city), and continue searching. It's too bad, because this is an ergonomic and well-designed remote, except for this problem. The problem with all Remote makers is they don't specify which components are compatible. They should do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of universal","review":"It seemed to work well at first. I had some problems getting it to set, because it requires more force than you'd expect to trigger the set command. Successfully got it to work for a Zenith TV, Panasonic VCR and RCA VCR. It also worked on a Sony STD-D550Z receiver, although not all the commands would work. It would run the basic commands for a Sony 5 disc DVD player, but couldn't switch discs (very annoying). I'd still have to pull the DVD remote out of the drawer if I planned to cycle through CDs or wanted to view more than one DVD. I could not get it to work on the Sony STR-DE985 receiver I just bought. Like the other review I read, I'm pretty amazed it doesn't work on Sony devices. The inability to learn commands makes this remote pretty much useless, even if you have Sony devices.

They are rich in detail, and are very engaging for young exploring minds. This one (MSB Kicks Up a Storm) pales by comparison. Not nearly as much detail. Lacks the quality of illustrations and side-commentary that make the earlier ones so special. This is a run-of-the-mill kids book with nothing much to distinguish it. I have read elsewhere that this series took a downturn when it became a TV show. It certainly reads like a comic-book version of a TV show.

Is it moving air or the heat from the sun that creates weather?Well, of course, there's nothing to be done about it but to get out there, take chances, get messy and make mistakes!The children learn all about weather but not before they are turned into water droplets, ride on falling ice crystals and get whooshed about in a thermal updraft. Shicka-Shicka Kaboom! Ralphie gets carried away as your children will be.Four Stars. These books are very educational, but they are not the easiest read-alouds.

Money and a Cough","review":"Jane Haddam does her usual brilliant job weaving the personal story of Bennis and Gregor (amazingly, finally together), crime and puzzle, with her real life sharply observant eye on human acts, human motives. Like a Japanese brush painter, she captures an essence in a few strokes. Litchfield county debs and country club denizens and old money and old money wannabe's and a Litchfield county women who doesn't have any money to be sick. Murders happen that couldn't and in the midst of it, Bennis gets sick.... Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compassion and Crime","review":"As usual, Jane Haddam delivers a very solid, enjoyable mystery with lively action and intellectual challenge. The plot is believable, extremely interesting, and impossible to predict. But she has added a very moving and believable component in Bennis Hannaford's illness and Gregor Demarkian's horror that a second beloved companion might die. By now Haddam's readers are involved in the lives of these characters. One complaint: After such a long wait, I'm greedy for the NEXT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeleton Key","review":"This is the best Gregor Demarkian in awhile. The book seems more energetic and the plot twists and turns just enough to be intriguing without getting silly. If you're a lover of Haddam's books, you'll really like this one and if you're new to these mysteries, this isn't a bad place to begin to become acquainted. Bennis and Gregor and Tibor and all of the neighborhood are priceless and leave the reader wanting more. Although all of the Demarkian mysteries are fun, this is the best in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I don't know how anyone can say this book is bad.

Hopefully, she'll be happy with a newer, and might I even add, beautifuller version. Comes with tons of accessories, such as popcorn, stuffed frog, suitcase, and even a miniature, fluffy telephone! I think my sister will play the head right off of this one, too!And trust me, these dolls are quite durable, the head fell off after about a year and a half of playing, but that's quite a bit. My sister was a little rough with this doll, tugging out her hair while she tied it in braids, putting my makeup on her Bratz, carrying around by her head, etc. Excellent quality, and my sister stuffed the head back in, (it looks quite odd) but she still plays, and loves her Jade Bratz to death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bratz Slumber Party: Yasmin","review":"My child loves this toy BUT a littel plastic thing with assesarys is way to expenciv.

When my daugher opened the doll, their was another pair of pajamas for Yasmin to change into, a tank top and panties/boxer shorts. The boxer shorts/panties had a large \\"V\\" cut out of the front of them with lace trim on the bottom. Something like you would see at Victoria's Secret!

But I don't want people to waste their time and money, so I'll give my honest opinion.On the positive side, Titmuss has obviously gone very deeply into Buddhist practice and has earned a high degree of spiritual accomplishment. Moreover, the basic concept of the book is good - very short essays about varied topics which express Buddhist ideas in an accessible and practical form.Unfortunately, I found Titmuss' ideas to be very pedestrian. Few of his observations are very profound or thought provoking. There are so many wonderful books about Buddhism nowadays that there's no reason to waste time on this one.

I've listened to it three times and like it better each time. The \\"concept album\\" idea is interesting and makes the songs blend, especially if you listen to the \\"story\\" track, but the songs can definitely stand on their own.

The story is told of good vs evil. All the songs rock and show why DIO is god! Great guitar playing by Craig Goldy, and a pounding rhythm section of Jimmy Bain and Simon Wright...plus atmospheric keyboards by Scott Warren return DIO to its classic roots.

I liked his stuff more than any singer they had. But those days are long gone. Although it would be hard to do much better than Holy Diver or The Last In Line, this just doesn't come close. He can still sing, but the music just isn't there. Craig Goldy is no Vivian Campbell, heck, he's not even Glen Campbell. The tracks are often slow and boring. The best song is probably Fever Dreams, but it can't carry the cd alone. Don't get me wrong, the cd's not totally boring, you can always listen to one of the two reprises or be read to for 18+ minutes on \\"Magica Story\\". Sorry, not much magic here, just a disappearing act."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIO is back - feeding from the mainstream","review":"Dio is back.. but is this good? Yeah, musically it is. The band is tight, strong and straight to the point. But what about the lyrics ? Dio's lyrics were also horrible, no meaning at all. Now, he take a ride in the fashion stablished by European bands who talks about RPG characters and fables, like Blind Guardian, Hammerfall and Rhapsody. The result: the lyrics are still bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"You think he would learn...","review":"I heard great things about this CD, and had high expectations. Then I bought it. I took it back the next day. I gave it two stars just out of affection for Dio, but if I never have to listen to it again, I'll be happy. The first impression from the cover art is a bad sign, then the music really goes nowhere, and the lyrics are disappointing. Few bands can pull off the fantasy themes and sound mature. Dio needs to mature his music because those of us who remember him fondly are all grown up now. What really turned me off about this album was the sophomoric fantasy story at the end... written and read by Dio. If you can't make the story clear with the music, put it in the liner notes. I want to listen to music, not bad bedtime stories for 12 year-old boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring for the third straight album","review":"I was really looking forward to Dio returning to his sound of the 80's and a concept album on top of that meant I had to give it a listen. What a major letdown. It is better than Angry Machines but every album ever made was better than that dribble. The musicians are horrible and the music is slow and plodding. RJD needs to get out of his rocking chair and pick up the beat. I definitely don't see the comparisons to Holy Diver like others have said IMO. That album had real musicians and pace and was a true classic. This can only be compared to his work in the 90's which is slow and boring. Stay away from this one and hopefully Ronnie will finally get it back together on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magica","review":"This album is not the best representation of Dio. I cannot recommend this album to anyone. I am a very big Dio fan. I like Rainbow and Black Sabbath with Dio, but this album is pretty bad. It is a concept album with a lot of orchestra, and sound clips of stuff at the beginning of most songs. The only reflection of a Dio song is Feed my head, and that's not even that good. The album is low energy and not to good. IT's definite;y not something I would blast in my truck. The main reason I gave this album 2 stars is because Dio Rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESERVES MINUS 5 STARS!

It's Eminem's band just like the song title, no one cares about the rest. It was just a excuse by Eminem to appear on tv even more. I normally like Eminem, he's a intellegent and sometimes even funny guy, but this is as unoriginal and outwatered it could be, hence i would know it was a Eminem sound even if the song was instrumental.

The comic book portrays genuine love, angst, frustration, discovery, and hope in a way that might be the closest to a movie without actually being a movie. In a movie you can't usually pause anyway and enjoy the detailed drawings like you can do with this book. It is beautifully drawn and the story captivates you from beginning to end.

As a result, it's even harder to get the rest of the wax off.I prefer more flexible (elastic) wax which doesn't break when you pull it off. I will not buy this wax anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Facial use, make sure not hot.","review":"This is not as effective as hot wax but i like that it doesn't stick to the skin and hence very effective and gentle for the face. Using this for Brazilian or bikini area is very very painful. I do not recommend it for that area. Hot wax is must faster and less pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff","review":"It took a few tries to get the consistency right and to know when to pull but after that it's been great. Make sure to exfoliate first then apply lightly pre wax oil or a little olive oil to the area you are waxing so the wax doesn't stick to your skin, only the hair. Then apply the wax directly on the skin in the same direction of the hair growth, wait about 30 seconds or until slightly tacky, pulling the wax off in the opposite direction of the hair growth. If the wax dries too much it will break off in little pieces and be torture. It helps to end the wax strip applied to the skin where there is no hair so you aren't pulling your hair trying to get the end up to pull and to work in small sections. I use this product for my eyebrows,underarms and brazilian bikini wax and did about 8 treatments on myself. After waxing be sure to use aloe vera gel or other cooling gel to reduce redness.This is the second container I've ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have no clue how this got so many good reviews. I've waxed many times before and I thought I'd try the GiGi brand. It's HORRIBLE!!! The wax doesn't dry hard enough at all. It will not set! It's like i'm using hard wax mixed with sticky soft wax it's ridiculous. It didn't take the hair out at the follicle so I have stubs of hairs and bits of wax everywhere. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while to set up","review":"But while it sets up it takes me that long to get the courage up to pull the strips. The product description was not overly clear to me as to whether I needed strips with this item or not, but it turns out that I did not. However, having used it with strips in a few areas I can definitely say it makes life easier. You definitely have to be patient though."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah sure","review":"Took me some time to perfect the technique. Like the other reviewers say, if you don't wait for the right consistency it will dry too hard and flake or will come off in a gooey mess, both situations equally messy and painful. Me personally, I have coarse hair: I use it for waxing everything and the bikini. Not brazillian; tried it once and it's too risky to try again down there <^_^>"},{"rating":"2","title":"decent quality. hard to warm up","review":"i guess there's a reason why they sell a warmer for additional cost...but this wax has a strong hold and gets the job done effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5 star product","review":"I gave two stars because it's painful on the bikini line (what I bought it for). I followed all the great reviews on here from everyday people but I found it painful & messy. It leaves pieces of wax in spots on the skin. I have to slather on lotion afterwards & then pick, pick, pick, until it all comes off. I thought it would be cleaner & easier than that but it's not. If you're not a professional, you may have ISSUES like I do. But I still use it when I need to & it does seem the hair grows back slower. It does NOT prevent ingrowns though. 1st time I used it, I got a horrible one that's still a dark brown scar, over a month later. I'm a fair-skinned Caucasian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice & Less Messy","review":"This keeps the mess in the container. I like that, but think it should come with instructions for beginners like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same as another product I was trying to to replace","review":"It's the same thing that Sally's carries, but with a different label.

It doesn't seem to work well either way, although I like this line."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST WAX I'VE EVER USED.","review":"I had to give at least one star rating, but honestly I'd say maybe it's worth 1/2 of a star. I have worked at 5 star spa/salons and know my stuff! I tested the wax first on my arm, following all directions. The wax doesn't get all that hard like other hard waxes, so it can be messier, and really a pain in the @**. Anyways, the next day after testing the wax on my arm, my arm was COVERED in loads of small red bumps, that looked like I had been attacked by 100 fire ants. Sufficed to say after that there's no way I want to give myself a brazilian with this CRAP. I wouldn't want my lady parts looking that way. Very SCARY! $15 down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful stuff","review":"All this wax did for me was to break off the hair to stubble. I might as well have shaved. Plus, it left bits all over my skin. As an added treat, even though I used a collar on my wax warmer I'm going to need a crowbar to remove the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"big NO-NO","review":"if this is brazilian wax, I am Giselle Bundchen. Just awful.I have been using wax for 20 years. I always bring my wax from abroad. I chose this wax just because it was hard and usually that's the best type of wax to use. However after the first try I just tossed the wax away. It is like trying to wax yourself with chewing gum. It is so sticky that you need rubbing alcohol to clean your hands. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"purses","review":"This was used to go inside handbags...it was a lot cheaper to buy it this way...the only struggle I had was cutting it..as I didn't have the proper tools :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAGIARISM!!!

In fact, I hope I never need to know any of this stuff. I'm betting it will come in handy and that I will regret not having fully assimilated its concepts. As I'm a geek and not exactly a people person, I would have considerable trouble finessing some of the social situations (i.e.: interaction with government employees) discussed in here.Looks good, however. The lack of the fifth star is a) because I can't judge the quality and b) I probably can't do some of what is suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"You and the Police","review":"Very informative. Every citizen should understand their rights under the Law. The police in this country think they can do any thing and seldom know what your rights are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedic","review":"Although the inspiration of this book is commendable, in practical situations I think it not always best. If you're drunk or high, don't bother going against a police officer's wishes. It will alwayds bite you in the rear. Aside from that, remember that when it really comes down to it, the way it works in most parts of this country is : it's your word against the cop's .. and the cop is ALWAYS right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sliightly (?) paranoid dillusional","review":"I believe based on my background that this book and what it recommends will only serve to place the individual in a no win situation overall. I am sorry I purchased it in all respects. If you have limited experience in the area this book is not for you!!! The author cops out so to speak with the admonition he is not a lawyer and that your actions are up to you so somewhat relieves himself of any responsibility for you going down in flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if your completly clueless","review":"This book really has no good information. The author considers themselves an expert on police because they are friends with cops and they even side with them in this book. A cop needs RAS, reasonable articulable suspicion to ticket/search you. Other than that keep your mouth shut take your ticket. This is the extent of the info in this book. Oh, besides building a strong box in your trunk. This book really stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's up ?","review":"this is a very fine product; and easy to connect. i am enjoying my tv more than ever. i would recommend this item to everyone who needs better reception and in some instances more channels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good antenna for High Definition broadcast, good price","review":"Bought this as a gift for a friend with a new 52\\" LED HD TV. Helped him install it and get the tv set up for station scanning. We both live in the same town and are almost exactly the same distance from the broadcast towers we receive 8 stations from. I was very impressed with the tv quality he was receiving compared to my older antenna on my LED HD TV. I'm putting one of these on my own shopping list before football season starts! :-)P.S. Before all our stations went totally digital and high def we had half of them still broadcasting analog signals over translators and even those channels were superior in quality compared to the performance of my own old antenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good antenna for HD TV","review":"The antenna was very easy to set up, and it has improved my TV reception to the point where I do not need cable anymore. We get every channel available in the area, and this is even with the antenna mounted in my attic! Good value for the money. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Although I replaced an antennae on my roof (so I was up on a ladder) installing this product was simple. I recommend assembling as much as possible on the ground and then take the antennae on the roof, bringing tools afterwards. Older antennaes are difficult to remove if they've been up for a while.I installed the new antennae because I also installed an HD converter box for an older TV and the HD signals were dropping or pixelating. This antennae solved the problem immediately, bringing in all available broadcast channels. I occasionally have an issue but usually it is minor. The signals are now stronger and I'm sure this new antennae solved the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inexpensive antenna","review":"I used this to replace a VU-120 that was broken in a storm. This one went in its place very easily and gives similar gain in a slightly smaller design. I can't really complain about it except it always has a bit of wiggle room in the mounting brackets. I really wish I could get it to mount as firmly as my old antenna.Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent Video! Wow! I thought I knew about Miyamoto Musashi and his techniques/philosophy, but this video has really helped me to understand and see the book in a more visual aspect.

It started off boring and ended with a dissappointing conclusion. Even though I love Jacen and Jaina, this book really never made me care for either one of them. They seemed stuck up, snooty, and were constantly whining. A friend that they meet, Lusa, is essentially a glorified centaur. This really bothered me, because in Star Wars you would think that an author could manage to think of some half way original creature. Everyone acter uncharacteristically, particularly Luke, who seemed depressed and self centered. Han and Luke's purpose in the story was pretty forgetable, and the bits with Chewie in them were truly abysmal. If I didn't reserve the one star rating for books like the Black Fleet Crisis, or I, Jedi, then I would have rated this book that way. Buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina instead. You will thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most confusing Star Wars book I have EVER read!","review":"This book stunk, I mean really, and love Star Wars Books! I was so confused I ended up spending 30 minutes trying to understand each chapter. Luke doesn't have a part at all, like he usually does, and neither does Han! I mean, COME ON! It would save some ink just to cut them out. The plot was kind of good but the way she wrote it stunk! She spent half of the book describing how Chewie and Princess Leia look! This book doesn't even deserve a 1/2 star. Lousy waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the level of other books in the Star Wars line","review":"The plot itself was pretty weak, and the characters were not portrayed well. Many of the story concepts were entirely to far-fetched and many things were left unexplained (or inadequately explained, i.e. Luke's temper). The introduction of more \\"lost Jedi\\" was ridiculous and undermined the storyline set up by previous books in the Star Wars line. McIntyre fell short of Zahn's mastery of Lucas' universe, and this addition to the Star Wars timeline tarnished what other writers had done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrible!","review":"This is without a doubt the WORST Star Wars book I have ever read. And believe me I've read 'em all. It is totally bogus! Ms. McIntyre is giving the Star Wars name a bad rap with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, this book is so bad, its fun to review it!","review":"This book is absoutly horrible. Not only does Han cheat on his wife, Leia, in the book, they have to have some person who had a scientific body builder make him, hero of Star Wars, seem like a puppet. On top of that, it continually made Anakin seem superior to Jacen and Jaina, two of my favorite charectars, and had a dark jedi that was wasted, without a single lightsaber duel. That's the point of those charectars! Not to be eaten by some stupid creature the author took the liberty to make up! Don't read this book, because it'll just give Star Wars a bad name! McIntyre should have stuck with Star Trek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better, could have been worse!","review":"I loved this book! It had a great beginning and a great ending, but the middle was a little weak. It was a great way to meet the children of Han Solo and Leia. I borrowed it from the local library, but am looking into buying it for myself. If I don't like a book and can't get into it, I put it down and don't touch it again. This book had my mother angry at me because I wouldn't put it down. Read it, it's good but it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never read something worse about SW","review":"I just need few space to say that this one is the WORST book I've ever read about Star Wars ever.

You could plug any Sci-Fi character into this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Star Wars novel I've read yet (and I've read alot)","review":"I'd have to agree with every other reviewer in saying that this is just a downright horrible book. The Crystal Star takes place when Han and Leia's kids are about 4 or 5. They get kidnapped (predictable) by 'The Second Imperium' (predictable) and are forced, along with other kids, to train to serve the Empire (predictable). Oh, and it's controlled by a guy who force-chokes people and laughs (predictable). To add to the atrocious plot, it was written badly, or not very descriptive on characters or events. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"The characters in this book are all cartoons of the people from the movies. All development prior to this novel has been ignored. All character development has been ignored. All common sense has been ignored with the weird Force blotting stuff. This is a bad book, one of the worst I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars in name only.","review":"Sadly, this is book presents the characters in such a way that it's almost impossible to associate them with the characters from the movies. Trying not to spoil it, but I continually shook my head at the behavior of the 3 major characters because I could not rectify their actions - and especially their thoughts - with the way these characters would actually act in these situations. Usually I am more than willing to read these books over and again, but with this title, sadly, once is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a not-too-good Star Trek book. out of 4 stars.","review":"The only elements The Crystal Star incorporates from the official Star Wars saga are two words (Force and Empire), two alien species, and six character names. All could easily be integrated into the ST galaxy - or at least a lot easier than in the SW one. It doesn't even reach the quality of an episode of Star Trek (not even something like \\"Shades of Gray\\" or \\"Man Hunt\\").Some people have cited details about the plot and writing style, but I think the less you know, the better. I advise you to not buy it or read it. Die-hard SW fans should still shun it - in fact, they should buy their library's copy and flush its ashes down their toilet. I don't have a clue how it got into Official Continuation in the first place.PS: Yes, I'm saying that ST books are generally crappy. There may be a few good ones, though - I know next to nothing about Trek. But this is one of the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good, but only 1of the 2 lot lines were interesting","review":"This book was pretty good. However, only one of the two plot lines were interesting. the Luke/Han/Waru thing just stunk. I only read it so i could get on to the part where Leia is looking for her kids and (my fav part!)the part where Jaina, Jacen and Anakin were when they were kidnapped. This part was told through the eyes of little five-year-old Jaina, who is my favorite of Leia and Han's kids. Jaina just sounded so cute and innocent and she was trying to be so brave and she was so sweet that i just wanted to hug her. Those kids were really smart and i liked Lusa. Also,i was hooked by the first sentence(it started with Leia, my all-time favorite SW character). I dont know why everyone hated this book. I mean, i too hated the second storyline, where EVERYONE was out of character and the plot just didnt make sense...but it was THAT bad. I liked this book. A lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not good","review":"I bought the book in hardcover, and it was a waste of money.

Thank God Waldenbooks accepts return.DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank the maker! no more superweapons!","review":"I liked this book. I think it's great to have a Star Wars book without another Death Star or Sun Crusher or a ton of Star Destroyers. I liked how there was action from page one. I also liked the idea about them getting new identities, but they have to work a little better on it. Luke made me mad during the book. I didn't think he would be that weak after being a Jedi for so long. Han was a different kind of heroic than I was used to him being. I enjoyed Tigris's relationship with Hethrir (which was brainwash) and Anakin's relationship with Tigris(which was braking the brainwash). Jacen and Jaina were okay, but it bugged me that Jaina was so concerned about breaking her parent's rules. I liked how they escaped and they're bluntness. I would recommend this book, it's a pageturner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah! Don't waste your time on this one!!","review":"The Crystal Star had one of the slowest plots I ever read. The story also has some really bad characters (Waru) and a creepy plotline that is just plain annoying. The only reason why i kept this book is that I'm trying to collect all the Star Wars books.

What's so special about Anakin that he gets all this time in the spotlight? Why weren't Jacen and Jaina treated the same way he was? The whole thing is stupid.

Leia's character was well done, and I kinda liked the scenes with Jacen and Jaina, their characters were pretty good throughout most of the book. But Luke was just a whiny brat and jerk, how many times did he bite off Han's head in this book? When was the last time you remember him being even close to doing that? I thought Jedi Masters were supposed to have better control over their negative feelings. The whining was more than usual, and that's pretty bad. The Hethrir and Waru characters were REALLY stupid, I won't even get into them! The storyline stank too. This book was almost as bad as Planet of Twilight and Darksaber.....

And for some reason, I just could not picture Waru in my mind. I couldn't visualize what he looked like! And that Leia/Lelia stuff...did that get annoying quick!

The plot was lousy and did not fit Star Wars at all.She did a bad job of telling the story. she was repetitive and made Leia act like an overprotectivemother, Han- an abosolute idiot, and Luke- a wimpy, ridiculous off to the side, not very important character. Jaina amd Jaina were portrayed horribly. They were little geniuses that could find a way out of everything and that can figure everything out.The author should have spent more time thinking about how a star wars book whould really be.

The pace was unbearably slow at times, and the latest \\"Luke must be a non-factor\\" device seems overly contrived. Characterization doesn't seem to follow the obvious development path from the movies through the other novels.

This book is not, definately not, a good Star Wars book. I wish that I had more nice things to say about it. Vonda whats-her-face gave it a good shot. Unfortunately, maybe she should have tried watching the movie before she started writing. The characters we all know and love are flat. I mean zip. Luke, Mr. Jedi Master, they guy who resisted the Emperor and Vader is a whining crybaby who gets under the influence of some blob. Come on! Leia is flat. The Chief of State is not going to run of like that. Yo, she has a government to run. Were is See- Threepio? Our prissy chatter box spoke, maybe five words in the whole book. Han has a strong will, and would not practicly cheat on Leia. Since when does he let an inkeeper push him around? Hethir or how ever you spell it? Get lost! Waru? Bring me a basin! I'm going to be sick! Overall, stick to Star Trek, Ms. McIntyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The darn thing owes ME a few stars.","review":"How many beers did Lucas have before approving THIS one? This is one of the most hyped books in Star Wars Official Continuation, but I advise you to stay away from it. I revised my concept of purgatory after finishing this book; major sinners will probably be forced to re-read it multiple times.This is one of the main reasons I gave up Star Wars in favor of Invasion America. Of course, another main reason is that Invasion America kicks bass. I hope VNM never discovers it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God, what is this THING?","review":"This mockery of the Star Wars universe has to be the biggest waste of money I have ever been sucked into. (Next to the Jedi Academy Trilogy, that is.) These characters are NOT the characters we know and love from Star Wars. And Han and Leia's children... ordinarily, I would have loved a book that lets us get to know Jacen, Jaina and Anakin better. But THIS is ridiculous. The kids were much more interesting in the Corellian Trilogy.The only way I can appreciate this book is if I pretend it was all some big hallucination that Luke had after a visit to Yoda's dark side cave. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stellar example of Star Wars fiction (pun intended)","review":"I have to agree with all the other reviews on this one. There are just too many examples of familiar characters being very OUT of character for this book to have continuity for me. For example, Luke is supposed to be strong and unflappable at this point in his development, but he keeps acting like a frustrated kid again. Solo has a couple of lines that sounded like they should have come from Obi Wan or something. A species of ethereal alien creatively called a Ghostling (roll eyes) offers to show Han \\"the route to happiness\\" and Han replies \\"To your death!\\" because Ghostlings cannot survive a physical relationship with a human and he misunderstood her intentions. I'm sorry, but such a melodramatic response should not come from the cooler than ice Solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute WORST Star Wars book I've ever read","review":"If I could, I would give this book zero stars. Absolutely the worst drivel I've ever read. None of this book makes any sense. From characters who are out of character, a crappy plot, and half of everything in it not following the Star Wars universe, this book bombs. It was almost like this author just wanted to use the already made up characters in her own little universe, like fanfiction that she got lucky enough to get published. And let me say... I've read better written fanfiction.The biggest thing that irritated me -and actually caused me to put the book down after only getting a quarter of the way through it -was Leia's character. She is NOTHING like Leia. Reading this book is like reading about someone who happens to share a name with our favorite Princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the cover is nice...","review":"Leia and Chewbacca's part of the story was okay, and there was no reason for Luke, R2D2, or even Han to be in this story. There was no reason for a Crystal Star to exist. It was not a Star Wars universe book -- more like Star Trek, with dimension jumping, destroying or healing by a blob worshipped by mindless and hopeful masses, transmogrifications, etc. As much as I admired Carrie Fisher's hair in the movies, I was tired of descriptions of Leia's hair when it was let down, all throughout the book. At once point, I was convinced she was disguised as Cousin It of the Addams Family! I think Han also sleeps with an old flame, but this book was so dull, I think I fell asleep then, and had to be told about that scene by someone else. The part about Hethrir and his wife, their training by Vader and Hethrir's subsequent evils were interesting. But that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"McIntyre should never write another SW book","review":"To put it simply, this woman should never be allowed to write another Star Wars novel. First of all, what was Hethrir going to do with a whole load of kids? Did it ever occur to him to contact Admiral Pellaeon, so the full might of the Imperial armed forces could be brought into the fold? Seems this common sense idea never occured to McIntyre for her to incorporate into her story. Of course, Pellaeon would have quickly asserted the military's dominance over Hethrir's sceme and if the former Procurator of Justice didn't like that, the admiral would have ysalamiri once again placed on the Chimaera, and then Hethrir could have been either made to see reason or he could have been killed.I wish Leia and Han had never had kids, or if they did, that the commando team lead by Major Himron could have killed both of them. We would have been spared much childish nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Very slow and very dull. I am telling the truth when I say this book made me fall asleep flat on my face. If I had to describe it in one word: stupid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who'd want to read it?","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book when I was thirteen. I'm seventeen now, and I haven't picked it up since I first finished reading it (hell, I needed a shovel to plough through it!) It's a waste of otherwise useful paper. The characters have no depth. That might be okay for Star Trek, but this is a whole 'nother galaxy, so to speak. The situations were unrealistic. Leia's kids are kidnapped to be fed to some otherdimensional freak, which just happens to be at the same place that Han and Luke are at, to give a psychopath more power? Puhleeeze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bantha fodder","review":"this one was a lemon and unfortunately i as the reader could not even make lemonade out if this storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful.","review":"I had high expectations going into the reading of this novel.I was truly let down. It was painful getting through the whole novel.Who are these characters?? Certainly not the Luke, Han and Leia we know from the movie and other Star Wars novels. Luke is just pathetic and paranoid. Vonda N.McIntyre unfortunately has no feel,knowledge or understanding of the Star Wars universe. Please save yourself the time and money and do NOT read this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom of the barrel ...","review":"Fellow fans, I've read all but one of the Star Wars novels released to date and this has got to be the absolute worst. Vonda McIntyre is another mid-pack Star Trek author who can't begin to capture the 'feel' of Star Wars and has no business writing a book set in this universe. Her plot doesn't come close to fitting in with this series and the characters (the few she bothers to include) are barely recognizable as portrayed.Consider yourself warned. I can honestly say this book has no redeeming qualities. Not a single one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is horrid. I'd have given it a 0 but there wasn't any on the scale. I felt like tearing the book up when I was done, except it was a library one. Luke did not act like Luke. He was stupid & whiney & got taken in by that Waru blob. I mean, HE IS A JEDI KNIGHT!! Does the author not know what that means? & it felt like Luke was falling to the Dark side . He walked around yelling at everyone. Does that seem like a Jedi to you?? Han was a stupid gambling idiot. I could go on forever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I've read every book so far to date. This novel is the WORST Star Wars book in existance. It has a very high unbelievability factor and it stretches the Star Wars universe beyond the realm of human comprehension. Two Thumbs Down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugg!!","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer, Craig Stanchfield. The Luke, Leia, Han, and the others were completely out of character. And Luke was an airhead. He's an encredibly powerful Jedi, remember?! His hopping into that thing, temporarily joining the dark side, and all that... I mean, come on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Very Interesting new characters.","review":"I found that this book kept me reading it. While I may agree with the others that perhaps the 'feel' of the characters could have been better, the story was excellent, and the new characters Rillao and Hethrir were great! I really enjoyed their characters and would recommend the book alone because of them. That intertwined with the overall good story give it my thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord, what a load of crap!","review":"Hey, look- KJA is no longer the worst Star Wars author on the planet: That honor (sic) now resides with Vonda! This was the first SW book I've felt ripped off buying in hardcover. Ugh, where to begin with this deep hurting. The characters were all wrong, the story didnt have that Star Wars feel (The ending- what the hell was that about?!? I *STILL* cant figure out what was happening), and the villan was boring. Avoid this book at all costs! This novel wasnt released- it escaped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring, and definitely different.","review":"This book is a different pace from most Star Wars books. It's not nearly as good as every other books, and there were definitely parts where I just wanted to put it down and start the Black Fleet Crisis. Are you going to take my advice? Probably not, but it's alright. In fact, I encourage you to read it if you truly do like Star Wars, just don't be expecting a great book to come out of it. This book moves as slow as a hutt on a hot day, and has some very lame characters such as Waru (By the way, what the hell is he?) It also makes Luke out to be a very weak and jerky character, and I didn't like that at all. All in all, a definate thumbs down with a couple of exceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. But I guess Star Wars novel hardcores gotta read it.","review":"If a 12 year-old like me thinks that's a little steep, I don't know who doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me want to vomit.","review":"This book was the absolutely worst thing I had ever read. First: the characters. Who are they? These people were not the same people that we have grown to know and love. Han is an drunkard, Luke is a whiny weakling who does not act like a Jedi, Leia seems very false, Chewie is a softie that had to limp around and act meek the whole book. (Strange, because I have read in countless other Star Wars novels that Wookiees have amazing regeneration speed)Leia's children were corny goody-goodies. I didn't want them to get rescued. The dialogue between the kids was positively ludicrous and absurd. At times they were so corny and sugary-sweet I wanted to rip the book to shreds. I hate this novel with passion. I hope Ms. McIntyre has learned a valuable lesson-that it is wise to watch the movies that your novel is based upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story is fine, but is it Star Wars?","review":"The Crystal Star by Vonda N. McIntyre was a fine tale of disguise and things not being quite what they appear. I'm glad it avoided the \\"Oh,no! Not ANOTHER Imperial superweapon!\\" syndrome these novel tend to get trapped in. I wanted to like this book, but I just can't.The charaterization is simply terrible. Luke doesn't act like Luke. Leia seems to be on the verge of multiple personality disorder.After finishing the book I had a picture in my mind of Ms. McIntyre getting a call from Lucasfilm: \\"Would you write a book for us?\\"\\"Sure, I'd love to, but I'm too busy... No, wait. I have a book done, but it's not Star Wars. I'll just change the names, add the Force, and no one will know the difference.\\"Of course, I have not idea if that conversation happened, but considering the end result, I can't help but wonder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these characters?","review":"I felt throughout this book that it never grasped the true nature of Luke, Lei and Han.

I was dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, boring, lame...","review":"I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one was so boring and predictable and lame... *YAWN*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a different SW title","review":"Man, I wish I would have looked at the reviews before I read this book. The other reviewers are spot on and your time could be better spent reading the X-Wing series or titles by Aaron Alston or Timothy Zahn.This story strays so far from the typical Star Wars books that it feels more like one of the Star TREK books that's wandered too close to the space-time continuum. It tries very hard to be original, but leaves out what makes the Star Wars universe a great place to spend an afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I liked this book because it was my first Star Wars novel and I was amazed at some characters.(I didn't know Leia and Han got married and had 3 kids.) The story was riveting and suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Star Wars books","review":"This book was a little too weird and didn't have the same \\"Star Wars\\" aura. I had a hard time believing that Leia would act the way she did, especially blaming and holding a grudge against Chewbacca. Furthermore, I never felt that Luke was real. He seemed a skeleton of himself. The only plus side of this book was a little glimpse into the development of Leia's kids and how they used their powers. But I think that the Corellian Trilogy does a much better job at that(the kids) too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for 3rd Graders?","review":"This is like one of those 20 page SW books enhanced to 400. Everything is just laid out nothing is left for you to discover. Aside from the reading level allthe action if that's what you want to call is at the end.Another thing Luke is a wimp just like in Barbera Hambly's book. Last time I checked Chewbacca had above normal healing abilities.This got two stars, because if your're really young this book will be good. Other than that Mcintyre just messed up the SW characters and universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUST.","review":"Those who liked this must either be lunatics or 8 year olds who never saw SW movies.

Vonda McIntyre showed that she had no knowledge whatsoever of the main characters, particularly Luke and Han. She portrayed them badly, giving aspects to their character that a good Star Wars fan would be repulsed by. Buying this book was a waste of my money and the only reason it got one star from me is because that is the lowest I could go."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens when you let a woman write science fiction","review":"Well, damn i read the reviews here and i didn't listen to them, i bought the book, read it and tossed it to my cat's litter box. It's depressing to have to destroy a book. Esp. when it was from Star Wars. Listen close folks don't read this stinker.

I had to return the first one because the spout was off by 45. This, obviously, resulted in the soap being dispensed off to the side rather than straight downwards. Its replacement is better but certainly not perfect - the spout is about 5 to 10 off center. I'll probably return this one too and search for a different brand. It's disappointing to see an item of a Kohler so poorly made. It appears to be a brand that I can no longer rely on for its quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and works perfectly","review":"I replaced a Grohe part with this.

This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Grohe","review":"Adding a soap dispenser to my second kitchen sink. Both sinks with Grohe Ladylux in Stainless steel. The original Grohe model has a poor bottle attachment design.

The other has been a problem from the beginning. It didn't sit right on the sink and so the pump didn't work well. When my husband went to take it apart and re-do it, the neck snapped off. A waste of money. Can't believe I had to order another one. I ordered a much less expensive one - since this one was made cheaply even though it was fairly expensive for a soap dispenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking, easy to install, works well","review":"We purchased this dispenser to match our KWC faucet during our recent kitchen remodel. We received the order promptly. This exceeded my expectations as far as the look and the ease of installation. So far (it's been about a month in use now) it works great.

That's even using an MLS team against stronger international competition.Whatever EA did to the game this time around it spoiled it. This game is slap in the face to soccer fans. So many elements that were right with FIFA 2002 are gone just for the sake of better graphics and animations.Headers are all but gone and impossible to execute. There isn't much variance on the passing game and your only chance to win a game is to brutally outscore your opponent because often times 2 or 3 goal leads won't hold up.I really don't get EA.

To some, this is a frustrating technique. I however, tip my hat to Zulawski for creating something so unique. This film was made in the early 80s when Berlin was divided with the wall. The symbolisim of Berlin at the time (good vs. evil, freedom vs. confinement, faith vs. athiesm) is a constant reminder throughout the film. Isabelle Adjani won both a César and the Cannes award for her role as a tormented woman. Both awards were well deserved, for this was probably the most difficult role she ever had to play. Her moments leading up to the creation of \\"the creature\\" are absolutely terrifying. Hopefully this is the original European release (127 minutes) and not the butchered atrocity released in the US back in the 80s (80-something minutes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"This book does not do justice to this series, which is saying quite a bit, given how quickly the show met its demise. First of all, there are many inconsistencies between the book and the series. Facts just don't match up. Second, there is pointless and frequent profanity. Come on, this was a TV show, not an R rated movie. Kids who could handle the series shouldn't go near this book. Third, the editing is lousy. At times, even names were spelled incorrectly.Overall, the story isn't bad. It's entertaining and a quick read. If it was just another book, the rating would be at least a three.

I'm really supposed to believe the OC was in the military, sorry, no way. I also don't buy that Logan knew another x5 before Max. There were other problems too. Maybe I'm getting a little nit-picky here, but OC was from Los Angeles in the series, not Texas. Finnally what was that ridiculous 10-page kiss-up job about what a great movie Titanic was.

Kino Video did a superb job in producing the DVD version (not perfect but way, way better than most transfers). The DVD is a must have for film buffs. This stunning film is about the family of Oskar in Danzig (Poland/Germany) during the time Nazism was creeping its way through Europe and is seen through the eyes of Oskar, a boy who refuses to grow at the age of 3 and does so by throwing himself off the stairs. Unlike Peter Pan, Oskar does this in protest of the inevitable Third Reich. Beautifully shot in the same location with a haunting musical score by Maurice Jarre and a brilliant performance by David Bennent as Oskar. The story is bizarre enough to keep you glued to your seat and at the same time mesmerizes image after image. A great extra is an audio commentary by Volker Schlondorff, the film's director. One of the best films of its decade rivalling Fellini's Amarcord and Szabo's Mephisto."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic-dubbed english version is one great film.","review":"The varied scenes have stayed with me over decades.

To the very graphic eels and horse head scene. There were so many excellent actors with great dialog, this should be re-released in the dubbed version so EVERYONE could view this film. I myself find subtitles very annoying. I miss too much of the photograpy and the actors movements..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-uh","review":"I honestly thought I'd like this movie, but it was disappointing. Not in the worst way a movie can be, which is to say boring, but in that its shock elements outweighed the theme and message and reduced it to, basically, soft-core child porn.

None of the characters in this movie are particularly admirable or likable, save Markus the toy merchant.Even the protagonist Oskar is a debauched character in his own right as evidenced by his frequent sexual trysts with his sixteen-year-old baby sitter. Not to mention having an adulterous affair with his best friend's wife.Some critics have said that \\"The Tin Drum\\" is a funny film. Having seen this film a few times, I can say there's nothing funny about it. If anything, it's sick and disturbing. This movie really deserves a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"I was made to watch this movie for school, and I was like \\"Oh, a foreign movie, I like those, they're usually different and refreshing, this could be good.\\" Was I ever wrong!! I can honestly say I have no idea what this movie was about. It seemed to be just scene after scene in which none of the scenes seemed to fit in with the others. World War II seemed to play a part in it, but I don't know why. Just a background for all the child sex scenes to take place in I guess. There was not one likable character, I cringed when each one walked on screen, especially that psychotic kid/adult. So basically, this movie had nothing worthwhile in it, not one good scene, not one thought-provoking plot idea, nothing.

Having seen several \\"art\\" movies over the years, I can honestly say this one is the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film with disclaimer","review":"This movie was great! It has tons of symbolism: Oskar not growing up reflects the stunted society of Germany after the First World War was until after the Second World War, when Oskar began to grow.

This movie cam dangerously close to proving me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"All I can say is that this movie was a complete turn around from Episode I. The computer graphics were beautifully done, the battle scenes were amazing and the plot twisted enough to keep me interested and flowed so that it all made sense.Lucas did a wonderful job of foreshadowing for the original three movies. This movie seemed to run parallel to the design of the original three.

The film itself is a great continuation of a mythic saga, and I enjoyed it immensely. I have heard time and again from other reviewers their distaste with the plot and the acting, and are wondering where the original saga went? Well folks, the original films had no real focused plot or acting at all either. These are meant to be viewed as silent movies, with the focus being on the STORY and NOT the acting. All 5 films are fantastic and I would give them as I have awarded this one, 5 STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than The First...","review":"Better than its predecessor, Anakin is finally played with passion and good 'acting'. Hayden Christiansen is one to watch as the young Darth Vader. The films picks up from Episode I (strangely, ha ha) where the Empire sees the Sith have become more powerful and the clone wars have begun. With the same computer generated style of Episode I, Clones has succeeded in making a very fine looking film. Ewan McGregor is worthy but dismissable as is Natalie Portman (unfortunately two of my favorite actors). Somehow their performances seem on auto pilot as most Star Wars actors have been accused of over the years. Good news, though, Jar Jar Binks has a limited role this time! Although every second he is on screen is still as painful as nails on a chalkboard. With good action sequences and an intriging development in the cause for Anakin's build up of hatred, Clones proves to be worthy of the Star Wars name. ****stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Force is not strong with this one...","review":"Tremendous disappointment. My expectations are INCREDIBLY low for Episode 3. Level of adventure in these new installments is null. George has gone mad with power.

I'm not talkin Henry Jaglom here (Plot matters too Henry) but Lucas spends way too much time trying to create a self-consciously mythic narrative (A mistake!

No, I was not expecting outstanding performances by them, but I've seen more believable acting by first graders in school plays compared to the leads of Episode 2. There was not 1 scene in the movie where I believed that Padme and Anakin were in love. They had absolutely no chemistry together. Natalie Portman was just flat and emotionless while Christenson was seemed like he was reading his lines off a teleprompter. A few of their scenes were actually laughable. The rest just put me to sleep. I'm not familiar with Christenson's work, but Natalie Portman has done great work in her short career. Let's hope this problem gets fixed in time for episode 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clone Wars have at long last begun..","review":"You can see it in Anakin's eyes... When he was talking about how he murdered the Tuskin Raiders... The lighting, the music, the darkside pouring from him, we knew right there that young Anakin Skywalker was starting to really feel the darkside. I enjoyed the movie, it's not my favorite Star Wars movie but I did enjoy it a-lot that's for sure. The best scene was probably the lightsaber fight with Count Dooku and Jedi Master Yoda. I mean Yoda has always seemed like he wasn't one for fighting; that he'd only do it if he REALLY had to, and MAN did he put on a show. All in all, it was great, and I can't wait to see Episode III now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie","review":"This isn't a movie, it's a 2-hour long toy commercial.

A friend of mine told me the film reel would be flawless because we went to a midnight showing and it was horrible. I thought it was going to melt on the reel. The crowd who attended this midnight showing pretty muched laughed out loud every single time anakin and padme did anything romantic....I felt embarassed for all the people involved with this movie. I was also told ...that we would see lots of Jedi die in this movie.....we see one, and we dont even know or care about the one who does die. this is by far the worst movie on the installment and thats saying a lot with Phantom menace out there to compare it too.

Both Episode I&II; have to be the biggest let down to anyone who is/was a fan of the originals and a let down to anyone that has taste in good cinema. It amazes me that Lucas made 3 of the best movies ever (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) with barely any money, but give him an unlimited budget and he makes the worst movies ever (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)...go figure!My advice...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the acting and story line..","review":"As a Star Wars admirer it seems that the acting and story line is becoming secondary to the special effects. The special effects are absolutely amazing and the quality of the DVD is incredible.However, without the story line to hold it together it seems more like a video game. I kept thinking these actors really have a challenge trying to have a dialogue with a blue screen and it's really starting to show in the films. The editing is very choppy and that might contribute the lack of flow...Oh well..at least I was there for the beginning..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the Clowns","review":"This movie was just plain bad. I thought that the acting was come of the worst acting I've seen in awhile.

I am a Star Wars fan. I was surprised that, in spite of all the gee-wiz eye candy and dramatic action, I was bored halfway through. The movie and it's characters fail to connect with the audience. AOTC is a souless, technical excercise. The dialogue is dreadful, the pacing is, well, odd. The acting is wodden and uninspired. What a pity; I'm afraid George has lost his touch. It was like an extended cut-scene from a video game, and it looked better (the trailer, I mean) as a Quicktime video on my computer at home. I wanted to like this movie. Out of 10, I'd give it a 4. What a dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action, Intriguing Story, I wish someone could act","review":"The movie is a step-up from the Phantom Menace. The action is excellent, the special effects sweet and the full story begins to come together. But could someone please help Mr. Lucas when directing actors. Annakin is stiff and distant. The dialogue is weak and almost forced at times in the movie. The CGI characters in the movie actualy had better lines and warmth than the humans.

You have to love the idea that in the future, combat will be dominated by humans who have reflexes quick enough to dodge laser beams! Great stuff ( not ). Lucas continues to milk his SW franchise, with ever worsening results. Portman is smashing to look at, as always. McGregor does a great job. The best parts of the movie are at the clone factory, the assembly line dodging, and finally, the Coliseum fight.Lucas should have stopped with SW1 in 1977----not one SW feature after that has been worth the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egads!

Like its predecessor THE PHANTOM MENACE, this contains enough exhausting visual effects to sink a boat, but they don't pack any of the punch they should. This, along with laughable politics, cardboard-thin characters, ridiculous sexual chemistry between the two leads and a monotonous battle at the end make this pitiful instalment easily the worst of the entire saga yet. EPISODE 1 actually looks good by comparison. One of the first films to be shot of HD Video, but who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke, a real shame...","review":"At this point George Lucas is revered as a God essentially. This is the major problem. Nobody can tell him \\"the truth\\". He made this film for himself, great, why make us suffer with it? I saw it opening nite in full Digital form at Universal Studios Hollywood. The audience was very, very excited. But tragically, we all laughed at the wrong moments, see what I mean? Sometimes a film is so bad that it's almost good in the campy funny sense (think Zoolander). Anyway... I speak as a MAJOR Star Wars fan, someone wake up Lucas (maybe pal Spielberg?) and let someone else direct episode III lest the whole thing be a major, major waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie [is bad]!","review":"This movie is so sappy I want to throw up.

If you do you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez.......George Lucas has lost his touch!","review":"I was raised on the the Original Star wars trilogy and have watched them over and over! But the new star wars prequels are pure junk, when compared to the original three. The original 3 are easy to digest and seem to whisk you away to this fantasy world and the story just flows freely throughout the movies. The new and improvedcg crapfest movies are force fed(go on eat up, it's star wars of course you'll love it) and trudge along with jagged edges. The new movies also lack patience in its story develop, almost as if Lucas is trying to cram in to much crap. Mark my words, the new star wars trilogy will never become classics. However, the original trilogy is classic cinema. at least will always have those to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange mix of stilted dialogue and incredible effects","review":"As a longtime scifi fan, I was both disappointed and impressed by Episode 2.The special effects were amazing. I saw this movie in a giantscreen digital theatre, and it did a wonderful job to showcase the computer-generated special effects. Looking at the city-scapes, vehicles, and aliens was worth the price of admission alone.The subdued presence of Jar Jar Binks was also a big relief. His appearances did nothing to detract from the story, and he seemed (dare I say it?) almost LIKEABLE.Storywise....it's not very impressive on its own. The new Anakin gave a sadly lackluster performance, and even Natalie Portman failed to shine as she did in Episode 1.This one's worth watching for the special effects and the end sequence. The fights and creatures make it worthwhile. If you can, try to catch it in digital format and dont expect too much from the story/script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"This movie is just plain unwatchable. It has nothing going for it. It's two hours of video game-like action sequences in cringe-worthy dialoge. The only thing that saves this movie is the Star Wars IP.Don't watch it. You're average fan film has better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was horribly disappointing, even after Ep. I","review":"I had expected George to get the momentum going with Ep II, since there was arguably a lot of setup in Ep I, but he just didn't deliver. I agree with everyone who says that Anakin was terribly acted and Natalie Portman seemed uninterested in the role. the dialogue was crap, as was the plot. The effects were the only thing done well in the film. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was because I paid full price to see it, otherwise I would have made it as far with this movie as I did with Battlefield: Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one (LORD OF THE RINGS)","review":"And this ain't it. Loved the first 3, hated the last 2 SW. Ultimately, the concentration here was on special effects, not acting. With the Matrix, Gladiator, and Lord of the Rings out there (All movies with GREAT acting, by the way, in addition to special effects) these latest SW don't really stand out in any way.What a monumental waste of acting talent (Mcgregor, Jackson, Lee). Sure, emphasize the two stiffs in love who couldn't act their way out of a shoebox. Blind us with special effects. Blah,blah.I felt absolutely no emotion towards any of these characters and will probably never watch this movie again. Maybe this series was part of American culture at one point, but not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful to watch","review":"Poor acting, poor story, and generally a boring story.

WHY?","review":"Since 1977 I had heard that George was going to make 9 SW movies. Then, after Jedi, he trimmed it down to 6. After the success of the first 3 SW movies he should've just walked away and been happy. (Can I get a witness?) George, you have oodles and oodles of cash! You never needed to do this to us! We were happy with the first 3! Well, I can take solace in the fact that I have said, since 1983, that he should NEVER make anymore SW movies. Why? Because you can't top the first 3 on ANY level. You can't top the actors, scripts, direction, villians, and the legend of the first 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've seen","review":"This movie was so stupid I've seen better when I went to see Cast Away.

So after Episode 2 I tried to do the same, and for a moment I couldn't remember what movie i've just seen. Its just other SF action movie; big explosions, bad acting, CG graphics... they all become one big blur in my mind and no name jumps out at me. oh well, no big loss.Its worth a rental if you want to test you newly bought home theater system."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Special Effects should be used to support an already good story/screenplay and Lucas doesn't have that to begin with. He is a horrible scriptwriter because he has no realistic sense of dialogue. In addition to this, he is not a great director. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were both far superior to the original and were not directed by Lucas. Because of his inability to direct, the romantic tension between Christiansen and Portman is essentially non-existent and the overall emotion in the film is about on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special. Good special effects don't make a good movie. Lucas tries to do too much himself and in the end the success of the movie is carried by the success of its predecessors and its good, but overused, special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have seen the error of my ways","review":"I was wrong about this movie. All the good reviews I wrote were written under a bad influence. I was the one who lost the truth. I hate this movie because it is bad.

George Lucas must be stopped!! Worst movie since Hope Floats!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Even though there are a cool couple of scenes in this movie, overall its terrible.

Some movies just need great action sequences and great visual effects. The Matrix gave us both of these, but Episode II neither. I was extremely excited when I heard about the special high definition cameras Lucas was going to use. But what is the use if the entire background is digital and looks phonier than a toupee. Billion dollar cameras to film pure (beep)! But the storyline is worse, Lucas should have created a digital Anakin, at least he would have had a better actor. Touché for Padme. I felt robbed after watching this movie. I thought this would be redemption for Lucas after Episode I, but STRIKE TWO!

I espceilly liked it with how everything really en-circled the love theme of the movie. I was very impressed by that because no matter how much action there is in a movie, there is always a little room for some passion. The romance between Padme and Anakin was very cool. I really enjoyed it. The ending was good. I didn't really like what happened to Anakin in the end (you know what I am talking about). The fact that it is on DVD, makes it even better.

It was the final nail in the coffin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is gonna be the best Star Wars yet.","review":"Even though most of my friends disagree with me, I though Empire was the best Star Wars flick. I liked the storyline, the action, and the final battle between Vader and Luke. I thought all the characters came off a bit more human in this one. Also, there's no silly Barney-ish scenes, which seemed to be every where in all the others (Episode 1-Jar Jar, Episode 4-Jawa's, Episode 6-Ewoks). Now Episode II looks to do the same thing, to make the characters seem real, like they actually exist. I felt that in some of the films the characters felt like cardboard stand ups with a voice box. Still, I love this series to death, and I think Lucas may have succeeded with this flick beyond my wildest dreams. This will be the movie to see this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars has turned into children's fodder","review":"Great movie for kids. As an adult, I am disgusted with the whole Star Wars franchise at this point. Between Episode I and this over digital produced kiddie flick, I won't even bother with Episode 3. I think what I miss most from the original series is Harrison Ford. A real actor. Not a computer generated Jar Jar Binks. Bring the kids! Any adult who finds this fodder \\"great movie making\\" probally loves \\"The Muppet Movie(s)\\" and \\"The Goonies\\" The ruining of a perfect trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad for everyone involved.....","review":"Not sure where to begin..Dialogue is ridiculously juvenile and performed by actors who seem unenthused to be speaking these ridiculous lines. Lucas seems to reconstruct the Star Wars universe at his Leisure, ends up painting himself into a corner, and then reconstructs it again with something more ridiclous. Plot holes to explain Plot holes. Between him shamelessly cramming every character from the orignal series into this one and his crappy sense of humour we are left with quite a train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Lucas","review":"Yes, only he can take talent and technology and [offer] it horribly to the public...Not to mention ruin both at the same time. Who else could take a group of very talented actors (well, some of them), and make [an] in your face, CGI laced, Melrose Space, soap opera.

George Lucas has unfortunately disapointed us with the second installment of the star wars saga. Granted the CGI in episode 2 is great, Arnold Schwartzeneger's acting could have made its way out of this paper bag better. The best acting and emotion in this movie, came from the CGI Yoda!

But please, you have to get someone who knows how to act. Episode 2 plays a very important pivotal role for Anakin Skywalker turning to Darth Vader. The audience has to be able to see that brewing change but still not strip them of their sympathy for the Dark Lord. It centered on Anakin/Padme's love story instead. Such a waste of time & money. I could have just skipped this & proceed with the Episode 3. On second thoughts, I may just skip it altogether if it comes out like this film. Mr. Lucas, I hope you are listening!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Wars Yet?","review":"In a word, yes. Not even the special effects of this movie impressed me. I'm a Star Wars fan, a big one too, i got all the movies on VHS, and the \\"special editions\\" and the 2 new ones on DVD, I've got action figures filling up boxes that are filling up my closet. This movie dissapointed me in every way, as a fan. The acting was at the B-movie level. the script was lousy, no one talks like that. the love story was a joke, why would she love him? at least give the viewer a reason. Lucas only cares about making money and it makes me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst filmgoing experience of my life.","review":"What can I say. I grew up on Star Wars -- Seeing Return of the Jedi at age 9 was like being baptized at the Mormon Tabernacle for other folks. But even then I could sense something chintzy about \\"Jedi\\"...so what I didn't care. Twenty years, hundreds of dollars of Star Wars Laserdisc purchases later...these pieces of **** come out. I actually defended Phantom Menace! Not that I liked it. But this is simply the most embarrassingly awful film ever made, this, Attack of the Clones. I can only think of Ewan MacGreggor, after starring in brilliant films like Shallow Grave, watching the dumb Americans and their failed cinema empire. How depressing. But I went home and listened to some Neil Young and it was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit confusing","review":"The biggest attractive of the movie are the Jedis, we finally see them really in action, and we see plenty of them from different wordls.

I don't understand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite as bad as episode I","review":"Who's the kid that plays Anakin? What kind of favors did he, or his mother, have to do to get the gig?! He is one of the worst actors, and I use the term lightly, I've ever witnessed!!!Boring, but at least it got rid of the racial stereotypes that was soooo offensive in episode I.

What the hell was Lucas thinking when he made the prequels? The cast has no chemistry and the CGI makes everything look fake.

This movie lacks all the essentials to good movie making except one: special effects.

Episode 2 was again a marvel for film special effects, but sometimes even those felt overplayed. OK, I admit, the first time I saw it (as appalled as I was by the fake emotions and horrible directing from Lucas) the last 20 or so minutes kept me excited and wanting more, but Lucas just really has to pass the torch... which he isn't doing. As much of a chance as Episode III has of being a great movie, I thought that Episode II had just as much a chance over 1. Sure, it was better, but not by much. Really people, look inside yourself and ask whether you can really say that you felt as good coming out of this movie as you did when you came out of A New Hope and beyond. If you can, then happy disillusionment to you.

The acting is wooden, the dialogue is pathetic and contrived, and the plot is almost non-existant. Only the scenes with Anakin and the Sand People and the final Jedi battle come close to capturing the spirit of the original 3 films. The rest of it is garbage.Apparently George Lucas thought that he could distract us all from the fact that he made an extended video game cut scene instead of a movie by filming the entire thing in front of a blue screen and filling the movie with CGI. Maybe he thought that we'd have to like it, just because it carried the Star Wars brand label. Maybe he just didn't care because he knew he'd be raking in about $1 billion. In any case, he continues to ruin the original three movies with these train wrecks.

It was the ultimate adventure with a good versues evil premise.I was very disappointed when I saw The Phantom Menace. The film was too focused on Anakin Skywalker, and it lowered its standards. I anxiously waited with anticipation for Attack Of The Clones, and aside from it being a little better, there were still alot of flaws in the film. The worst was the romance. It totally ruined the pace in the film, and talk about rehashing of certain scenes. Haven't I seen that scene with the starship weaving through th easteroids before? Han Solo did it in the Empire Strikes Back and the ending was way too fast. I didn't know what had transpired until I read the book. And again I'm reminded of The Empire Strikes Back.

However, when Geroge Lucas delivered a Satr Wars that was 95% \\"storybuilding\\" with forgettable characters and TERRIBLE performances(most notably from haydn Christiansen), there was a great groan, and rightly so. Having established a strong base, Lucas ptobably hoped to try something new, and fell flat on his face. This movie should be renamed Attack Of The Drones.

George Lucas has surrounded himself with too many \\"Yes\\" men for far too long. Someone needs to tell him that he is out of touch with what the fans want to see, and that he needs to get down off his \\"High Horse\\". I loved the first series of Star Wars movies. These Last two were just awful! The actors were all horrible, especially the guy who played anakin, who was, at times, down right embarrassing to watch. The plot was way off, and the special effects all looked like poorly done cartoon images. This movie could have been so much more. The only thing good about the whole movie was the soundtrack, which I believe is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Abysmal","review":"Moves the story along? Only by character ignorance, idiocy, and incompetence.We get bumbling Jedi \\"masters\\" who literally can't detect a Sith Lord standing next to them. Obi Wan spends six minutes (film time) being confused by obviously deleted library material. As per the romance, aside from being laughable, Lucas/Anakin's idea of sweet talk seems much more suited to stalker dialogue.The film shouldn't be given special consideration because it is sci-fi. Lucas and company need to be held accountable for telling a quality, full-bodied story. Producers get to stop at putting together a story concept and framework. Writers and directors are responsible for making it engaging, robust, and complete. That hasn't happened here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Wars Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"The original Star Wars trilogy was a lot better than this movie. This movie is really boring. The actor Hayden C., who played Anikin, was just terrible. This fellow does not know how to act. He should have just been a storm trooper not a jedi.

Thank you for everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Phantom Menace...","review":"To put this review in perspective, I should say that I bought this DVD strictly in an attempt to test the potential of my new entertainment system setup. Upon arriving at the final battle scene, my shameless goal was happily realized. However, the mundane tripe that I had to wade through before hand almost made the journey an unbearable one. While almost always pleasing to the senses, the movie had absolutely no substance... especially to justify a revisitation. Therefore, rent the DVD. However, be sure to enjoy and marvel at the efforts (documented nicely in the special features) the amazing talents at the ILM (arguably the only ones in this production) had put towards this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treat for DVD lovers","review":"The reason I gave this DVD five stars was not because I thought the action scenes were cool or the acting was excellent, but beacause the DVD had great special features. Which included deleted scenes, interviews, and even T.V spots. Fellow customers here, we are reviewing the DVD, not the quality of the movies. I am not trying to cut up your reviews, but just to take the topic into consideration. We are reviewing the DVD, not the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"still havent gotten it right?","review":"sigh. where to begin? anakins gut-wrenchingly bad acting? the sappiest cornball romance? (they did NOT just roll together on the grassy hill) the completely unoriginal, unconvincing (even if you tried) action sequences (seemly designed strictly for the video game)? the gross over-use of CG? (its 3/4 cartoon really)I could go on, but these are the shallow reasons why Lucas has let me down. Lost in the new episodes are the completely NATURAL and HUMAN relationships, interactions, dialogue, and behavior of the original SW characters. Episodes 1+2 contain the most STIFFly performed, unengaging scenes, with every actor convinced that they must act 'dignified' at all times. Granted, they are jedis and politicians, but it just gets irritatingly fake and pretentious after a while. Absolutely none of the relaxed/easy feel that made the original characters so charismatic and appealing. Don't see any new stars born, in other words."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good movie","review":"in this movie you see charters you see in the first movies. like jinga feat son is bobba feat.they also show the plans to build the daeth star.last but not least the show whean c3po gets mad at r2d2. i think you should look at this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The force is with this movie!","review":"I have never seen a better Star Wars movie. The Phantom Menace was okay but the lack of fighting made the movie somewhat boring. But in this movie you get to see everyone in action and everybody does something important. 3 words Best Movie Ever(thats a lie)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Episode 2, Attach of the Clones","review":"After watching Episode 2, the near realness was fantastic.It movie technology at it's very best. A must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up from Episode I...","review":"This movie was better than its predecessor, but it again had a different twist to it. They spent too much time on Anakin and Padme, we got the theme after the first five minutes. But this movie has more action than Episode I, therefore the title \\"Attack of the Clones\\". My favorite scene was the Obi Wan-Jango Fett battle on Kamino. That was an exciting scene. And Yoda going crazy on Count Dooku was another great scene. Overall better than Episode I, again, any Star Wars fan should pick this up and add it to their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically brilliant - content empty","review":"The DVD is technically brilliant, the simulation lifelike and almost seamless. so what's wrong with this DVD? No storyline. Well, maybe a pathetic little story line overwhelmed by special effects. This episode is even more unbelievable that Episode 1 but without an annoying chatterbox. You never connect with the male lead (jerk is a good discription) and the romantic interest was laughable! Obiwan's adventures keeps the video afloat. The only really delightful sequence is kungfu yoda, light sabre will travel! If you have to see this, rent it. If you are compelled to buy it for your collection (DVD packrat) wait a year and pick it up in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film is rudderless","review":"A totally uninspired effort by the Star Wars team. The love scenes between Anikin and Amidala are almost painful to watch. I found myself unable to care whether they lived or died. In fact, all of the characters in the story seem limp and lifeless. The one exception would be Christopher Lee. He is the quintessetial villian.Unless you are a Star Wars fanatic, I would give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"HILARIOUSLY AWFUL","review":"Again check out RedLetterMedia's critique that recently came out of Episode 2, this movie has no plot and the whole 'romance' story has to be the worst in all cinema. Another sticking point is how they TELL us how Anakin and Obi-Wan are great friends instead of SHOWING us. Horribly written, this movie is yet another excuse to sell merchandise, do yourself a favor - don't bother watching this crap unless you want a laugh watching the cringe inducing dialogue being delivered"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Episode I (if that's possible)","review":"If only I could give it zero stars.

Instead of showing what trials caused Anakin to go to the dark side this movie shows him for a weak willed little sniviler who was destined to go bad. Let's hope for installment three 1. George gets someone else to write the script and 2. Hayden learns how to be a better actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of corny","review":"The dialogue was darn right cheesy, Hayden Christensen's acting was undeniably bad. It was cringe-worthy at times. I like Natalie Portman, but even she was bland and borderline awful in this.On the plus, the lightsaber battles are again, the best part of any Star Wars film. The effects are all done very well, and the music score was also fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The time line of the prequels is very disjointed compared to the original Trilogy. I was particularly offended at the blatant inconsistencies in this film. For instance, we are apparently so stupid we will believe that in the 10 years since Anakin left his Mother, she was sold, freed, married, and gave birth to a bouncing 18 year old baby boy.For as long as it took for these films to be made, it feels like the story and script were just slapped together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't bad...Had some freaking awesome moments","review":"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones really get's downplayed a whole lot, when really, you think about it...The was some plain freakin' awesome moments in there.Mind you it did lack a bit, and many diminish Hayden Christenson as a bad actor (Something they'll regret saying after Episode III is released), but come on...If anything, this movie has some awesome Jedi action mixed into the huge battle array of the Clone Wars. Best of all we see what made Master Yoda himself (Frankly...he kicks butt, as we will see again in Epiosde III).I definatly think it deserved more than it's getting, and I think after III, people will understand it and like it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant movie","review":"I do consider this the best of the series. Easily the best since Empire in 1980. And why? Because this not only delves more into the events which brought about the fall of the Republic, the rise of the dark side, but also sets up for a final chapter that will tie it all together with the original trilogy. If anything, I feel George has put together a piece of story telling genius.One thing that must be remembered about the Star Wars series, none of the movies, with the exception of Episode 4, can stand alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episode II","review":"Hayden Christensen ... is just too horrible. Pinnacle of bad acting. IMHO, he ruined a perfectly good movie. I just recently watched it again on DVD and I had to write a review. BOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little better","review":"a step in the right direction, much better than the truly awful episode 1, but still some very cheesy dialogue, and lots of actors that weren't up to par with the great samuel l jackson. the young boba fett was annoying, the romance while necessary was too schmaltzy, but the clone wars were cool and they are the only reason it gets a 2 besides seeing samuel l remove a head, jar jar still stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"New addition for Mystery Science Theater 2000","review":"After Return of the Jedi, I was struck by how George was movingaway from great fantasy moving making to just plain sap. It isreally a sad thing having grown up with these movies. I stillremember standing in line in '77 to see the first one and subsequently for the second and 3rd installments. I don't seeanyway back here. The plot is booring, the CGI completly makesthese films unremarkable, and the acting is so stale and lifeless to make you wonder, other than for money, that this film was made. I shudder to think what the 3rd, and hopefully,final installment will be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could put No Stars, I would","review":"What a waste of time, horrible acting on Anakin's part. What a horrible actor, absolutely disgusting. He looks like a psycho on top of that! They should have gotten somebody better for his part. What a disgrace, he cannot act....AT ALL. Not only this, but the movie in general was a waste of time. A boring plot, dull story, just somewhat good special effects. If it wasn't for the midget, Yoda, doing foolish lightstick battles, this DVD would be nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE WAS BETTER THAN PHANTOM MENACE","review":"LIKE THE TITLE SAYS, BUT THIS WITH MENACE WAS JUST THE SET UP THIS ONE IS THE BRIDGE AND PLOT PAYOFF AND THIS ONE IS VERY ENGAGING AND SEE WHY ANAKIN TURNS TO THE DARKSIDE. HE DISATTACHES HIMSELF FROM THE JEDI CODE AND THE JEDI THEMSELVES SLOWLY. BUT IN REALITY MOST OF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TIL THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. BUT YOU SEE IN THIS ONE WHY IT HAPPENS AND THAT'S REASON ENOUGH TO WATCH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha???","review":"Ok, it's not horrible...but, jeez it's not worthy to be called Star Wars either. When Yoda is the best \\"actor\\" in the flick, you're in trouble. Boring, unbelievable love story. Wooden dialog...ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EPISODE 2","review":"this movie was incredible despite what the critics have said about it. Everything about it was good and it is quite possibly my favorite movie of all-time. I've seen it twice already and I am looking forward to seeing it again. the star wars saga continues to be amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Just saw the movie and .. WOW! The special effects are amazing.. MUCH better than the Phantom Menace. Although, it must be seen on a Digital Projector to really appreciate it. The story is much better and has tied up a few loose strings left from the Phantom Menace. Across the Stars fits the romance theme perfectly, John Williams has done it again! Yoda really is the Jedi MASTER! Portman is destined to be on the walk of Stars to be be remembered even in a galaxy far far away. Thank you very much Lucas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is strong in this one","review":"This film was excellent on so many levels. The script was much stronger than The Phantom Menace, Hayden Christiansen portrayed Anakin suberbly (quickly shifting between emotions), and the end-battle alone is worth the price of admission!If we could do 1/2 stars I would give this film 4.5 stars.I eagerly await the last installment in the saga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst so far yet","review":"This has to be by far the most disappointing installment of the Star Wars series. I think Mr. Lucas should take lessons from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The special effects will impress you if you are a 12 year old with a penchant for nintendo but if you are looking for the story, forget it this is not the movie. The acting is atrocious though i can't blame the actors entirely since the screenplay is atrocious too. The story lacks heart. I didn't care for any of the characters and as for Master Yoda's fighting skills, that is just pyrotechnics not storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash Wars","review":"I've been a Star Wars fan since the first movie, what is now called a \\"New Hope\\", came out in 1977. I was thirteen at the time. The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi were both great movies, very worthy successors to the original movie.I've just seen Attack of the Clones. It is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen. The acting, if you can call it that, was just plain bad. Dialog? Plot? Don't worry about stuff like that, this movie does not have any. It was like I was watching Friends.My four year old loved it. The thing was written for people with the mentality of a four year old.I've written far more than this dog deserves. Don't see it. It's bad.I rate this move -6."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Cartoon of a Movie","review":"The main problem with Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones is the special effects. The actors look lost and confused most of the time because they are constantly behind blue screens. The end battle looks like a cartoon, it looked like the actors were trapped in Toy Story world. Another problem is the script, it is really lame, with lines like \\" Sand is corse, but not like you, you are everything soft.\\" its corny lines like this that make some scences laughable. George lucas is probly the laziest dirctor of all time. This film was not directed by George lucas it was directed by the good guys ofI.L.M Cause this movie is one big special effect. Its sad to hear John Williams legendary score over this waste of a Star Wars film. I hope Lucas trys a little harder with episode 3. Actually i pray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughinably Bad","review":"After a 3rd viewing of this movie the other night i struck me just how awful this movie is..absolutely awful plot..sub-par special effects...wasted talents of very good actors on awful dialogue and poor direction..not a believable set piece in the whole movie the whole thing looks blue screened..and badly blue screened..and the bad chinese accents on the aliens..and those lousy creatures at the end in the arena that look like a 3rd grader thought them up..i mean this is really awful filmaking..i dont know which was worse this or Phantom Menace..Mr Lucas needs to stop directing and move on to another line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I in Hell, or again at a horrible blockbuster?","review":"No humor, no originality, no script, no acting, plot is half baked and could be good if it wasn't so formulaic. No excitement, no tension, no character development. Just costumes. Ho hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad, it's not even funny","review":"it's just all around a disappointing moive. bad, horrendous acting and above all WEAK writing/directing. George needs to let someone else rescue this saga from it's death spiral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play on DVD/VCR Combo units","review":"It has finally happened, Lucas is so worried about his copyright that he's created a nonfunctioning product. We bought my father a DVD/VCR combo unit for his birthday, his old VCR died at last, and some DVDs to watch. The one he was most looking forward to watching was Star Wars - Attack of the Clones... BUT... it WILL NOT PLAY in the unit, the picture goes light and dark because the copyright protection is kicking in despite the fact that isn't even a tape in the VCR side. I'm not going to return the combo player just because this ONE dvd, it seems the others all work, will not play. If you have one of these units however, don't bother to buy this DVD. I would give this DVD no stars id it was possible but I guess it gets one for being used as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is probably one of my favorites in the series. 1st of all, this is the first time we see all the Jedis fighting together. The battle was assome. Second, Jango Fett was amazing, his flamethrower, whip, and all the other cool accessories he had. 3rd, you get to see Yoda and Mace Windu fight, it was sooooooooooooo cool. Now go buy the DVD!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Despite some shotty acting from Hayden Chrisstiansan and Nathale Portman it was excellent. Special Effects are at a max.

They had a bad actor to play Anakin! You could make a better Anakin by grabbing Mike Myers and put robes on him! The only reason my father bought this was to try to get the full collection of Star Wars... This movie did not have the thrill of Star Wars Episode 5 or the excitement of episode 6...You think if Episode 1 actaully was good then Star Wars Episode 2 might be a little better! I'm sorry but this movie was not good! I give it 2 stars for the effort they put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE STAR WARS FANS WILL APPRECIATE THIS MOVIE","review":"Excellent special effects, interesting creatures, and of course NATALIE PORTMAN! The plot was easy to follow if you are a true STAR WARS fan. The introduction to the stormtroopers, meeting young Bobba Fett, (even as a kid, he knew how to fly SLAVE I), and a young Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. I admit the touchy, feely scenes were a bit much,but, there was plenty of action to go around. The battle in the asteroid field was great. We never got to see the full armament of SLAVE I before. Christopher Lee was convincing as Darth Tyranus. He is a good evil character actor (remember Seramon the Wise from Lord of the Rings). ....Just watch the movie as if you never saw the earlier films. Great film, a must for star wars fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not much better than Episode III","review":"Episodes 1-3 got progressively worse, but casting Christian Hayden in the role of \\"adolescent/adult Anniken\\" was a mistake. He's terrible, he over-acts, and he has zero chemistry with Natalie Portman. But, it's part of the Star Wars series now, and I had to add it to our home-viewing options."},{"rating":"1","title":"lucas needs help,fast!","review":"This movie is nowhere near as great as episode 1,except for yoda fighting christopher lee,mcgregor and jackson and the opening credits, it [stinks].The romantic scenes in this...make the ones in pearl harbor look good.And just because you FINALLY get to see another head cut off, and some limbs removed,that does not make this as good as \\"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\\".To come close to that there has to be some acting going on between portman and that new guy,which is sad because portman can act very well. the two most horrible things that have happened to these films are that with digital technology, lucas sticks with the effects and nothing else.He made the big mistake of not hiring someone else for number 2.And dont try and tell me number 1 was the setup and this is the payoff,thats bull.you can watch any of the original 3 and each one works on its own.If what lucas said is true and this thing was part of a thirty year mission to come to the screen,star wars is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Episode III","review":"This Star Wars Saga Has been the greatest thing to ever be created by the human imagination. Lucas is a wonderful story teller,(no matter what anybody says)and I've absolutely love every star wars movies that have been made. from 1-2 and 4-6, and once I see Episode 3 I'm sure that movie will be added to the list of all time greatest films. I'm terribly sad that these are going to be the last star wars movies they will make."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best Star Wars movie!","review":"Who cares what critics say? Or what fake star wars fans say. Behind Return of the Jedi this is the best one. The story was wonderful and the the film painted a beautiful picture of the star wars galaxy. The action was amazing and Yoda's fight scene vs. Doku was magnificent. It was a masterpiece all through out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Being a Lucas fan, my disapointment is enormous with this movie. I thought the best actors (Mcgregor, Lee, Jackson) were poorly used (if at all) and the Portman/Anakin duo were emphasized even though their acting is atrocious.

I hope VI is better.PREDICTION: I bet no one waits 2 months in line for the tickets to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the sci-if movie buff","review":"Bought as part of the six movie star wars series that will be a permanent fixture of my movie collection.Farhad"},{"rating":"1","title":"star wars episode 2","review":"i did not enjoy this movie. i wish george lucas had added more plot and sped up the movie to be able to include more of the clone wars instead of having to make an animated tv show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Episode One brought viewers to a different place within the Star Wars Universe: one where story doesn't matter as long as the visuals are pleasant. This movie continues the focus on eye-candy while falling below mediocre in terms of dialogue, story, and acting. It does have more story and better visuals than its predecessor, but that is all that makes this better.

Episode I and II are so cheesy I need to find me some crackers!! Episode II has a pathetic love story that is just too gross to actually take seriously. I expected episode II to be the \\"evil/ dark\\" one where things start to really happen. Um....wrong. Besides the soon to be Darth Vader's whining I didn't find most of the \\"story\\" to be of interest. And don't even get me started on Yoda and his little fight scene.........HORRIBLE!!!!!To even suggest that episode I and II are better or even equal to the original trilogy is an insult!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific.","review":"If the title didn't prove it, the movie definitely does. Lucas has clearly lost his touch, not to mention his dignity. This installment of the second trilogy is, without a doubt, an insult to everything Star Wars.The writing is miserable, ranging from Anakin's \\"romance novel\\" love scenes to a sequence consisting almost entirely of puns with our old friend C3P0. Lucas even managed to make Yoda sound corny. The acting is just as awful. Hayden Christiansen, the actor who plays Anakin Skywalker, is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to Star Wars, with the possible exception of Jar Jar Binks.The only thing this movie has going for it are special effects. But, even they are not particularly impressive, compared with movies like The Matrix or Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.Rent it if you have to see it, because, if you are a fan of the original trilogy, I guarantee you will NOT want to endure this travesty a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film","review":"The special effects and storyline are incredible. Many questions from the original trilogy are answered, like where the stormtroopers and Boba Fett came from, why Luke calls Owen and Beru uncle and aunt, who designed the Death Star and why Vader has wires on his severed hand in Return of the Jedi. They're heading in the right direction for Episode III."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Load of .......","review":"Did i just watch a kinder garden play or a baby who wants his bottle??

Or The Lord Of The Rings is going to take your place in life!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FORCE IS STILL WITH US...","review":"I found this to be my personal favorite of the entire STAR WARS saga for several reasons. First, it brings fans what they've been waiting for:Yoda fighting, what Boba Fett looks like under the mask, the Clone War, tons o' Jedi action, Anakin's dark side manifesting, and him and Padme falling in love. Lucas has created a tragic love tale meshed with a action-packed adventure that preludes to galactic war. The result is a truly amazing film that shows what STAR WARS is really all about. The acting is first rate, especially Christopher Lee as the villainous Count Dooku (Darth Tyrannus). Hayden is great as Anakin, because he really makes you feel sorry for him. I mean, he could be having this great life that will never be, since he becomes Vader. Anyone who has seen the old films must see this one. It is much more fun than its predecessor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to the series","review":"Attack of the Clones is a great addition to the Star Wars series.

It provides a good introduction to Episode III which will reveal even more secrets about the Star Wars universe. I can't wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"This movie is a celebration of wooden dialogue. The really interesting question is how could someone with so much talent available make such an uninteresting movie? By comparison, the first movie was positively sprightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"even worse than episode one","review":"The remarkably fine cast seems remarkably bad in this movie. Maybe it's the gawdawful clitches they're expected to utter? The remarkable special effects fizzle as well, with no plot, point, or story to back them up, and it's a real pity that this time, Lucas couldn't afford to hire a WRITER, like he used to do, back when his movies were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn....","review":"I enjoy sci-fi movies including the early Star Wars films. This latest Star Wars movie must have been made by the merchandising department as I find it hard to believe that the George Lucas we know from his earlier works made this one.

Look at all the people clamor to the theater in order to soak in the latest piece of . . . passing itself off as a Star Wars movie. \\"Why do I have the feeling you'll be the death of me someday\\", says Obi-Wan to Anakin as we are supposed to laugh at the foreshadowing George Lucas sets up, except that we already know that Obi dies by Anakin. So the joke's not funny and neither is every other intended joke in this crudfest. The only funny part is the supposed \\"romance\\" between Padme and Anakin, which feels about as intense as a hula hoop.The little diner that Obi-Wan visits, what the hell does it all mean? This movie has waaaaaaaay too many modern references, do yourself a favor and rent episodes four through six and skip out on ep. 3 because I'm sure it'll be as bad as the last two. George Lucas better take the next movie off and try and regain his sense of adventure because this franchise is more stale than a crouton."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've given a 3 but...","review":"You guys are giving scores that are way too higher than the movie truly deserves. This movie sucks, period. The special effects are great but its storyline is very lame and pretentious. And why imitate Blade Runner? It doesn't look like a Star Wars film at all but a parody of several \\"cool(or hippy?)\\" movies like The Matrix. This movie lacks originality.Yeah I agree that this DVD version has lots of great extras, but the movie itself is really bad(Of course, I know AOTC is not a artsy movie.). The story's boring, the acting's very flat mainly because of the director, and the editing was choppy and amateurish. And who wrote the stupid script? Even the fight scenes were so so compared to B-level Hong Kong movies.This movie does NOT deserve a five star. This movie generated lots of money because it's a \\"Star Wars\\" movie, and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas has completely lost it...","review":"Bad acting, incoherent story, horrible climax... I find it outrageous that this was the end result of a project that Lucas has been planning since the original trilogy. What it all comes down to is horrible writing. Anakin was horribly miscasted and his acting was painful to watch. George Lucas is so bad at writing dialogue that he actually made a cast of great actors including Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman look like stiff amateurs. The movie seemed to revolve around actions scenes that were indiscriminately thrown in the story left and right without any real build up to them.Yes, it was beautifully shot, but to what end?

The entire movie was badly written, acted and it was forced. It was over the top even for sci-fi. I mean the part in the begining when Anakin jumps from the vehicle-come on! And Obi Wan is nervous about Anakin's piloting, I thought Jedi's were to control their fear. Duku was not all that exciting either. To tell you the truth I think The Phantom Menace was a better film. Darth Maul was awesome! Duku lacked the dred that Maul brought to the scren. No one can replace Darth Vader but, If Darth Maul had more screen time he would have been a close runner up. I will see the third film just to get some closure but, I don't have very hi hopes. I will probably wait for it to be released on DVD. I was born in 1972, so I am going to have to stick with the Star Wars that I grew up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!...","review":"The plot is not bad, the Digital Effects are OK, but for all the rest, all I can say is YUCK...!Unless you're a big fan of South-American soap-operas, I can't imagine you enjoying this movie.What a disgrace seeing Portman and McGregor acting with such poor dialogs (god I miss them from Leon & Trainspotting), as a result the whole movie can be shrinked out to 30 mn (plot and some battles), but here you get a 2 hrs bonus of useless scenes, love declarations, and deceptions.A friend of mine told me it was much better than Episode I (which made me sleep for about 1 hr), but I see Ep. II exactly the same.What happened to the George Lucas that created the first trilogy? I personally have no clue, but something did happen.I can deduce that this movie has been digitally directed too.PS: One positive thought about this movie, is when you follow it up with another movie (like I did with \\"Hedwig & the angry inch\\"), then you'll find out and appreciate excellent directing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"Overall, this movie was one of the worst sequels or prequels I have ever seen.The romantic scenes were not at all believable and poorly written.Some of the acting and dialogue was just plain horrible.The first hour of this movie was too slow except for the openning and the chase sequence.There's a heavy reliance on CGI for the special effects, which made the movie look more like a cartoon at some points.In addition, this movie doesn't stand up well to A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back or Terminator 2.A more talented director like James Cameron or Steven Speilberg would have done justice to the series.In conclusion, I do not recommend this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on..","review":"Is this really a five-star movie?

It almost ruined the whole movie for me. I just went to the theater and saw Attack Of the Clones. Oh my God. This movie rocks. What a good solid screenplay and story. The action sequences were the best that I have ever seen in any movie and the special effects were totally awesome. Also I am not big on love stories, but that was even good. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have great chemistry. I do not possibly see how someone could give this movie a bad review like some of those I have read at Amazon. I can&#65533;t wait until the next installment to see how everything gets set up for the original Star Wars from the 1970&#65533;s.

This wasn't the Lucas I expected. Where are the brilliant \\"Han Solo\\" expresions? Where are the details of the story?There's one thing that makes the three first movies unique, and that is the care they took to make things apear real with so limited tools. But it looks better than the computer generated spaceships with little or no detail.The music wasn't that good also. It looks as if they didn't have time to work on it and started making a mix of every theme they had in the previous movies.There are things that doesn't make sense in the story, like 3PO working with Anakin's mother (and Owen and Beru Lars) and they didn't remember him when they bought him a second time.Jedi are not as great and powerful as I expected and battle sequences weren't as good as Phantom Menace ones. I'm even starting to think that Phantom Menace was better.What has become of the Lucas I admired?"},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze...","review":"When I sat down to watch Attack of the clones,I was hoping it would restored my faith in George Lucas and the Star Wars series. Unfortunately, it was not to be. This is worse then the Phantom Menace. The acting is dreadful. Most of them are spouting off philosophical lines like there got sticks up there butts. Ewan McGregor is so boring as Obi-wan. Hayden Christensen is terrible, he wines so much it's hard to believe this is the future Darth Vader. Natalie Portman is still wooden. The Jedi are idiots and deserve what they get. I was cringing throughout the romantic scenes. This movie is boring and has no soul. George Lucas cannot write or direct, his dialogue is cheesy and the action scenes are a mess, take the lightsaber fight scene between Yoda and Dooku, showing Yoda bouncing around like a soccer ball was so ridiculous I was laughing. Lucas, get someone else to direct the next movie and maybe then will see a good prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Wars Ever","review":"There are a few reasons why this Star Wars is only my 81st favorite movie ever. 1.

My blog was a flurry with anger when I first saw this movie. I only saw it 3 times. Openning day. 2; The CGI on Portmans breast were subpar at best. How can I appease my Death Star with a b-cup. The women of the infirior Star Trek shows are more decent!!!! 3: Not enough Jar Jar Binks. Nuff said LOL OMG!!!!! 3===> 4. As I've told George Lucas 54 times, pink lightsaber would be the weakest so why would Yoda have one?!?!?! Yoda should atleast have blue or green!!! 5. I was told by my internet friends that...

I mean we are talking about one of the top bounty hunters in the 'galaxy' yet in 4,5, and 6 the stormtroopers get killed left and right.Hoenstly the entire clone thing is flawed, because in the 4th episode there are two stormtroopres talking about new bantha wheels or somethings..... but if they were clones shudnt they just shut their mouths and serve the empire?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down, another episode one, minus an original plot.","review":"There comes at time in making sequels when using the same form of visual effects over and over to display battles no one really wants to see fails to keep the audience excited. On a whole the film represents a failure to bring in an original plot while having no hesitation to show endless scenes of battles with the latest graphic technology. This is another of the bland-plot films flowing out of the movie business at the moment. It would be nice to see a more complicated plot and a more intelligent script in future movies of this sort, otherwise we are in a dire state indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't set the bar of the original star wars yet still a great movie","review":"If you would take the first three films out of existence, then this wouldn't be bashed as much more being a mediocere film. Ill agree that the first 3 were better, but its too much to expect the same. Lightning doesn't always strike twice. On to my next point, this movie has very well designed special effects. The jedi battle on geonosis is great and the yoda lightsaber duel is another on my high list. Despite the lack of good actors, the beginning of anakin's transformation is well documented. George Lucas has done a great job with beginning to sew together the movie towards episode 4.

This combination can do no wrong.The ones who see this movie for what it is, stand to be a minority but a worthy bunch. Because at a time when the mob mentality rules, they refuse to be duped.I gave 1-star because I am a saddened original trilogy fan. What makes me sad is the way Lucas and Company uses the original trilogy to milk more money and to cheat the trilogy's many adoring fans with \\"clones\\" that have no spirit and no life.

The basis of the Star Wars Galaxy is rooted in Epic tradition and Mythology. Episode I not only lacked all of the characteristics of being EPIC, but it also was not designed for the intelligent audience. Mysticism, creative thinking and interpretation were lost on todays audience, as the plot, story and characters were trivial and immature at best - as well as obvious and driven to a point. While Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill we able to act as young adults, our new cast are \\"children\\" by comparison. Maybe less technology and graphics and an actual story would bring back the quality.For those who think that my review is based on \\"I hate SW\\" you ar mistaken.

That being said, the movie was dreadful. The only reason I did not ask for a refund was that the special effects were decent. I like Mcgregor and Lee in other flicks, but it seems here that they were handcuffed and they knew it. How could Lee be so incredible in The Two Towers as Saruman and look like a washed-up horror actor here? It boggles the mind. My advice is don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant recommend this one...","review":"I won't mention the acting, or the laughable love scenes. What I have a problem with in this film, and many others like lord of the rings, is the overuse of cgi's. I really think the older special effects from films like aliens, the original star wars, and others are so much more convincing than a cartoonish jumble of computer effects. For me, it destroys the illusion of the film because seeing the cgi instantly alerts me to the false nature of the picture I'm looking at. Now, in a movie like aliens, you really believe the alien is going to kill someone and that they are engaged in a real battle, because they are both on the screen and the actors are not just guessing at where the cgi is going to be standing in the film. Imagine how bad aliens would be if they replaced the aliens, and the mother alien, with cgi characters!

The story was this: anakin and his girlfriend get involved in bad people then there is a war and some people get hurt. ObiWan does stuff and it reveals things about robots. I wasn't really paying attention cuz it was so boring. There is JarJar too and he was funny. There was also Yoda and an old man who fought and that was funny because the old man was old and could barely keep up with Yoda! I think Yoda beat him up.

There is a whole mystery about who built the clone army, but this is never fully explained. Also, it's not really clear why the Separatists were building a Death Star. I'm a Star Wars geek and it took me a while to figure these plot twists out. It's certainly not going to appeal to casual fans.

I think this got more on track with the story of the OT, from EPI 1. Another thing that is bad, is that there is no buildup to fights. There all just rushed into, and with the dialog as well. To rushed, they never just sat down and gave dialog to much. But, I have seen 100x worse then this film, so I give it 4 *, but I have seen 100X better, so thats why only 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie was good","review":"While some of the love dialogue was...horrible the movie itself was good. If you think the love lines were corny in this movie, think back to the Leia and Han love lines throughout the original trilogy.

It was just the underlying love plot that brought the movie down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Best Star Wars yet, minus the bad acting by \\"Anakin\\" in this movie, plus a lil ierd running by \\"Mace\\", but the battle between Yoda and that Sith dude, Count Dookuu, makes it all worth it for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't we all just get along?","review":"Wow, the negative reviews on here are pretty vicious. Maybe those folks are just angry that the Star Wars series have declined into clunky stories and bad acting with great special effects. I didn't like Episode I and blew off Episode II until it showed up on HBO. Maybe I'd be furious if I saw it in a theatre as well--like Lucy had pulled the football away AGAIN--but then I just switch channels and look for something like STAR TREK II: WRATH OF KHAN. Character, character, character.The best thing I've read about ATTACK OF THE CLONES was in The Onion news: \\"Most of it's like watching C-SPAN from another planet.\\" Dead on, dude.Knowing where everything is going is not enough to breath life into these movies.

I was quickly surprised at the very poor acting and dialog! It never even occured to me that would ever be an issue in a Lucas film! The emotion and interaction was wooden and given with all the enthusiasm of Ben Stein! I can't believe the line ups and the 4 star review. Did the rest of you see a different movie than I did?

Thanks for everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Episode 1, but needs work","review":"I found much to enjoy about Star Wars Episode II: the effects were dazzling, the fights were well choreographed, and it's a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. But unfortunately, the characters weren't that interesting. In the original trilogy, the characters were fresh and involving, while now they're just actors in a Star Wars film. Not that that effects the movie badly, but would've made the movie better if the characters were more interesting (and maybe even developed).

She was angry that I had told her that this was supposed to be a romantic movie, as she felt that it was a lousy one, at best.Overall, Hayden Christiensen was a horrible choice for Anakin. His acting was absolutely aweful. And since the movie hinged upon him, that really hurt.Some scenes were good, like Obi-Wan's use of the force to make a drug-seller rethink his life, but these were far and few between in a sea of sludge.The best thing that I can say is that the movie picks up when they arrive in the arena. Unfortunately, this is about twenty minutes before the end and I don't think that twenty minutes out of a two and a half hour movie is a good thing upon which to spend my money.Yoda's lightsaber duel was really good, though . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating the DVD, Not the movie.","review":"Having said that, one must decide 1st if they like the movie or not.

On the first disc is the Movie itself, with the option to hear commentaries by Lucas, and others. They explain some of the subtle changes made between the Theatrical, and DVD releases. They also show you the \\"Easter Eggs\\" you may have missed while watching the movie.The second disc is the Behind-the-Scenes disc. They show how the creatures were designed.

The acting was pathetic (a scene or two being an exception) to the point of making Kevin Costner wooden acting look like Jack Nicholson, the script, for having some interesting ideas, was completely amateur in its construction, they couldn't even get makeup on Natalie Portman consistently correct. This movie did not appear to have a director<period> Great technology, bad movie-making, poor acting, nonexistent directing, Christopher Lee and Yoda were the only characters with any presence or animation, reminiscent of a high school play in a school without a drama teacher.

That said, I think you can expect where this review is going.Underdeveloped characters, too much digital effects (even the sets are fake!), and a Cheese filled story all make this film one of the worst I have ever seen. George Lucas is obviously throwing out these prequels to make money, and he has lost his devotion to the fans. Plain and simple, this movie was a marketing ploy for Lucasfilm and ILM to show their talents(?) due to the failing of his efffects company.The movie lacks detail, skill, and a coherent story, also the film seems to be directed by a twelve year old with ADD.Avoid this one at all costs folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing.","review":"What is the problem with this movie?

Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Episode 1...","review":"This movie is FULL of special effeects and action. Th acting is adequate, but Lucas needs to work on his dialogue. I feel like the story is rushed much more than the original movies, and the lack of strong characters like Chewbacka and Han Solo are what's lacking. I am looking forward to seeing how Anakin finally turns, but it seems like it will be difficult to do in only one movie. He still seems so far away from evil in this episode.See the movie, It's fun.

Would Yoda, Obi-Wan and all of the others really have allowed this child to continue to study the jedi arts, and is it possible for him to have completed 10 years of study and still be such a little menace?The special effects were undoubtedly great, and the final fight scene with Yoda was brilliant fun, but the characters were one dimensional (if that), and there was no real emotion anywhere in the movie. Anakin's relationship was laughable, and completely bereft of any true quality.An entertaining movie for 10-year-old boys, but there isn't much to offer anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well pleaser for Mr. Lucas universe","review":"This instalment of the Star Wars saga is one of the most exciting production since The Empire Strikes Back. A lot of respected american and british film critics slaughter this film because of lack of emploment, poor acting and building substance of the main characters, too much high-tech wizardry, boring and lame. I really enyoy the film, not by the monstrous millionaire propaganda it because the movie follows very well the Lucas intentions to guide us to the most important climatic event, the transformation of Darth Vader. The film has a aceptable castwith fine and not so good acting. The real improvements are with Ewan McGregor and Cristopher Lee is excellent. Chirstersen and Portman romance works, but I will wait for a big surprise. The polictics, clone experiment,oedipal complex and death it gives not talk , talk ,talk but intersting plotting.

If you're a fan, and so hungry for star wars stuff that you'll accept anything Lucas throws out there, this is a treasure. This is an overbudget B-movie at best. All it has done for me, personally is to taint the magic the original series held for me as a child.

So said, Episode II (and Episode I for that matter) are horrendously disappointing.

Even the faithful in the theater found unintentional humor in the lifeless dialogue. The acting was not on the level of Episodes 4-6 (the only decent performance comes from a CGI-Yoda). Even the action scenes (usually Lucas's forte) were hard to follow and ridiculously over-crowded. This movie made me appreciate how truly great the first two movies were & especially how great Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness were in their roles. I'm not sure I can totally blame the actors. Somebody quote me a memorable line of dialogue from this movie!

In Attack of the Clones, Lucas emphasises Anakin's rebellious streak in the most tactless, overdone way imagineable. I mean, the little brat has to argue and \\"rebel\\" about everything, as if the audience would not realise the future Vader's personality unless there were arguments between Kenobi and Anakin in practically every scene.

Lucas has cribbed from a lot of sources over the years (most notably Camelot and the Arthurian Legends for the original Star Wars). But to enter into a car chase (a CAR CHASE people!) early in the film and to so blatantly rip off The Fifth Element is unconscionable.Anyone who can sit through Clones and not fall asleep (as I did in the theater) doesn't understand (and will never understand) what made the original Trilogy so much better than the ...George and Co. are turning out nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Words and an Incomplete Sentence","review":"Dazzling.

The special effects are much better in the last two movies than in the previous trilogy. In fact, I have a hard time watching the original movies now because the effects look so poor in comparison. The plot is a little slow in the middle, but I think the rabid fans want as long a movie as possible so they won't complain.

The story is dull and listless, and plays like an episode of Columbo in space (with all the lines being delivered in very wooden tones) . The original Star Wars movies (episodes 4, 5, and 6) were exciting and fun to watch. This movie, along with episode 1 is simply dull. Far too often the viewer is asking themselves, \\"What happened to George Lucas' brain?\\" I couldn't even bring myself to go to a theater to see this movie (after episode one being so bad, I wasn't going to fall for that again). I saw it when it appeared on HBO. At this rate, it will take extreme use of force to make me watch episode three...... this poor franchise, which started out so well, is being beaten further and further into the ground... unless you are a fanatical Star Wars fan, do not waste your time with this movie (even then, the fanatical will most likely be majorly disappointed as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I'm a fan of the Star Wars movies, and I love the trilogy, but I was somewhat disappointed by Episode 2.

Citizen Caine is a masterpiece, this was just Starship Troopers with lightsabers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Crafted Prelude to Tragedy","review":"In \\"Clones,\\" Lucas offers up the most complex story-line in the series yet, taking Star Wars beyond its traditional good v. evil roots into novel territory: good becoming evil v. evil. Though you cheer for Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme, you understand that they're all unwittingly serving a deceptive leader. Moreover, Anakin begins his conversion to the dark side, spurred not by innate evil impulses, but by love for both Padme and his mother, a love frustrated by his duties to the Jedi Order. Thus, the film carries with it a sense of impending tragedy in which nearly every character in the film, good or evil, is a sympathetic figure. \\"Clones\\" features good performances from all its principle actors, unparalleled special effects, beautiful cinematography, and Lucas' best directing of the series. Both children and adults should have a great time watching this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT Star Wars film!","review":"The effects and sound were state-of-the-art & bone-chilling! The actors did a wonderful job, especially Hayden Christensen, who portrayed a young Darth Vader as well as could be done! The introduction of The Clone Wars, and hints of the Empire-to-come leave you craving for the conclusive Episode III, the final film which will bridge the gap between the prequal and the classic trilogy. Episode II surely redeemed the saga since Episode I and I can't wait for episode III!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More yoda","review":"This movie was great I just wish the yoda fight scene was longer and it was refreshing see the jedi master mix it up I just hope we get learn more about yoda and see more of his skills in the next installment and learn more about the old and new jedi's because there isn't alot knowledge about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Phantom Menace, worse than \\"Anaconda\\" or \\"Spawn\\"","review":"There are two types of people in this world: Those that liked \\"The Matrix\\" and those that didn't.

So then he got off the beast and lost his light saber and got in the chariot and was still fighting!!!It was also awesome when Padmai unlocked herself and it was funny when Anakin said, \\"I'm worried about Padmai.\\" and Obi-wan's response was, \\"She seems to be on top of things.\\" At the time Padmai was on a giant pillar. It was strikingly striking when the Jedis jumped down from the arena stands and fought to the death. Until they were surrounded by trade federation and confederacy until the clone troopers came with armed transports and started blasting away at droids. Then a transport picked up Anakin, Obi- wan and Padmai. Then they flew away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome Sequel!","review":"First of all, if you read my review for Star Wars Ep. 1 the Phantom Menace, then you know where i stand on the \\"sequel\\" thing.

I barely agreed to go see the first one, as it were, seeing as how I had pretty much guessed that they would completely mutilate the heart of this series with unexperienced actors and \\"mind-blowing\\" special effects. The thing is, the effects are okay, but there's so much boring dialouge that I was driven to do something I have never done before: fall asleep in the movie theater. That's right everyone - I fell right asleep during some sensationally repetitive scene about Jar Jar Binks and never bothered to see the rest of the film. And when I saw that the lead for the second movie was given to Hayden I scoffed, spit and engaged in other acts of disgust in the general direction of the new \\"movie\\". They have NOTHING on Star Wars 4, 5 and 6. No-thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Puppet Show","review":"Special effect wise this movie was much better than Episode1...Story and character wise the movie was far behind even Episode 1.Something must have happened in the last 2 decades that made George Lucas lose his human touch...the characters in the original trilogy all had their own personalities and characters...in the new movies it comes more and more through that all the \\"real\\" actors might have as well been replaced by digital puppets as they already act like those anyway.The only glimps of hope was Ewan McGregor who was refreshing by dropping a couple of cynical comments here and there...other than that the acting is just hidious and you can't even blame the actors for it...GL is so busy getting all those cool effects in place that the acting and story are not really his main focus.Even the digital Gollum in The Two Towers was a better actor then all the real life people in Episode 2....as a true StarWars fan I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"When potential for greatness is wasted it is far fouler then a project that has no redeemable qualties from the start.Thankfully this whole mess was shot digital, so they didn't waste any film.Steer clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why cant you stupid f##king so called star wars fans accept","review":"you stupid crazy star wars fans made me sick i mean why do you all think the prequels are awful including the special edition versions of the classic trilogy and of couarse the under rated return of the jedi, do you all actully think that the one of a kind genious george lucas himself actully f##ked up one of the most beloved films in cinama history do you, i dont think so because first of all you all must understand that lucas can do what ever the hell he wants, star wars arnt your films it lucas's films you could either accept lucas's vision or go watch your stupid so called popular lord of the rings trilogy and F**K yourselfs i mean this is the 21th century this isnt the 1970s any more, so you all need to stop critsizing the films or i will denfinatly kick all one of your a##'s so there and also please be nice to lucas okay or he'll kick all of your a##'s too so until then may god all of you so called fans have mercy on your souls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars is the best movie franchise ever","review":"I went to the theatre 6 times to see this movie, twice opening day.

The only good part I won't give away because it's the only part you'll like. This was the most boring movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I almost fell asleep in the middle of this movie. I am an action lover and this just didn't cut it. The romance level between whiny Anakin and Senator Amadala made me sick! These aren't supposed to be romantic movies, they are supposed to be adventurous. This movie made me decide to never see another Star Wars movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bordering on unwatchable","review":"This was relly bad!

Please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"O George Where Art Thou","review":"I saw this movie in the theater, and it was the first time that I have ever looked at my watch during any of the Star Wars movies. To bad it was only 20 minutes into the picture, but it felt like I had been there for 2 hours. What can I say about this movie; bad acting, bad love story, and the movie was way too long.I think George Lucas needs to stop listening to the hype surrounding him, and find someone else to write and edit your scripts. The dialog in this movie is terrible.I plan on buying this just to complete my collection, and then at least I can watch bits and pieces and watch it in 20 minutes :-).For something far better watch The Fellowship of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"I understand that the special effects are expensive, actually they're worth it, the movie is impressive, visually. But the story is just so bad, couldn't Lucas afford a real writer? The dialogues are just the worst I have ever heard (and I saw Dude wheres my car). The only way they make the DVD interesting is they make a mute track."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas Must Be Imprisoned","review":"This borefest is a crime against humanity. George Lucas proves without doubt that he is a total lightweight and cannot direct actors to give a even slightly decent performance. The acting in this film is atrocious. The story is idiotic and only slightly interesting the way that other \\"origin\\" stories are.The scene where Anakin's mother dies? George Lucas gets life in prison.The scene with all the \\"choppy crushy things\\" (parodied BEFORE this movie in galaxy quest)? Double life sentence.Moronic love story - poorly acted, written, directed? George Lucas may need the [unltimate]penalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the Razzy nomination for \\"worst film of the year\\"","review":"But it is still a bad movie. A previous reviewer felt this installment was the final nail in the coffin. While a strong statement, it has some truth.

This will be his downfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God, it was true","review":"If you're like me and don't \\"go to the movies\\", but wait for the DVD, you've heard all the criticism of II's acting/script/plot.

Regardless: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment to the original","review":"The best moment throughout the whole movie was when Yoda was fighting at the end. The rest was boring and had almost no action whatsoever. The computer graphics are amazing but the story is less than satisfactory. If it wasn't for the lifelike graphics, i would've given it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled again","review":"Once again, I have watched another Star Wars prequel, and regret it. This episode, like Episode I, does not hold a candle to the three films that elevated Star Wars into its place in fantasy film. These are dramatic embarassments, full of poorly staged scenes, wooden acting, inappropriate dialog, and wasted talent. The special effects are spectacular, and there are perhaps two sequences worthy of the series, but otherwise this is 2+ hours of leaden filmmaking. The next installment will surely seem more forced, like more of an exercise, than either of the first two. I will probably watch it, hate myself for having fed the gaping maw of Lucasfilms yet again, and so it goes. Luckily, Episode III should end this litany of painful prequel experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't tell the difference between this and dumb and dum","review":"Oh yeah, dumb and dumber was supoosed to be funny. I'm a huge huge fan of Star Wars. But why I bought this after having already seen and hated it is quite beyond me. Probably for references, but boy oh, this movie sucked.

There was plenty of battle scenes and lots of lightsaber duels, my favourite was when Anakin was dueling it out with Dooku with both sabers. The only thing I did not like about this movie were those mindless droids (\\"Roger, roger!\\") that were no match for Anakin or Obi-Wan's Jedi skills. I thought that Hayden's acting in this movie was convincing.This movie might not be liked by all Star Wars fans, but I still found it a good movie to the collection.Below are my ratings for these actors:Hayden Christiensen: 3/5Ewan McGregor: 4/5Natalie Portman: 4/5Ian McDiermad 3/5Anthony Daniels 2/5Ahmed Best (Jar Jar) 1/5Christopher Lee 3/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad could this get","review":"star Wars Attack of the Clones was really dissapointing. I went to go see it in movie theaters when it first came out. I think Star Wars nation was pretty upset about this one. The worst thing about ti was it seemed more like a romance then anything. Anakin cryed like a baby the whole stinkin time and he was very inmature and just so annoying. I gave it two stars because I am a Star Wars fan, it was good in sourround sound, and the last thirty minutes was actually decent. I'm sorry I have to critisice this product so much. Just buy it because it is part of the Star Wars saga. Besides that this was just a poor effort by a great director who is George Lucas. God bless you and have a wonderful day and make sure you go see a good Star Wars movie that is out right now which is Episode three Revenge of the Sith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still better then Episode I","review":"Since there was less Jar Jar binks in the movie, only just about 5 minutes if that, but i really hate Jar Jar, it made for a much better Star Wars. Hayden Christenson was a little wooden as Aniken but from the trailers from Episode III looks like he grew into the role. But the best part in the movie is when Yoda and Count Dukoo through down, when Yoda walked in and gets his light saber out i had goosebumbs on my arms, another good addition to the Star Wars franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Star Wars movie yet","review":"Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars movie yet. I really don't understand all the people who are bashing the movie. They complain about how cheesy the dialogue and love story is, but in reality, the dialogue is no worse than some of lines in, say, The Empire Strikes Back. The plot is captivating, and keeps building up in intensity until the finale at the end. This movie is definitely worth getting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Star Wars they ever made","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was cardboard, and totally [unbelievable]. If you wanna go see a really good action movie in theaters, with really good acting, and hot stars, try Bourne Identity, or Minotity Report, or Spider-Man. Star Wars was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical Teen Movie Set in Space","review":"Ok, it is star wars. The origional Star Wars movies set a standard in which every other Sci-Fi movie has since tried to break. The acting wasn't amazing, but everything else about it was way ahead of its time. Ok, now, the past two star wars movies have been horrible. They completly ride on the legacy of the origional movies, and have nothing new or origional to offer.The writing first of all leaves much to desire, the romance aspect of this film seems inferior to grocery store Romance Novels.

Don't bother seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is great!!!","review":"I don't understand the negative talk about \\"AOTC\\"! This is a great movie and definately a must have movie. It isn't anywhere close to the original three and is marred somewhat by the lame execution of the love story and ocassional script weaknesses but overall, it's much better than \\"Phantom Menace\\" by a long shot!

TERRIBLY. My grade over all (the whole trilogy) (F) it's just to over rated. To much."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh man--","review":"this has got to be the second worst movie ever created by man. a bad B movie that is supposed to be an A but really hovering around E-. it is close, but i still think the first movie was even worse than this one, EP1 the absolute worst movie ever! but EP2 is the worst in the category of love scenes-- the writing and acting is so atrocious that there really are no words in the english language that can describe how bad it is. not just painful to watch, but startlingly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Rocketman!","review":"Well, if you are a Star Wars fan, then you no doubt loved this movie. Me, on the other hand, think the opposite. I REALLY didn't like this movie. Anakin Skywalker is now a whiny, annoying, brat, who complains at every turn, and it's hard to see him turning into the Darth Vader of the original Star Wars. When this was made, it's like they tried TOO HARD to keep it consistent with the original films. For example, Yoda talks in reverse-sentences at every chance he gets, not only that, but he enjoys pointing out the obvious to the audience (\\"Clone war begun it has\\"). The scene where Yoda fights that one guy is ridiculous, this is a movie for children. Ewwwww, bad movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy...","review":"Well, this movie was pretty bad. Yes, the CGI was acceptable, but not the top tier compared to what is out there right now. Forget the actors; they were limited in what they brought to the screen.All in all, just sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING","review":"SIMPLY ASTONISHING!!!!!!!

I take fencing and I still couldn't follow their movements in the lightsaber duel! WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor has no clothes","review":"A dismal failure on almost every level imaginable. Even the eye-popping special FX in this film aren't enough to overcome the threadbare plot, terrible acting, zero chemistry between the romantic leads, and a mind-bogglingly bad script (which may contain the worst dialogue in cinema history, including anything by Edward D. Wood Jr.). When I saw this in the theater, the audience was literally rolling on the floor laughing during the romantic scenes, and bored during much of the rest. The only way to view this movie is as an unintentional comedy suitable for MST3K treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope revived!","review":"I was hesitant about seeing this movie.After watching the fiasco we call Episode 1, I pretty much lost faith in the Star Wars movies. This movie (Episode 2) restored my faith and surpasses the quality of the older Trilogy.The actors are extremely talented and leaving nothing to be desired! Hayden Christensen (as Anakin)has an extremely tough role to play with is character going back and forth between extreme hate, and his not-so-new-found love. He pulls it off smashingly! Natalie Portman (as Amidala) does equally well playing the \\"hard shelled\\" senator.Great action (have to love the Yoda fight scene), humor, and of course, romance make this a film you'll want to see again and again. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST movie ever!!!!","review":"This was the best Star Wars movie in my opinion. I think Hayden and Natalie did a wonderful job. They can't help it that other people just can't tell the difference between good acting and bad. If you don't like the movie, don't get on here and diss it and try to get others who will enjoy the movie to not watch it. Also, don't try to look it up, just forget you saw it and go back to your movies that you like. The tale of this movie is really making people want to see Star Wars III. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Yoga's fighting was the funniest part of the movie and had everyone laughing and cheering. I saw this movie three times and plan on buying it as soon as possible. My family and I can't wait to buy the movie and continue this amazing story from a galaxy far, far away. Thank you George Lucas for giving us the beginning and a story with Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Lucas has lost it!","review":"I give it 5 stars because all 6 films are one story and 4,5,and 6 rock!!! 1,2,and probably 3 are insults to the originals.

BUT REALLY -- the young actors were very unskilled, Anakin mostly seemed like he was embarrased by his lines (a reasonable response) and to be fair, is probably much too young to carry a transition from good guy to bad guy at all convincingly (he could have used some help from the writers). The plot was probably there before the left most of it on the cutting room floor.The force is hardly ever talked of or used, and Yoda at one point alludes to the diminishing power of the Jedi -- this would have made a great plot element, whay was it not developed?Over all, too many special effects, too little story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not","review":"Keep real yo. This movie did not! I am , like, never waiting in line for another ridiculous movie again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad!","review":"I cant remember if it was here or elsewhere that I gave Star Wars Episode 1 a one star review or whatever. I do know that Ep1 was one of the WORST dissapointments in a movie in my entire life.Obi-Wan is the only person with tallent in the entire movie. I feel that the movie was based too much on politics and there wasn't enough action until the last fourty minutes or so. If you are a star wars geek (UNLIKE me) you will have to get this because you're a star wars geek! If you are like me and just get good movies, then skip on this. The only real reason that I upped this rating a knotch is because of Patame's (Natale Portman's) GREAT looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah!! this really sucked!","review":"This was worse than Phantom Menace. This film had no spirit to it whatsoever. The acting was horrible, the plot didn't flow, the dialog was shallow, the action scenes were senseless and overly gawdy, and Yoda's light saber scene was a joke. The only thing memorable about this movie was the scene where Anakin finds his captive mother. I can't really remember much anything else. There should have been more of the scene where Anakin proceeds to slaughter the tribe that captured his mother.It's a darnshame, but this series has really gone downhill. I am not looking forward to Episode 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disapointed","review":"Ratings:1. Special Effects=102. Directing=23. Plot=34. Acting=4Hmmm....well, at least it was visually stunning. I think to stand out these days, you need to have a good plot and at least decent acting. The audience has to care about the characters and what will happen to them (Basic movie requirement). None of this is present here. There are already a ton of movies with special effects, so standing on that alone just doesn't cut it.In the future, Lucas can be head of special effects, but that's about it!And please, use the acting talent available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars Episode II","review":"The system does not allow the option of selecting no star, so I am forced to give one to this HD video. So far the more parts there are of a movie the worse it gets, and unfortunately this is also true for the Star Wars saga.Episode two even more then Episode one seriously suffers from lack of story. The attempt to give the multiple action CGI sequences credibility through the construction of an incomplete political back story fails entirely. The reasons for the featured clone war are barely apparent, and the lack of a real antagonist in both new episodes does not make it easier to detect a story line. Maybe part three will make greater sense, once Anakin turns into Lord Vader, even though there is little hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT \\"Like New\\"","review":"Star Wars II was advertised as \\"like new\\". This is the first \\"like new\\" item that I have purchased through Amazon that was not as expected. The first Disk has a few slow points, and it is a little fuzzy sometimes. The 2nd disk (special features) was virtually un-watchable; it stalled and could not be fast forwarded or replayed. Both disks were well worn: not at all \\"like new\\". I would classify this DVD as Fair. I do not watch Special Features on DVDs often, but I like to view them at least once. If I don't get a better replacement, I will stick with this one so that I have the Star Wars set complete. I ordered another DVD from this supplier, but I have not watched it yet--it does look very well worn, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special effects can never save a bad movie.","review":"I saw this movie shortly after it was released, and even though I was starved for entertainment, this failed to satisfy. In all fairness, the special effects were great, but the movie was severely hampered by poor dialouge, and an even more moronic story. To my great fortune, I've only had to endure viewing this bomb twice (not by choice), but I urge anybody that was a fan of the original not to waste hard earned cash on this sorry excuse of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the only thing i liked about this film was christopher lee","review":"christopher lee's tall ominous performence of count dukoo was the only thing good about an other wise stupid film. though i doubt the old man could have done all the stunts without a double. the rest of the film is really bad acting by natalie portman and a sappy romantic subplot that makes me want to vomit.

Who the hell is the guy playing the part of Anikin? Did he ever hear of the word ACTING? Is he here only because of some unknown nepotism? God, this non-actor can't even speak, he mumbles every line given to him, looks totally overwhelmed throughout the film & manages to bring all of the other performers down to his level. Ms Portman, what happend to your acting skills? I've seen your work in earlier films and you have always managed to impress me. Not here. In the professional you were a young kid that seemed wise & old for your age, in this, whatever you call it, you appear to be older, yet striving to act like a toddler. Very disapointing. Not recommended if you're older than 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the Universe happened to Star Wars?","review":"Star Wars is not what it used to be. In the good old Star Wars days there were intesting characters like Hon Solo: Greedy and still a hero. The dialogue was snappy, but it didn't sound like something from a seventy five scent joke book? Remember the action? The actors actually looked like they were fighting their opponents not square dancing with their lightsabers. R2D2 used to be more than a tin can on wheels; he had what I call a personality. The story was a little cliché in places; but it wasn't down right corny. For the most part it was fast paced: bang, bang, bang. Now it's slow as Yoda with a broken leg. The characters used to be charasmatic, all out guys not bums that walked on stage and said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, I thought so, can I shout myself in the butt now?\\" It used to be funny without begging, crying, and scratching for laughs with stupid characters and ridiculous situations. Star Wars used to be fun without being Barney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas should pay me for renting this...","review":"I am amazed that George Lucas can so easily display the obvious contempt he has for his fans by this meager effort. The dialogue is infantile, the acting non-existant. The principal characters, who could just as easily be walking down the corridors of any junior high school emote nothing - they just read through their lines like the immature kids they are. Ironically, the computer generated aliens are better actors than the humans. Like I say... Episode I was barely OK (nothing to compare with Episodes 4, 5 and 6), but I won't waste time looking for episode 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"STARS WHAT?","review":"Please, can somebody tell me what's going on here? This is sheer [junk], really, I'm not joking!Don't go get It with any expectations at all, the main character, Anakin, is terrible, didn't he get any actor's course before this? He only makes faces, oh, of course, several teenager girls were hooked on him, as they are hooked on every single pretty face that is on the spotlight, what saddens me is that George Lucas used this guy NOT because of his talent as an actor (Unless he's blind and def) but because of his potential in forming a romantic pair.I couldn't help remembering what romantic pairs wrere all about in the times of Princess Lea, who was fortunate enough to act with Mr.Harrison Ford.If I were George Lucas, I would have sticked to the trilogy and forget about this piece of sh....Maybe, If he's clever enough, he'll let Steven Spielberg do what he wants and direct the third and last part of this charade they insist in calling ''stars wars''."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 13 year old reviewer","review":"One of George Lucas's many masterpieces! Star Wars episode II attack of the clones describes the events before Luke and Leia.It consists of the training of Anikan, his love for Padme, and great fight scenes with incredible digital effects!

II is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN","review":"Star wars attack of the clones is the best movie ever!I like the Jango and Obi-Wan fight the most!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay!","review":"If you're really into Star Wars, then this is a must have to complete the entire set for when the 3rd one comes out. However, this isn't the best film in my opinion. I think that the original 4,5,and 6 were better than the new 1 and 2. I think that there's WAY TOO MUCH SPECIAL EFFECTS!!! Before in the originals, there were special effects, but they were more \\"home movie\\" kind of special effects. In this movie, I can't think of many scenes where there isn't something that's digitally animated. Now, that's good for LOTR and Matrix, but I think we should get back to the \\"home movie\\" kind of special effects. Other wise, this film is OKAY, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best of the Star Wars films.","review":"Fine and Much better follow up to The Phantom Menace plants the seeds of what is to come but lacks the conviction to take it forward to where it should be. It needed to be darker, and the love story needed more to make people believed that they were really in love. The script needed work as well, and I think a good rewrite could have been ordered if they took a little more time with what they were trying to do.I will say that its probably the best entry in the saga since \\"Empire\\" but it lacks that film's conviction to take it all the way home."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Movie the FANS Wanted","review":"There is so much to like about this movie, but you really have to be a die-hard Star Wars fan to enjoy it. George Lucas really gave the fans what they wanted, and the Saga is looking like it's back on course, after the strange cornicopa that was The Phantom Menace. Think back to the pre-prequal era. Didn't you WANT to see Yoda kick some butt? Didn't you WANT to see the origin of the Clones? Didn't you WANT to see the origin of Boba Fett? Didn't you WANT to see the CLONE WARS? Didn't you WANT to see Anakin and Obi Wan as student and mentor? Episode 2 gives the fans all this and more and I think most are just too WHINEY to accept the truth. Once Episode 3 is released I believe the tide will turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best STAR WARS movie after episode 4","review":"If you are expecting completely new movie and incredibly original scenario this is not it. But it is a wonderful star wars movie, although you are familiar with the story, the battles are wonderful. You get really into another time and galaxy. This was what star wars fans really waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"I remember the first day in December 2001, when the teaser trailer was first aired on German television (I was sticking to the screen between the first and second \\"Vader Breath\\").Just like The Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones seems to become that part of the trilogy where the good guys will have one hell of a hard time to make it through.Unlike some examples of bad opinions (and even worse grammar) about this movie, I do think that the Star Wars Saga is worth being watched from Episode 1 to 9 (which is the total length of Lucas' storyline).The story is expected to continue in May 2002? Well, I hope, that we do not have to wait much longer, until the second part of the bestscifi story ever made hits Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A second helping of crap.","review":"This film was more exciteing to some degree than the first, but again we get a cast of actors that has no chemestry and further more they look out of place in all the CGI meshing. This film was just another second helping of crap. Thank god Star Wars: The Clone Wars is out there to give Star Wars a good name, because these first 2 movies just make it all look like utter crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Not Great","review":"This movie has amazing visual effects, a beautiful score and imagination to spare. What it oh so disappointingly lacks is good acting. Natalie Portman is so painfully wooden...Lucas had better spend a lot of time rehearsing the actors on third one. It's funny, watching all the DVD features, it is so obvious Lucas has no interest in or respect for the acting process. This is why this movie and its prequel will be easily forgotten once the digital tools are put in the hands of someone who actually cares about actors as well. Like Peter Jackson. George Lucas is out of touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outstandingly Horrible","review":"Star Wars: Episode II was absolutely horrible. This movie delivers with an incredibly poor script, incredibly corny romance, and a boring and stupid story.This movie's story could have been much better, had they left out the romance (unless it was good) and thrown in a constant evil. One of the movie's problems was there was no true evil until the climax, and this bothered many people. ... The movie's only good quality was it's very well done special effects.The acting was disgusting. ...20 minutes into the movie I was wanting to go to an electronic store more then finish.Never see this movie. I am disgusted by my choice to waste [money] on a ticket to this movie. George Lucas has proven his movie skills are slipping away ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very wooden, stiff acting","review":"Just goes to show that no matter how many millions you spend on special effects, it doesn't add up to diddly squat if the acting isn't good.Where did they find this hayden christensen? a boy-band audition? Somebody send him to an acting class, please.I saw Episode II in the theaters on opening night, and people were actually laughing out loud at scenes that were meant to be dramatic because the acting was so silly.This movie is overall very average, felt like I was watching a cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stellar Disappointment","review":"What can I say. More importantly, how can I express my disappointment and do so kindly. George Lucas has lost sight with his most recent addition to the Star Wars saga. What was once a franchise predicated upon classic story telling, has been reduced to a mixed bag of overly embellished special effects. Wasn't it Mr. Lucas that stated that \\"A special effect without a story was a pretty boring thing\\"? Well George, it is time to start practicing what you preach. My suggestion! Put the laser blasters, and political overtones to bed. This franchise was perfect just the way that it was. Afterall, anything worth doing is worth doing right. Neither Episode I or II even come close to doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Special Effects, but George Can't Direct....","review":"This is a technically great movie, and it is KNOWN that the actors can act, but Lucas is sadly lacking in his Directoral abilities. Poor Pacing, Flat Acting, and built up expectations really make you wish this was a much better movie than it turned out to be.Where are the memorable Lines? All three of the first Star Wars movies had great one liners, LOTS of them. You'd be hard pressed to get more than a handful of good ones from Menace and Clones.George was out of the driver's seat for too long and it shows. Maybe he should have warmed up with something else before he tried to continue his epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it","review":"I too am a big fan of Star Wars however not a fanatical one that will say anything is great no matter how crummy. The love scenes were like a page from a bad romance novel..they should have been discreet and the dialogue less sappy. Also Hayden Christenson was only ok as Anakin, he seemed unable to truly portray the passion and conflict Anakin would have experienced. Admit it..the scene where he was having a nightmare was the worst acting you have seen.The audience would laugh at many points during the movie where you weren't supposed to laugh. The fight scene at the end barely saved it and even then it was inferior to the fight scene in Phantom Menace. We knew things were going downhill when they \\"redid\\" the originals and not in a good way. I still have high hopes for the third movie but Attack of the Clones is the weakest out of the entire Star Wars series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker. No chemistry between the stars.","review":"...AND PLEASE...Someone tell me what is the purpose for SAMUEL L. JACKSON?? All he does is walk around \\"looking concerned\\", but I can't quite figure out WHO or WHAT he adds to these films. The original trilogy with outdated special effects are classic.

Yoda is the only good part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Close to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK...Excellent movie","review":"This movie was like episode 4-6 was...finally! The Special Effects were awesome and the chemistry was superb! Alas, I will always hold the first 3 films made the best, but this one was awesome and I cant wait to buy it in November. This episode answered alot of questions we have from Episodes 4-6. Acting was great, the fights were awesome and I loved the love story and you can tell where Anakin is going to go...I loved the scene with Anakin and Obi-One in the speeder chasing that chic...that was great and the lightsabers scenes...THIS IS A DEFINANT MUST-SEE FLICK AND I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yoda Fight","review":"I agree with what was said about the Yoda fight scene: It could have been longer, but I have a thought on that of my own. I think that, since the Yoda fight scene was so short this time around, that there may be a longer fight scene in Star Wars Episode III. In \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", Yoda is fabled to be a Jedi Warrior. I think we get to see that in \\"Star Wars Episode III: The one that ties it all together\\". :-P Just had to throw that in there. Let's just hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunch of spoiled whiners","review":"Yes, there was a little corny dialog at times, but come on! If you can't look past that then your just plain too picky. This movie is fantastic! The visuals are stunning! The special effects are simply awesome. Lucas and his team pulled off a tremendous feat and re-captured the epic feeling of the very first one back in 1977 which I saw when I was 15. Don't listen to the whiners who say this was a horrible film, they need to quit over-analyzing and re-learn how to enjoy a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 Stars...","review":"Episode 2 is the worse Stars Wars movie to date.

In Attack of the Clones, Lucas emphasises Anakin's rebellious streak in the most tactless, overdone way imagineable.

The movies, the toys, the products; you name it I've probably owned it at one time or another. However as big a fan as I am it really kills me to see what they've turned this once larger than life saga into. They turned a grand story into a background item for the sake of showcasing technology. The whole driving force behind the original Star Wars movies was a gripping well told story, this new chapter of the epic continues on the downward spiral of episode I. Bad acting + secondary story = bad movie. I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. Yes its the first completely digital movie but that doesn't improve on the movie itself, it just means that you can have a crystal clear view of the bad acting... steer clear from this stinker and lets hope that when they make episode III that they remember what made the first movies in the series so memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the Clones-All Flash no Body","review":"Just saw Star Wars Attack of the Clones and I am terribly sadly disappointed. Yes it was visually stunning but then it wasn't really anything sci-fi fans haven't seen before. No new ground just lots more of it. What really got me was how boring the dialog and the love story were. Everytime Padmae and Anikin were on screen talking about falling in love or talking about not falling in love time just stood still and went on forever. These people were not acting they were reading and reading badly.Yes all you geeked out Star Wars fans will love the movie and see it twice Im sure but anyone with a lil detachment to the whole Star Wars thing will be gravely disappointed.

I don't eat, live, and breathe Star Wars. That aside, I watched Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in the theaters because of all the hype surrounding the movies. Phantom Menace was good, but this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. I just watched the original trilogy, and was mesmerized by the effects and plots in the first 3 movies. I really wonder what George Lucas was thinking when this movie was made.This movie is nothing but a love story with some minor side plots. The last 30 minutes (where the Jedis fight) is the best scene in the movie, but the rest of the movie falls flat on its face.

This is just all that stuff over and over again. The ONLY segments of this film that are wirth the price of the film it's printed on are the spectacular Yoda-Fight-Scene, (Though slightly MNatrixised)and McGregors line about Death sticks.

God - I've NEVER been so bored !!! Went with a friend, and we both said that if we'd been sitting at the end of the aisle, we'd have left after 20-30 minutes. I'm trying to remember if there were any film cliches they left out - from Anikin rescuing his mother, her managing to make her dying speech and then snuffing it to one of the Jedi being killed SO easily (where did the force go ?) by the bounty hunter, who then proceeds to perform a wild western twirling of his gun, before returning it to its holster.Aaaaaarrrrrggggggghhhhh - DREADFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outclassed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\"","review":"I really wanted this movie to be great (everyone did).

The CGI were good.To be frank, The Lord of the Rings was everything I expected this movie to be-great plot, sense of evil, great effects, true emotion. The romance in clones was pretty wooden.So I will not purchase this dvd, but I already bought Lord of the Rings.

Padmé Amidala's role is much better, but what the hell motivates her to fall in love with Anakin? Can't support his mental health, much less the woman who becomes his wife. Anakin is definitely a candidate for schizophrenia meds if he actually thought that Amidala would fall in love with him. Lucas just needs equilibrium pills, because obviously just looking at the script must have made him incredibly sick. It would me. The Battle of Geonosis is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a grand finish and a show-stealer. Count Dooku's role is just a bit defunct, but not quite. After all, he needs to start the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"No movie in the box","review":"Big star wars fan and seemed to be missing this movie from my collection.

Damn that was retarded.I could go on and on, but I'll spare you all. This is a classic example of a perfectly good story being f'ed up to make 8 year olds laugh.I will say the special effects were great and the story does leave it open for a great III.

While not as stale and shallow as Phantom Menace, it reaches points only slightly higher. Lucas has allowed digital computer animation to overrun this film, and while we certainly expected some of the special effects magic, the movie relies on these scenes to carry the rest of the film. The acting is simply that bad. Natalie Portman is certainly attractive, but since when did a Star Wars film rely on outfits to embellish a figure and sell the film? Jackson & Christenson are horrible in this film; Lee gives probably the best performance. All in all, a poor film.

This is the reason movies should be made in the first place - captivating plot, good acting, good storyline.Almost everyone I know that has seen this movie has thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes, but they have cringed at some of the disgraceful acting and scriptwriting.

That's fine. That could be very interesting. However, when you have George \\"King of Cheese\\" Lucas writing and directing, it's unbearable. It looks like it's going to be Not Another Teen Sci-Fi Movie. Some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard was in this preview.I will not comment on the fact that N'Sync is going to be in this movie.

It's as if they filmed the first read the \\"actors\\" do to familiarize themselves with the script and the other \\"actors\\". The effects look like a Saturday morning cartoon! Dump most of the computer animation and bring back the model makers! The entire experience was depressing. The only good thing I can say about it is there's less Jar-Jar. You should avoid this clinker at all costs. If we keep encouraging them to make trash like this by handing over our money they will be more than happy to oblige us.

I've read the scriptment, and it sounds like the movie is going to be an outstanding addition to the series. The story is engaging, and the character arks of Obi-wan and Anakin are probably the most visible, profound, and interesting in cinema history. People have had time to overcome the 're-introduction shock' that caused massive grumblings over TPM. Now, audiences have re-adjusted to accept new Star Wars story, and will be able to simply enjoy the continuation of the saga.I'm marking the days until AOTC hits my local Cinemark. Thanks, Lucas, for making such great flicks!-- JJ Timmins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatiful scenery, but lacks a sense of adventure","review":"Unfortunately it lacked a sense of adventure despite the definite beauty in the advance in digital technology.

The fight scenes between Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker with double light saber should've been stretched to 5 minutes longer. The camino should've been game and model builders who reconstructed armies from the past,in plain english,'Gamers'.

Lucus has not lived up to his standards. The movie is to love dramatic. My kids said they didn't like it at all. I found it hard to stay interested in the movie. I wanted more battles and action. The movie wonders to much from actor to actor. My wife took the kids and bought tickets to go watch Scooby Do. I have never got up from a Star Wars movie to get a drink, but I got up twice during this one. I wanted to see some of those great galatic battels. The whole movie seems to centered about love. The battle at the end between the Colnes and the Robots does not save the Movie. Yoda can hardly walk and he fight with his Light Saber like he from the Matrix. Technology does not help this movie. It has killed the feeling that the sceans are real.

Personally, I think he should have picked up the series with episode 7 and not gone back to episode 1. Lets face it, we all ready know how these are going to turn out, so where is the suspense, and if he had picked up with episode 7, not only would the stories be fresh, he could of had some of the old characters, at least in cameos. Attack of The Clones is not a terrible movie, it is certainly better than episode 1, and the special effects are terrific, but the dialogue is laughable at times, and does anyone really care about any of these characters? It is sad to think how great this series could have been compared to how it is turning out."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...there is no try\\" Well yeah, that's obvious","review":"All I can say about this movie is WOW, what a waste of film. It was even worse than Episode 1, and that's saying something. These are the things that screwed it up.1) The love story. I didn't pay 7 bucks for a movie ticket to watch a pacifst senator and the future Darth Vader make out on an island in a wetland for an hour. I hope that George Lucus goes bankrupt for that. He'd deserve it.2) The acting. It was the worst acting that i've EVER seen. It was so bad, i can't even explain it. See for yourself.3) The corny lines. \\"The sand is corse, but you're smooth all over.\\" Huh?4) Jar Jar Blinks. Even after the Phantom Menace failure, Lucus STILL put him in, and even made him a Naboo senator! If I were Lucus, I would have had that speech challenged slug killed by some droid in Naboo during Episode 1.All in all, this movie is terrible. Instead of buying this, go out and get a good movie, namely, the original Star Wars movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise of the Empire.","review":"I will keep this short. AOTC was awesome. Just saw it last night. I was totally blown away and was not expecting what I saw. It was everything that TPM wasn't. Its a complete 180 degree turn from TPM. It ties in nicely with ESB & ROTJ. You get to see the Emperor, find out a little of how Anakin turns into a machine, and the music. We get to hear Darth Vader's theme music, as well as the Emperor's, and all the great Star Wars music that was not in TPM. It makes you drool for Episode III, but I guess we will have to wait three years. I hope we get to see how Darth Vader gets his full body armor, helmet, and breathing machine. I can't wait for this movie on DVD. A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATE Star Wars...!","review":"...I wasn't supposed to like this movie! I really, really TRIED to hate this movie! It was no use. SW2 is amongst the greatest movies I've seen, seriously!I hated the origional, so I had NO intentions of seeing this one. But my brother finally got me to go.Now apparantly, this movie is better if you haven't seen the recent SW1. Everyone was complaining that it took too long to get started, but I hadn't, so all of the initial time was very informative. I got to know the characters and understand the plot. Afterwards, it leaves you begging for more. So now, I'm going to have to see Episode 3. It really is as good as everyone keeps saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAHHH!!!! IT BURNS!!!!","review":"Geez! Talk about downhill! Episode I was good, and even the original trilogy wasn't bad, but this...This just isn't fair! When I walked into that movie theater, I was all prepared for droids' heads getting chopped off and whirling lightsabers, not mushy goo-goo kissy stuff. It was disgusting! I mean, excuse me for noticing, but even if a Star Wars movie had romance, it didn't dominate the movie. The only decent parts were the execution and the part where Yoda kicks butt. Other than that, this movie stunk. So, for all you kids who hate romance, avoid this movie like the plague. Save yourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for a science fiction movie.","review":"Normally I don't go for these kind of sci-fi action movies, but Attack of the Clones was surprisingly good. It had great special effects and very original characters in it, like the Genosians, whose language is the most creative thing I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie. It had some cliche moments in it, like the heros being forced to fight monsters in this big pit in front of all the inhabitants of an alien planet as a death sentence, the forbidden love thing, Jedi apprentices revolting against their masters, etc. etc. But it had a surprising amount of plot for a movie with so many gun/lightsaber fights. And seeing Yoda kick butt in a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku! WOW. EASILY one of the best moments in ANY of the Star Wars movies!!! I wasn't incredibly impressed with the acting, though. Yoda, Watto, Mace Windu and Obi Wan were the best characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the blocky subtitles?","review":"Fantastic picture and sound, the best. My complaint however, is whenever a non-english speaking character pipes up, the font looks like it's on a 320x240 screen. It's distractingly bad. I'm left wondering how that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible shame","review":"I think Lucas was just too big a man in Hollywood. Rather than a collaboration of talent as in the original trilogy, you get Lucas doing what he alone wanted, with nothing but yes-men and admirers to get advice from. A terrible shame. Probably the best of the prequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"shockingly bad","review":"I'm not a Star Wars fan but I've seen the rest of the series, and I expected Clones to be enjoyable. I got halfway through. I was appalled. If George Lucas is no longer interested, he should hand the project to someone else. The script is shockingly bad, high-school-project bad, and Lucas' direction is inexplicably amateurish. So unless you're an addict, be warned: stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I have to say this film was a total dissapointment. Yes it had specail effects, but it was boring and it seemed to have lost the plot.

First of all, once again lucas chose a horrid actor for anakin. Natalie Portman cannot act to save her life.

But the lightsaber duel was bad. Now i did enjoy yoda's lightsaber duel, but, people in the theater were laughing. Youre not supposed to laugh at a Star Wars movie, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful mess, and a shameless treatment of John Williams' music","review":"What a mess. The story is muddled, the acting is atrocious, and the film feels like a giant video game. But by far, the worst aspect of this film is the BLATANT REUSE of John Williams' music from 'Phantom Menace'. What Einstein thought of taking cue after cue of music from the first film and cutting and pasting into this film? As a huge Williams film, this RUINED substantial portions of the film for me, such as the Jedi arena battle sequence. I couldn't get into it, thinking that, \\"Hey, this is the music when they tried to gas Qui-Gon in the first film...\\"Shameless George. Shameless. You'd be NOTHING without Williams music, and you treated his music like reusable garbage in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek is better","review":"I just saw \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" on cable and can honestly say it blows away Phantom and Clones for three solid reasons:1.

Anakin and Amidala have no chemistry.The storyline is convoluted and hard to follow.The special effects are pretty but many of them are unnecessary. I liked the cantina creatures in the original movie just fine... why did they have to computer-generate so many of the new creatures? It's annoying.Sorry George...

There is lots of action, and it is fast-paced. I like the music, too. On the nine tracks, you can get damaged by crashing or by being hit by a powerup. When your car is severely damaged, black smoke comes out of your car and its performance suffers. You can collect powerups by driving over them, and some of them can be fired at other racers to cause damage and slow them down. There are 18 cars total, with 6 for each of on-road, off-road, and dragster. They all have different top speed, acceleration, handling, and toughness. I like the tracks a lot. My favorite tracks are the Foundry and Red Creek Cavern. The best cars are Dune Striker, Tremor, Torq Racer, and Pulse Concept. This game has lots of action. You could be 1st one second, then two seconds later, you could be 6th just by getting hit by a RC missile or a Hatchet. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie, funny.","review":"Dark subject matter, def should be rated R. But funny. Love the part about reenactors.

I guess that was their attempt at making it more realistic?I thought I would be cracking up the whole time based on the trailer but it was not what I would call a comedy.

He has one chance to escape his life and really be free of his family. However things quickly go wrong when he decided to help his mom buy drugs from a drug dealer Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).For a film about drugs abuse it really rather tame. Even Tracy Morgan was subdued somehow. The film has its great points however and you see a micro back story of each character that Eli has come to interact with. This helps Eli see them has people and not just \\"f ups\\" has he calls them in the movie. I wish the film just had a little more. If so maybe it could have done better but for a rental I give it 2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surprise","review":"Just stumbled on \\"Why Stop Now\\" and thought it was great. Totally quirky comedy which never gets pedantic and seldom loses its sense of humor. Eisenberg is perfect for the part of Eli, and even brings a new sort of boldness to the table in this role that I don't recall seeing in his previous characters. The drug dealers (Tracy Morgan and Isiah Whitlock Jr.) were hilarious. For me the comedy really came through in the banter between these two who took over many of the scenes they were in. I didn't know what to expect of this one, but really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cast that flexes its acting muscles","review":"It's a delight to see the members of this cast flex their acting muscles. Eisenberg and Leo are wonderful in their total lack of self awarness when it comes to their mutual craziness, and it's great to see Morgan acting somewhat like a normal but still funny human being (he's a drug dealer yet more stable than the others)rather than whatever it is he's playing on the more well-known 30 Rock.

When Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) discovers that a powerful lord is insane, the lord's retainers decide to kill him for fear of the consequences should he reveal the fact. As Ichi says later, all they had to do was ask him to keep it quiet and he would have. However, dishonorable men expect only dishonorable behavior from everyone, so they see murder as the only solution. At the same time, a foe from Zatoichi's past appears to complicate matters.This movie has more going for it than just great action, although it certainly has plenty of that. Zatoichi is a genuinely likeable character and the climactic battle has some real emotional heft to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel to the first Zatoichi DVD","review":"After watching and enjoying the first Zatoichi DVD, I decided to buy the second installment.

In fact a mysterious rival from his past turns up. We are also treated to more of Shintaro Katsu's excellent swordmanship which is even better in this movie than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Fly High Coloring This Book","review":"This is a very easy book to color and a lot of fun.

Much more difficult getting the wiring to where you want it. Just cut the hole and there are 'posts' that swing over to clamp onto the wall. Screw down and it's done.Only gripe is that you have to take off the wire grill to get to the screws, and you need to use a paperclip to do this. It was kind of a pain and I deformed some of the grating getting it off. Can't really tell once it's far away (on the ceiling) though.I have a big room w/ tile and couldn't set up bookshelf speakers in good location. The sound from these blows away the speakers I was trying to use. Sound is rich and full. I mainly use it for surround sound when listening to movies/playing games, and I can definitely hear thing I never noticed (gravel crunching, rain falling, etc). Very happy with these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality adequate at best","review":"I bought the Polk RC 80i speakers for a multi-room sound system in my home. If you like classical music, where crispness and full range fidelity are important, this is not your speaker. Highs are muddy, and lows are virtually non-existent. Mid-range is adequate. I have owned Polk Audio floor speakers, and these are in no way comparable. I did a side-by-side test with some M&K S125 home theater speakers, and the Polks sounded washed out and flat by comparison. For low volume, background music these speakers are okay, but audiophiles--or those who know what a good quality speaker should sound like--will not be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"These are installed in my bathroom.

The speakers have a neat little clip for easy mounting in a drywall ceiling. The templates provided are accurate and easy to use. Took about ten minutes each to install. I spent much more time running the wires through my attic, but I obviously cannot blame that on the speakers. Now that they are installed, all I can say is wow. The sound is crisp and clear. The aimable tweeters gives you a lot more flexibility in your mounting location. As with any speaker, sound is a matter of personal preference. I have noticed that these speakers seem to impress people that are a little older (like mid 30's and up) more than the younger crowd. I suspect it is because the younger ears can hear the higher frequencies better. I have always enjoyed the crisp highs that I have gotten from Polk Audio. Once again they have been able to impress me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for the size","review":"These are greats speakers for the price, much better bass than the 6\\" pair. I built my own speaker boxes to sit on top of these speakers in the ceiling, about 16\\" square, made of 1/2\\" MDF, and lined with 1\\" high-density foam. Without such a box, much of the sound will be lost in the ceiling cavity. You may not need to do this if you're installing in a residential location in an insulated cavity with wood studs."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than pleased with the RC80i and RC60i","review":"I purchased these last December, 2007 from Amazon and after all these months I have been completely satisfied with the Polk Audio brand.

I never did anything like this before and I'm completely amazed of the outcome. You can't go wrong with the template, just make sure you go in the attic and clear out any insulation that might fall on you.This was my setup for the home theater and my wife and I are completely happy with the sound, look, and would purchase Polk Audio again.Front: RC80iSurround: RC60iBack Surround: RC60iCenter: CS1Sub: PSW505"},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"got 2 pair in the ceiling===my friends cant tell the difference between them and others that cost 3 times as much== very happy with sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speakers, excellent value","review":"As long as you have an adequate receiver to push these things, they will definitely deliver.

Installation was much easier because the large, 8\\" opening you cut into the wall/ceiling makes it much easier to fish speaker wire. The mounting brackets securely fasten to the wall so there is no shaking or rattling. The tweeter can easily pivot to aim at your listening position. These are voice matched to the Polk \\"Monitor\\" series speakers, so match with any other RC series in-wall speaker, CS1 or CS2 center channel speaker, and PSW10 or PSW12 subwoofer.My only 2 complaints, which were not enough to drop the rating, are:1) The speaker cutout template turned out to be a tad small, and I had to go around with a keyhole saw again to make it 1/8\\" larger to fit the speaker all the way. That made it a little messier, but it ended up fine.2) The speaker grill is pretty hard to remove, but you only have to do that once, and you want it to fit snugly anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I shopped around for similar speakers at local shops and places like Best Buy and Circuit City.

I returned the pair of speakers.I later ordered a pair of Pioneer S-IC831-LR ceiling speakers. Although the sound quality is not as good as I have expected, it is basically on par with the speakers of the low-end Sony mini shelf system: the lower frequency part is not as good, but the sound is more clear for the Pioneer speakers.

Second, I enjoy good quality sound, but I'm also not dumb enough to take out a second mortgage to get it. They are a great compromise for someone on a budget, yet wants something more than the cheap speakers can offer. They are much better than what I had.I like them so much, I'm thinking about installing in-wall speakers for the front and center too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ceiling Speakers","review":"I have these installed on my basement ceiling as my home theater front and back surround speakers. They are perfect for their purpose. Amazon's price was much better than local retail stores, plus free shipping and no sales tax. Can't beat that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid product","review":"We have installed four of these in a home theatre setup. They are well made, they were easy to install and look great in the ceiling. Sound quality appears excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"These speakers look great and sound great. I bought 4 sets of these to fill the house with. Super simple to install. Almost impossible to screw up installation. The speakers put out great sound and the adjustible angle of the tweeters make customization of sound easy. I would certainly buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops! Too many.","review":"I built a 16x20 detached garage with an upstairs office space. I put two pairs upstairs. One pair is PLENTY. These things rock- I don't normally listen to hip hop, but Devil's Night was playing a set, and the bass is spectacular. You can aim the tweeters to reflect better, which is highly recommended. Not sure about the grill criticism- they aren't difficult to take out for me. How often are you doing that really? Regardless, easy installation, pretty good price, and great sound for this guy- definitely good on the bass, but you may want to play with tweeter orientation to get the most from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polk In-Wall Speakers RC60i","review":"Great sounding speakers and very easy to install.

Great speakers.","review":"My buddy told me these were very easy to install. He kept telling me what a smart design the locking mechanism is. They sound great. The Omni directional tweeters make up for any problems that might arise from less than ideal speaker placement due to shape of your A/V room. My ceiling is textured white, so these speakers almost disappear until you turn them on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polk RC80i","review":"Great speakers.

They sound great I put another pair in a second room in the basement - Two speakers really fill a 12 x 14 basement room. I placed a scrap piece of insulation over the top to direct the sound down and keep the noise down on the next level. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"I've got these in the ceilings throughout my house along with some RC850i's in the walls and they're excellent speakers. I have them rigged set up in a two channel setup powered by the Yamaha rs-700. They can handle a good deal of power when needed but they sound great for normal tv viewing at normal listening levels. Frequency response is great. I'm very happy with them and I highly recommend them. Great price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"These are used as the surround left and right with Martin Logan MLT-2 speakers. They match well and work great. The adjustable tweeters are a great idea and really helps with some flexibility with placement. They sound quite good for the price paid ($90/pair)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"I installed these in my basement workshop, where I have no room for speakers, but wanted to hear music without adding stuff to the room. The mounting system for these is poorly explained in the manual, but actually quite easy to achieve once you figure out how it works. Once I had them installed, I was quite impressive with the audio quality, while keeping in mind that these are only $100 for the pair--you're not going to get high end sound at this price point. I plan to buy another pair and look at some higher end Polk built-ins for other applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound , easy to install, wrong mechanical info","review":"Tried to install on my dry wall ceiling (7cm from a concrete ceiling) and discovered that the speaker depth is not like published online (nor in the documentation that came with the product).Finally after a failure to carve in the concrete ceiling, I used a with sponge to extract the speaker 12mm from the ceiling.Other than that surprise, the installation when OK and the sound is great (for surround speaker)The price is fare.All in all this product is positioned well on the value/cost axis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good surround speakers","review":"I've had these speakers for about a year now. They're high quality, easy to install, and pretty decent sound. These are good surround speakers. You have to remember that when you set your expectations for their sound. They work well and I haven't had any problems out of them, but they're pretty limited in their sound field. They do the job well for surround speakers, but if you have powerful towers, you may want to consider the 8\\" version of these. These have served me well, but at times get a bit overpowered by the front 3 speakers and the sub.Again, no real complaints. Good quality, decent sound, but just remember you're buying a 6.5\\" speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a bunch of verbs","review":"I don't know how those 501 verbs books work for all those other languages available right now, but I suppose I expected this book to show different types of verbs in Tagalog AND explain how they are used.

I was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a tribute","review":"As I understand it this is not a tribute. The story that I heard was that George Benson, amongst others was appearing at a Jazz Festival (Montreaux?). Rudy van Gelder invited George to his home/studio whatever along with other musicians to record an impromptu set as was his want, and the only music that they had with sufficient copies to go around was Abbey Road. It is a great album and one that I had from when it first came out - I much prefer this earlier George - he was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and commercial","review":"I love Don Sebesky's arrangement of \\"Day in the Life\\" with Wes. I had known about this record for years and always wondered what it sounded like, so I downloaded the MP3 album. Turns out, wondering was better than hearing. The arrangements of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Oh, Darling\\" and \\"Something\\" are really lugubrious, and the string quartet is scored with particularly trite jazz harmony. There is none of the light quality of the Beatles' originals. Sure, the rhythm section and the blowing sound nice on \\"Come Together\\" and \\"She's So Heavy\\", but it's not that hard to make minor blues sound good.This record sounds less like a serious attempt to interpret the Beatles than a novelty album neither the players nor the arranger really enjoyed making."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff","review":"well it's George Benson.

Buddy shreds like no one else can and heavily influences my playing style. All tracks are enjoyable. My favorite being \\"Sally\\" and \\"Feels Like Rain\\".

I had to have one of his albums and the one song, Mustang Sally in one of my favorites. Do enjoy the Jazz and all that stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddy IS the Guy","review":"This is a pretty good collection from Buddy. It's definitely a good 'intro' to Buddy if you want a good mix of his various moods. 'You're damn right I got the blues' is a great opener, and sets the tone for the following tunes. 'While you were stepping out' is one of my personal favorites on this one, as Buddy shows off his voice as well as guitar chops (and he has plenty). He and Jonny Lang have a good duet, along with traded solos on 'Midnight Train'. Jeff Beck steps in for 'Mustang Sally'...and you can tell when he kicks in. A great cd for any Buddy fan, or a great ice-breaker for those looking to get into his vast collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Buddy's Baddest\\" is one of Buddy's best.","review":"This is a great blues album from Buddy. It really highlights his vocal range and expertise with the guitar. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Blues","review":"If you like blues you'll like Buddy Guy.

Josh Gordon clearly and effectively presents 20 different classic, difficult behaviors, including everything from \\"The Client Who Lies to You\\" to \\"The Client Who Knows It All.\\" Gordon offers useful strategies for dealing with such personalities and situations, strategies that can help you make your sale and then make a clean getaway. The book is written conversationally and includes no filler or fluff, just plenty of well-organized and helpful ideas.

It is full of delightful characters and clever jokes.Set 20,000 years ago at the time of the last Ice Age, a wooly mamoth (Ray Romano) meets Sid (John Leguizamo), a sloth, and they become an odd traveling pair. They find a helpless, cute human infant and decide to return the baby to its human herd. A saber-tooth tiger who is stealthy and cunning joins them because they are searching for a human herd, which means food to eat. Eventually the motley crew bond as they travel through the cold rough territory, facing challenges successfully together. Then there is always the charming side-plot of a fanged squirrel trying to keep an acorn under control. The movie is entertaining, warm-hearted and not too long. Ice Age reminded me a bit of \\"Monsters Inc\\", however, it keeps an original feel, has funny jokes and exciting adventure that the whole family can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Age","review":"Good price and fast delivery...The product was in very good condition.

It's not too scary and quite entertaining. The voices of the animals are funny and the overall movie teaches a good lesson. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story for all ages","review":"Ice Age is a wonderful fill about an ADORABLE human baby and three wonderful animals' quest to return him to his family. One of its themes (yes, it really did have themes, even though it was animated and funny) was that babies should not be blamed for the sins of their parents -- and one of the animals was willing to set aside the most awful injustice imaginable (the killing of his wife and child -- animated in cave paintings and one of the truly most heartbreaking scenes I had EVER seen) in order to save this little baby and return it to the people who had deprived him of his own family. Most of all, it was about how three unlikely friends came together to do the right thing, despite the unfiarness in the world. Oh how I love this film. I am still enjoying the memory of having seen it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as I hoped","review":"This movie was not quite as good as I hoped. My husband and I bought it for our son thinking he would really enjoy it. My husband and son hated this movie. My animal loving little boy actually walked out of the room -- not a good sign!

Ah, you should try to watch this movies in all the languages, its very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"This movie was a lot of fun. I saw this with three adults and two kids and we all loved it. Not brilliant like Shrek, but no major drawbacks -- a pretty good DVD to share with the family. The best character is \\"Scrat\\", the squirrel that shows up at the beginning and end and parts in between. He is simply hilarious with his quest for the acorn - wish there was more of him. Visually this movie was very appealing as the Ice Age and interesting animals provided lots of fodder for the animators. Loved Ray Romano in this too, as the voice of the mammoth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really very enjoyable.","review":"Initially I just kinda' liked it... it had people whose comedy I sometimes enjoyed in it and it was pretty funny. Now, however, after having seen it countless times because it is laugh-out-loud funny to my 2.5 year old, I can tell you it's really worth getting.Our toddler will giggle at everything that makes a 2 year old laugh... the squirrel getting trampled, the baby scenes, the football-watermelon-dodo bird scenes are hilarious to us both.. there's more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old daughter quotes this movie from memory","review":"The kids are the best to review animated movies, and my daughter has all of the great one on DVD.

I bought this knowing it was a very funny movie no matter what age you are. I didn't really look at the case before buying, I just bought it. I was VERY surprized to see there was another disk in the DVD case. The first disk includes the movie in widescreen and fullscreen modes, as well as Dolby 5.1 sound. The video quality is absolutly great, even on my Mac monitor it looks GREAT. The sound is very good with the 5.1 and during some scenes you will feel surrounded. The second disk is a GREAT extra disk. It comes with all the usual stuff (making of, art, ect.) but also includes a hilarious short movie about a character from the full length movie named \\"Scratch\\". I give this DVD 5 solid stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very silly. A major disappointment.","review":"Considering it got such great reviews and was nominated for an Oscar, this animated film was a major disappointment. The main characters are Manfred (a mammoth), Sid (a sloth), and Diego (a saber-tooth). Diego? Anyway, they're on a quest to return a human infant to its migrating tribe. Manfred is the staunch and kindly leader, Sid is the comic relief, and Diego is the bad-guy predator turned good-guy protector of the innocent. And that's basically it. Much of the action involves patient plodding through the snow and there's way too much dreary and not very funny conversation. And some unanswered questions, like why is Manny headed back north when all the other animals are migrating south? The moral lessons lack even basic subtlety, which doesn't help, either. _The Incredibles_ and _Shrek_ were ten times better than this, and _Toy Story_ was twenty times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was pretty good","review":"I only saw part of this but it never failed to be very, veryfunny and never failed to have a touching story"},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny","review":"This movie was really funny.

My second favorite would be Scrat because he is funny also and he is trying to put his Acorn in a safe place. My third favorite would have to be Diego because hes the coolest one and my least favorite would have to be Manny because he doesn't really act cool. The main plot in the movie is the Baby ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"There are a couple of things wrong with this movie. For one, am I the only one who thinks the animation in this movie looks cheap compared to even Pixar's first efforts? The mammoth hair, the tiger's face, the lava, the snow... where's the detail? It looks like it was spray-painted on. The sloth and the squirrel didn't look too bad, though. I guess Pixar has spoiled us to some extent.For another, the story and plot are riddled with cliche, convention, contrivances, and slapstick. The target audience for this is probably something like 3-4 year olds, not adults. They won't notice the substandard animation or lack of originality.The squirrel was without a doubt my favorite character, especially during the charade bit, but he played only a small role. The behavior of the child is almost a carbon copy of the one from Monsters Inc, only not even close to being as cute and adorable as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"better and worse","review":"this is a strange film. it's both better and worse than some of the other animateds. there's more laugh-out-loud humor in 'ice age' than even the best animateds, like 'toy story 2' or 'monsters, inc'. but in between the laughs, there's too much dead time - the story almost dies when there isn't some slaptstick stunt. the graphics aren't so hot, either. i mean, what can you do with ice?! 'ice age' is worth a look, for both adults and kids, but don't expect another 'toy story 2'."},{"rating":"2","title":"ICE AGE IS REALLY COOL","review":"THIS MOVIE IS REALLY ENJOYABLE.

One would think Scrat was the lead character but he's lucky to have a full 10 mins of show time. Scrat is the hilarious squirrel/rat character that you see running around with an acorn.

The quality of the DVD is awesome! The sound is very very wide and loud and the picture quality, while its not as good as Monsters, Inc., it still looks very nice, the colors are bright and the darks are dark! The first disc is nice, lets just hope disc 2 satisfies! I will be watching disc 2 when I get the set for Christmas!The movie is all about a stranger herd of animals: Manny the Mammoth, Diego the Saber Tooth and Sid the Sloth. These three have to take a little baby who was saved by its own mother after Diego's friends try to kill it.

It's a shame they wasted their time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for the kids, but don't expect to learn anything","review":"When I saw the trailers for Ice Age, I was excited--prehistoric mammals are a favourite subject of mine, and here I saw them being showcased for once instead of dinosaurs. Instead (despite Roger Eberts's claim) this film is full of inaccuracies (sloths and Neandertal \\"cavemen\\" never met, for example; and don't get me started on the Dodos).To make matters worse, I was expecting humour in a similar vein to Shrek, as well as an equally entertaining soundtrack. Instead, it was insipid and dull, and the kids were barely even amused (except Scrat--he needed WAY more screen time). For paleo mammals, get the BBC's \\"Walking with Prehistoric Beasts\\". For entertaining animation for kids and adults, get \\"Bug's Life\\" or \\"Shrek\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well rendered but terribly written","review":"At first glance, it is apparent why Ice Age was so successful in theaters. The graphics are beautifully rendered, and the opening sequence is wonderful to watch. Unfortunately, at this point, the characters make the mistake of speaking and the viewer realizes that with them, only the graphics are three-dimensional. The characters are woefully unfunny, the plot derivative, and the pacing tedious.

This movie it is not the case! There is humor in it for everyone. The computer animation is amazing, and the storyline is appropriate. It also has a good moral without being preachy. Both me and my 6 year old enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie...so-so Bonus Features","review":"I saw this movie in the theater, and enjoyed it to a certain degree. It does lag in a few areas, but definatly worth seeing. Similar to 'Shrek', younger kids may/will enjoy it, but a lot of the laughs go to adults.The bonus features are only so-so. Not as much fun as other films in this genre (such as 'Shrek'). The 'Scrat's Missing Adventure' short was overhyped. It is not as humorous as it was made out to be. Another short film 'Bunny', is interesting, to say the least. It is hard to understand, without the commentary. It makes you think, 'Wow, that's interesting', and at the same time 'What were they thinking?'.The rest of the bonus features really are not anything worth mentioning, unless you really have too much time on your hands.Overall, the film is good. The 2-disc DVD seems a little of a waste, but the film is still worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older Kids","review":"This caters more to older kids, say 7 years old and up. Although kids younger than that may enjoy it, they may not enjoy it as much. A lot of the movie is dialogue-based, more so than similar movies that are more action-based (e.g., \\"Lion King\\", \\"Hercules\\"). So, the older the kids are, the better they may like it. That may also explain why so many adults like it.The plot is somewhat simple and a little predictable, but the good-guy / bad-guy lines and redemption of some bad-guys is uplifting.

I bought this for my daughter for Christmas as it was one of the movies she asked for. We did see this in the movie theaters and it was humorous. Lot's of adults as well as children and there was quite a lot of laughter going on in the theater. Children under the age of 5 or 6 may not understand the movie or what's going on but they will chuckle at some of the antics and they will enjoy it.

I wanted to upgrade and buy it on DVD (finally) and was disappointed when I got the DVD to find the short feature was not included in this DVD. The DVD was in good shape, good price, and if all you want is Ice Age (which most people probaby do) then this is a good buy.

The sound is very peaceful in general, and fits in with the story.I was under the wrong impression of this movie, thinking it would be a comedy.Instead, it is a more child directed movie, and it might be very good because of the lack of violence and short time (1 hour 15 min, for kids with short attention spans.)The low down, is that its directed to children, and I found it rather dull, seeing how im 17.~hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Age is not just an ordinary movie!","review":"Ice Age is like Shrek (where Shrek and Donkey rescue Princess Fiona), but only 3 different animals (mammoth, sloth, and saber-tooth tiger) rescue a baby human back to it's father (after the saber-tooth's group went hunting the baby, but lost to it's mama, and was gave to the mammoth and sloth.) This movie is the type of family movie, with laughter, and friendship. (But with a few fight scenes, it would terrify toddlers.)

The character rip-offs are shameless, from the mismatched buddy pair to the horrible villains, and there's absolutely nothing redeeming in the script, which is basically nothing but a cookie-cutter story with supposedly funny jokes and visuals running throughout. This may be good for the under-five crowd, but for anyone to say that it comes anywhere close to comparing to Shrek or Toy Story or A Bug's Life or Monsters, Inc., for example, is a great disservice to these fine films.

The ones where you can't go to bed until you finished it? Star has been out in my town for almost three weeks-and I haven't even thought about buying it.

C. so much I'll never stop reading them, no matter how pathetic they will get, and Misty was beyond pathetic. Neiderman will never cast a spell like Dark Angel or Petals on the Wind, but he did a job well done with Music in the Night and The Dawn and Ruby series. Not everybody who reads V. C.

Back then I still got excited every time a new VCA book came out. I was a bit disappointed that Neiderman hadn't gone back to a full series after finishing this one, but by gum, I still got excited!However now ten years later, I'm no longer excited. Compared to the crud that Mr. Neiderman is now writing under VCA's name (Gemini, Shadows, Flower, Attic, Delia, and now Heavenstone series) Misty is definitely a better read in its own right. However, as a VCA book it's unacceptable. Yeah, Misty has problems, her dad and mom hate one another, blah blah, but she sounds as if she just likes to be rebellious on top of the justified anger she feels towards her parents. For a tween book, it's not bad. 2.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's so bad....she ran away on a Mini Motorcycle!","review":"Misty is the first in the Wildflowers series, and floral metaphors are scattered throughout the five part series of poor little rich girls.

The book tags and summary are so melodramatic it's laughable, and sadly, the inside of the book isn't much better. For 150 pages, Misty whines about her life, using endless description, and clichéd metaphors, that a real person who was narrating her tale never would have spoken. At the end of the book, we know that there is still more torment, for Star will be speaking tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"One word...weak. It's a good book if your 13 or 14 I guess but it doesn't come close to her stories.

It was short and pretty well written but it wasn't VC Andrews best work. I do reccomend it but I'd reccomend taking it out from the library instead of buying it.

It's too bad that these tapes aren't grouped by dance type instead of user level. It'd be easier to practice a certain style without switching tapes all the time.Are they smooth dancers? Not really. Competent, but stiff. Is the oldies type stuff what you associate with Waltz and Rumba? No. However, the important thing is that they teach you and these tapes are great for clearly learning some moves. I find these tapes much better than those by Teresa Mason for learning, although Mason's dancing is certainly superior.

Waltz may be ok, but again only if for some reason you can not move properly, everybody looked stiff and without passion for dance... the instructors were extremely unattractive, even worse... I felt that I threw away my money. I did not give up and bought a tape of another instructor - Teresa Mason- and she's the best.

The author keeps \\"pestering\\" (my words) the Dalai Lama with situation specific strategies and then asks \\"What if that is too difficult?\\" \\"What if that doesn't work, what then?\\". That's not what Buddhism is about! To me, that's the problem with Western methods, people can't see that an overarching philosophy can be your basis and then you don't have to remember which little tactic to use for each situation.

Like I can conquer the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I have bought this book some time ago becuse I myself am a very spiritual person in hopes to become a better person. I will not tell you a lie this book has some exercises and some medation exercises to help improve your life. This book has help me somewhat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting debate","review":"A bit of a tough read, but worthwhile all the same! It takes the Dalai Lama's views and mixes them with explanations from an American psychiatrist (East meets West). The result is a useful tool kit for creating more happiness in your life, but beware, it requires some deep thought - and some very active mental changes in your normal patterns of behaviour. Happiness, it seems, requires a great deal of mental discipline! But remember, its the end purpose we are working towards, not the short term pleasure...so put those chocolates away, and read the book!If you are not a Buddhist, do not fret, there is not a lot of religion in here and it is deliberately tailored to a secular audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant book","review":"After reading this book I came to the conclusion that the Dalai Lama is the most inspirational person I have ever come across. I rate Sir Donald Bradman as the ultimate in sporting perfection, and the Dalai Lama similarly perfect, but in the fields of intelligence, compassion and love. A brilliant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading for good living.","review":"As an asian growing up as a Buddhist, I found the insights and Buddhism doctrines be nothing new to me. Personally I'd recommend the reader to ignore the psychiatrist's comments. He didn't seem to quite catch up on the true Buddhism concept..not until the latter half of the book. I first decided to read the book because I'd like to see how a westerner view an eastern concept/philosophy. For that purpose the book gave me a pretty good view and in some way helped me better understand the western thinking and culture. I enjoyed the latter half of the book more for one I think because Dr. Culter started to have a better grasp of the whole concept (sometimes I wondered if he didn't quite get it or just asked questions with an average reader's mindset on the subject in mind). To me it helped repeat and remind myself of the proper way to live..as a Buddhist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I just finished reading the Art of Happiness and in a nutshell, I hated it. Nice way to earn a quick buck Cutler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Self-Help Book","review":"Visit my Blog if you like my review: [...]The Art of Happiness is a book born from the interviews of the author (a psychiatric named Dr Howard C. Cutler) with his Holiness the Dalai Lama.The author tries to fill the whole book with some (mostly brilliant) Dalai Lama's declarations, made in their interviews and in his public appearances.It's true that there are some interesting thoughts in the book (mainly in the first part: The Purpose of Live), but the rest of the book has a lack of intensity.The Dalai Lama seems a very interesting person, but the author doesn't have the ability to suck the juice of those declarations, and the best part of the book are transcriptions of the own Dalai Lama's words.I don't recommend the reading of this book, however, some Dalia Lama's ideas are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Holiness please find a better writer!","review":"The ideas in this book were simple yet important, and it is useful to remind oneself of them. I think this book would have been far more interesting if someone other than Howard Cutler had written it. His style is annoying and he tries to intepret events in his own life to demonstrate the Dalai Lamas teachings, which he manages to do with very little insight. He comes accross as a culture and philosphy starved westerner, completely awed by this very basic eastern philosophy.If you are really interested in the Dalai Lamas teachings, I am sure there are some better written books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple truths that allow one to deal with complex life issue","review":"What we may consider to be common sense truths about the attainment of happiness and the elimination of suffering is artfully explored and given greater depth in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First on compassion","review":"Howard C Cutler asks some good questions for each of Dalai Lama's assertions. When Dalai Lama says that the goal of life is happiness HCC asks then why are we not naturally inclined towards it. Expanding on Compassion when DL says it involves opening yourself to other's suffering, HCC is quick to ask as to why would we take on another's burden, while we are trying to get rid of ours. Instead of one way info flow, HCC's persuant questions, make the reader linger on thoughts and know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK!!!","review":"I normally don't write reviews but this book inspired me that much. I thought this was an exceptional book and challenges your way of thinking. There were many useful concepts that I applied and literally, in a week, I did feel happier and more at peace--for awhile, I felt very stressed at work (I am a manager)--but this book helped me to think in other ways. It is not an over night change, mind you, for this to work, you almost have to be religious to training your mind to think differently.I loved this book and it's number one on my list now! Anything that helps us to be better, happier, more compassionate people is a good thing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage to Say \\"I Don't Know\\"","review":"I salute the Dalai Lama to have the courage to say \\"I don't know\\" on confronting with common human problems, such as a self-destructive woman mentioned by Dr. Howard Cutler. But His Holiness did answer the question, in a more unhurried way, which he called The Art of Happiness. In the book he raised more questions than a psychiatrist could raise and answered some of them which not even a neuroscientist would like to try. Life is not mysterious, but to be happy is. We need medical sciences definitely, but a humanly love or concern, no matter how faint, should not be slighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one goes on the boat","review":"The messages within this book are invaluable. They have helped focus my interests in such a manner that the dreams of building and subsequently living aboard a bluewater troller yacht (48' or 68') have taken a quantum leap toward becoming reality. Rest assured, when that boat leaves port, a copy of this book will be onboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice mix of philosophy, theology and psychology.","review":"I appreciated the easy style both authors used, proving that it is possible writing about articulate and deep concept in a clear and simple way."},{"rating":"2","title":"happiness inside","review":"Everyone wants to be happy. Having read The Art of Happiness, I think it enables me to find the right ways to look for happiness. This book is elementary tool for any spiritual or personal development; however its simplicity is not simplistic, it is delicate with abundance of examples that are easy to be understand by virtually anyone.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"Howard C. Cutler knows how to sell a book - stick a big picture of the Dalai Lama on the cover and exploit the heck out of him. This book was very disappointing. I was expecting a book on the wisdom of the Dalai Lama's teachings. Instead I read a discouraging rendition of a psychiatrist's struggle to understand something he obviously just does not get. He blunders through interview after interview with the Dalai Lama spending much more time relating his own interpretations of \\"The Art of Happiness\\" than passing on what the Dalai Lama has taught. If you want to read a rude, arrogant psychiatrist's version of happiness, this book is for you. If you would rather hear what the expert has to say, I suggest looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was surprisingly disappointed with this book. What I wanted to read was words from the Dalai Lama; what I ended up reading was mostly the words of Dr. Cutler. It seemed more like a psychology book, referring to studies and so forth. There were pages and pages of words by Cutler, then a couple of paragraphs from Dalai Lama. Definitely not what I thought it would be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Judge This Book By It's Cover.","review":"I just received this book in the mail. When I glanced through it, I was very disapointed with Dr Cutler. His Holiness the Dalai Lama should not have been listed as an author of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to living a more compassionate life.","review":"Reading the quotes of H.H. the Dalai Lama in this book inspired me to learn more of Tibetan Buddhism, so I read two more books by H.H. Compared to those more 'technical' tomes, The Art of Happiness is a MUCH easier read for an average American like me. There is SO MUCH to the Tibetan Buddhist path, but Cutler's book distills an essence that anyone can apply with minimal effort, much to the benefit of self and other sentient beings. The meditations are a wonderful introduction for someone who has never tried it before. Being a basicly library (GASP!) sort of person, I checked this out and read it. I DECIDED TO BUY IT because it's a book with several points that I KNOW I will want to reread over time. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it but..","review":"just would have liked a bit more direction - a book that has been helping me is Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Important subject, bad book!","review":"I hate to think that this would be the first exposure to Buddhism that one would receive. This book is poorly written, and doesn't come close to capturing either the essence of Buddhism or the personality of the Dalai Lama. The book is more of a monument to the ego of Dr. Cutler than anything else. For those who are truly looking for an introduction to Buddhism, I would recommend \\"Awakening the Buddha Within\\" by Lama Surya Das, or \\"The Accidental Buddhist\\", by Dinty Moore. I could not in good conscience recommend Dr. Cutler's book (for it is most assuredly Dr. Cutler's and NOT the Dalai Lama's) to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a terrific book","review":"It truly makes you look at like in a completely different life. Ever since I have lived keeping in mind what I learned, my closed ones say \\"I don't think I've ever seen you her unhappy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading authorship","review":"As noted in other reviews, the cover is misleading in suggesting this is written by the Dalai Lama. The book is written by the rather average writer and psychiatrist Howard Cutler who lists his name as second author although he is really the sole author. Cutler uses quotations from some interviews he had with the Dalai Lama to justify the deceptive authorship credit. The quotations are very thinly spread through the book and you will find nothing new here. I presume this is legal, but I felt cheated and really struggled to extend loving compassion to Cutler and the publishers of this book. Read some of the texts really written by the Dalai Lama or the excellent and beautifully written book \\"Happiness\\" by Matthieu Ricard instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Peace","review":"I found the Dali Lama's book to be a clear path or stepping stones if you like to a wonderful life. His Holiness writes about a true life where we experience the ups and downs that come our way as part of our journey. Each experience being rewarding. Another book I recently read which was recommend by a reviewer, is called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes write of how thru awareness without judging yourself, your life can become a continuous series of rewarding and enriching experiences. I recommend both these books whole heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right answer to unhappiness","review":"This book is all about the wrong feelings we get when our minds are still focus on the wrong objectives or the bad intention.This man describe the right way to get away from all those thoughts which keep us into bad mood and drive us through bad decisions.His solution is far away from religion or any other bad medication. He just explain what is going bad in our mind and how to feel better. And all this has nothing to do with any god.He is a kind of spiritual guy I trust and his philosophy is the best religion that has never existed.You will be converted as soon as you start reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt advice from a wise man","review":"The Dalai Lama is awesome! He has such great advice about a lot of the things that people concern themselves with. Of course, he lives in an entirely different world than we do in the USofA, but his principles are very fundamental. Compassion is universal.When I read \\"The Art of Happiness\\" I was in a really bad state of mind. I was depressed and suicidal. He helped me get through a lot of my own problems and make me into a more balanced person. It's still tough - especially when other people are such a-holes and have zero compassion for anyone or anything - but I'm going to keep trying to be the way the Dalai Lama says to be and hope for the best. \\"Why?\\" by Phil Nery was a great book for dealing with depression and suicide, too. Completely different manner than \\"The Art of Happiness\\" but just as effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look at Western science vs. Eastern practice.","review":"Some previous reviews belittled the efforts of Dr. Cutler, but this book reads just as Cutler describes in his introduction. He states that if you're looking for a book that delves deeply into fundamental Buddhism, this is not the book you're looking for. This is simply a book that relates the practice of Western psychotherapy and the Dr.'s personal practice to the wisdom and practice of the Dalai Lama. It is a very interesting book - mostly through the Dalai Lama's ability to relate his teachings not just to modern practicing Buddhists, but he segments his advice towards the Christian audience and to non-believers. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a fraud","review":"I'm very disappointed - I thought this book was by the Dalai Lama - but it isn't. It is by some psychiatrist. I wanted to hear what the Dalai Lama had to say - not Harry Cutler. Don't buy this if you expect words of wisdom from the Dalai Lama!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Views of the Dalai Lama as seen by American Pop Psychology","review":"When I purchased this book, I was unprepared for the enormous amount of filler provided by Cutler. I get the impression that, were this book truly about the beliefs of the Dalai Lama as gleaned from Cutler's interviews, the book would only be 10-20 pages long.Writen for sale to the mass market, not necessarily out of Cutler's intrinsic interest in the underlying complexity in the Dalai Lama's views per se."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutler really loves himself!!!!","review":"Man does this guy love himself! This book is in essense, 1% Buddhism and 99% Cutlerism. It was absurdly obvious to me that Cutler's main purpose in writing such a book was to stroke his own ego. I saw the hokey photo of Cutler on the back flap of the book after I'd finished his soliloquy and to my un-surprise, Mr. \\"I'm ready for my close-up\\" looked just as I would have imagined. He apeared nothing shy of the blatantly transparent individual that he presents himself to be. Next time, maybe Cutler should stick to the topic of discussion instead of slithering his 2-cents worth at every opportunity he gets. I just sympathize for the Dalai Lama for having to endure the presence of someone who was so full of himself. I would preferred to have ranked this book \\"ZERO stars\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Cutler Book on HH the DLs Ideas","review":"This is a great book representing the views of HH the Dali Lama, but a book mostly from Cutler, one of the better collaborative efforts.This is a great book and if you are looking for a read on the DLs perspectives I think this one is a great starter. I highlight and underline a lot as I read and found that I marked the thoughts in this book more than others - which to me means that it was a thoughtful read.So, a great start of you are just getting into Dali Lama literature. Many thought provoking ideas are presented - and if you made it this far in this review I would not hesitate in testing out the book. It is not that expensive and has great bits to ponder.After that - add a review and tell us how you felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the quotes","review":"It seems somewhat strange and perverse to write something negative about such a positive book, but I think, like most readers, I wanted to read more from the Dalai Lama and less from Cutler. I found the only way I could get through it was by just skipping Cutler's prose and reading the Dalai Lama quotes. There is a need for a meaningful dialogue between buddhism and psychology, but I'm afraid Cutler is not the right person for the job, or perhaps, the problem is that the popularization of the topic in the book makes it far too simplistic and trivial.Having said all that, I learned a great deal from the Dalai Lama himself. I found his quotes to be incredibly useful and meaningful. I wish there were more in the book on the different kinds of meditation exercises that the Dalai Lama teaches. That is a book that should be written. If anyone knows of one, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your day job Dr. Cutler!","review":"I will never but another book by Dr. Cutler again. I found Dr. Cutler's sarcastic comments extremely annoying and distracting to the book's overall content.

Don't quit your day job Dr. Cutler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your day job Dr. Cutler","review":"Please do not write another book Dr. Cutler. I was hoping to read a book that the Dalai Lama has written and to find that an American M.D. had tried to write about something he really knows nothing about was a truly disappointing. Keep your day job Dr. Cutler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and believe.","review":"Inspirational book, I could not put it down, had to keep reading. The coauthor Howard Cutler has a wonderful style that keeps you connected to the Dalai's words from a western perspective. Mr. Cutler obviously had a profound experience writing this book with the Dalai Lama. I hope the book will mean as much to you as it does to me. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr Cutler's Prism Has No Colors <No Stars>","review":"The Dalai Lama didn't write this book. An American psychoanalyst wrote it. All of the good doctor's observations and analysis are presented as somehow 'echoing' the ideas of the thing being analyzed, the patient: Dalai Lama.The book is therefore, a hoax. The Dalai Lama, as Cutler concedes early on, has several good books which explain his religion (which is were the truth of this book begins, and ends).This book is clearly not one of them.But the paranoid political attributions of some other reviews I have seen in here are not at all in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing prose by Western Psychologist.","review":"I thought that I was buying a book by the Dali Lama but instead got a journal of a psycologist that traveled with and interviewed him. The author has taken great pains to fill his book with insights of he and his colleagues while still finding some room for the wisdom of the Dali Lama, most of which he seemed determined to resist."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the readers from Argentina & New York City","review":"I am a Buddhist Tibetan woman living in the U.S. and I just want to say that I am appalled at these two readers who have missed the purpose of the Dalai Lama's preachings towards \\"The Art of Happiness\\". Why must you criticize and demean the opinion of others? Have you learned nothing from the Dalai Lama's words? Are the thoughts of others not as legitimate as your own? I believe that the purpose of this site is to comment on the book not to criticize the thoughts of others. I know that if the Dalai Lama could read these self-indulgent comments he would also be disappointed that his words have achieved nothing towards inner happiness for the readers from Argentina and New York City. A suggestion: If you don't agree with the opinion of another, let that be your personal challenge towards personal growth to achieving enlightenment. Otherwise, keep your abusive comments to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Cutler MINUS 5 STARS (Nice picture, says it all...)","review":"I wish there had been an easy way to separate the thougths of the Dalai Lama from the endless platitudes of Dr. Cutler. To think that people actually pay to get advice from Dr. Cutler seems absurd! This book is for the most part filler and inane anecdotes. The only times Dr. Cutler hits the mark is when he points out the stupidity and shamefulness of his own questions. I know 5 year olds with a better insight on life than him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - Definately the most enfluential. A must-read!!","review":"This is a fabulous book and I suggest this to anyone going thru difficult times and you need something uplifting and helpful to get you thru some tough times.

Loved it, and I find it soooo useful in everyday situations. Excellent book, from beginning to end!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT","review":"The Art of Happiness by none other than the Dalai Lama! I couldn't wait to get the book and start reading. What A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT! Boring, lacks the insights and wisdom I expected. I honestly could not force myself to continue reading this book!!! This book continues to sell only because of its title and the picture on the cover!If you want to be enlightened read anything by Zen master Thich Nhat Hahn, I loved \\"Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life\\".If you want to know about the nature of happiness read \\"Authentic Happiness\\" by Martin Seligman."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about achieving HAPPINESS, not buddhist enlightenment!","review":"Many of the comments so far focus on the fact that this book isn't an introduction to Buddhism and the Dalai Lama. It doesn't claim to be! If that's what you were expecting, you should shop more carefully. It's about achieving HAPPINESS, people! It gives the Eastern approach, with Cutler playing Devil's Advocate with his very Western approach. Nor does it give any ready answers - that's up to you as the reader, and isn't for lazy readers. In my opinion, this book is a tool to promote thought, not a manifesto, nor a TV programme. I not only enjoyed it, but enjoyed the directions in which it sent my thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blueprint on Living","review":"This book is an excellent resource on daily living. It teaches us to enjoy living. We are reminded that the innocense of a child is our natural state. And, the only way to happiness is to become happy as we live. Happiness is not something in the distant future or something that can be possessed. It is an inherent sense of our core that lies at the heart of every human being.

I though that Howard Cutler's personal comments and research added a great deal to the book. In fact, my husband couldn't relate to some of the Dalai Lama's concepts, but Cutler's explanations removed the haze for him. I especially liked learning how Western research supports concepts that are 2,500 years old. Books are like people - they have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice of which end of the continuum to focus always remains ours. This is a book that I treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This book is so beautiful. I love it, and it helps bring a lot of small things in life to perspective. It helps you realize that you make your own happiness, and gives you things to try! This is a great gift idea for the reader on your list... or for anyone in that matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspirational","review":"This was my first Dalai Lama book. Everytime I would pick it up to read, within 5 minutes, I would be overwhelmed with a sense of peace, compassion and humbleness. It's truly wonderful how the Dalai Lama is able to invoke such strong feelings within a person who knew very little about him and his teachings. His quiet wisdom, manifested to me only through the written word fills me with a newly discovered respect for his teachings and Buddhism in general, something which I will be exploring more in depth now."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE","review":"Despite the disclaimer that the narrator makes that this book is only a guideline andwill not change your life, it will. I have been studying Zen for over a year now and the Dali Lama puts everything in a perspective that cannot be misinterpreted using logic that cannot be argued. I have never read anything more clear and concise in my life! It's the kind of advice that makes you slap your forehead and say, \\"Duh, why didn't I think of that?\\" Some people, my roommate being one of them, cannot get past the fact that it is narrated by a psychiatrist and not the Dali Lama. However, this does not have to distroy your reading of the book. The shrink is very helpful for giving more practical applications of the Dali's teachings as well as more \\"scientific\\" proof of the Dali's words. BUY THIS BOOK -- YOU WILL BE A BETTER PERSON FOR IT :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected at all","review":"This was the first by the Dalia Lama that I've ever bought, was an impulse buy. I was extremely disappointed to discover that it was written by Dr Cutler with excerpts from interviews and speeches made by Dalai Lama. :[ I agreed with several principles of the book, but overall I was left unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"If you want to know about the Dalai Lama, and his message, in my opinion you would be better off to look elsewhere. This book gives you the Dalai Lama through the eyes of the author (Cutler), who unfortunately attempts to make us think drivel is special and profound, with sneaky (intentional or not) tricks. In the following example, Cutler prefaces something lame the Dalai Lama says with this: (P.62) \\" he sat examining the human mind with the scrutiny of a scientist\\". Huh? How do you know that Dr. Cutler? At other times a twinkle in the eye or a warm laugh is supposed to substitute for actual information. My take is that the Dalai Lama himself began early on to tire of Cutler (We must stop now, I am tired). I didn't finish this book, as it was unconvincing of anything interesting. I found the book a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Not Interested in the APA","review":"I was disappointed to find so little of the Dalai Lama and so much of Howard Cutler who sometimes presents his limiting beliefs with awareness of them, and sometimes not. I'm interested in what the Dalai Lama has to say, and NOT whether or not his words agree with the findings from surveys by the American Psychological Society. If you want words of wisdom from the Dalai Lama, then I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Lo-Cal Buddhism, but it works","review":"Buddhist scholars and purists might have trouble with the idea of a psychiatrist gleaning a few practical tools for better living from the grand traditions. But the Dalai Lama apparently wasn't bothered by it. As for me, it got me back to meditation after too long a lapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"An affirmation of personal happiness potential.","review":"I so enjoyed reading this book and have always felt that the Dalai Lama is \\"on\\" in terms of how to lead a happy existence. It provides wonderful gems in the form of the thoughts and practices that are within us but we tend to forget and a timely reminder is always for the better. The wonderful book of quotations \\"Timeless Wisdom: Illuminating thoughts on the art of living\\" includes thoughts from the Dalai Lama as well as hundreds of other masters and is an ideal partner for this type of book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A western outlook on what it takes to be happy.","review":"This book is a good example of an analytical, Western thinking mind contemplating what Buddhism is all about. Dr. Cutler does a very good job asking the Dali Lama most of the questsions that Western thinkers want to know about Buddhism, and what it means to be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone can find something of value in this book!","review":"The Dalai Lama knew what he was doing when he agreed to the format of this book. In the areas I found the good M.D.s' comments dry I also knew that they would be guide posts and directions to those who are in a different place on their spiritual (emotional/ intellectual journey.) Because of the books format I think it is received by a much wider audience.The Dalai Lama speaks from a center we can all move toward. He gives us the insights into the Empathy and Compassion necessary for our journey to be a peaceful one.I will recommend and give this book to many friends and family! It is a labor of love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sets the lines that define life into a clear outline","review":"this book was very filling.

I always figgered what's good enough for the American Gigolo is good enough for me, so I've become quite interested in the Lama over the years. Turns out me and my pal Richard are not alone. American psychologist Howard Cutler also took a shine to the Lama and, over a few years, was able to ask him a whole boatload of spiritual questions. The result: _The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living_, a stunningly beautiful, simple book that chronicles the dialog between Cutler and the little happy guy. I've taken to leaving the book alongside our large bathtub and dipping into both simultaneously. Very peaceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but lacking substance","review":"This book is a good light read but lacks the level of substance necessary to give any real insight. I wish Cutler would have gone in one of two directions: a.)delve deeper into the western interpretation of the Dali Lama's teachings or b.) give us more (less repetition) of the Dali Lama's teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!!","review":"This book has been cleverly put together. It is mostly written for a Western audience to benefit from His insight on how to attain happiness. The Dalai Lama comes across as a compassionate human being offering his wisdom to help us achieve that goal, very rarely do you actually think of a \\"religious figure\\" doing the talking. I have to say I immediately have begun to feel the impact of his words in my life. I am now more aware, that each person I encounter is a human being just like me, with similar struggles and joys. Kindness, caring, tolerance and compassion are words to live by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to readers put off by Dr. Cutler","review":"As a practicing Buddhist, I wanted to let others know that part of the tradition of the Buddhist scriptures was to write goshos (letters) in the form of a Q&A, generally between a non-believer and an enlightened one. So Dr. Cutler is following along a well-traveled path by playing 'Devil's advocate' so to speak, and I am sure that the Dalai Lama completely understood that. Buddhism believes in a healthy skepticism on the part of believers because it safeguards against losing one's sense of autonomy to a religious authority. I feel every religion can learn a great deal about themselves and others by studying Budddhist thought. Regardless of the 'vehicle' that you drive, we are all headed for the same destination ultimately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly just empty talk","review":"This book is not written by the Dalai Lama, but more like a series of interviews, which really cast some doubt on how much of what is in the book is really from the high priest.That aside, the book is full of empty talk. Sure, a few gems here and there will make you feel good, but after reading the individual chapters, you are likely to walk away with a sense of emptiness. You could use your imaginations to practice what's preached here, but ultimately, if you are looking for a concrete self-help guide, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, insightful, profound","review":"A beautiful, insightful, and profound collection of philosophies by the Dalai Lama written in a tangible manner by an American psychologist who breaks down the ideas and presents them in a way that all readers can digest and apply. Includes many links to daily life and ties in with modern psychology. Is ideal for all belief systems and is not just geared to Buddhists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this book if you're still capable of thinking","review":"1. This book isn't the Dalai Lama's writing.2. This book is a clever way of \\"earning\\" some money based on the Dalai Lama's cult of personality.3. The simplistic nonsense passing for deep thoughts can be discounted by anyone who knows anything about logic, history, religion, or is above the age of ten.4. The Dalai Lama is just another in a line of theocrats and would-be theocrats who have polluted the Earth for too many centuries.5. You should learn what Tibet was like under the religious dictatorship of the previous Lamas before making any positive comments about them or their philosophy.6.

First of all, I have to disagree with the assumption that all people are essentially compassionate and gentle. A tour of the toy aisle in a Wal-Mart on Christmas Eve should reinforce the opposite, that people are inherently selfish and sinful! Next, how can imperfect people achieve perfection (\\"enlightenment\\") based upon their own imperfect efforts? A broken vessel cannot repair itself! While some of the points made in the book may be valid, I think the greatest evil in this world is not anger or hatred or intolerance, but rather a reckless disregard for the Truth.

I found myself repeatedly re-reading passages while shaking my head and muttering \\"no, no, no\\" to myself.This is a thinly veiled self-help book, attempting to use the Dalai Lama's name and words to lend credence to simplistic, formulaic bookshelf \\"wisdom\\".Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutler gets in the way - \\"Ethics....\\" is a better read","review":"Unfortunately, Cutler keeps getting in the way by explaining things that don't need to be explained. This makes reading the book a laborious test of will. The insights by the Dalai Lama are profound and transcend religious and cultural boundaries, but they require introspection to truly explore the implications of those insights. Cutler doesn't allow the reader to do this, instead he quickly boxes the quote into a clean, often artificial container, diffusing the impact of the original quote.A much better read which offers most of the same message, without the distractions, is \\"Ethics for a New Millenium\\" by the Dalai Lama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Happy with deception","review":"I have been unable to finish reading this book; I came to the Amazon reviews thinking \\"is it me?\\" and found there are some others who feel as I do.I couldn't read without a troubling thought constantly nagging me. 'Why is this book sold as the Dalai Lama's?' It [appears to be} a fraud - it is prominently Cutler's book.As you read your mind is distracted in figuring out whose words are whose. They are not well indicated by simple things like quotation marks. One can tell, to some degree - the rambling repetitive restatements are Cutler's.Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vain Cutler, Insightful Lama.","review":"I agree with most of the previous reviews that Mr.Cutler lost this battle of wits with the Dalai Lama. The latter shows us in vivid detail how to cope and beat the blues, anger, envy, etc. Mr.Cutlers attempts to outwit DL with psychological questioning was transparent and ineffective. DL's logical responses go far beyond the limits of the self. Part1-The Purpose Of Life, P2-Human Warmth And Compassion, P3-Transforming Suffering, P4-Overcoming Obstacles, and P5-Closing Reflections On Living A Spiritual Life. Will give any reader plenty to reflect on. For me P3 was the linchpin of the book. Page 140 was the most crucial.

I have read a few other books by HH Dalai Lama, but this one is my favorite. Cutler asks questions about topics such as compassion, anger and anxiety. HH Dalai Lama gives very thoughtful answers. It's like sitting down and having the conversation with HH yourself!

But really, Dr. Howard Cutler is the main author of this book, like a previous reviewer said. Dr. Cutler helps make the ideas more accessible to Western ears, but next time I want a book that actually is written by the Dalai Lama himself. This was an excellent read nevertheless.This is a book on how to be happy, how to control negative emotions, and how to be compassionate.

If you want to find out about Buddism then of course you should go right to the source, the Dalai Lama. Dr. Cutler did that and has been able to organize some rather complex concepts into a very readable style that could be understood by anyone. In addition, I feel that this book will stimulate further interest in Buddist teachings. I know that I for one intend to read more books on Buddism and try to learn even more about it based on the fact that the book sparked my interest to learn more. Dr. Cutler effectively used examples from everyday life in order to better illustrate how the Dalai Lama's teaching can be turned into practical guides to handle everyday problems. All in all, I found reading this book to be a very rewarding experience and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide to Life","review":"The Dalai Lama is a revered spiritual leader, for many people, Buddhist or not. However, in this book, he makes many Buddhist teachings incredibly universal to everyone's life, regardless of their faith. This book is applicable to all, due to the way that he eloquently adapts major Buddhist teachings so that they are common to every human being. This is truly a handbook for living, in terms of coming to accept yourself as well as others and your environment. He discusses in detail the whole concept of living life in order to avoid suffering, and how simple steps taken in everyday life can allow you to reach a much more peaceful place in your existence, and he discusses how to deal with pain and how to learn from it.

I was looking in anticipation to read 319 pages on what the Dalai Lama had to say on \\"Happiness\\" (in his words). Instead as I read further and further into the chapters I understood that this was Howard's words and not the Dalai Lama's. I did not pay to read Howard; so I felt betrayed by the cover with a picture of the Dalai Lama and the content being for the most part from someone else then portrayed.

I definitely admire the Dalai Lama and what he stands for, but what the book preaches is pretty logical for any normal human being and served more as a reminder rather than new insight. Compassion and happiness...easier said than done, at least in our society today. I wish he would've explained more how he came to what he is...why and how he doesn't crave what he doesn't have, or get angry when wrong has hit him. It seemed like he was basically preaching to the choir. Anyone who would read his book would hope to get more out of what he gave. What he said was logical and nothing I haven't heard before. The meditations were pretty cool, and I wish he wouldn't gotten more into them. It seemed a little repetetive, but it was a good reminder of how we should all be living our lives.

Perhaps the best two scenes in the movie that touched me the most was the scene when Jared talked with his blind charge informing her he was leaving and the final scene where Jared asked Robert for a date.

And I must say that, Andrew (Bryan) is totally HOT! He has a beautiful body and I enjoyed every scene that he was in, however, I think it would have been WAY hot if he and Jared (Corey) could have been in a steamy love scene too!

The acting is terrible (Rocki Craig wins the award for Most Stilted Actress in a Supporting Role), the story is about the oldest gimmick in the book and it's meant to pluck at your heartstrings. Production values? Hey, in this world, anyone can get the equipment at Best Buy for a few hundred bucks, and it shows. Still, it makes you want to cuddle up with your boyfriend and have a good sigh.

For example, the levels are different (This only means the worlds are, not the stroy line; the boses and characters are practically the same, and yes, Skorn's in here). However, There's no co-operative, and I still haven't figured out what the gold's for! But just not to let your hopes up, it is a decent game. The graphics are okay.

The song Awesome God knocks you off your feet in worship to God! \\"Deliverance\\" lets us know that God still delivers, but we must be available to receive it. \\"I have a Right to Praise Him\\" reminds us of our freedom to serve a righteous God who is worthy of Praise!

My cat has wrapped himself in the string when hauling it around the house, and once I thought that he might choke if I didn't release it myself. The safety release doesn't often release, and so the whole contraption comes down off the door trim that it hangs from, which then gets stuck when the cat runs around the house with the mouse in mouth, increasing the \\"getting wrapped up in the string\\" potential as he circles around chair legs etc. The rubber tips on the ends of the metal door jam grip come off almost immediately, and are hard to find. (Have lost several.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Longer string for my fat and lazy cat","review":"Great toy. Quality is very high. Very pleased. It stays on the door frame securely and also works around chairs and stools (alternative locations for my cat to play). However, with the height of the doorframes in my place, the mouse barely grazes the top of him when he walks underneath it ignoring the temptation to play with it. When I pull the elasticized string (which is great) and get the mouse down to the ground so my lazy kitty sees it, the toy entertains him and gets him moving. If the string were longer my cat might play with the toy by himself (like he does with toys that are on the floor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cats love it!!","review":"We had one of these toys that we have hanging in the doorway...the cats destroyed it from playing with it so much.

A bathroom shelf that you can't get wet AT ALL, not even an accidental splash, or it will bleed like a stuck pig ?? The enclosed paper said I could use a small rug under it,if I wanted to use it on a carpet. Again, REALLY ?! So, who out there wants to ruin their rugs with orange dye ?? I decided to test it, to see just how bad it would bleed. Well, I had it in a hot shower for an hour, and then in a filled tub with soap for another hour. It still bled.

The prose is clearly beautifully written, but I had to force myself to finish it. I loved the stuff about silkworms and the early stuff about the queen, but after that I found it hard to take any interest in the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled plot line takes away from fascinating concept","review":"I don't think I've ever suggested a book be longer but this needed a good 100 pages more to make sense. Certainly the concept was a fascinating one. The Spanish Inquisition and its effects on both the common peasant and royalty is intriguing, but the author seemed to be so caught up in \\"painting a picture\\" that the writing seemed affected not to mention the numerous plot lines left dangling in the wind. Why didn't the two women's lives intersect a bit more? The writer couldn't decide if she was writing a novel or a Harlequin romance, leaving a dissatisfied reader in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly Woven Prose Paints Gruesome Picture","review":"In \\"Poison,\\" Kathryn Harrison impressed me with her masterful command of the English language. Thank to her crafty prose, I was immediately and completely plunged into the brutal times of the Spanish inquisition, from the dungeons of its torturers to the deadly intrigues of the royal palace. Swiftly changing between her two main female characters - a silk grower's daughter and the Queen of Spain, she narrates their life stories and compares and contrasts their fates without effort. The two women, so different in their station, are so similar in their doomed destiny that the book leaves you a little sad and helpless. Still a wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing but what's the point","review":"I loved the setting and the writing, but overall there was nothing exciting about this book. There were no surprises (the entire story is a flashback), at times it was just really gross (as other reviewers have mentioned), and the link between the silk maker's daughter and the queen was tenuous at best. Most of the story just read like a history, I felt no connection with the characters. I love tragedies but I don't think there was a single happy moment in the entire story.So if you like beautiful prose and being depressed and grossed out I would suggest this book to you wholeheartedly. On the other hand, if you're looking for any kind of plot, action or meaning look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to finish it","review":"It was a mission to finish this book because at times I was disgusted with it. I have read other reviewers comment on the excess of bodily fluids . . . Were these too crude for a lover of historical fiction? Perhaps . . . The information on the Spanish monarchy, the Inquisition and even the French Court was rich in images, but when I pick up a book I want more. Reading a book is like watching a movie. You want a good plot, you want to expand your knowledge of a particular era, you want to appreciate the characters, but you also want to be entertained. This time it failed for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superlatives in many reviews, but what's the point?","review":"The synopses present the story well. However, after reading the book, I felt cheated. \\"Poison\\" is no more than a high-brow romance novel which attempts to chronicle parallels in two women's lives..the princess and the pauper. Guess who has the bette sex life? But the two really have nothing more in common than you or I, nor do their lives intersect in any meaningful manner. So now I know a little bit more about silk worm farming. What was the point of being dragged into these two lives? I finished the book, but will likely not pursue any more work by this author. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept thinking it would make sense","review":"Poison is a confusing tale of two women who share the same time in history but little else. The poor silk farmer's daughter tells the tale of her experiences during the Spanish Inquisition while the new Queen of Spain suffers the indignities of royal life with an impotent and invalid husband, King Carlos. While rooted in some historic fact, the book loses its charm in the unending descriptions of body fluids and bizarre acts. I kept reading it, thinking it would make sense at some point, but alas it didn't. Don't waste the time or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't wait to get through it","review":"I had high hopes for this book... especially after reading a lot of positive reviews. I generally like books about women from different periods of time (Crimson Petal and the White, the Dress Lodger, Slammerkin). However, I found this book tedious. In the future, whenever I hear a lot of people talking about the \\"beautiful, poetic language\\" - i'm taking it for what it is. Flowery, and sometimes over-descriptive account of the story. This book had the makings of a lot going for it - 2 women's lives parralled in tenuous situations but it fell flat for me and I think it was partly because of the language and partly because I could not get into the characters as much as I wanted to. I don't want to read about a person's dreams more than what is really happening in the story. I like stories that are more straight-forward and unflinching."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Year Long","review":"While this book is deemed appropriate for ages 4-8, our 14 month old daughter quickly chose \\"All Year Long\\" by Lois Rock, as her favorite book.

It is a part of the world that most Americans not only do not know about, but cannot imagine. This is a very good film- a must see. Watch this film and have your eyes opened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtles Can Fly","review":"Few films can match the dazzling visuals and heart-wrenching storyline of Ghobadi's unforgettable Oscar-nominated drama, which spins a tender, engrossing tale about the costs of war from the perspective of three Kurdish children. Newcomer Ebrahim is completely fearless playing the likable, charismatic Satellite, while nonpros Latif and Feyssal are devastating as war-brutalized siblings toting a handicapped, unwanted child born of rape. Harsh yet compassionate, \\"Turtles\\" is filled with potent, resonant images--a blind toddler seated in a mine field, Agrin swigging kerosene to numb a toothache, the maimed Henkov defusing a mine with his teeth. A beautiful, hypnotic work of film poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all americans","review":"This movie doesn't have any political tied, but merely shows you a view from Iraqi refugee's.

Excellent source of ideas for restaurant operators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puff Piece","review":"Decent corporate bio, but definitely in the \\"authorized\\" category. Corporate missteps and blunders are glossed over, and the company is portrayed as having created everything. For example, did McDonald's really create centralized distribution? Was the creative accounting used to obtain financing in the 1960s OK since they didn't default on the loans, and it's more accepted today? Should the rage and childishness of Ray Kroc and later CEO Fred Turner exhibited at times be overlooked so easily? The book paints an extremely rosy picture of a company that is extremely flawed.Interesting chronology and interpretation of the development of this monolithic American icon.

As a vegetarian, I appreciate not having to worry about what's in it. The black bean & lime soup gets thick, is a hearty portion, and is great over rice for a full meal.

So I cook it half the time, let it settle, then finish it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family favorite!","review":"I've tried all the other McDougalls now and none of them compete with this one, which is fantastically tasty and filling.

Other than the sodium content, which I agree is a bit high, this is a great, healthy, filling, convenient lunch. Just takes some good hot water and a little wrist action to mix it up well.

It's not even the taste that's so bad--it tastes fairly ok, even though there's a slight cardboard aftertaste--it's the consistency which just makes it terrible.

However, I don't like being lied to, so this food is off my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great choice...","review":"I bought these soups not realizing the following--the soup cup is two servings---that means that this is 340 calories and a whopping 660 mg of sodium. I guess you could eat half the container, but what do you do with the rest? Despite this (hey, I bought it...), I made the soup and was unimpressed. It tasted salty and stale. I have had other dehydrated soup cups (great for traveling) and this is by far one of the worst ones that I have had. Too many calories, too salty and too complicated to make (you just don't pour in boiling water and wait a couple of minutes). I find that the Nile Spice soups are better and certainly less fattening.I am a bit surprised that Dr. McDougall would create a product like this.

I found it really nasty. The flavor powder clumps up, no matter how vigorously you stir the mess, and the beans stay a bit too hard. The final texture is like maple syrup with lumps. The flavor is horrid -- dried something, but no resemblance to any food I've had (and homemade black bean soup is a favorite). This seems to be a product devised by someone who considers food only a nutrient object, not a potential source of joy in life.

It tastes just like Panera Breads version but Im sure this one is much healthier. I love it and will not get tired of it any time soon. I will recommend this to everyone at work.

Update: Months later still love this soup, Im doing the subscribe and pay and Im saving money so its cheaper than progresso or healthy choice and a whole lot more filling."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could live on this stuff!","review":"This is the best dehydrated soup I have ever tasted.

Kind of expensive if you get it at the store, but Amazon's subscription program makes it very reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear, irrelevant and sometimes inaccurate.","review":"The diagrams are unclear, the advice is irrelevant, and the information is sometimes inaccurate. Specifically, to answer the question: 'where do I sit,' Goldberg tells the reader that the first person into the courtroom picks whichever counsel table he or she wants. This is, in my jurisdiction, just flat wrong (civil = D sits closest to jury box, criminal = prosecutor does). The first time advocate who follows this advice could embarrass herself and start trial no. 1 off on the wrong foot. Goldberg answers the second question: 'what do I say' with a couple of hundred pages of vague bromides like 'the trial lawyer is an actor' 'the courtroom is a theater' and 'the trial is a movie.' I don't find these particularly useful. For those with more questions, the authors suggests that the lawyer 'check with the court for how things are done locally.' Thanks for that, but I want my $25.00 back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for law students- who should also see Keith Evans' book","review":"Goldberg's nutshell is good, but Keith Evans' book, Common Sense Rules of Advocacy for Lawyers, is for the law student and new attorney who wants to learn how to be an excellent advocate.Keith Evans practiced as a trial lawyer in California and as a barrister in England.

The information is so easily formatted, and the words so simple, that anyone can read it and take in the advice as something second nature. After reading and applying the suggestions in this book, proper breathing during exercise, stress, and other circumstances can lead to an ease not experienced before. I am a cross trainer, and when I was young I couldn't breathe properly so everyone told me I had asthma. Asthma may exist as a medical problem, but its also a state of mind. The ability to control our bodies is underestimated. This book is nature in words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Practical","review":"I give this book four stars as it is very practical in its approach to the Buteyko method. More so than other information sources I have found. His 5 different exercises gives the patient plenty to choose from when trying to incorporate Buteyko's breathing exercises in everyday life. He also gives advice as to what to do when progress stops up, something I am sure a lot who has tried this has experienced.The fifth star is left out as the book is fairly short. Had he crammed information with the same density, and given the book twice as many pages, it could have turned into thee book for most of us trying out this method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medical Information, Suggestions","review":"Hmmmmm - despite the fact that there is a thread of truth regarding the efficacy of this better breathing concept, the process itself seems curious, at least with respect to several techniques described in the book.

The only feature I personally didn't like about this bracelet, is it is heald together with stretch elastic string. I know it will wear away sometime soon, but to try it out as magnetic therapy, it is well worth it for the experiment.

I designed a new cover for it, put a sticker of Stanley and Dennis on it, added letter tabs and my son couldn't be happier. It was the only thing he wanted for Christmas and he was not disappointed. The high point came when my siblings thought that it was nice that the \\"Stanley\\" people made this book. Lots of animals and great pictures. Sometimes my children and I pick out an animal and I use that as their bedtime story. 5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed great, until...","review":"At first this book seemed excellent. I bought it because I wanted to use the illustrations and photos in my own book, which I am simply writing for fun. As you may have guessed my book is on animals. Anyway,the \\"Animal Encyclopedia\\" has a lot of great information and beautiful pictures. However, upon closer inspection I noticed that the book had many errors. In fact, after searching through the entire book, I came across an astounding 32 errors! These aren't minor errors either. An example is page 349, where they have a picture labeled: great egret, where the bird is obviously a SNOWY EGRET. There is a HUGE difference. So, why give it more than one star? Because besides these numerous errors the book does have a lot of good info. You simply can't rely on every fact to be correct, which sort of defeats the purpose of the book I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent live effort","review":"I originally purchased the LP in 1987 as one of my first Le Orme recordings. This is a very solid performance of Le Orme standards, but without a doubt the show stopper is the intensely percussive \\"Truck of Fire\\". A must have for any prog fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"This novel was a disappointment after reading \\"Birdsong\\". The love affair between Anne and Charles lacks feeling, but the incentive to finish the book was to find out Anne's mystery. A total feeling of let-down arrived at the end of this book. There were glimpses into the background of various characters, but none were explored enough to satisfy. One gets the feeling this book was written in a hurry without thought to detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I discovered Sebastian Faulks with the wonderful Birdsong, which is one of the best books I ever read. I then turned eagerly to this book expecting to have a similar experience. I cannot figure out why, but this book did not engage me in the least. I read the entire book expecting to be drawn in any minute, because I know this author can do that. I was so disappointed. I did not feel any connection between Anne and Hartmann - they supposedly have deep feelings for each other but I couldn't feel a thing. The minor characters such as Roussel, Roland and Christine were actually more finely drawn than the main ones. I so wanted to love this book, but would never recommend it. I will try another book by Faulks, on the strength of how I was carried away by Birdsong, and hope that this book was just an anomaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent prose, but plot lacking","review":"Although this book managed to hold my interest, I think it was solely because I was on a trip and it was the only book I had with me. While Faulks' descriptions of locales are evocative and intricately written, he seems to fail in his attempts to bring the characters to life. Both Anne and Hartmann seem rather one-dimensional, and Anne's attraction to Hartmann is never satisfactorily explained, except in an obtuse way when she divulges her \\"secret.\\" The other characters seem simply to be neither particularly interesting nor an integral part of the story. Frankly, I was disappointed, and am hoping for better from Birdsong, which was the book I was searching for and was unable to find when I settled for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me what happened!","review":"I desperately tried to follow the plot, but I was unable to locate one; I tried to like the characters, but what was there to like? What in heavens name was this story ABOUT? Love? I think not! Self centered egotists, maybe. But what did the opening page and the last page SAY? It must have been written in another language because I simply was lost in this tedious dwibble of a book. And I am serious: I hope someone can at least explain the details and depth I obviously missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"Of all the books I have read, this must be the most disappointing... no wonder it took me well over a year trying to read the book with major interruptions as there is nothing to look forward to ..the plot and story-line are absolutely hopeless.... well, to sum it all up, very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple story beautifully told","review":"This story does not have the drama of Birdsong or Charlotte Gray but in some ways I think it may be better than eitherof them. The story unfolds like a flower, becoming more beautiful as each piece of Anne and Hartmann is revealed. The characters seem like real people trying to make sense of a world turned upside down by war. Yet, while there is great sadness in the story it never becomes maudlin. As always, Faulks is masterful at bringing France alive for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody Hates the Arabs more than Rubin","review":"Another propaganda piece blaming the Arabs for everything. United States and Israeli are just \\"misunderstood\\" angels of peace and prosperity. If you like his portrait of Arafat as Satan, you'll love this diatribe by the high priest of the Arab Defamation League. There are a lot of completely one-sided books on this topic but this is one of the worst. I wonder where the money comes from to support these hate mongers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom and son can play together!","review":"Alright, so it's not super high-tech and full of graphic complexities - it's a fun game. It's one of the few games that my five year old can play well enough for it to be fun and I am entertained by.The characters are well-defined and amusing. It's a lot like Mario Kart in the air. Mario Kart is another game my son and I enjoy together, so if you like that, you'll like this.Good game for the price. Family fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible movie!!!","review":"I agree with another reviewer here...this movie just left me cold and disgusted...I guess people think because it is French, it must be clever? With all the cliches of class struggle, obvious symbolism, and a movie that overstayed its welcome, I just felt, well, almost nauseated....just watch a movie like In Cold Blood which was a thousand times more creative in its handling of \\"senseless\\" violence...La Ceremonie feels like a cheap porn film with all the sex scenes \\"implied\\"....I doubt I will watch another Chabrol film...what a waste of time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and worth seeing","review":"An excellent portrayal of two very different personalities. Hupert's character is a chilling portrayal of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder. The maid is passive-aggressive. One need not speak psychobabble to understand why the two women are attracted to one another.Hupert's character is at her most horrifying when she describes her baby's death not so much to reveal herself to her new \\"friend\\" but to righteously justify why it happened; the death of a baby who must have been terrorized into silence by her disturbed and self-centered mother. Haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"widescreen","review":"Great film. Lousy DVD. The original film has been cut att top and bottom to make it look more like cinema widescreen. Many details that the director meant to be seen are now gone.The original idea with widescreen in cinema was to show more picture at the sides. But here you just get less picture at top and bottom, not more at the sides. The producers try to make money by tricking the buyers with this foul and superficial sales-trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Dissapointing","review":"I am a big fan of 80's films, even the cheesy ones. But this one was just a dissapointment for some reason. The dragon looked cool enough, but I didn't think they used it to the full effect they could have. The entire film had a very slow pace and just wasn't interesting or even 'fun' enough. And also not dark enough as well. I won't even talk about the acting, since anyone buying this movie shouldn't even be concerned about it. But when I heard it had the \\"coolest dragon effects before Dragonheart\\", well... I've seen better effects from the 80's than this. Pass this one up unless you are a major dragon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modest yet very entertaining movie","review":"I first saw \\"Dragonslayer\\" when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981. It was the first VHS movie I ever purchased. It's very well made, an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about. It still holds up. Caitlin Clarke's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job. I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter. I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004. \\"Dragonslayer\\" has action, humor, humanity, political irony. And if none of those matter to you: it's just plain fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Review","review":"Finally available on DVD at a bargain price, Paramount have done this film proud with a great image transfer. Sound, although 5.1, is lightweight with little surround sound but is clear. No extras, but so what at this price.

Bad acting, simplistic writing and not believable effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonslayer Drags On","review":"Take one over-zealous sorcerer's apprentice add one nasty, evil dragon and the end result is \\"Dragonslayer,\\" a medieval fantasy which lacks the charm of \\"The Princess Bride\\" and the intelligence of Arthurian legend. For two hours the film subjects its viewers to stereotypical stock characters and acts of aggression which are too violent for young watchers. Although the special effects are quite good given the date of production, it's not enough to hold one's interest without helping the bland dialogue along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"It's a poorly executed movie.

I may have had higher expectation of what insight this book may have provided, as I have run a plumbing and electrical service business for 35 years. PVC is an excellent material to work with I.ve had a lot of material to experiment with. The projects in this book are on a \\"tinker-toy\\" level. There are so many more ways to utilize this material. I am sure the author had good intentions but I absolutely feel this book was a waste of my money and my time.

You can shorten the \\"throw\\" by impeding the spray. You can sprinkle a narrow area or a full circle or anything in between. My only complaint would be to have a brass fitting on the part that attaches to the hose. As it is, it is plastic and the connection seems to loosen when you drag the hose around to a different space. Also, on our other rotor sprinklers the hose attachment at the base of the sprinkler was fixed. I like it fixed as it is easy to turn the sprinkler onto the hose than to try to hold the hose in place while you are trying to rotate the connection onto the hose.

The fact that it was written by a former LEO made me expect that I would get good information beyond what I've heard in casual conversation with friends. Instead, I kept wondering \\"Where's the inside information?\\"There is some good information, in the chapter about the traffic stop, about what information to gather to prepare a defense. Otherwise, there is a lot of very obvious advice, and some repeated info to pad the book out.The tips in the \\"Learn to Speed and Not Get Caught!\\" chapter are lame, and some of the excuses for speeding the author lists (that he says worked on him as an officer) are downright ridiculous).Richard Wallace really should have used a co-author; it's a very poorly written book.My advice: If you want to buy this book, get it used, and don't pay more than a few dollars for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too abstract, no substance","review":"The content of this book is too abstract with no substance at all.

When we met the judge, He asked to dismiss the case stating that he didn't have the documents I asked for to prepare my case. My case was dismissed and saved me $200 of speeding ticket. I knew I did not speed in the first place and I'm so glad I invested on this book. It's worth the money. I also spoke to Mr. Wallace prior to my case preparation. He has a toll free number and he returns calls...This book is on the top of my list..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND","review":"The Educated Guide was very easy to read, follow and understand.

So I lucked out! I also emailed Mr. Wallace at his company website and he responded back to me with some advice via email.

They remain fixed and do not follow you around as you move through the game. This method of gameplay worked pretty well in the hit series Resident Evil, but plays out very poorly in this game. It's difficult to maintain fighting sequences with bad guys and to see exactly what you're doing. The fighting sequences are very frustrating and the punch and kick combos look terrible (Batman kicks low, to the shins! now that's low for the dark knight).The tools also stink. The batarangs and smoke bombs are awkward to use, and pretty much unusuable during combat.I do have to give this game some props for the music track and style - both of which are very good. But the gameplay is awkward. This game is difficult, and not in a good way.

It features the worst camera angles I've ever seen on a game (while moving, the camera suddenly shifts, and you find yourself going in some other unintended direction). The graphics are sub-par. The only good thing about this game is the cutscenes - they're first class. But apparently, the budget for the game was spent on this feature alone, because the gameplay and graphics are awful.This should give you an idea of how bad it is.

The book does have some good information about getting started gardening, as well as how to get started keeping a variety of animals along with bees, fish, frogs, and earthworms. All in all though, I think it is sort of more of a book to give you general ideas than anything else.

Now, Martin Luther King, Jr. taught me not to say that word, so I was confused when I heard it being used so much by African Americans. This music is not good for you, it has bad words.

Finally, I wanted to read the book , mentioned in both the above books, that Nora Ephron says is a thinly disguised novel about her first marriage. I ordered Heartburn. It is very disappointing. It is an example of terrible writing in the general mood of the 1970's which was to let it all hang out. Back then it was like 'wow' she really wrote this? Reading it now, it is embarrassing and not politically correct. The book doesn't hold up over the years.

Nestor gives a historical look at slavery's influence on capoeira, takes a contemporary look at capoeira's development, and offers illustrated basic to intermediate techniques. The most interesting thing is the examination of capoeira at a physical and metaphysical level, and how it affects the individual player as s/he progresses. A game, a fight, a dance, a way of life..?

It has wonderful graphics, large boards to explore and race through, cool characters, multiple airplanes to race with and good sound effects.I have a couple of nephews that have really enjoyed the game a lot too. IT'S A SAFE GAME FOR KIDS, but has some good tongue-in-cheek humor for everyone old enought to get the jokes.

The author's command over the narrtive techniques is amazing. He creates a story inside of another one; both of them could be real, historical events... or not. But it just does not matter, because the main aim of the book is to evoke emotions, and it sure does. Especially, it is a tribute to the old people who fought in the Spanish Civil War and are now living in the most absolute and unfair oblivion. I found it deeply moving, as well as the movie (by Spanish director David Trueba), and wonderfully written. In Spain it sold like crazy without any serious campaign behind it, all by itself.

Based on the legendary dog 'saint' Guinefort, the story explores the clash of noble and village culture; outsiders such as Dominicans looking for heresy contrasted with the village priest who is one of his people; medieval understandings of Christianity; and the role of healing women and men.Although some liberties are taken with the story of the Dominican Etienne de Bourbon's life, who wrote about Guinefort at the end of his life and the healing woman Elda is much more young and beautiful in the film than in the original tale, this is a stunning film that provides great insights into 13th-C. life and beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool game!","review":"I just bought this game a few days ago and have to say that it's one of the most fun shooters I have played in a long time.

The book begins by examining the religio-cultural origins of the Italian renaissance in the 13th and 14th centuries. It then travels through Italy, encompassing the movement in Florence, Venice and Rome, examining the reasons behind artistic developments through the artists and their sometimes notorious employers. The tone is lively and witty throughout and never less than intelligent. The author clearly has a great reverence for his subject and conveys this love throughout without ever becoming overly sentimental. The photographic reproduction of the artworks discussed is also superb and unlike many books definitely follows the text so thereader has no difficulty following the arguments that Graham-Dixon puts forward.

But if your laundry area is where it is seen by others, you won't be embarrassed by some cheep looking junk. I feel it is a nice cart for the money. It is very flexible. You can place shelves on height settings that are right for your needs. Took me about an hour to put it together.

But I owe him a personal debt of gratitude and welcomed the recent DVD releases of Holst/Debussy and Rachmaninov/Stravinsky which gave me pause and good reason to re-assess my estimation of his work. The Holst/Debussy disk has surprisingly good stereo sound and more than acceptable video. It was recorded at the Philadelphia Academy of Music in 1977, when Ormandy was 78 and the longest-serving music director of a major orchestra. I find myself amazed at the lack of the Philadelphians' proverbial sumptuous blanket of (string) sound and delighted by the lean, transparent and incredibly disciplined playing. Ormandy's body language is equally sparse, but he is in full command of these idiomatic, clearly structured and powerful and ultimately great readings. I suspect that these disks have been released in fairly small pressings and suggest that you get them while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old junk. Never liked Ormandy and his band","review":"This is rushed, out of balance, and um... how shall I put it... well, nicht zusammen, believe it or not. Winds slightly out of tune now and then. This video is from 1977, so the sound is defective as well: trebly and tinny. I'd live with it if the performance were good, but it's quite lousy, actually. The worst performance of both pieces I've ever heard. Give it a pass -- or, if you must hear it, rent before buying: I bet you'll forego the purchase. (PS. Ignore the five-star reviewers here: I suspect at least some of them are hired drones retyping liner notes to attach something to their contractually obligatory five stars.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kristine Rules","review":"After seeing her perform here in a local club here in Houston Texas a few years ago I was compelled to buy Kristine W's \\"Stronger\\" cd.

Rockin the Paradise holds up fairly well. Too Much Time On My Hands is still pretty good. I still like Half-Penny Two-Penny, nice vocal effects after JY's very creative guitar solo.

The Hot Zone was great, this was better! I'm glad to hear it will be a movie, but I don't think I'll see it.

Preston used a not terribly original idea, and padded it with lurid detail. Period. I am a scientist, and I read many books and like most of them, and I can't remember a book as horrendous as this. I place it in the same category as watching bodies being removed from the scene of an accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cobra...","review":"Another good read by Richard Preston. It follows a similar story line as the rest of his books but he makes sure to change each book enough to keep you very interested in his writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fascinating","review":"Richard Preston hits the mark again. Although, in my opinion, not as quickly paced as The Hot Zone, this novel is every bit just as thrilling and exciting. It is one of my favorite to date. If you are looking for a good book, read this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Sci-Fi","review":"Preston always fascinates me and the Cobra Event is no exception. An antiseptic look at an autopsy without missing a beat. My favorite book in over 3 years. I cannot wait for his next thriller.RX Horatio"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Action-Packed Thriller Based On Solid Research","review":"Preston has done a remarkable job of researching the potentially catastrophic and realistic threat of biological warfare. This provides a fascinating backdrop to a brisk paced work of action fiction. His characters, while not very original, are credible enough to keep the level of versimilitude in tact. The descriptions of the potential effects of man-made viral weapons are spellbinding in intensity and nightmarish in impact. This is truly one of the most terrifying books I have ever read. It makes the average Clancy novel seem like \\"Hello Dolly\\" by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to journalism Richard","review":"The technical details were interesting, particularly about the nature of the virus & its effects on the human body. A high gross-out rating if you like that stuff (I do). Unfortunately, the plot was stupid and predictable. The characters were paper thin and uninteresting. Some authors have a great feeling for people and human nature. Some don't. Preston definately falls into the latter category."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hybrid read","review":"I came to this book after reading \\"The Hot Zone,\\" Preston's non-fiction account of a near-disaster involving an outbreak of Ebola in a Washington, D.C. suburb. I was reluctant to pick up \\"The Cobra Event\\" because it was fiction -- I thought it could not be nearly as exciting as \\"The Hot Zone\\" because it wasn't, well, true. But halfway through \\"The Cobra Event,\\" I was hooked. After all, why do we love detective novels so much, when we know they aren't \\"true\\"? Because the characters are appealing, the plot is riveting, and in the back of our minds, we know that this kind of story might someday _become_ true. Even while we curl up on the couch, enjoying a fictional murder/terrorism/epidemiology adventure through the subways of New York City, Preston is making an excellent case for why we should be afraid for the fate of the \\"real\\" world. I highly recommend this very scary novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reality of warfare.","review":"Very well researched book,a real eye opener about the production of biowarfare ,insectwarfare,etc.At least One book like this should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, after finishing Micro that was written by Michael Chrichton and finished by Richard Preston after Chrichton's death. The premise of the plot seemed promising, but it just didn't pan out. The characters were flat, with very little description. The climax of the plot was overly contrived--I felt like I'd just wasted several hours of reading only to be highly disappointed. I hope someone else takes on the bioterrorism/genetic modification theme and writes a better story than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THOUGHT PROVOKING","review":"I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them more. Nevertheless, biological engineering, weapons, and covert operations send a chill up the spine. In my opinion the beginning was rather weak, with the action jumping to several scenes. The ending was much better with the villian getting burned with his own fire and the haunting possibility that the deadly virus is still on the loose. The manufacture processes, laboratory descriptions, and the research seemed to be overdone. I found some of the background data tedious. It was if the author had found materials that he wanted to insert because he had it - which to me clouded the plot. I would rather have read much more of the villian including his philosophy, research, reasoning, and techniques. Nevertheless, I would recommend the book as a fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang on--Its One Hell of a Ride!","review":"From the first to the last page, Mr. Preston grabs the reader and doesn't let go. He strikes the chord of terror and reality in having dangerous biological weapons dispersed throughout America's metropolis--New York City by a lunatic mad man. Its a race against a biological holocaust that is qucikly ticking to detonation. Spies, viruses, danger, and intrigue all make this a first rate novel. Readers should also check out Preston's \\"The Hot Zone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT!","review":"It may well be labeled fiction but it's cut too close to home. Everyday, we hear about technology break through. We have very intelligent scientists who devote their lives to discoveries & improvements. Good thing if these discoveries & developments are used to improve everyday lives & to bring good deeds & prosperity to everyone. But what if these developments include something like COBRA which can mass exterminate? It may be used as biological weapons (to protect who from what?) or it may be used as a tool to control population as what Cope may have intended to(do humans have the right to take this to their own hands?). These issues are highly debatable --- whether be it in a moral, ethical, or social view. But why do we do this & what for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After the advent of HIV and Ebola, stories about scary viruses seem to be everywhere. We all remember Outbreak (which was an excellent film) and then the highly acclaimed The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. I was expecting much from this one but it failed to deliver. I got the feeling that Preston was trying to impress me with all the research he has done, but who cares? Sure, there was some nice detective work and a fairly fast-paced ending, but it wasn't enough.I wouldn't be surprised if we were to see this in the movies, the character Littleberry is almost written for Danny Glover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worry about the scientific trifles.","review":"It may not be appropriate to expect the author to be knowledgeable as a physician with abundant knowledge on gene technology, experimental medicine, pediatrics, and so forth. He might have assumed that the readers know little about Lesch-Nyhan symdrome, or method of collecting blood from tiny experimental animals, or specimen pretreatment for (electron) microscopes, or clinical biochemistry or whatever. But the assmption is not always true, unfortunately. The readers are always selfish. They always look for perfection even when they are not perfect at all. I cannot recommend \\"The Cobra Event\\" as a \\"medical\\" thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically perfect but artistically flawed","review":"Considering Mr. Preston's past efforts with \\"The Hot Zone\\" I was expecting a can't-put-it-down techno-thriller ala Tom Clancy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Mr. Preston's journalistic background, which he has put to good use in his previous three books, proved to be a hinderence in this novel. In the first 112 pages(which is as far as I got) I learned more than I ever wanted to know about biological weapons, chemical weapons and the myriad ways to deliver these instruments of mass destruction. What I didn't learn about (and I think this is what kept me from continuing) was enough about the characters to make me care about them. Characterization was, at best, minimal. As much as I respect the gargantuan effort it takes to complete a book, any book, perhaps Mr. Preston's forte is journalism/non-fiction and not novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your teenagers read this--- bet they'll use their Trojans","review":"Okay, I realize it's not in the same category or at least body part. But I'm serious, this is one scary book. Your fingers grip the pages, white-knuckled. Your eyes bug out like a Chihuahua's. There is no flowery writing in this, just bare-bones entertainment, and let me tell you-- grab your shorts, it's a heck of a ride. This is a most excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad ending ruins the book","review":"Preston must have been in a hurry to end the book, so absurd is the ending. Preston should write non-ficition about the subject and not pretend to be a fiction author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I agree with most of the negative reviews for this book. I was immensely disappointed with the writing style that Preston used. It read more like a science text book than a thriller. Unfortunately, there were times when a science text actually would have been more interesting. I appreciate that Preston felt he needed to take time out to explain the terminology he was using and the techniques the villain used to create the virus, but sometime he just went too far. Was it actually necessary to explain that a knish (one of the characters was eating it) is a small potato pastry? Sometimes there is such a thing as too much detail.After reading that Preston was journalist before becoming a fiction writer, I could see why he wrote the way he did. I think he needs a bit more practice before he actually can make a name for himself in the world of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very scary!","review":"All to plausible, very graphic, sometimes a bit too graphic but this has the desired effect.

However, I would not say that it is a \\"must read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic in a good way","review":"This was a fantastic book. Richard Preston did an even better jobe than in the Hot Zone, and wrote a wonderful suspense novel. The graphic scenes that he adds in the book make it very intesting and easy, though not always pleasant, to imagine. The book starts out so well, and doesn't let down, staying interesting and exciting the whole book, as you don't ever know what is going on or who will die next. By using a lot of facts, and doing lots of research on biological weapons, and the such, he was successful in creating a very real life fiction story of some unsuspecting, seemingly unrelated vicims of a horrific crime. It was so real, it makes you really think that it is possible, and could really happen, and with biological warfare on the rise in today's world, seems like a very relevent topic. He even adds a little humor, and emotion to the drama and suspense that makes for an overall good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Seller","review":"This was a great buy. I needed the book for a class and not only did it arrive in a timely manner it arrived in great condition too!!!Thanks so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse of a possible future.....","review":"If this book doesn't alarm you, probably nothing will. Although supposedly a work of fiction, this book is well researched in the science behind bioengineered weapons \\"black biology\\" and possible government responses to a terrorist event involving such weapons. A superb account of what could happen in our country if a terrorist utilized biological weapons....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Factual Novel","review":"Richard Preston here does an exemplary job of weaving historical and modern facts into a well written novel. He obviously knows his facts when writing about viruses and hot zones, etc.. Besides being an interesting novel in it's own right, Preston has a lot to say here about epidemiology, forensics, and how autopsies are done. There are descriptions of gruesome, drawn out deaths in this book, and some of this is just sick, sick, sick, but it will keep you turning the pages, fascinating nevertheless. Much of this novel concerns itself with the science of forensics, it is interesting how scientists can gleam information out of what at first glance may seem to be very little evidence, and alone this would make the book worth reading. I took one star off of my rating as the novel seemed to me to start very slowly and it was really only the last one third of it that it got intense, but overall a good solid read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot but just didn't deliver","review":"I really liked the premise for this book, but as I got into it, it just felt weak. Although I thought the overall story was interesting, the execution was not compelling. I found myself, many times, getting bored after just a few pages.I know I'm against the opinion of the masses here, but this book just wasn't that much fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering entertainment that illustrates human vulnerability","review":"Richard Preston's bio-terror thriller shocks, informs, and clarifies as it demonstrates how vulnerable humans are as a species to nefarious techies (or socio-paths, paranoic schizophrenics, or eco-terrorists)that have a whim to decimate the human population using genetically engineered viruses. Were it no so plausible given the growing number of conscience-less weirdo's, it would be the most adreneline pumping tome I have read. The sobering matters with which it deals limits the thrill for me. The plot and characterization are fairly well done, though it is strongest where Preston was brilliant in The Hot Zone: expository material in a narrative context. His style is transparent, nearly without exception, making it a good day's read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd, poorly told story","review":"The premise, biological terrorism from a rather prosaic source, had the skeleton of an enjoyable plot. But the author's odd temdency to break out of narrative and simply tell you what was going on or what something meant, broke the old fiction writer's rule of \\"Show, don't tell.\\" The law enforcement characters seem to have been taught technique by the detectives who investigated the Jon-Benet Ramsey case (missing some obvious sources of information to track down their man). As the review above mentioned, the characters are rather cardboard --- the main character, Dr. Alice Austen, appears to be sleepwalking most of the time. And there are several gruesomely detailed autopsy scenes that even Bevis and Butthead would characterize as gratuitous. Rather than calling this book a \\"page turner\\" we found it to be a \\"page skipper\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author he's not","review":"If the book was sold as a technical exercise in biological warefare, then I could accept what was written as well put. However, the book was marketed as a suspense thriller and came off as a documentary. I'm disturbed that the publishing industry used his Hot Zone claim to fame, I did read this as well and recommend it, to sell a novel that comes off as a weakly plotted and poorly developed cast of characters around what should have billed as a fictional documentary. I will admit that the technical details of Cobra were interesting, but I would recommend a library visit before a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"biological terror","review":"the cobra event manages to scare you with the cold hard facts of biological warfare.it scares you by telling you that a terrorist can easily wipe out a city the size of new york with a small dose of genetically engeneered virus. After reading this book,you will probably live life more cautious and in fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Plot - Preston needs a ghost writer","review":"Excellent plot, believable and terrifying, but the lack of writing skills was too intrusive for me. No character development, and the dialog was stilted, and the descriptions and the asides were irritating, and the sentence structure was juvenile, AND... Actually reminded me of my children's writings in high school. Usually a good plot can overcome poor writing, but I could not continue past the first 200 pages. I hope Preston gets a ghost writer. His fertile imagination is wonderful, and I would enjoy his stories, as long as a skilled individual wrote the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where fact and fiction mingle, readers are left clueless","review":"With his whopper of a book -- The hot zone, Perston left me disappointed with this next one. He says in the start that some of the things are mentioned are facts, but what is fact and what is fiction is quite a gray area causing me, and probably others to believe things from his fantasy world might be true. Only after I did independent research did I learn that some of the things I was believing were pure fiction. The plot is mediocre with few suspenseful parts. Overall, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most terrifying book I have read in 1998!","review":"Stephen King and Dean Kootz - move over! Never have I been so terrified. I'm hooked on thrillers, but this one was too much. Back to Jonathan Kellerman, Ridley Scott, James Lee Burke and David Morrell for me. At least when I got through the books written by these authors, I didn't feel my life was at risk - like I did with Mr Preston! A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot=8.5;Character Development=4","review":"Preston has done quite a job of scaring the bejesus out of the reader with this and his previous \\"Hot Zone.\\" For the forensicly uninitiated, many scenes in this novel are graphic, intense, and quite literally visceral. Unfortunately, Preston has compromised the novel's effectiveness for a draft of a SciFi screen script sans character development. Still, I'm waiting for viral glass lozenges to appear at the HABA counter of my neighborhood druggist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty scary for those who shop flea markets!","review":"I have read a lot of books, but the first chapter of THE COBRA EVENT and the first chapter of THE HOT ZONE are the only reading material that ever gave me the dry heaves. I was scared more by the HOT ZONE, not because the scenario was more \\"real,\\" but because Preston's style in the previous book was more effective. THE COBRA EVENT has a great plot, but the long detours into facts, definitions, and explanations detract from driving the story forward. I prefer a story to be told as such, without the \\"data,\\" which could have been placed in a separate section at the end of the book. I would still recommend it (with misgivings about the blood-n-guts) because of the timeliness and plausibility of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the book so much, I hated to finish it!","review":"As the leader of the bomb disposal team for Los Alamos National Laboratory, I can verify that Mr. Preston's book, The Cobra Event, is definitely on the right track. His knowledge in the area of Chem/Bio devices amazes me. The research he performed while writing this book was extensive. The book is must reading for all first responders to an emergency response of this sort. I lends great credibility to the threat of a biological terrorist event right here in our own backyard. His plot is well thought out. The characters are real enough to be lifted right off the page and set into their real life roles. I spent many a night reading into the wee hours unable to put the book down. Heed Richard Preston's warning. It is not \\"IF\\" a terrorist event of this sort will happen upon U.S soil, it's \\"WHEN\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE AN EARTH WORM THAN A COBRA!!","review":"Not as striking as a Cobra! Preston is one of the best describers of technical material I've read but I'm not convinced (yet) that he's a novelist. Great theme and fascinating detail, but held back not so much by shallow characterisation (as other readers have complained) as by boring characters. Some of the descriptive passages are also boring, for example the interminalble passage covering the set up of Governor's Island. The shoot out in the tunnels is cliched to hell (hasn't even Patricia Cornwell done a subway shoot 'em up?)but I didn't mind it so much. Having said all that, I'll still give it a 7 because the subject was fascinating and the author believable"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not optional. You must read it.","review":"I can understand why this book frightened President Clinton. The storyline of a genetically engineered viral biological weapon is simply horrifying not only because of how Preston masterfully portrays its gruesome effects, but because this technology actually exists! The historical background he gives (of Soviet, US, and Iraqi biological weapons programs) is truly mind boggling with its implications for our present-day world. I felt that I was very up-to-date on biological weapons before reading this book but I learned several facts in this book about Iraq's development of biological agents that are just chilling.First read \\"The Hot Zone\\", and then read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, Hodgepodged, Forced","review":"Just finished the book. It took a bit of doing. This is the first book by Richard Preston that I've read, (I understand that his other books are nonfiction) and as novels go, this one didn't click. The point-of-view could change in mid-paragraph, the subject could suddenly change without letting the reader in on it. I felt like the story could have been more to my liking if it had just been more cohesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gory, not scary","review":"Despite what others will have you think, this book is neither terribly gory nor scary. The reviewers who thought so are either all terribly wussy, or are used to the tamest fiction imaginable.I'll agree that the *idea* of a virus that could make you eat yourself is frightening. I was expecting it to be better written and much more visceral, based on the reviews. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good journalism, bad literature","review":"Preston's skill is in presenting factual material in a dramatic way. But this talent is dissipated in fiction because it's very difficult for the reader to know what's real and what he's just made up. Add to this a complete inability to evoke character and creaky dialogue and you have a rather unsatisfactory novel. I much preferred his New Yorker articles to anything in this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, badly done romantic interest","review":"I must admit, I do enjoy reading about pathological diseases and their, ahem, effects. Richard Preston is excellent in that respect. But his \\"romantic side-plot\\" stank. I mean, lines like, \\"And suddenly she realized she wasn't thinking of him in an entirely professional light\\". Give me a break. The book was interesting, the story was great, I loved Archimedes and the disease, but Richard Preston needs to stop the feeble romance, a failing I've also noticed in \\"The Hot Zone\\". Read the book, but ignore the romantic melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big biological mess.","review":"It would be wonderful if the FBI and the CDC in Atlanta could work as smoothly together in reality as they do in this book. I found it too strange that the very first case of this newest virus is found almost immediately and suspected of being a biological weapon. This was the second time I have read the book, (hoping to get a little more out of it) and it just doesn't make much of a grade. The ending is a fast paced whirlwind of activity that does not match the rest of the book, and though some of the story does center on the actual human beings contracting this \\"virus\\", too much of the story is centered on the individual sleuths attempting to solve the puzzle and the mechanics of biological warfare. This aspect of the writing makes the book less of a good read and more of a definition of biological warfare, which can surpass the average layperson so easily that the reader can get lost quickly. Thumbs down, The Hot Zone was so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best Book I have ever Read in my entire Life!","review":"Me and two of my friends started this book and at first I thought it would be just a boring novel. I am only 14 years old and now I cant put the book down. This is such a good book. I am almost done and cant wait to finish it. This book makes me want to get into the field of biological warefare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring Virus Story","review":"Richard Preston has no ability to create a story that really keeps the interest of the reader. I love to read about anything and the central point of this book - biological warfare - could offer a great book. But that's not the case of Cobra Event. Extremely gore and galore in some points (like the suicide of Dr. Dudley), dull and heavy in other parts, Cobra Event is a book that neves takes off. Preston has a mamoth style of writing and it doesn't help to lift up the reader expectative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but no masterpiece.","review":"This book is easy to read, fun and flows well. That's about it. There is some modest success at character development, but nothing to shout about. Worth reading for the fun. Don't have high expectations. Not as interesting or exciting as THE HOT ZONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Lousy Reader!","review":"This is a gripping story and I am glad I chose it. However, I regret choosing the audio version since the reader, Blair Underwood, is so poor. He often rushes, and the rhythm and emphases he uses in his \\"narrator\\" vocal persona is unnatural to the point of being ridiculous.@He sounds more like a parent reading to a small child than a professional performer. I'm certainly overstating my case, but I am truly disappointed that such a fine story didn't get a more talented reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first half, but the players just seemed to get tired.","review":"I gave this book an eight, and now I'm thinking that could've been a little unfair. I LOVED the nonfiction parts (I could've read an entire book over what kind of weapons Iraq really has the Mr. Preston writes). The actual story line is extremely interesting-- up until a point. Sorry, Mr. Preston, but you don't have to end a thriller with a big chase scene and showdown. I would have been happy with Archimedes being caught in his apartment or shortly after he \\"escaped.\\" Everything else was letter perfect, although I must admit that it took me several days JUST to get through that autopsy near the beginning. (in fact, I actually read another book in the middle of it to get my mind off of it) If there is one message I have for the author, it is... PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE keep writing-- but make it SMART writing. Facts with fiction is good, very good. This book is very readable, just be watchful of graphic realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-researched, but devoid of any character developement","review":"There's nothing like a gripping thriller that keeps you reading until 4:00 in the morning. Unfortunately, the Cobra Event is not one of them. The setting and storyline are not only plausible, but intriguing. And Preston has done an exceptional job of research. But the characters are never fleshed out beyond their one-dimensional attributes, leaving the reader indifferent to their plight. Most importantly, the villain is given no rational motivation beyond some vague concept of \\"overpopulation.\\" It's hard to believe that anyone (even in a work of fiction) would go to these lengths for a motive so ill-defined."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This story struck me as an adolescent-like attempt to impress with excessive amounts of blood and gore. The plot itself was simplistic. The characters were fairly interesting and likable. But the only good thing going for this book was the action filled conclusion. Still, not worth wading through the main body of the story to get to the end. This book was wildly different from Preston's first book, The Hot Zone and a big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobra Event doesn't measure up","review":"I really looked forward to reading Cobra Event after having read Hot Zone and I am still looking forward to reading First Light. I applaud Richard Preston for the research necessary to write a book of this kind. However, I feel Mr. Preston would do well to stick to non-fiction. Cobra Event bordered at times on being just plain silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but a bit over the top in places","review":"I was intrigued by the primary topic of this book (biowarfare) and by the huge impact the author's previous book, The Hot Zone, had on everyone who read it. This one was not quiet as real, as Preston dipped into Steven King's inkwell a few too many times in an effort to make the story more chilling.

It is time for all of America to wake up and realize, how important it is to pay attention to where all these scientists who practic this line of work are and exactly what they are doing and why. Also which nations are experimenting and trying to perfect such bio weapons. This book is intense, it is realistic and it scared... me. Perhaps some reading it may not, be scared, but if you have half a brain you will have to really stop and think about how serious these issues are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Tale","review":"Preston's non-fiction works, \\"Hot Zone\\" and \\"Demon in the Freezer\\", are better. He brings an enthusiasm and readability to the subject of viruses and biowarfare that are, well, infectious. But he's just not a great writer of novels. His main characters --beautiful, smart, diffident, heroic, patriotic, and primed for action-- are little more than cardboard cutouts. The secondary characters are just names. Even the perpetrator in this book, the bad guy releasing the virus, is just a name and a description. Preston would have done well to start with the characters and then develop the plot from them, rather than vice versa. The science stuff is interesting, virology and autopsies and bio-reactors. It's a good tale, but not great fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only Preston Could Write Fiction","review":"The Cobra Event had the potential to be a good story but, unfortunately, it lacked an author who could write fiction. While Preston definitely is familiar with all the details about biological warfare, he has virtually no ability to develop and sustain a plot and in creating rich, interesting characters. All of his characters are cardboard-like figures. The publisher would have been more honest in marketing this book as a scientific documentary on biological warfare than as a suspense thriller. Save yourself the time and possible expense and skip The Cobra Event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but the plot falls flat","review":"The Cobra Event is worth the read (if you don't mind gore or horror) just for the science tidbits behind it, but the characters, plot, and writing style are absolutely nothing to write home about. Preston is a decent non-fiction writer; his writing style works well with non-fiction--the plot is already developed, the characters already exist, and the science is well expressed in the bare facts. (This isn't to suggest that non-fiction writing is easier.) Unfortunately, his efforts for fiction just fall flat. I felt like this book was a stripped down version of what someone else could have written given the premise. Preston should just stick to non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soliace for those in need.","review":"I remember back in 1991 reading this book while I was serving what was called an \\"in school suspension\\" I was in 10th grade. I do not think I understood all of it.. but I was captured by the powerful words. Some of what Rollins wrote about I would not understand until later on in my life. I still have the first printing of this book. It is ripped up and even has some blood stains on it in some places. I still pick this book up and try to imagine what it was like for him while he was writing this book. He was much younger than me and hardly famous.I feel that of all of Henry Rollins work this one allows you to feel his deepest emotions. He had nothing to hide or water down. This was it. The guy lived in a toolshed in someones backyard while writing this book. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"the game is more of the regular racing style its boring if your looking for true rally racing dont buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Funny!","review":"This will be our next game. Demo came out in PS2 mag. Game play is OK, sound effects a bit iffy (cars sound like they are electric). But the brit navigator is too funny, \\"you broke the F'bleep car\\". Hopefully will have an adult mode for real cuss words. My wife and I intentionally run into things to infuriate him. Ramming his door into the fence gets him going good. We have so much fun listening to him scream. Oh, if you destroy all the tires the car tends to track better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far from 'everyday' it's silly","review":"This is as far from everyday as you could possibly get. Recipes are complex and use gourmet ingredients, not everyday fare. Families watch out, this is not the book for you. A total waste of money for my picky eating child who can't have dairy. P-U - rename this to the GOURMET DAIRY FREE COOKBOOK and it's fine but with this title it's a huge miscue."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting recipes to try","review":"I checked this book out of the library and decided to buy it. I disagree that the recipes are too gourmet; I do happen to have things like turmeric, curry powder, cumin, ginger root, canned coconut milk, and pine nuts at home. I guess I'm weird. And you can always substitute for sunflower oil or pancetta with olive oil or bacon. Anyway, when you have to go dairy free you have to cook differently and try new things. I'm looking forward to trying the roasted parsnips with sesame and honey, sweet potato and chick pea cakes, and the moroccan lamb burgers (although I'll probably use turkey). The book definetly has different recipes in it and not just things I've seen over and over in other cookbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"I've used many of the recipes in this book even tho neither my family nor myself are lactose-intolerant. The recipes use what I consider to be ordinary, everyday spices like cumin, curry powder, cinnamon, etc. And ordinary, everyday ingrediants like eggplants, mushrooms, chicken, fish, nuts, breadcrumbs, parsley, etc. My family enjoys a wide variety of cuisines and it is my pleasure to prepare tasy recipes for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every day???? Please!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I would like to know who eats like this every day and who has the ingrediants in their pantries for these kind of eccentric/lavish meals.I'm really sorry I wasted my money.

We had a good laugh over the title of this cookbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"It's hard to believe Walken and Dafoe wasted their talent on this \\"film\\" and I use the word film lightly. Half an hour into watching, I had had enough but a friend who expected better things to come compelled me to keep viewing. Not only did better things not come, the movie sunk to further depths of depravity. Not only was the plot miserable, the sound quality was awful and the lighting atrocious. In one scene due to inept lighting you can hardly see the actors because of the darkness shadowing their faces. Mood setting is one thing but obscuring the actors quite another. What a colossal disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's dull alright","review":"I was so bored watching two men who think they are cool get their egos stroked. A couple of ugly sleazeballs and an Italian actress every bit the ideal playmate and she just wants to please. Yuk. The film is slow and actionless. The plot seems to be an excuse for banal titillation. Someone should tell those guys these type of women fake it everytime in bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film for cinematographers","review":"An excellent film, but not for the faint of heart, New Rose Hotel requires a level of concentration usually reserved for literature.

Not much of a plot. A waste of good actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid mess","review":"An unbelievable mess, this incredibly confusing movie makes Ferrara previous \\"The Blackout\\" a model of narrative clarity. This shoddy movie is one of the reasons that Ferrara has become more and more a marginal figure (his films are now barely released in the US). The reason why actors of the caliber of Dafoe and Walken starred and produced this movie is beyond me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a look are a few nude scenes from the beautiful Asia Argento."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst screenplay EVER.","review":"What a waste of talent coming from a cast of (usually) wonderful actors. Walken & Dafoe in endless incoherent banter. The beautiful Asia Argento, who is Italy's most famous actress is miscast in this horrible mess. What a shame! I have seen the work of all these actors but this one is a huge, awful attempt to be artistic. Director Abel Ferara, who has made one of my most favorite movies (like Bad Lieutenant w/ Harvey Keitel) thoroughly dissapoints me in this shoddy piece. Everything is tacky, including the quality of the film. This is by far, the worst movie by a talented director made w/ three awesome actors EVER made. Rent it but do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Abel Ferrera, even Walken couldnt help this one!","review":"Im a huge Ferrera fan, i love his dark, no light at the end of the tunnell aproach to filmaking... howver this movie is just terrible! I mean really freaking bad. Like, the worst I have ever seen. Walken couldnt help it, and neither could Dafoe.Whether its Neo-punk or not shouldnt even matter, this movie is HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a new tool of torture...","review":"It took me 4 separate sessions to sit through this abortion. I've read Neuromancer, so I'm not ignorant of Gibson's work. I don't care if this movie is a great adaptation of the book...that just tells me that the book must be equally as boring.The \\"eroticism\\" is cheesy, the story meanders... it's as if noone was really interested in making this. If so, it shows.If this had been a low budget b-movie, it might have had \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" potential. Nope.I didn't want to even give it 1 star, really, but I'll say it's for the minor nudity & the so-so performances by Walken & Dafoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew! Boring!","review":"Ugh, I didn't even finish watching this movie. It's incredibly *BORING*. We enter the movie with two people halfway through a conversation, and it gets more confusing from there. The plot is minimal, at best, and the movie is basically a bunch of idiotic nonsensical conversations and sex scenes. Forunately, they weren't at the same time. Avoid this trash at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book... with a suckish ending","review":"I am a huge fan of tokyo mew mew. I have all the books and i just bought the second vol of TMM ala mode today. I was waiting forever for this book to come out cause I wanted to find out what happened. I can say the second volume is decent but the ending in tokyo mew mew is WAY better (the fight scene with deep blue)SPOILERS AHEAD:In the end of the 2nd volume there is no fight scene! the crusaders just give up without a fight--wtf?! i was expecting a action packed ending like at the end of the 7th volume. that is why i gave this book 4 stars--but mia ikumi-san ends the book with extra comics--petit mew mew (with berry and special guest--MEW RINGO!)and a new ikumi manga--rabbits starfall. so its still a good book but i think mia-san could have improved the ending a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious George Costume","review":"I really loved this costume for my son. He looked adorable in it! The quality is good and held up while trick or treating a couple of times. My only complaint is the sizing chart. I would only recommend this for a child who is between 2-2 1/2 max. It says it goes up to age 4, unless your child is on the small side I would not buy it. My son just fit into it and it was a little snug around the neck area."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Being Pagan","review":"This book seems to be more about what this guy has learned and who he has learned it from then on being pagan. I can honestly say I have learned nothing from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding narrative history","review":"This great narrative history of King Charles' trial and execution (during the English Revolution of the 1640s) sets the standard for readability without sacrificing detailed research. It also has the best discussion of the London popular press of that era that I have read anywhere, including Christopher Hill. This book has been reissued as \\"A Coffin for King Charles\\" -- look for copies under that title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an especially good read.","review":"After being spoiled by Goodkind, Hobb, McKiernan, Fallon...this was not what I was expecting.

They are amazingly accurate, every happening seems to be researched, every thing is thought out. The way this series describes magic is so belivable, so...logical. the book, as all the books in her series, is so intense, i always seem to be thinking how the hell are they going to pull this off? and she makes it fit together perfectly. If you love magic, dragons, fantasy, mystery, you will love all of her books.I fully recommend this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I wouldn't say this was a BAD book--well, not an AWFUL book--but it definitely was not a very compelling story. I didn't finish it (I know, you're thinking, \\"don't knock it till you've read it!\\") but this is one of the few books that has EVER failed to hold my interest until the end. It's not romantic, even in the love scenes; it's not exciting, even in the chase scenes; it's not filled with interesting concepts, even in the \\"magic\\" scenes... It's just bland, bland, bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't walk blindly into this light","review":"I picked up this light a few months back for my Sony VX2000 (which captures both digital and still images). While the range of the light was moderate for video, it worked reasonably well for nearby photos in the dark. It seemed to drain my battery rather quickly. That was to be expected...but it was even faster than I thought before the battery light would start blinking.So after some moderate use at one event, I brought my batteries home and realized they would charge just a little and stop. This thing seemed to KILL my InfoLithium batteries! The workaround I discovered (which I'm not sure it quite works) is to take the light off and turn the camera to VCR mode and play video until the battery REALLY died. Then I'd be able to give the battery a full charge and that seems to return them to normal...pretty much.I'd recommend if you get this light (or any similar) that you try it out with your cheapest battery first to see if you have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest?","review":"I love Swingout Sister ever since I was a little girl in Oakland...this cd is missing some of their best songs!

First saw it as a kid; it made a big impression on me. I searched for years for this video, finally found a copy in Winnipeg, Canada. Watched it but the ending was not what I remembered. I tried to figure out why and in my detective work was given the home phone number of the director Anthony Harvey by a journalist (I didn't realize it was his number till I phoned!). Mr. Harvey explained when I talked to him that the original theatrical release had 10 minutes chopped off it (they thought it was to long), despite the directors objections).

It was very powerful and somewhat disturbing. The romantic elements weren't there too much, but the acting was superb and humourous. I heard about the cut-out scene from the supermarket without which the movie made no sense, but I think that the most crucial scene is the scene in the taxi when Gearge C.

I'm frantically hunting for a text of the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"More than just a movie about a man who thinks he is literally Sherlock Holmes - a social commentary worth watching.

Such an enjoyable movie, well-written script, good direction, etc. And the ending - leaves you surprised is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Good Plastic","review":"George C.

Joanne Woodward, a psychiatrist named Dr. Watson, tries to help George C. Scott, who sees threats all around him. The title metaphor comes from Cervantes, but Conan Doyle provides the major framework. Scott is a former judge who thinks he is Sherlock Holmes, pursuing Moriarty, the epitome of evil. Each step of pursuit through the city shows reality a little differently, wittily, sardonically, poignantly. (Jack Guilford's brief Scarlet Pimpernel is a special gem.) No sex; no violence; just a joyous relief from the ordinary. Unfortunately, the video is still too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemp double stack-great flip flop!","review":"This flip flop is very comfy and provides great heal support.

The dungeons are all flat paneled, straight out of Wolfenstein. The fight scenes are slow and repetitive, and get boring after twenty minutes.

I wore them everywhere and received multiple compliments. There was never a breaking in period and the cushion and heel back area was incredible comfortable. I purchased a new navy pair and a black pair earlier this year for the spring season and the quality of the shoe has changed. Not only did I get blisters and blood stains on the shoes but the material is obviously different in the heel back area. I have tried wearing them around the house to break them in but I can only take them for about 15 minutes at a time. Wish I could return shoes that do that to my feet. It is like they get your money and see you later! Do not recommend which is too bad. Softspots were my favorite.

The original VHS and BETA versions were presented in glorious DOLBY SURROUND STEREO but not in the original Panavision 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, but the horrendous pan' n' scan 4.3. The DVD preserves the correct widescreen aspect ratio but is presented in MONO. The import DVD is no different. For some reason Paramount only provided a mono widescreen print for worldwide DVD release.

Gulls were killed in making this film; they were deliberately dashed on rocks, thrown into the sea, and put into fights. This film, of course, was from the days before the American Humane Society started monitoring the use of animals in films. Still, that doesn't excuse the cruelty. I was EXTREMELY disturbed at some of the scenes and had to force myself to watch the film all the way through. I'm amazed that this film is considered a \\"family film\\" - I'm sure children would be disturbed at some of the scenes of bloodied and dead gulls. As Gandhi so wisely said, \\"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"CD - Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"I received the CD 2 days after placing the order.

Meaningless footage of seagulls (and nothing but), Neil Diamond at his most saccharine, new age glurge at it most repellent passing as philosophy. Ugh.But what gets this awful, yet not even laughable, picture more than a single star from me from is the desperation of 70s Hollywood to try something different, and it doesn't get much more different than this, and that they would put this bomb on DVD.A turkey in every sense of the word.

All it consists of is a big ocean, and then a seagull with voiceover saying, \\"I gotta try, I gotta try...\\" and then the seagull flying while Neil Diamond sings, \\"SEEEEEAAA--GUUUUUULLLLLLL.....\\" and then the seagull lands in some wretched nature scene like other seagulls eating garbage or fighting, then he says, \\"I gotta try, I gotta try...\\" and flies again, and Neil Diamond goes, \\"SEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAA--GUUUUUUULLLLLL!!!!!!!!\\" and then the same thing happens over and over. I admit I couldn't watch the whole thing. I read a review by Roger Ebert, and he said that he left the theater during the film. Now I see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinatingly bad","review":"The main reason I'm giving this film one star is that I can't take stars away from it. If I could I would.This is, without doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.A reasonably well written story (tho' a little stomach churningly New Age for my tastes) is given the prison shower treatment in this train wreck of a movie which has as its most prominent features some of the worst songs Neil Diamond ever wrote (honestly, he should be extremely embarrassed by that rubbish!) and a very very creepy voice over.For me, the best part of the whole film was when someone in the room remarked that the aforementioned voice over sounded like an obscene phone call, and the very next line was \\"I can see everything!\\"Avoid this film at all costs, unless you are copiously supplied with recreational pharmaceuticals. Even then, you still may want to give it a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie, Better Message","review":"This is a movie for the SOUL.

This album remains their statement, with quick, funny songs and clever lyrics. Barely 30 minutes in length, it does the rare feat of pouring on the buzzy energy while delivering on memorable songs. Their debut is generally thought to be a classic.This recording has a special significance for fans. In their early career, live performances were miraculous mirror copies of their record, showing a tightness and control unequaled by their peers.

To this day, that album remains my favorite LP of all time. She truly had the voice of an angel. Along with the late great Minne Riperton and Deniece Williams they were \\"Wonderlove\\", Stevie's backup singers. Stevie knows talent!! Now we only have one angel still down here with us. Minne and Syreeta, R.I.P. I love your voices and I miss them dearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated Vocalist","review":"Syreeta has long been one of my favorite vocalists. When I first heard her on her debut lp, which I bought because of the Stevie Wonder production and knowing of her songwriting with him, I knew she had it. Her crystal, youthful voice is such a joy to hear. The highlights from that lp are heard here- \\"To Know You..\\", \\"I Love Every Little..\\" are superb. Here charm carries throughout.

Ok you got the Billie Preston duet but come on folks, get with the program get this album, get these downloads so I can get Blame it on the Sun and Let Me Be the One.

The blade is on the left side and it eats batteries like crazy. It is not very powerful either. The light is the best piece of the entire set. All in all I'm pretty disappointed with Milwaukee on this one. I buy Milwaukee tools exclusively because they usually last. I think the higher voltage sets are not as good as say the 12 or 14 volt sets. The batteries really are ackwardly designed.
