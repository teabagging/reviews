If I could build/setup a mythtv box from scratch with no problems I definitely didn't think this could be a challenge, but was I wrong. The drivers out of the box didn't work at all. After installing newer ones from ati's website I just kept getting an error with ATIMMC.exe. This was the first time I'd ever bought an ATI card and it's definitely going to be the last. Always avoided them cos they tend to have problems with linux but I guess they can't even get their cards to work in windows and to make matters worse their customer service is woeful.

It provides a clear and detailed introduction to hedge funds useful to investors and to anybody with an interest in understanding how hedge funds work. The book is math-free, but thinking is not optional. I like the summary of hedge fund strategies and the description of their returns and weights in the universe of hedge funds. Unfortunately, one has to hope that the chapter and the charts will be updated frequently for they will be soon obsolete. As this book definitely deserves to see more editions, I hope that the author will go through the trouble to include both more examples and more details for each of the eleven strategies. That would definitely make the book more appealing to those readers with sophisticated backgrounds and useful to be used in classrooms as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Brief","review":"This book provides an overview of hedge fund structures, strategies, and investing.

What Mr. Trelease failed to mention was the disturbing imagery of children carrying guns and dead animals slung over hunters' shoulders. I don't allow my son to have toy guns and I desperately try to filter the steady diet of violence our society thoughtlessly feeds to our children.

It basically predates the Internet as we know it. Most of the companies mentioned in this book seem to have gone out of business or have exited the 900 number business.900 ain't what it used to be.

It might very well be China. Company is German-based but that does not mean a thing in today's world. If the item were German-made, Germans would not be embarrassed to stamp it on the stainless steel. There is no stamp as to the country of origin. Neither is there a sign on the packaging to point to the country of origin.I just hope it is not radioactive.

It is protected by styrofoam and the box was heavy damaging from UPS. When I opened the box to pull the thing out, the styrofoam flew everywhere covering my whole room and broke apart in my hands trying to take out the stand.Then I noticed when assembling the stand, that the bottom 2 shelves had broken off from those circular metal tabs you bolt on from behind.

It kind of just went along and eventually I was at the end, but I still didn't really see a story; just a lot of tangents that didn't fit too coherently together. Parts of the story even seemed to contradict each other and the people in the book weren't described very well.

Our rabbits systematically destroyed many electrical chords as I raced to find the best bunny-proofing material available. I saw this product and immediately ordered it, not really noticing the \\"citrus\\" fragrance.As soon as I opened the box I was overwhelmed with a not-unpleasant detergent smell that then turned into a horrible bug spray/perm solution funk that gave me a headache. I figured it would fade and used it to cover a laptop chord. It seems to work fine ( although one bunny sniffed it for a long time in great interest; she may be eating it soon) but the whole apartment reeks now.I've been out in the fresh air for an hour and I still can't get the scent out of my nose.I'm very disappointed.Yes, it does the job but so would unscented pvc tubing, without the olfactory torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells REAL BAD -- for a LONG TIME","review":"It was not worth stinking up the entire house to keep the cat from biting the wires.

That is how strong the first 4 tracks are. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good melodic glitchy house...","review":"Around the House is a really nice record of loungey, fresh house music with somewhat glitchy instrumentation. A lot of glitchy stuff can be kind of clinical and alienating, this however is very human and inviting due to Dani's excellent, soulful vocals.Some criticisms I have with this album are that the mastered level is very quiet and the tracks have a lot of noise... not really a big deal but if you put any of these songs on a mix tape they'd be practically drowned out by any other song.Overall, a great album, very good music to chill out to or perhaps fold your laundry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodily Functions = Brilliant - AroundTheHouse = Not So Much","review":"I first bought Herbert's Bodily Functions CD. If you like ambient or downtempo music and you like jazz (i.e. Coltrane, not Kenny G)then run out and buy Bodily Functions immediately. It is really a great CD. It is intelligent and sometimes transporting music made with sequencers(and rounded out with more traditional instruments). Often a song will start with a simple electronic beat, but as it progresses it is layered with vocals and jazz chords, until it has acheived a real musicality often not present in electronic music.So I was excited to hear AroundTheHouse, but wound up being disappointed. It has none of the beautiful jazz improv present in Bodily Functions, and the sequencing just doesn't reach the same heights. I suggest avoiding this earlier effort. Also check out Herbert's Secondhand Sounds- it has great Herbert remixes of other artist's songs. It is also highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding approach to marketing based on value...","review":"You know a book is having an extradinary effect when you see managers walking the halls with it -- postits coming out of every corner -- saying things like \\"This is my Bible...\\" Based on a significant amount of field research, this book has got real insighnts you can use in getting down to what customers really, really value -- and will pay for.

Your brain definitely stays awake as he shifts his attention from one to the other. \\"The Red Pavilion\\" takes place on \\"Paradise Island\\", a town in which the main industry is the selling of pleasure--sort of a Las Vegas of ancient China. Between current murders and murders of the past, the Judge has his hands full, and with only one of his usual four assistants he is a busy guy.I enjoyed the interesting characters of the various courtesans, bouncers, businessmen, and mysterious beggars no end. His Excellency is not beyond making a guess at a solution and then proving himself wrong, which is quite refreshing in detective novels. If you like detective novels combined with ancient culture, you may well enjoy these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every mom and pediatrician should have this book","review":"This book simplified my life. I have four children and the youngest started showing signs of autism at a young age. I had an extremely hard time getting a pediatrician to listen and my concerns were put aside. I was told that \\"he is a boy and he will catch up\\" instead of taking the initiative and listening to the instincts of a four time mom. Step 7 helped me learn how to choose another pediatrician, and Step 10 taught me how to negotiate an integrated partnership with my physician who listens to my needs. I liked the charts throughout the book especially the daily log chart in Step 1. Now I monitor and chart my son's behaviors daily and I am prepared to discuss his development when I meet with the doctor. I found Step 6, Interventions and Therapies, fascinating because it covers all types of programs including educational, medical and biomedical. I could have used this book when my son first received his diagnosis. Now I use it daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it a Bounty Hunter Gold Nugget Search Coil???","review":"I received the coil on time as always when it comes to purchasing products from Amazon. However, this particular item leaves me with a serious question. According to the photo, there is the trade mark BOUNTY HUNTER logo. With the coil I received, there is no logo at all...nothing. Its solid black from top to bottom. So Im not sure if I received a knock off or if it is actually a Bounty Hunter brand. The coil seems to work fine (used it in the back yard for about 10 min). Ill get a better idea of its use later this week. But again, it seemed to work fine. I give this item a four only because Im not sure if its a Bounty Hunter brand or not.

I tested it and it worked no differently then the one that came on your metal detector. If you need it to get into smaller spaces then it will work for that purpose but it will not pick up gold nuggets unless they are whoppers like 5 grams + and that is rarely found. Even then your other coil that comes with your bounty hunter would work the same as this little one. I would not invest money in this unless you need it for small spaces. This will not pick up small nuggets. I am a avid miner and have tested it on gold. save yourself the $40 and save up for a tesoro compadre which will pick up small nuggets and it is only $160 free shipping on amazon and ebay.

True, the book is loaded with facts that we didn't know before,...but being absolute DIEHARD fans of Sir Bolton outside of listing albums and songs, correct syntax, every plug for Joyce's fan club,...and the attitude in general that all Michael Bolton is...is BEEFCAKE! Our preference for a book about Michael Bolton is MICHAEL BOLTON by Lee Randall, which delves more into his career and early hardships,...and whose binding holds up more than 2 days.

It's obvious that the author did not really test the recipes--for example, the sesame/anise bread for St. Joseph's Day calls for 4 cups flour, 6 eggs, 2 cups water, and 1/2 cup of melted shortening. Anyone who knows how to cook would know instantly that you will not end up with a kneadable dough with those quantities but rather a form of library paste.

The amount of detail about each place was well balanced between mundane business and exotic cultural/geographical details.The strength of the family connections pulling them 'home' contrasting with their goals of seeing the 'world' was significant for those of us toying with the idea of selling up and following in their footsteps.

In a country music industry of George Stait and Garth Brooks wanna be's, it is refreshing to have a band with a sound and groove all it's own. This album consists of music ranging from country like the track: He Don't Need to Know About Me, to ballads like River Town, to the blues influenced Buck these Haggard Blues and Praying to Live. There is also a hidden track at the end of the CD that is just a rockin instrumental in the tradition of Carlos Santana and ZZ Top.

As to the interviews themselves, they are mostly fascinating, Chomsky proves once again that he may be the most important intellectual of the latter half of the 20th century. My one complaint is that some of the interviews overlap, as he is asked to speak multiple times on a number of topics, he is asked what the conncection between his linguistic work and his political work is about twenty times for instance, as the title would suggest.

Claire is so real and Trevelyan is a character that jumps from the page. He is not your typical \\"romantic\\" hero. The scene where he admits to Claire he loves her is one I can hear spoken in real life. I can close my eyes and imagine that this conversation has been uttered between countless \\"real\\" couples. Ahhhhh, it is so refreshing and touching.The one theme that touched me deeply was the discussion of loneliness. So many time the heros and heroines of romantic fiction have so much going for them BEFORE they meet the \\"one\\" that it is hard to relate to. This novel is not that way. Everyone can relate to the universal theme of loneliness. Sure there are Scots, castles, murder plots, etc. but deep down this is a story of two lonely people finding eachother.Wonderful wonderful wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Romance","review":"I read this book for the first time several years ago.

I think they are unfounded. We are not talking about an earth shattering biography or an epic tale.

The Duchess made me angry at both the Heroine and the hero. I could never connect with Claire, JD failed to show any bond between the Brat and Claire, at the end when Claire had to decide who to marry, it was all about her little sister and if she was left penniless. The relationship between Vellie and Claire was disturbing all the time and when he tells her he might not be able to be monogamous, she didn't have a problem with it. Even though she was extremely jealous when another woman entered the story. Nothing about this book made sense.

According to the Rough Guide to Reggae, it collects the best tracks from both of those albums.The sound quality of these dubs is clear and deep; they are truly a pleasure to listen to.

The info about producer and musicians seems to be correct.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Demo quality throughout","review":"This is a collection of demos, not a finished album.

Books dealing with relationships where one partner is disabled often are puerile and totally unrealistic. From personal experience, I can say that this is a terrible shame. Disabilities are infinitely varied but, in the end, mutual acceptance, courage, patience and love are what make such relationships work and these are the themes which make wonderful romantic books. Readers who are interested in this particular theme may like to seek out a copy of Lyn Dycoty's Pocketful of Dreams - an old Harelquin Temptation title from 1984 which is one of the few books I've read that comes up to Ms Robinson's standards. I hope other authors are encouraged to tell such stories with such honesty and integrity.

There is some of the worst acting I've seen in my life in this, but at the same time it was so bad it was rather entertaining, overacting equals humur, at least here it does.

Overall advoid this film unless you have a soft spot for poo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say Cheese!","review":"This is pure 80's cheese. I love 80's movies but I can't recommend this one. It's about a kid in highschool who is the anti-Christ and the arc-angels who try to stop him from coming to power. The acting is good and bad with some good special effects for its time. It takes almost 75 minutes to get to the payoff which is too long for a horror film. The dead rising from the graves was cool but not enough to save this film.

Bob and Larry try to explain why so many bad things happen to good people. Bob wants a straight Bible story and Larry wants a western. They compromise and THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JOE is the result. The film contains all the great humor and heart that have made Veggie Tales so special and popular. This episode includes the Silly Song of \\"Belly Button\\" sung by the In the Sink Boys. The song is hilarious and reminds one of the famous \\"Hamburger\\" song from a few years ago. Perhaps Mr. Lunt should sing more love longs. This is a great Veggie Tale episode and the DVD is a welcome addition for any collection. Kids love the Veggie Tales and so do adults.

The Ballad of Little Joe is full of fun and just as entertaining for adults as for children. I laughed out loud at the Boyz in the Sink song \\"Belly Button\\"! The main story, a western retelling of the Bible classic Joseph and his coat of many colors, is wonderful and brings with it an excellent lesson on keeping the faith, even when life seems to go against you.

While this DVD does not include many bonuses it is, at least, affordable.The documentary works, I think, like an artist statement. The viewer gets a strong sense of what inspired the artist, and how he understands his works' relevance to society.The artist, if not obvious from the amazon description is primarily concerned with post industrial landscapes. This means functioning and abandoned factories, gravel pits, computer waste sites. The most savory image in the documentary is, I think, a small Chinese village where a group of older citizens stand hunched over gigantic mounds of computer waste. Each mother board is heated until all the salvageable metals are stripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"This movie is created mostly based on slides and photos. It is incredibly slow with very little commentary. From the very beginning, it shows a huge Chinese factory floor for six to seven minutes with no comment nor music. The camera just walked through the entire floor from one end to the other. You can actually fast forward through the entire movie without missing much.The deleted scenes and comments were more interesting than the movie itself.

The movie is sometimes a little slow but maybe you want it to finish faster so that you can go back to your way of consumming as usual. It will be hard to discard your cellphone without a thought, or turn on your engine to go and buy bread, the images will hover above your shoulder and haunt you like a gardian angel warning you \\"do not do it!\\".Two of the most amazing scenes besides the opening one are: the destruction by its own dwellers of the houses that will be flooded by the building of the Big Dam and the dismantling of the old oil tankers in Bnagladesh.

On the other hand, the second one was a deserved homage to Henry Purcell with motive of being celebrating his 250th anniversary. And what better homage than write a chaconne in the last movement?.I still have to deplore The Allegri Quartet version has not released on CD format, which it is a pity, because perhaps we are talking about one of their most celebrated musical achievements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky","review":"The best word to describe the Axiom 25 is *clunky*.

I've got to turn up my monitors or wear headphones to drown out the horrible clacking keys. The 8 percussion pads and 8 endless rotary knobs are a redeeming factor though, and for the price I should probably complain a little less.

Hamilton-ish in the cinematography, hazy edges and soft lighting dull the senses before the big moment - the rather beautiful lead singer - who is not quite what she seems.

During this time the woman dreams of another existence, this one set in the modern world. The second story involves a woman in the \\"modern\\" time period who unexpectedly finds herself a sex slave. Both women dream of each other, it would seem. Though not everything is as it seems. ..The drawing is quite good, nothing appears to be censored.

His illustrations are beautifully realistic and the action is fast and furious. Dreams of Cecilia is a series of vignettes about a beautiful young woman who daydreams herself from erotic fantasy to erotic fantasy where she is captured and forced to service multiple men. In so doing, Cecilia is forced to recognize and accept her innermost sexual desires.Although the book has a very strong Domination & Submission storyline, there are relatively few depictions of S&M leather gear or complex bondage equipment. If you want more bondage, try Michael Manning. Dreams of Cecilia focuses more on portraying beautiful people in a series of hardcore sexual scenes. The illustration is better quality than Kevin Taylor but the girls are more passive.

Then John should't have been in their and made it kinda a love story slash army story romance isnt always needed. Their is nothing i hate more then a hard core army story mixed with love it just doesnt work. Then the end was weak some may say it was good but it was a very weak plot. It was just thrown in to make people happy oh noone died how nice.

But it get's really confusing with all the plot twists and plot holes it has throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra-Contrived","review":"This flick was so convoluted and ultra-contrived that I have to think the only purpose the director had in mind was to totally confuse and deceive the viewer into a narcoleptic trance. Absolutely devoid of flow, and even though the action sequences are bearable, after the third or fourth flashback- you just find yourself thinking what else is there I could be watching instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching","review":"Definitely a very good movie, Basic, is a military mystery that brings to the screen the story of a U.S. Ranger training mission gone awry in Panama. Subsequently, an ex-Ranger is teamed up with the base investigator to try and shed light on the mysterious circumstances that led to the near annihilation of the entire squad.The film combines drama, mystery, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Connie Nielsen, Giovanni Ribisi, Brian Van Holt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching! Strongly recommended along with Black Hawk Down, A Few Good Men, Rules of Engagement, and Courage Under Fire. 4 1/2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"had the potential","review":"this movie had the potential to be a great movie. it failed. the plot seems great but it's just average for a murder mystery. i liked it up until the ending and then i was like what the hell just happenned. i don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"This film tried hard, but it kept missing. The pacing of the film is way, way too fast. The twists and turns of the story are fired at you bullet-style and I just couldn't keep up. When the end finally arrived, I STILL didn't know what exactly had happened. There were critical scenes missing which would have tied it all together. Too many things didn't add up. Inconsistencies galore. And I don't know what the other reviewer meant by John Travolta being \\"slim and trim\\" here-- he looked fat and bloated to me, and showing his age. He always plays the young cocky guy in every one of his films, but in this one he is the washed-up, ex-cocky guy, which I guess is perfect since he can't keep up with the younger crowd now. Jackson plays the usual loud-mouth character, so there wasn't any real surprise there, either. All things considered, I recommend skipping it entirely. There are far better \\"thrillers\\" out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist, twist, twist,..ah screw it","review":"I rented this movie thinking it could not be that bad seeing as Samuel L. Jackson and J.T were in it. Boy was I wrong. This movie is so bad. The most damaging aspect are the plot twists. I like a good twist just as much as the next man but in this movie there is a twist about every 15-20 minutes and they don't make any sense. At the end of the movie i was lost and that would not be a bad thing if the twists were logical but they were not and so i did not care. Towards the end of the movie it seems the director or writer or whoever just said screw it and gave up on making an ending that would explain everything that happened in the movie. Its very bad. Don't buy this movie, rent it at best.ALSO: I enjoyed the movie \\"wild things\\" because the twists all fit so maybe watch that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair movie with lousy ending","review":"SOME of the acting is good, if you can overlooked the fact that the provost Marshal's accent comes and goes in every other scene, but the ending ruins a fair movie.WIthout giving away the \\"twist\\" if you accept that the ending, then the entire rest of the film makes no sense what-so-ever.

First its a murder mystery, then its a conspiracy thriller then its a psychological thriller then it turns into something else entirely at the end.The producers of this goofy film forgot the basics of filming mysteries: audiences enjoy them more if you actually give them clues and offer up logical plot twists. This mess does'nt do any of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense and ingenuity","review":"Basic is anything but that - it proves to be the very antithesis of its title with its bizarre and constantly twisting and changing storyline. I believe Newton once said: With every cause, there comes an equal or greater effect. Well, while watching this movie you're constantly refiguring the outcomes when the variables continue to change - so much so that it almost makes you dizzy! Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dead on as Army Rangers - the supporting cast is superb as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness of the plot and the good acting.If you mix Black Hawk Down with The Usual Suspects you come out with Basic. Worth a look-see for all military buffs - just be prepared to pay VERY close attention to detail. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 1/2 Stars","review":"This movie has a relatively interesting premise with good actors and relatively good execution. The problem with this movie is that it makes no sense.If you like plain action, this might be ok, however, I found myself pausing this movie every ten seconds to ask the person I was watching it with what had just happened. The movie consists of the same scene repeated ten times, from a different point of view.The characters are believable, the only problem is that the watcher has no idea what is to be believed. The twists are so numerable, and minor characters unknown and vague that it is impossible to follow. (Toward the end two characters even switch names!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a mess","review":"The thought of trying to explain the plot of this movie is exhausting. In fact, I don't know if I could even if I tried. A bunch of soldiers go into the jungle; only two come out--maybe. Or maybe not. The plot twists and twists until it finally has no shape. Even if I could have understood it, the characters are given little-to-no development or backstory, so I simply didn't care what happened to whom or why. I'm a smart and patient viewer, but I felt like this movie wasted my time being convoluted instead of clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic... WASTE OF TIME","review":"Before watching the movie, check out the \\"Extras\\" where no one involved in the movie can even agree with what the movie is about. They can't even agree what \\"genre\\" the movie is.Basically the movie meanders on with EVERY character lying for the whole length of the movie - is Sam dead, alive, good, bad? Who done it or DIDN'T do it? Why?The REAL question should be why was this junk even made? Why did Travolta & Jackson even bother. The movie provides Travolta with his worst role since Vinny Barbarino and Jackson his worst role since appearing regularly on the Pee Wee Herman Playhouse with Geri curls. Don't these guys believe that they have more talent than this?Quote: People mistake me for Laurence Fishburne all the time.

Jackson's performance makes this an alright movie but there are two many plot twists for the average viewer","review":"Basic is another failure of a film from director John McTiernan. McTiernan who used to make good movies like Preadtor, Die Hard & Die Hard 3 hasn't made a good movie since Die Hard 3 spins this confusing film. On one hand I do give the director respect for his attempt to make an uodated version of Rashmon but he film lacks the action sequences McTiernan is known for. The performances by Connie Nelson is horrible and she has a bad accent as for John Travolta he seems bored but as always Samuel L.Jackson delviers the good. The trailer spoils a lot for the film but trust me you try to figure out something in the film your head will hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic deception","review":"This is by far Travolta's best movie since \\"Face-off\\". Basic is almost impossible to predic, that's what I love about this moive, not many thrillers can do that anymore. The ending was great! Much better ending than \\"Identity\\", why? because it is not a let down, many movies now days end with you saying what's was the point, for one Tarantino's movies(Pulp Fiction), even if their not bad movies they always living you saying what's the point. Another great thing about basic is the cast, Academy Award nomine Sam Jackson and the very hot Connie Nielsen, she sould be in more stuff. Once Agian Travolta's has made another winner! He relly has proved to be one of the best actors of all time. If you like this movie, try out \\"The General's Daughter\\", \\"Snake Eyes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, but not basic in this movie","review":"I'm not going to explain the movie cause other people have.

Jackson's character missing in combat. Kinda like the General's Daughter in the sense that they get answers from witnesses and even killers.

In fact, it's not even worth watching even once. The script is dreadful, trying desperate to be clever, but succeeding only to bore the viewer. Samuel L.

The plot was intriguing and it kept me thinking through out the movie but unfortunatly I believe that the movie was not well commercialed and released at a time when people only went to the cinema to waste their money and did not really care for the story within so for some people Basic was too complicated to understand.

And then of course the weird, quirky, gay intellectual (played by Giovani Ribisi) who would NEVER even attempt to complete Ranger School... And Samuel Jackson just plain sucks. If you want to make yourself a movie with generic written all over it. Get Samuel Jackson to star in it. Yeah. He plays the same annoying loud mouth jackass in EVERY movie.

And yes, as one reviewer pointed out, there are some awfully silly and trite comments/jokes that seem to be geared towards women who haven't set foot out of their house in 10 years. Further, it was published in 2004, yet they keep referring to the \\"Classified\\" want ads. From much of the content, I was surprised this book was not much older."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Having read all of Dean Koontz novels to date I was greatly disappointed in this one. It starts out OK (just ok) moves on to ordinary and ends in way below average. It almost seems that the author reviewed it after 300 pages, decided it was a dud, and felt that he should end it as soon as possible. It won't put me off racing out to get his next one when it is released, but I wouldn't recommend this one to friend or foe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best...","review":"After reading Dark Rivers of the Heart followed by Intensity, I eagerly awaited Dean Koontz's next novel. Disappointment is the word that comes to mind. I did not like the ending at all. It started good, was mediocre (at best) half way through and ran out of gas at the end. I wouldn't recommend this book to a \\"first time\\" Dean Koontz reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put the book down.","review":"There was a lot of suspense and I believe that the topic was very interesting. I think that it was one of Koontz's better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz's Worst","review":"This book starts out good, not great but good, and then falls very short. Obviously he got the victim characters from our last big airline disaster which killed a young mother and her two daughters. This novel is poorly written, has too many cliches and senseless analogies. The plot becomes more and more ridiculous half way into the book.The characters are not fully rendered and it is very hard to identify with them. The ending is a flop and leaves one with a wish that they had never opened the cover. I am very surprised that a quality publisher such as Knopf chose to pick this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Koontz book ever!","review":"I listen to the audiotape of this book and was boring as the drive I was making (between Ely Nevada and Salt Lake City Utah). Dean Koontz is my favorite author but this is his worst book. The ending is very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I just got done reading Sole Survivor by Dean Koontz and was overall disappointed. I read and own his book Watchers (which I think is an awesome book) and this one no where compares to it. Sole Survivor starts out slow, which is understandable because it is building the story line, but throughout the book it never really picks up a whole lot. There is a lot of rambling, and I had to keep reading parts over again because I would get lost in all of the scientific and off-topic jargon and unneccesary details and descriptions. There are some really good parts in the book that get you to the \\"edge of your seat\\" and some really decriptive scenes that play well in the story, but all in all I was just really bored with it. I almost quit reading it several times, but managed to finish it. I probably won't read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very long winded.","review":"My wife and I enjoy listening to CD books when we travel. Well I made a big mistake when I purchased this long winded waste of time. I think the author must subscribe to \\"Metaphors Monthly\\" because this book is chock full of tireless metaphors many of which are so lengthy I lost track of what it was related to. There are ten disks in the set and it could have been abridged down to four."},{"rating":"2","title":"High level suspense with a surprise end","review":"This book opens with the sad tale of Joe Carpenter, devoted husband and father, in a deep depression after losing his wife and two daughters in a catastrophic plane crash. His misery is so well rendered and so realistic, it could make you cry.On the one year anniversary of the crash Joe goes to visit the cemetery where the remains of his wife and daughters are buried. He is surprised by a visit from a stranger who is photographing the grave marker and then by armed assassins who go after that stranger to kill her.From there this book takes off at breakneck speed with all the suspense of a spy thriller. It will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. It also blends classic Koontz fantasy in the last quarter of the book. It is all done so well that you can suspend belief long enough to enjoy a truly terrific read.I highly recommend this book! In the event that you would like to try another Koontz classic - read Lightening, my personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate science fiction?!?!?","review":"The initial set up and story was intriging. It went WAY off the deep end for me. I like something you can somehow remotely believe in. This explanation of all the bizarre happenings is a cop out. Too \\"Twilight Zoneish\\" for me. Very disappointed in the ending. This is my first Koontz book. After reading how others rated this book and in reference to some of his others I may give this author another try. The only reason I kept reading is because I had already read more than half when this storyline took a \\"nosedive.\\" I'm glad I got this at the library. I'd be really upset if I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks...","review":"Like the airliner around which it revolves, this story climbs at full power for the first couple of chapters, then comes crashing down in flames. What begins as an intriguing idea rapidly turns into a Hammer Horror episode, with an ending which hits the reader with all the subtlety of a poorly-lobbed half-brick, and makes you wonder whether you are still reading the same book you started out with. Rubbish. Shame there's no \\"zero stars\\" mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book ever!!!!!!","review":"I've been recommended Dean koontz books before but if never read any yet. This book I could not put down if my life depended on it. I would would sneak it everywhere just to find out what happened. It did get a little slow at some parts, but it always sped up. I loved how he described everything in great detail. It actually felt like I was there. It was full of emotion and action and humor and suspense... it was amazing. Joe Carpenter is really confused in this twisted turn of event s that he can call his life. I usually relate the characters story to my own and see how I would do in a situation like that. I absolutely loved this book and would recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sole Survivor: Dean Koontz","review":"This book was not up to Dean Koontz's usual quality. Story line was just too far from reality to get into the story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book has a nice build to it, but the ending was underwhelming for me. In my opinion, not one of Koontz's best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"Starts out as an intriguing mystery. 18 chapters, and you want to keep plowing through to find out what happened to flight 353. Strange events begin to occur, but do not seem to throw the story off track - you are still intrigued enough to keep on going. In chapter 15, things start to get really wierd, and in chapter 16, the longest in the book, the explanation comes out, but it turns the book into 'strange tales of the supernatural' - not my thing. A very unconvincing and disappointing ending. A very disappointing read. I wasted my time. At least I only paid $1.66."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Better Dean Koontz","review":"Sole Survivor is great fun. A pick you up & slam you back down thriller that doesn't let go. Mr. Koontz steps out of the safety of his usual formula and lets loose in this. I have been disappointed far too many times by some of his recent work and this novel was a joyful surprise. But let's quickly set the record straight. I've seen Dean Koontz's books described as horror far too many times. He has never written a horror book in his life. Suspense thrillers yes, and damn good ones like this. But only if you've just graduated from the Little House on The Prairie series could you classify Koontz's work as horror.Buy this book right now. You'll be very happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I absolutely loved Intensity, so went to the bookshelves in search for another promising Dean Koontz thriller. How upset I was to find Sole Survivor, an attempt at fear that stopped short with his lack of beleivability. I feel so fooled, and am quite upset I wasted my money with such anticipation"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read, but too short.","review":"Dean Koontz is one of the most incredible writers I know of. I have read several of his books, and they all made me want to read more. Sole Survivor is one such book. It starts out in a totally normal setting and spirals into a journey through the afterlife and redemption, through heaven and hell, like a roller-coaster poace version of Dante's Inferno. My only complaint is the pace, and that the book ends far too soon. We are left with many unanswered questions and untraveled paths. This book could have been a lot more gripping and a lot more exciting if it were just a bit longer.I hope Mr. Koontz writes a sequel...I can't wait to see what he has planned for his characters next. May his talent never diminish."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Dean Koontz?","review":"The first half of this book is fantastic. I really enjoyed huddling under the blankets on my bed, afraid to look into the corners of the room for fear of seeing something spooky...Unfortunately, the second half of the book became formulaic and predictable and the ending is so rediculous, it reads like satire. For those who like to wait for the final few pages to discover what happens, this is the book for you. For those who look for resolution that, while not terribly plausible, at least makes sense, then avoid this book. There is enough style evident in Sole Survivor to make me want to check out some of his other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Bomb","review":"Dean Koontz fans, avoid this novel...I was really disappointed in this story, where a man who loses his family in a deadly plane crash is led to believe that a \\"Sole Survivor\\" survived the crash...as he searches for this survivor, he is being tracked down by an agency who will stop at nothing to make sure he doesn't find out the truth... This book lacks a solid plot, often leaving the reader to wonder if Koontz fell down with the plane as well...Also, the lack of explanation between events makes the reader wonder if Koontz really put a lot of dedication into this novel...I am not saying that Koontz hasn't had good novels (see my review on Intensity), but it just seems like Koontz put out this novel to make a quick buck...when in fact, all it's worth is about two cents..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz fans","review":"One of the things we enjoy about Mr. Koontz' writing is the detail he puts into it, helping to build the suspense. We didn't feel it was suspense-building this time, tho, as it seemed a little slow and we had a hard time staying focused through the first third of the audiobook. However, once the plot began to thicken, we were as drawn in as ever and couldn't wait to find out what happened next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"hero\\" does too many stupid things!","review":"I'm ex-military, ex-street-cop and ex-PI, and this book is so full of \\"investigator nonsense\\" it was aggravating. Very aggravating. It was also chock full of \\"FLUFF\\", namely unusually long descriptions of unrelated (or almost unrelated) stuff. Basically the author hasn't a clue of how \\"real investigators\\" operate and tries to make it up like an old lady might. If you like well written fluff filled nonsense, it's OK. But if you want your fiction to be believeable, forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"This book is a fast read, because you dont want to put it down. Was done with it in 2 days, and I work full time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This book was not a good read. The story was pointless and the writing and dialogue was repetative. I found myself skipping and skimming chapters because they seemed pointless. The book is like reading some magazine article on how loved ones cope with plane crashes that was expanded to fill a whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"edge of your seat\\" treat!","review":"This is my third Dean Koontz novel in the last 3 weeks, and it was a nail biter...not quite as much so as \\"Intensity\\", but still kept me wanting to finish it, as I knew Joe would come out alright...just didn't know how. Dean Koontz really has conspiracy as a theme in the 3 I've read, actually listened to on audio cassette, and makes for a very thrilling story. The story may sound a little far fetched, but with cloning becoming more common, who knows? It's a scary thought, but that makes for good story-telling. David Birney does a great job as narrator, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start - Great Finish","review":"I have enjoyed many of Koontz' books and have always had problems putting them down. This book was very difficult to get into, but after perservering, I once again was unable to put it down. Another great book from Koontz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the climax ?","review":"This is my first Koontz book and it was very hard to put down but the ending is a disappointment: without spoiling much I can say that I expected a spectacular confrontation, but there is none - does he save it for a sequel ? Nevertheless I will try to put my hands on any Koontz I see around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great opening, and great opening only...","review":"Sole Survivor was the only Dean Koontz book I have read. Up until the middle of the book I was still thinking it was one of the best book I have ever read, but as the story went on and when the truth behind the mystery revealed, I found out it was actually one of the worst book I have ever read! Well, actually I should say one of the worst ending I have ever read. It was just like reading a poorly planned detective story, the mystery was fantastic because the truth behind was unreasonable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"The problem was the ending. I felt let down because I was expecting something a little more original than a child whose special power is helping the world \\"see\\" the existence of God and the afterlife. I mean, c'mon. I read 400 pages for THAT.We already have a book that addresses these issues: it's called a bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book. It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring. Normally I enjoy Koontz books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh nothing great","review":"I just finished reading Sole Survivor. The first 3/4's of the book was great. But when the plot unfolded I was majorely disapointed and wish I hadnt wasted my time reading it. I thought it was going to unfold into something better. But I guess if your into robots then you wont think this is that bad. Thats all I can say. I recommend definately getting this from the library then the books store just in case you had the same reaction I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was so excited when I found this Dean Koontz book because I am a new found fan of his.As you see from the description of the book, it sounds great - and it was great...until the end.The whole mystery surrounding the plane crash is very interesting once Koontz reveals it...but he waits until the very end to explain the mystery. He doesn't develop the plot twist, and then the book is over leaving a lot of unanswered questions.If you want a great Koontz book, try Odd Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag on","review":"I don't mean to be critical or anything and i'm not sure about the rest of you but i've never known a book go so slowly i mean it took 250 pages or there about to get past 24 hours i then gave up and gave it to my teacher as she said Stephen King recomended him and she liked his works.When she gave it back to me i asked her what happened after such and such she said you stopped at the wrong part it gets so amazing. I asked her about rose i and how she survived the crash and she said this company had made children and this particular child could transport people or things to other dimensions which is what happened and she said the reason people kept commited suicide was because another child could control peoples mind and he was forced to. I gave this book a 2 which is alot considering the amount of rubbish i read the only reason i did was because of the rest of the bookMy First And last of Koontz's books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out strong...","review":"I was pulled into the book immediately, felt sympathy for Joe and great interest in what would happen next. Initially it was a real page-turner. What happened was the book deteriorated into metaphysical twaddle and I reluctantly plodded through the last section. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Koontz's best","review":"I started reading Sole Survivor while flying on an airplane - this I don't recommend. However, I strongly recommend starting this book any time you are on the ground. This story had so many bizarre, seemingly unrelated incidents, that I had no idea how he was going to put it together in a way that made sense - but in the end, it was well worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I very much enjoyed \\"Sole Survivor\\". I read a lot of Koontz when I was younger but hadn't in many years. This was a great book to start back in with and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The action was non-stop and it kept me wondering until the very end. The only thing that I dis-liked a wee bit was the uber descriptive prose. Sometimes it was several pages of blah blah and all it was saying was \\"a tumble weed went buy\\". LOL! But aside from that being a bit bothersome a time or two the story, the characters, I really enjoyed very much. It's definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great koontz book!","review":"i bought this book a week ago and finished it very fast. this is one of those very exciting books like Intensity. This book features a great plot with a lot of thingss happening at one time, which adds to the fun of trying to connect events in your mind as you read along. This book works the best if you can think and ead at the ssame time. My favorite part was the last 50 pages because that is when i figured out that a lot of the events were linked to tthe plane crash and where all of those events started. I would recommend this book for anybody who is a goog reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the ending to this book","review":"There was so much unfinished business at the end... there really was NO ending.

I just can't believe so many people liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Flowery, But It Was Great","review":"I'm new to Dean Koontz. Based on this one book, he wrote a gripping, exciting story. It moves well, for the most part.But I've been reading Grisham and Chrichton, who move the storyline without all of Koontz's flowery similes. I want stories, not poetic descriptions.Still, once he got going, he was great. I only had to wince at his \\"lovely language\\" every few pages. Hey, I'm a guy... \\"Just the fact, Ma'am.\\"Sole Survivor didn't let me down in the end, either. A satisfying ending, going somewhere I wasn't sure he was brave enough to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you are bothered by scientific illiteracy","review":"I liked the first two Odd Thomas books so decided to give this one a try. The book starts off ok but around page 340 the story takes a turn that almost made me put it down.Although it is not essential to the plot the author spends a couple pages proselytizing for \\"scientific\\" creationism. I'm as willing as the next to suspend disbelief in the interest of a good ghost story but here the author goes beyond that to insert a view that mirrors a growing scientific illiteracy in the U.S. If you are upset with the attempts of the religious right to subvert science education you might want to skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Dean Koontz Fan - This is worst of his work","review":"I have read many Dean Koontz books...and this one is certainly the least enjoyed. The book started out good...in fact it was interesting for the first 1/2 to ALMOST 2/3rds...but I grew tired of the story line. The ending was confusing...and the plot and presentation...simply did not seem typical of Dean Koontz. If you want to start reading Dean Koontz...please do not read this one... If I had read this one first...I probably would never read anything more from Dean. This book was tough to get through....And I read about 50 books a year.

I will be sure to attempt to catch up on those books I\`ve missed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention-holding read!!","review":"In Sole Survivor, Dean Koontz uses his grasp of the English language to write a very good novel. Though the cult is far-fetched, the characters, especially Joe and Rose, are lifelike. The book truly holds the reader from beginning to end. It is a pleasure to read Koontz, because he writes so intelligently and rarely uses foul language"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not typical Koontz, but still masterfully written.","review":"This story doesnt compare to past favorites such as Dark Rivers, Dragon Tears, and his all time best Mr. Murder. It is still a very good read, especially for an avid Koontz fan. This book was not a dissapointment to me, it is much better than his last book Intensity, which totally lost my interest once they got to his house.

I am a fan of Dean Koontz but after four years since I bought this I still can't finish it. I was almost to the middle and still waiting for something explosive to happen but it didn't.

Maybe I will try to read it again and see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Koontz Reading","review":"For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested. I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling. When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, \\"I didn't think of that one.\\" The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters. The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained. There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended. It left me wanting to know more....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Koontz's best.","review":"Okay, emotional? Yes. Engaging? No. This is perhaps Koontz's WORST story ever.

As I ventured further into the book, chapter by chapter, I couldn't help feeling a growing sense of disappointment with the storyline and what was becoming an increasingly predictable ending.

However,in the second half of the book, the author just \\"Koontzed\\" with a totally unbelievable and wimpy ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really Dean Koontz???","review":"Sole Survivor is one of Koontz's weaker books. It seems like a plot line he would have given us in the early seventies. The beach cult was rediculous, that kid held captive in the airtight chamber in Virginia was downright stupid, and the ending was an embarrasment to Koontz as a writer. That BIRD? What? The woods on fire? Any time a character in a Koontz novel feels the room grow cold and witnesses mysterious occurences there, the novel plummets. The good ones are the ones that are more down to earth and have a clever explanation (Like Watchers, Mr. Murdur, Dark Rivers, and Whispers.) Sole Survivor was a step backwards and sideways at the same time. I don't recommend it to anyone unless they seek a mundane experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising start but a disappointing ending","review":"I was hooked at the start with the mysterious story of a man trying to figure out what really happened to his wife and daughters in a bizarre plane crash. But half-way through the novel Koontz ran out of gas and settled for a very contrived and boring ending. It reminds me of the action movies which rely on chase scenes and special effects instead of plot and character development to finish a good story. I'd like to see him go back and re-write the whole second half of the book but until then, I'm sorry I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed in Dean Koontz","review":"This whole book was a disappointment from beginning to end. You hope the story goes in one direction and then it veers off in the opposite direction. The characters are really one dimensional and really don't develop through out the story. I really feel Dean Koontz just wrote this book to just put it out. It doesn't seem to be thought out and seems to be incomplete. I really feel after Intensity he really has let his writing suffer. I enjoyed Tick-tock but it to didn't measure up to the real Dean Koontz. Maybe he should take a break from writing and come up with better ideas and get back into his old groove because if he continues to put out books like this I garauntee he will lose his fans even his loyal ones like me. I am really disappointed in him this time around...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life, the Universe and Carpenter","review":"What a letdown. And I thought Dark Rivers was bad. Firstly, there was way too much philosophical metaphysical rambling, and even the main character's name (Joseph Carpenter = Jesus Christ the carpenter) was tied into it. The \\"is there a god\\" question was beaten to death in this book. Secondly, the psychic children bit was straight out of Firestarter, and Mr. King must be delighted that his version was so much better. Finally, where's the resolution? Rose dies, the little boy remains locked up, tortured and torturing, and Joe still hasn't found peace of mind. BTW, a \\"hero\\" who's this violent is a dangerous person, and I think Nina should take him to see a good therapist. Everyone who read this book survived it, fortunately, but Mr. Koontz's reputation may not be so lucky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"My first Koontz novel - and my last. His writing style is simply terrible. It is as if he were paid by-the-word. This same plot could have been rendered much more successfully in one-half the volume.

You have to almost finish the book before it becomes interesting and then every thing moves too fast until you realize you are through reading the book. The desriptions of the forest and scenery was really unnessary, there were just too much about nothing, it made me feel like he was just trying to fill some extra pages so the book would be longer. This book could of been written in the last 4 chapters of the book because everything was summed up in the end and you really didn't need to read the whole book to find out what was going on. I am really upset about this book, I guess maybe he needs to slow down and take his time so he can writes better books, especially the books like he wrote a long time ago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensful, heartrenching ... one of Koontz's best.","review":"It was a breathtaking, wonderfully supsensful novel. From the very first page, I was unable to put it down. I was always wondering what was going to happen to Joe Carpenter, if he was going to survive, how he was going to hold up. When I thought about the love he lost, and whenever he talked or thought about his beloved wife and girls, it nearly brought me to tears. The end of the novel really did bring me to tears. Although Nina would never be HIS Nina, she was still a wonderful, bright fire in his life, and he loved her ... he needed her. It was a fantasy/suspense novel rolled up into one. Koontz loves to use supernatural ideas in his writings, sometimes just a hint, others full blown beliefs. This was one of his best supernatural novels. Although I sometimes had sleepless nights, wondering and wanting, I never regret picking it up, because I could never put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Signature Koontz, Unfortunately","review":"It'd been a few years since I'd read a Koontz book, and I picked this one up for giggles. Quite a disappointment, and a reminder of why it had been a few years since I'd read one. The book had the signature Koontz characteristics: 2-dimensional characters, an intriguing premise, one or two exciting scenes, and an absolute failure of a follow-through. Koontz does a decent job of getting you interested in the story and the mystery of what's going on, then turns the ending into a combination of deus ex machina and actionless exposition. Someone needs to teach him about story structure and how to write an ending that's a sufficient pay-off for the beginning. Does he just get tired, toward the end of the book? I sure did. Sole Survivor, like many of Koontz's novels, had a lot of potential. It just failed to achieve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2nd Dean Koontz better than the first (but not much)","review":"If you know Dean Koontz well and like his style, skip this review.

Wait for the patch and its going to be a large one. This game is full of bugs that will make the game crash or freeze your PC. Minimum requirements are not the cause. One bug that I'll give to the programmers. When you take a city and have troops waiting on a square to get a settler over, if a friendly Civ comes over and puts down a city. The city name will be something like \\"TXT_CITY_NAME_BELOX\\" i.e the code has not been beta tested. Is this why I giving it a bad rating? NO. I could live with little bugs but the crashing and freezing is almost every turn once you get in the later stages of the game.Overall: Good game if they get it right.

This is not an improvement on version III, it's pretty much a whole new game that isn't anywhere near as good as III is. Yeh, it's got pretty pictures compared to III, but who needs them in this kind of game. It's not looks - it's Strategy!! The tech tree is now incomprehensible. It has elements of a fantasy game (the animals). But the worst thing is the lack of a real editor. The \\"World Builder\\" is available at any time during a game. With Civ III you lived with what you had in the way of resources, units, etc., once the game started. With this turkey you can go in at any time and add units, resources, whatever. Losing isn't possible anymore. That pretty much spoils it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah...","review":"i picked up the last copy of this from my local bestbuy and its already off my hands. why? because it only took a few hours for me to go all the way through the game. some people have complained that it was too much micromanagement, but i felt it was really the opposite....a superficial game lacking any meaningful depth or strategy on the level of something truly great like medieval: total war. after i placed my settlers and staked out my cities, i pretty much just hit enter a billion times only stopping every now and then to research something new or build military units when threatened. hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Civilization","review":"Hands down, no contest, the best computer game ever!!!

In addition, the game randomly crashes to desktop! There are massive memory leaks, after 15 minutes of trying to play, my page file was at over 2.4 Gigs and cimbing.This game should not have been released as it is.

The AIs take forever to complete their turn. So basically game play is 10% actual play and 90% sitting around and getting bored. Bring a good book!Then there are the many bugs. I say Civ runs smooter on my computer than others with the -er being the operative. It still crashes often when the Wonders movie plays. Also, it takes forever to load - if it loads at all. It also takes forever to close.The game clearly was not adequately Beta-tested. Its pretty bad that Firaxis is basically asking people to pay $50 for the right to Beta-test it.

Fortunately a crude patch has been written that makes the game playable, but Firaxis seems to be ignoring the author. Not a good sign when a software company releases software that doesn't work and then refuses to talk with someone who can help.Civ III is by far more enjoyable as the game can flow (no delays from lag and no crashing..).

I completely recommend picking this up even with Civ V out now.Here is my original review...I can't believe they shipped the game in this condition. It constantly freezes or the screen turns blue and informs you of a severe memory leak.

I soon found out online that supposedly my video card was outdated and that I would have to buy a new card if I wanted to run the game. Since I'm a student, I simply can't afford $100 after I already dropped $50 for the game.It makes me angry that the designers made the game with so many bells and whistles so average gamers like myself couldn't even play it on their normal laptops. The beauty of the Civ series was its design and strategy, not its graphics. But apparently in today's x-box world, a simple strategy game won't do.

Why on earth set the hardware requirements so high? I've never played any of the Civ series for graphics or sound; it was always the gameplay that kept me playing over and over.

Prime Minister County Mountjoy (Peter Sellers) proposes that they declare war on the U.S., Grand Duchess Gloriana (Peter Sellers) is reticent until she understands the point is to lose and then receive massive aid, so the plan is approved and Tully Bascombe (Peter Sellers again) is placed in charge of the attack. They arrive in New York (conducting a bomb drill), capture its leading scientist, his daughter, and newest bomb, and return to Grand Fenwick.

The same product from Maxwell product gives me 24X full write speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there were an objective debate on the validity of the Rorschach...","review":"What's Wrong with the Rorschach is clearly a piece of propaganda from authors who have consistently ignored all evidence that runs counter to their claims about this much-researched instrument. It is written for an uninformed audience to sway popular opinion of the Rorschach, as evidenced by one of the authors taking the Rorschach himself, then disputing the results. (An expert on the Rorschach cannot take the Rorschach because he would know exactly what his responses would indicate, and would be able to alter them accordingly.) If only the debate on the Rorschach's reliability and validity were based on actual sound science rather than dominated by two diametrically opposed camps waging propaganda wars!This book is a waste of trees, not to mention a waste of intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rorscach IS controversial","review":"Don't let the other reviews fool you - many psychologists, especially in the forensic area where the testing and conclusions advanced are subject to scrutiny, are abandoning the Rorschach. The authors have mixed the methods of their arguements, using anecdotes for accessiblity, but here are many, many formal studies behind their conclusions. I predict the Rorschach, in its present form, will be dead in less than 20 years. Nobody will want to pay for a test with such little proven validity and utility, and so subject to overpathologizing people."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarressing Distortion of the Research","review":"Dr. Wood and his colleagues have been publishing these same arguements regarding their reservations about the Rorschach Test for several years. Despite scholars' efforts to explain the authors' misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the instrument, its current use, and the research regarding the Rorschach's psychometric properties, these authors persist in repeating inaccuracies regarding its scientific properties.This book is an embarressment to scientific experts who actually understand the research that these authors present with such misunderstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible book","review":"I am not a defender of psychological testing; in fact, I think it has serious limitations as evidenced by the relatively poor correlation of IQ with actual life achievement. In this book the authors set out upon a critique of one of psychology's most treasured tests: the inkblot, a projective personality test designed to reveal underlying pathologies. The research, however, is terrible; it's self referential and sloppy, and while the authors claim to be champions of the scientific method, their book is really no more than a few paltry opinions and some \\"data\\" gathered on the internet. I'm sorry I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"It is amazing tha the Rorschach is used at all these days by folk that call themselves \\"scientists\\". This book is a clear indictment of how psychology is not a science because it holds onto beliefs such as the Rorschach as a valid and reliable measure of personality. A must read for lawyers who wish to challenge junk science in the courtroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for first-, second-, third-time marathoners!","review":"Having trained with Team In Training before, and doing it again this year, I decided to pick this gem up to supplement the training I was getting with TNT. I'm glad I read this book. It both solidifies what I thought I knew about smart training, and helps clarify many of the emotional issues that go into preparing for and completing a 26.2 mile journey.I've recommended it to others. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating and manageable.","review":"As a beginning runner who wants to do things the right way, I have read everything I can find about running. However, no other book caters to the beginner like Marathoning for Mortals. Other books include set training programs that emphasize the importance of increasing your mileage or continuous running time every single week - which has always led to injury for me. Those books seem like they were written by people who cannot remember what it is like to be a beginner and get shin splints all the time! Bingham and Hadfield stress that just getting out there and doing it is what will lead to success. There are, of course, increases in distance and intensity in their programs, but they are much more gradual and manageable.The authors also have years of experience in motivating beginners to train, and it shows. Reading this book makes you want to get out there and do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Me!","review":"This is a great book, written by NORMAL people (not an elite runner or ultra marathoner that I could never hope to replicate in \\"real life\\")! This book is perfect if you are new to running or a long time jogger looking to finally run a marathon.It was a breeze to read but full of info so I still use it as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for absolute beginners A LOT OF FLUFF","review":"I got this book thinking it offered a practical but detailed approach for running longer distances. While it offers some decent insights it is a more of a 'you can do it', 'boost you up' book then a real nuts and bolts workout regimen. I am disappointed that their training plans are only a minor part of the book, mostly relegated to the back in the form of tables with very little variety or explanation. Likewise, they promise to explain certain things later in the book but never do. Get rid of most of the life affirming stories and put more substance in there. I am a pretty fit person and have a medical background and I can also add that some of their medical/injury stuff is a little outdated. If you have never run before then this is a good book. More experienced athletes will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go the Distance! Have some fun too!","review":"Marathoning is more than a physical effort. It is also mental and spiritual. Body and mind both must be conditioned for the 26.2 mile adventure. This book addresses the whole person's preparation for a marathon. Bingham stresses that each person can find success at their own level.A few years ago, I joined \\"Team In Training\\" to do a marathon while raising money to fight cancer. A noble goal, but I had never done more than a 5K. In fact I am a cancer survivor myself! I read this book cover to cover, and followed the ideas. Foure months later, I finished my first marathon! I have done a few more since then too!If you are a hot-shot runner, go write your own book. Want a technical book in running? Go get one. This book is for the rest of us who just want to do the marathon, go the distance, and have some fun too!Thank You John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished my first half marathon","review":"Great book - filled with lots of great advice given with a dose of humor.

My son (16) and I (41) are in week 6 of the training program and really enjoy it. I recite some of the \\"motivational\\" stories that I have read in the book while we are doing some of the long Saturday walks.

Florence couldn't sing even a tiny bit. Hell, she couldn't keep rhythm with her head stuck inside a bass drum. I got this album because the theater company I'm affiliated with was considering doing a play written about her. I am astounded that any recording of this woman singing would be transferred onto a CD - and there are at least two other CD's of her singing! It gives plastic a bad name. The only value in this painful attempt of song (using the term lightly) is of the historic variety. I mean it's incredible that this woman was, historically, allowed on stage at Carnegie Hall, and even more incredible that she was allowed to sing. Trust me, listening to Florence Foster Jenkins sing is like trying not to look at a car wreck but failing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remaster This?????","review":"The non-remastered version of this sells for $6.99.This is a recording that every serious musician should own, for a variety of (ahem) reasons.

If the sound is better on the remastered version, it could only be more painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Many say that I can't sing, but none can say I didn't\\"","review":"That quote came from Mme. Florence Foster Jenkins. The quote is representative of her music; most will listen and agree that, in fact, she cannot sing. Most of the music is out of tune and intellegable. However, the dedication and spirit with which she performed makes the album a joy. I found my self laughing the first few times I listened, but after that I found myself belting / barking it out with her. This album is a great confidence booster if you think you \\"can't sing.\\" A must for fans of the odd, opera, and singing fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable!","review":"Let's face it, Florence has had one heck of a posthumous career - she recorded these selections in the mid-1940s and they've never been out of print. One can't say the same for many opera singers who were recording 50+ years ago!

The author comes across as honest, sharing his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs regardless of the fact that he knows his story will be read by mostly white Americans who reject Hopi beliefs as nonsense. This book can teach everyone a valuable lesson about their own life, as well as about history and the culture of the Hopi Indians.

Fascinating and revealing autobiography is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required reading...","review":"I had this book as required reading for a college course. For someone thoroughly interested in the topic, go for it. If you have a passing interest in Hopi culture, or are looking for an interesting read, pass on this book.

It's brilliant in its simplicity, and I've been hooked since college.This new edition for DS adds many new levels of gameplay that all appeal to the Tetris-addicted yet add a new dimension to the fun. The best part is, the more you attack Tetris from different angles, the better you are at the classic game. Which makes for plenty of fun when you play against your friends!That's another element of fun in this one: single-card download play, which means if you have a friend with a DS, you can play against each other even if they haven't purchased the game. It's a lot of fun and hard to put down.If you like Tetris at all, you'll be delighted by the depth and creativity behind this new version. There is a lot of fun to be had here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of bites...","review":"I've had this on my wish list forever and only just got it off Marketplace.

I will not go through all the different playing modes that T DS offers, but its more than suffice to say that it has more than any other old Tetris games. The real gem here is the multiplayer, and this game is a perfect for semi-casual party games to anyone who enjoys Tetris in some degree. My only complain is: when I play intensively (competitively) for at least 20 minutes, my eyes becomes blurred for the next, say 10 minutes and its very uncomfortable.

I have really missed the feel of the classic and was hoping to see a remake on the DS. I finally found it and I could not have asked for more.

And assuming that, isnt judjing an album by how it fits with a particular genre just supporting another system of conformity? Anyway, just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on first listen, but gets old quickly","review":"Americana is an upbeat, catchy pop/rock/punk album that is pretty good at first listen with songs like the uplifting Feelings,skaa-reggae-ish Why Don't You Get a Job?, and one of the only true punk tracks, The Kids Aren't Alright. The Offspring who were once a punk band have turned more into a mainstream band just making a bunch of songs that they know will get play on the radio (uh, can somebody say Pretty Fly For a White Guy). Their sound is ultimitely more bubbley and a lot of depth to their music has been lost. Other songs that suck include Pay the Man, Americana, Pretty Fly For a White Guy, and Walla Walla. Another problem with the cd is that the songs that are good are only good for the first few times,but then slowly get old. I think the reason for that is the music is just too pop-flavored. This cd will disappoint Offspring fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have all the punkers gone?","review":"Why did The Offspring change into this happy, pop band, instead of the punk innovators, as they have been known? Well, after flipping past \\"Pretty Fly\\" and \\"Why Don't You Get a Job?\\", I realized they didn't. While they made me think they'd sold out by making an album with these mainstream junk tracks, I realized that they still couldn't give up that punk spirit. While \\"Pretty Fly\\" does give some interesting 90's commentary, the real tracks that set this album back with the rest are \\"The Kids Aren't All Right\\", \\"Walla Walla\\" and \\"The End of The Line\\" (which is a rather angry version of Ixnay's \\"Gone Away\\"). These alone prove that despite the fact that making it big has indeed affected The Offspring, it won't kill their punk credibility. Long live The Offspring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun cd","review":"This a good, fun, album. It has a good variety of punk style. From the fast pase punk of \\"Staring at the Sun\\", to the slower catchy rhythym of \\"Why don't you get a job\\". The best song is \\"The kids aren't allright\\", its got a great tune, as you probably know if you've heard it on the radio.

They've left their roots, going from in-your-face punk rockers to 1 and 2 chord playing \\"Weird Als\\" of modern rock with \\"pretty fly (for a white guy)\\" and \\"why don't you get a job?\\" (which sounds a hell of a lot like polka). if you want to experience true offspring, definitely get \\"smash\\" and then if you're hooked, buy \\"ixnay in the hombre,\\" but I wouldn't bother with \\"americana.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Offspring's stuck in wuss-ville","review":"Offspring should've stuck to their roots... I probably expect too much from this band, as they're the first rock band I EVER saw live in 1995 (I found out REALLY quick what a mosh pit was), but this does NOT even compare to SMASH. The singles on MTV are amusing at that, but musically it does nothing for me. I would've given it an extra star, but since some people are giving it 5's, I have to stick with 2. If you want some REAL Offspring, get SMASH."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"This CD has to be the worst offspring ever!! I am a longtime fan of offspring and this CD was awful. Smash was awesome but this........ The lyrics are pathetic, they say absolutlee nothing over and over again. Don't buy this CD.It is awful.O yea...you know Fieldy from KoRn? He rules"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half and Half","review":"Offspring have gone real soft, they sold out, just for all u lamers THIS IS NOT PUNK! sure there are some cool classic punkish songs like \\"have you ever\\" and \\"americana\\", but \\"pretty fly for a white guy\\" is so horrifyingly \\"popish and repetitive\\" it makes me sad. I own all of the offspring cd's even some bootlesgs, and i can't believe what they have done to their sound. It isn't pure anymore. Still i recommend the CD, for having some good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible in comparison to SMASH","review":"This album shows how my favorite Orange county punk-rock outfit is getting progressively worse with each big label release. Ever since they left Epitaph their music has been going downhill. Ixnay on the Hombre was a halfway decent cd, but Americana is outright pathetic in comparison to the Offspring's all-time greats SMASH and Ignition.The only reason I gave this record the second star is because the first two songs on this cd are great, if not inspired. The remainder of the album, however, is awful. \\"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\\"? I guess that's how the Offspring sees themselves these days. Too bad I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"the offspring's best album so far","review":"The Offspring aren't a very serious group, usually. So they express that with songs like \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy),\\" \\"Americana,\\" and \\"Why Don't You Get A Job.\\" This album, in my opinion, was very close to the explicit lyrics warning. On the album they swear a hell of a lot more than Godsmack's \\"Awake\\", Which does have the parental warnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about punk, cetainly has some class","review":"One of the top punk bands for years, the Offspring have taken a different route on much of this album, and despite some people's derogatory Britney comparisons, there is class on here. Pretty Fly is a great fun pop song of the highest order, Why Don't You Get A Job is kinda novelty but not too bad, and the Kids Aren't Alright rocks big time, with a great video to match. Better still are Staring at the Sun and Feelings, the latter a bizarre cover done with fine style. Like Green Day this was a cathcy and lively punk band who, having reached a certain stage of maturity, specifically the point of being married, stopped being punks and looked at other things. Don't forget that songs like Gone Away weren't THAT punk anyway. All the same Come Out and Play bea\\\\ts any of this, despite the album's quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"OFFSPRING HAVE TURNED POP! (thats bad)","review":"I love offspring and have all but their first album.however this has made me worry, this is pop music, pop is shit. The above comment is a matter of taste but anyone who likes any of offspring's albums before Ixnay on the Hombre will hate this. They have made all their songs about relationships which takes away the meaning their other songs have. They are also repeating and stealing stuff from other peoples songs and little of this album seems original. For many people this album is great but anyone who likes rock music and old offspring will dislike this. This album only gets a star for the two decent songs'pay the man' and'americana' otherwise you would have an n-sync album with guitars in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Offspring Rock with a New Roll!","review":"Two words: Kick ass! The new Offspring album is just that. Having acquired it before it is even officially released, my opinion is completely unbiased. This CD is a great accomplishment for the band, as they not only stick to the classic Offspring-style rock (She's Got Issues, Walla Walla) but they've also added new funk and turntable effects (Why Don't You Get A Job, Pretty Fly), all contributing to awesome powerful sound! Everything's got the expected Offspring extreme attitude too; with Offspring's near-screaming voice setting the tone up one notch throughout the CD. This is a rockin' album; well worth the buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GROUP OF SELLOUTS MAKE OVERRATED CD","review":"The offspring are burnt out. If you liked their previous efforts, or are a hardcore fan, then you will most likely despise of this album. They got lucky with the underrated song \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\". But many of thes songs such as \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\\", and \\"Why Don't You Get a Job\\" are of poor quality and are quite annoying. Effort seems to lack on all but one of these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhg!","review":"I hate this alternative rock poseur punk band! They stink. No talent. Just whiney and they have one of the worst singers of all time! AVOID!

Unfortunetly, I found it to be unappealing. Why? Mostly on the \\"most popular\\" song \\"Pretty Fly For A White Guy\\". The song I felt to be annoying the FIRST time around on the radio. I did buy Americana however, because I liked the song \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\". The only bad part is that it was the only song I truly enjoyed. As Roger Ebert would say, \\"Thumbs Down.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call This...PUNK?!!","review":"Not half as bad as Conspiracy of One, but still a major blow factor behind this one. When I first bought it, I was into the whole Blink 182 thing going on. But now, I listen to REAL PUNK MUSIC and I really...hate this failure. Suprisingly it's from a band who I usually like the music by. However, this goes into a sissy, crummy, boring...posuer record with the least thought out lyrics ever. What really kills it is the ultimatly cheesy, radio-friendly \\"Pretty Fly (for a white guy)\\" which is a shocker compared to their earlier accomplishments. It's probably the worst album I ever bought and actually liked at one point in my life...."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like poser punk music than this is the album for you","review":"I'm very dissapointed(especially in you people that gave the cd 5 stars...I recommend for thoose of you that did to listen to the cd over again). I don't know what happenend here, the offspring USED to be good, I think this cd only took like a week to make, I mean how uninteresting to sing about walla walla and feelings, there just isnt any point to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost has-to-be-listened-to for believers/non-believers","review":"This is a great album with the funniest lyrics and the catchiest choons, but why do we feel our great band is heading towards teenybop alley.

Come on Dexter-babe, we want u for ourselves not to share with some scallys who can't appreciate good punk-rock when they hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened????","review":"Their other CD's are so much better, Smash is by far the best.

So if you are intending on buying this CD, don't get Smash instead.(or Limp Bizkit, KoRn, ICP, Sublime, or Rob Zombie)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wouold like it?","review":"OK, it was good the first time, but all the songs sound the same, and it is a huge waste of money! Save you money and get the Beastie Boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best cds I have ever heard","review":"I am a huge fan of Metallica but this cd was givento me as a gift and I now listen to Offspring whenever as I get a chance. I listen to them almost on a religious basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Ixnay, you'll like Americana!","review":"The Offspring's 5th album, Americana, totally rocked! The majority of the album has the same kind of signature riffs and rhythms that made \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" such a good album. I think Dexter Holland did a better job of writing lyrics on their newest album. My favorite song on this album is \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\" Noodles did a damn good job of writing a very catchy, eery tune on this one, and the lyrics are excellent as well. Its the kind of song that can stick in your head for hours on end (It's in mine write now!), without annoying you. This Album is a must hear, and I'm looking forward to hearing more of its singles on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like!!","review":"Man, ok, So these guys were ok when they were just copying Nirvana, but what is this new direction they're going in? \\"Pretty Fly For A White Guy\\"? Gimme a friggin' break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened????","review":"i gotta agree with.... SELLOUTS .... cuz this is totally telling out towards kids, which is fine for kids, but what about the OLDER fans?? If you want REAL Offspring, go for their 1st 2 albums, NOT this one. This has a couple of good songs, hence 2 stars, \\"The Kid's Aren't Alright\\" & \\"She's Got Issues\\". \\"Pretty Fly\\" can go home, that song gets on my freaking nerves, almost as bad as the annoying video itself. So take a good HARD listen for those over 20 or so who preferred stuff from SMASH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offspring kicks ass!","review":"Americana is the best yet. It is the best one ever to come out. The best one's had to be numbers 2,4,5,7,8,11,and,12. 3,9, and 10 were ok. 1,6,and 13 sucked. But took keep things short all together I say OFFSPRING KICK ASS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good cd","review":"americana is great because it has four really good songs on it, Staring at the sun, pretty fly, why don't you get a job, and the kids aren't alright.

I also like Have you Ever and Welcome. While the other songs in this album were also great. hi to Elias and Badong my loverboys>> i love both of you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Extra Tracks","review":"This CD is a Japanese import with NO extra tracks, it was originally listed as having extra tracks but Amazon has since changed the listing after I brought it to their attention. I returned it and bought a non-import for a lot less money. I have bought many Japanese imports and most have extra tracks because the prices for cd's are higher in Japan. The other reviewer who says that there is an extra track after Pay The Man is incorrect, that is a hidden track and it's on the lower-priced American release so save your money and buy it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the past","review":"ive been a fan of the Offspring for a while, but Americana just isnt as good as past efforts. It isnt even close to the performance of SMASH and IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE, or even IGNITION, one of their earlier cd's. But i still have to hand it to them with songs such as Shes got issues, The kids arent allright and ...Get a job. I would have given it a 3 STAR RATING, but i saw them in concert and it was a hell of a show. If youre looking for the \\"real\\" Offspring get Smash or Ixnay on the hombre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This group has a beat that you can really groove too!","review":"I like totally love this band.This is like my favorite cd....I listen to it all the time.My fav song on this album has to be.......She's got issues.I think the beginning of that song is so RAD!~!All in all ...THEY ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"come on they can do better than this","review":"this cd sux.i got this cd the first day i got it man was i dissapointed.i mean theirs 2 good tracks no brakes and the kids arnet alright.but the rest......dont buy it every time i turn on the radio their music is on i just want to ......ugggg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its OK","review":"I bought this album a few days ago and I think it is OK. Its not as good as their other albums like Smash and Ignition. They are losing their place in the hardcore/punk area of music. They should go back and make more of the real old skool punk. Some of the songs, like Amaricana and The End of the Line were good. But the rest of the songs should not even be listened to. I mean, come on, what are they trying to make now, Hip-Hop? I recomend that you think before you buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"you choose","review":"this cd is not bad most of the songs arent as pretty fly and why dont you get a job would suggest this is not a punk cd but its not a pop cd eather its kind of an alternative cd its a lot softer than ther previous cds.most the songs where ok besides there two videos songs feelings and walla walla my favirates where have you ever and americana there too good for this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely fantastic CD","review":"This is the best Offspring cd ever!!!

Buy something original instead.","review":"These guys make a living off ripping people and other artists off. Every track on this CD could have been on a Bad Religion (but without intelligence), NOFX, or Pennywise album. Yeah, like any of the people who reviewed this care...I simply suggest getting into the artists who invented and actually added something interesting to punk rock. And one other thing: \\"Why Don't You get a Job?\\" is a blatant rip off of the Beatles' \\"Ob-la-di Ob-la-da.\\" Don't support these rip-off artists!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked on Offspring about 1 minute into Americana.","review":"I had never heard ANYTHING by The Offspring when a friend played \\"Americana\\" in his car one night. I liked the sound of the group, and thought \\"Pretty Fly\\" was kind of catchy, (WITH the Def Leppard Sample, don't forget!) So I decided to go out and buy this cd. I popped it into my cd player, and began listening to \\"Have You Ever\\" and knew then and there I had found something great! The lyrics to that song made so much sense, I was shocked! This was this past Saturday, and I have since played the cd at least 3 times a day everyday! I don't know much about this band, but I know I love this cd. I intend to stay with The Offspring for quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana CD-ROM","review":"If you haven't already figured it out. The new offspring CD \\"Americana\\" is also a CD-ROM. If you put it in your computer, you will find a cool CD extra that has a preview for the offspring home movie, 4 music videos from \\"ixnay on the hombray\\", and a kareokie club where you can sing along to \\"pretty fly,\\" \\"staring at the sun,\\" or \\"why don't you get a job.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to shabby.","review":"This CD has topped the charts with the song that is found on track 4. This song is humorous and is rather uncharacteristic for this group. But, Offspring's best kept secret is track 7. I believe that this song depicts more musical talent than I have ever heard from this group. Any self-respecting male can relate to this song. Other than these two tracks, nothing on this CD seemed to catch my eye. Not a bad buy if shopping for an advid fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD awesome songs best is Pretty Fly(For a white guy)","review":"Offspring has songs many would like. They also like to put funny things in their songs and on cover. This one it's mostly showing what America is really like (kid with brace and cockroach, song where white guy tries to act cool but he's not). Overall a great CD for all people (well mostly all) and it will definetly keep you listening.

But when I stepped into the World of Americana, I was blown away! I think there is no song on this CD that is bad. \\"The Kid's Aren't Alright\\" and \\"Starin' at the Sun\\" are my other favorites. Buy the CD and you'll understand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty stupid (for anyone)","review":"This was the worst. It was just a bunch of yelling. Dexter Holland must have larenjitis by now.

They aren't sellouts...they are a punk band, which means they mock everything out there and they never do the same type of thing twice. That's what it's all about.

From Pretty Fly for a White Guy to Why Don't You Get a Job, this whole cd will have you laughing and rocking through out the entire cd.

Being the first cd I ever had, I have no complaints and thank you Offspring for making this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as people say","review":"Lots of people, I've noticed, say that this CD is horrible. I admit that I think Ixnay on the Hombre was better, but this is not far behind. Most of the songs are interesting, and 'The Kids Aren't All Right' is probably the best song. I didn't care that much for 'Pay the Man' and 'Feelings' but that doesn't mean they're bad songs, that's just my opinion. The tracks are a little different from Ixnay, but still good.

And this album isn't explict at least not where I live, and there is really only one explict song which is \\"Americana\\".I knew from the moment I saw this cd that I would love it.

Simply said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably disappointing.","review":"I'm convinced after listening to \\"Americana\\" 8 or 9 times; that The Offspring have offically reached previously uncharted artistic depths at this juncture in their careers. Essentially all \\"Americana\\" is, is a bunch of obviously shamless plagerisims of older songs (they used to be called \\"covers,\\" but not when they've rewritten the lyrics). Oh yeah, great lead single fellas in \\"Pretty fly for a white guy'\\" I guess that's testement to your Wildean wit. My overall impression of these guys judging from the video's and these gormless songs: are just a bunch of Alternative-Nation geeks that go through life bending over for a cheap laugh and never once making an erudite or poignant musing. For all of you who loath The Offsprings latest opus as much as I do; go out and purchase \\"The Record\\" by Fear, it puts this unremarkable piece of commercial dreck to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, Great Songs, the best CD!!!!!","review":"I listen to this Cd day in and day out. If you like this one you should listen to all the Off Spring Cd's, I have. One of the songs you hear on the radio is Pretty Fly(for a White Guy) or Why don't you get a job. It goes like: My friend's got a girlfriend man he hates that #@#%$ He tells me every day He says \\"Man I really got to lose my Chick in The worst kind of way\\" etc......I think it is cool!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music with a message.","review":"Americana is probably the best cd I own, and have ever heard, but unlike many popular groups, they have a real message. Walla Walla has one, which is represented in the picture for it. Pretty Fly has one. End of the line does. Pretty much every song has some sort of a message, and besides that, they're all awesome! Its hard to say the good songs, but the total BEST songs are: Pretty Fly, Walla Walla, End of the Line, Have you ever, and Americana. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Offspring are giving Punk Music a bad name!","review":"The offspring have gone down the toilet.

If you have ever listened to any of Offsprings songs and like them, then you should get this cd.

The guitars, drums and the other things are the best Ive ever heard Offspring do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if i could!","review":"I liked the Offspring even when they got more rock and less punk, this killed them for me. All the other CDs before this were great to good(but not real punk) this is a poppy, lame, pos. I can't tell what is worse, Blink 182 after \\"Dude Ranch\\", or \\"new\\" Offspring. No, i mean which was more of a waste of money, \\"Americana\\" or \\"Enema of the State\\" Like the one guy said, Pretty Fly made it on MTV, but then again so did Tom Green's Bum Bum song for so long they had to retire it. Just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Sigh*","review":"What happened? Did I miss something? When did the Offspring become a pop-rock band? And after such albums as Smash, one of my all-time favorite albums.I liked that one because it was widely appealing to alternative fans of all sorts. Melodic, yet heavy. This one sounds just watered down. The music is weaker, and the lyrics lack meaning.Except \\"The Kids Aren't All Right\\" That song is true Offspring, not watered down pop. Please,do yourself a favor and pick up \\"Smash\\". I assure you that you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy one CD this month, buy this one!","review":"First, I shake my head at those who label this pop and therefore won't listen to it. Stylistically, yes, perhaps our Orange County boys have changed a bit, taken a bit less of an angry young man approach, but they've replaced it with wit and depth. It's too easy for an album to complain, it's another thing entirely to make you think, while still pumping out punk in a day when punk is on a respirator and Dexter and Co. not only provide but provide with style. Maturity has served them well and this album is an all-time favorite with me, equal to Smash and Ixnay any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definetly a bold new line of music for the offspring","review":"This is a great CD it is definetly a great addition to any CD collection.

Real fans knew who they were before MTV started playing Pretty Fly For A White Guy. They were good but this CD is horrible. They went from real music to what sounds like polka in Why Don't You Get A Job. Don't waste your time or money buying this CD. If you're gonna get one, get a good one like Smash.

Overall this fits in with all the blink 182, simple plan, good charlotte garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Effort","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs for hard-driving, roack-n-roll music. The Offspring shows some maturity and more than a little sarcasm in their songs. Have You Ever is a great start with a strong drum and good guitar licks. The Kids Aren't Alright is another terrific effort, combining excellent guitar, drum and lyrics.THe whole tone of the CD is a frenetic realization that Reality is the Cruelest Dream. THe band is maturing and, with maturity, comes the understanding that life isn't fair and that sometimes, things don't work out for the best. They sing about the different \\"pop\\" issues of modern culture and lampoon many of them with heavy sarcasm. She's Got Issues is one while Feelings is another."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to this great band?","review":"If you have seen my reviews for \\"Ignition\\", \\"Smash\\",and \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" you are probably wondering how i could give them five stars and then give this one only one, but here's why: I have been a fan of The Offspring since I first heard Smash and i have loved them ever since, but this album ruined it.I loved \\"Ignition\\",\\"Smash\\", and \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" but this album took a giant fall for my favorite band. The songs on this album have no meaningful lyrics and the guitar riffs just arent the same. Now, if you are a fan of the backstreet boys or nsink you may like this album, but for someone who liked The Offspring's earlier albums,you will probably hate this one. The Offspring has been my favorite band for the past 3 years, but this album dissapointed me. I dont see how they could go from a great album like \\"Ixnay\\" to this.Although this album is horribly pathetic,they are still my favorite band just because of their earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it to me baby!!!","review":"The songs on this cd kick! I just love this cd, but it isn't like their own style though. It's a good thing they keep on trying to find the right style, but until they find their right one there's gonna be a whole bunch of reviews on some of their new cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"good uncrappy music","review":"i think that this cd is one of the offsprings best and that any true punk fan will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good party music!","review":"If you love the Humor of Pretty Fly, you'll really enjoy the Offspring's cover and twist of the Seventies' Hit \\"Feelings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"an almost amazing album","review":"I love the new offspring cd, but it's missing the old Offspring sound. Although, why live in the past? Thier trying new sounds and lyrics, so why don't we? So sit back and enjoy the new Offspring cd cause it's definetly worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It bites people sorry","review":"See the Offspring used to be good before they sold out with Pretty Fly for a White guy, which I think is just about the most annoying song in the world other than any rap, and with Why Don't you get a Job?.. that one wasnt AS bad as Pretty fly..etc. but it was still stupid. All I have to say is that Offspring used to be good, but not anymore, they soldout.. so definitely not 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness!","review":"My lttle brother just got this CD for his birthday two days ago and he hasn't stopped playing it yet.

Go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this cd's the worst one yet. its not even real music. they only have one good song from Smash.If I could give it no stars thats what I would do. go buy some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"God, I can't believe I wasted 20 bucks on this pile. That's the last time I let band-loyalty drive me...now that I've listened to the crap that is Americana, I can go back and listen to Smash and realize just how excellent it was. This, however, is an abomination. Whereas Smash had the classic angry rock and punk tunes, Americana has reverted to \\"happier\\" tunes. Listen to \\"Why Don't You Get a Job\\" and then \\"Bad Habit\\" and see what I mean. I never though I'd say this, but the Offspring have turned into a hybrid of N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW - this really does suck!","review":"One of the critics below said that \\"Punk's not dead\\" - ARE YOU STUPID OR JUST DEAF?!? If this piece of crap is the comeback that punk is making... then punk would be better off dead. My god, I heard that this was kind of good. Hah! This is one of the worst pieces of \\"art\\" that I've ever heard. I could record myself going to the bathroom and it would be more entertaining and listenable... or maybe just banging on the piano with the background noises of my little cousin banging on the drums...ALL OF THE SONGS SUCK!!!!!!! THEY REALLY DO.\\"Pretty Fly\\" was cool for a while - but now it sucks. \\"Why Don't You Get A Job\\" always sucked. If another single off this album becomes popular - I'll cry.DO NOT BUT THIS ALBUM.I WOULD GIVE IT NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD. Believe it or not, this is worse than the terrible whining and moaning of journal entries on Alanis's new album.AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. ALL IT DOES IS TAKE UP SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's not offspring!!!","review":"This album is scrap comparing to SMASH, it have only 2 good songs (Have you ever and The kids aren't alright). The offspring just release this album to make money, before this one they would never accept to make a tv interview. If you want some good punk buy Smash or Ixnay on the ombre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, loud music, hey it's offspring!","review":"I think that Americana is really good~ The Offspring make such good punky alternative rock, they totally rule. Americana has the best songs, and they all kick so much ass! Hey man, the louder the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is \\"Pretty Fly\\"","review":"I bought this CD about a year ago. Pretty Fly (for a white guy) is really cool. You know what's weird? On Walla Walla, it has a polka beat! Why Don't You Get a Job? has kind-of Calypso beat. This entire CD is an mix of all kinds of music. Americana is a step down from heavy metal...kind of a mix between Smashmouth and Nirvana. A ggod buy if you like either one of those bands. The reason I gave this CD a four is because it has some cuss words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana: I own the albulm!","review":"i love this album! there is only 1 song i don't like. that would be \\"Pay The Man.\\" It's perfect for letting all of the anger out! plus, if you pop it in the computer, there is a bonus. Videos & an offspring karaoke lounge! you even get to see a clip of one of the guys trying to steal some beer! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"These kids aren't alright, why don't they get a REAL job?","review":"I thought it wasn't possible, but this album sux and blows at the same time.

Take my advice, buy the singles or get the MP3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"punk poseurs","review":"If this band is such a great punk band, how come they're so bad as a live act? When I saw them, they stopped in the middle of songs at least four times. Forget the lyrics? Prerecorded tracks mess up? Who knows, but the moshing idiots ate their lame act up with a spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Offspring are awesome - but not Americana","review":"Don't waste your money on the ENHANCED version of this CD. The normal CD already is enhanced, with a Sony music extra (videos + stuff). Besides, Americana is not worth the money. Their sellout CD's (Americana, Ixnay on the Hombray) suck. So go for it, be a man, and buy the real Offspring, the hardcore punk, the best albums - Smash, Ignition, and The Offspring"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't wast you money","review":"Offspring is a good band they just really screawed up on this one pretty fly is the worst song I hav ever herd the only thing keeping this from a 0 is the kids are alright and get a job offspring should stick to the old style and not try to be an mtv band save your money that is the best advise I can giv you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The video rocks and I give the song a 10 and the album a 9!","review":"The song really shows what guys like and thats to be FLY, and this video has it all and so much more. Not only does it have phat dancing but the lyrics rock also! There's one thing wrong with the album it really only has a couple good songs on it but another CD to buy would be Everclear's new CD. If you like The Offspring than I think this CD should be your next purchase. The song makes me dance whenever it comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat Offspring","review":"I love Offspring. I only have one album(Americana) but I really want Offspring(self- titled),Ignition, Ixnay on The Hombray, and Smash. But this CD Rocked and it blew all the other new albums away. I want to tell why this album was good:Dexter Holland vocals were funny, angry and even sad. He expressed his music for whatever emotion he had. Noodles played a great electric guitar in \\"Pretty Fly(For a White Guy)\\" and \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\". The guitars in the Offspring band were excellent because they were heavy and down right loud. The percusion was always on beat from Ron Welty and also played very well. I didn't hear much bass from Greg K but didn' effect any song.Go out and by this album now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEBODY GET THE HOOK","review":"Offspring's AMERICANA displays yet again the MTV experience of featuring a youthful punk-influenced garage band with little or no talent. Offspring still lacks the musicianship and lyrical sophistication to ever get beyond the mindless drivel from their current CDs. Aren't the 90s just great for music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for music fans","review":"if you are under 15 (or if you have the music iq of a 15 yearold) then this album is for you. this band just spews out songs for the point of spewing out songs. pointless pop music that gets boring and annoying quickly.if you are looking for decent music look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Smash or Ixnay unless you are just trendy","review":"I was dissapointed in this album I expected such great things. The Offspring even said that Pretty Fly for a Whiteguy was a mistake. Even people who never heard of the Offspring before love them now. It's sad really. Buy Smash and leave this one for the trendy wannabes."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it buy smash","review":"their used to be a cool punk band called the offspring now they just suck they sound like a pop band greenday also theyve gone soft but atleast not pop like the offspring have i am looking for new punk bands if u like old offspring try pennywise they just came out with a new cd but their was a few good songs americana the kids arent alright the end of the line have you ever and pay the man the rest suck"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Information...","review":"For all of you out there you love \\"Pretty Fly\\" (ugh) and think Americana is the greatest Offspring CD of all time (even though most of you probably have never even heard any of the others, like my younger cousin, who tried to tell me it was their first), I will enlighten you: Americana sucks. Sorry to be so blunt. Americana is nowhere near as good as Smash and Ixnay, and if you think Americana is punk rock, you need to do a bit more research. I'll admit, there were a few good songs on this CD, but most were junk. Unlike Smash, which I got in seventh grade and still listen to now, I sat through Americana maybe twice before tossing it on the mess on my floor in disgust (I have a very messy room). Anyway, for the hardcore fan, it's a let down, but OK if you have a huge surplus of money. Or better yet, send some of that surplus to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"it kinda sucked a lot","review":"\\"Pretty Fly For A White Guy\\" is the song to blame for the death of punk music. Dexter Holland's voice is incredibly annoying. I kinda liked \\"She's Got Issues\\" and \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\", but the rest of the CD is very bad. I used to like the Offspring, but now they completely sold out with \\"Pretty Fly\\". If you want REAL punk music, check out Bad Religion or Refused."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Punk to Pop - A Sad Story","review":"Early in the 90's, the Offspring released a self titled CD, followed by Ignition -- two fantastic CDs! Then came Smash, which is one of the single best punk records ever. That was followed by Ixnay on the Hombre, which was pretty good. But here comes Americana, filled with pop songs written to make money, but can you blame them? If you're looking for the good stuff you've come to expect from this little punk group, I don't suggest you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its actually hard to rate this","review":"I don't know exactly how to rate this album...I guess 4 stars will do. This is by far a very diverse album, which features the songs that basically reintroduced the Offspring to the world (Pretty Fly & Why Don't You Get a Job). Now, while those are not necessarily the most involved songs ever, they are fun, but are not the high spots of the album. Have You Ever, Staring At the Sun, The Kids Aren't Alright, Feelings, Americana & Pay The Man are essential listening for the Offspring fan. Everyone of those songs has its own flavor and feeling, and are among the best songs ever written by the band. The album is very much associated with the singles that came with it. Whether you like these songs or not, they are not all this CD is about. The writing is clever, diverse, and unique, and it still holds up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing stuff","review":"these folks are terrific, in an angsty-angry way.

IF YOU WANT OFFSPRING JUST BUY SMASH OR THE SELF-TITLED. PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY IS JUST A HORRIBLE POP SONG AS IS WHY DONT YOU GET A JOB.

The songs are not about sappy little love stories, they are about totaly ramdom things.

I did, regretablly, discover Offspring from \\"Pretty Fly\\", and I went out and got this album for that song and \\"Why Don't You Get A Job?\\" (and this was back before they both really hit it big!). that was when I discovered what Offspring was really about. and, most of the other songs on Americana were much better than Pretty Fly and WDYGAJ. now, looking back, now that I have almost all of their albums (missing only the first, self-titled CD), I can say that, of what I've heard, Americana is the weakest of their albums. there are three songs I can still listen to: Have You Ever, Staring At The Sun, and Walla Walla. I can truley only descibe this album as a great band getting back up and running into a wall.

I really can't stand Pretty Fly For a White Guy, and I used to like \\"Why don't you get a job?\\" and \\"The kids aren't alright\\" until they started playing them over and over on the radio.

If you like them, who cares, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to commercial success","review":"With the help of hit singles \`Pretty Fly (For A Whit Guy)' and Why Don't You Get A Job', Offspring's fifth album has catapulted Offspring once again in the big league after the \`so-called' flop \`Inxy The Hombre' (is 4 million albums sold considered a flop?). Accessible punk for the masses it may well be but the Offspring manage to hold on to their credibility for never being cool in the first place. As with all Offspring albums there are notable filler material but the highlights are many with \`The Kids Aren't Alright' and \`Feelings' displaying quality and an ironic sense of humour. Although not a classic album in any way, \`Americana' works as a short-term thrill and a catalyst for the mainstream to accept punk as a popular form of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"I am a long time Offspring fan, and I pretty much loved what I heard from Americana. While we are now all sick of Pretty Fly, there are many other great songs. Especially \\"The Kid's Aren't Alright\\" . When you pop this in the computer, there are also some other cool features, and you can watch four of their older videos, (The meaning of life, All I want, I choose, and Gone Away which is my personal favorite Offspring song). If you buy this CD you won't be disappointed, but, The Offspring's Smash and Ixnay on the Hombre are better, but not by a hell of a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"What can I say?

It wasn't as good as Smash but it was great. Then a long while later Americana was in stores. I bought it immediatly. I loved it for a week. Then it clicked that it sounded nothing like the previouse albums. It sounded like pop, it was pop, not the hardcore thrash metal that I was used to. If your one of those teenie pop fans who likes bad music get Americana otherwise get real Offspring like Smash or Ixnay. I can't beleive these guys. One second their the best the other they're sellouts! maybe next time they won't just think about the money, and they will make music that real, loyal Offspring fans will enjoy.

Pretty Fly for a White Guy (in case you don't know, it's one of their more popular songs from this album...I didn't like it though) was just such a joke. It seemed like they tried to change their style of music in order to actract people that were more into other styles of music instead of just the punk-rock crowd.

After listening to this CD, I realized how much those songs suck compared to the rest of this CD. My friend eventually gave me this CD and I listen to it all the time.

Dextor is not the worlds best vocalist (remember how he sounded at woodstock?), and you have to be suspitions if a bands changes the theme of their lyrics over the course of one album.... But then every cloud has a silver lining, and in this case it is the track 'The kids aren't alright', it is also the track that is closest to their earlier roots. But even that won't make me buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offspring gets better and better.","review":"This is an album of pretty good songs interspersed with three or four really good songs. offspring's unique sound makes them stand out from the rest of the alternative rock crowd. Their albums have gotten progressively better. Hardcore fans might say they've gone mainstream, but what IS mainstream these days? The sometimes comedic lyrics remind me a bit of some of Weird Al's original work, such as SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE and ONE MORE MINUTE. This was a very entertaining album with some great songs. A must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Americana","review":"The Offspring prides itself from removing its music from the \\"poison\\" of pop. However, their latest effort, \\"Americana,\\" is not only pop, but an embarrassment of its incarnation. The album is filled with tiresome vocal delivery, an attribute so important in the success of their earlier sets, \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" and \\"Smash.\\" Though \\"Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\\" serves its purpose, the only saving grace of \\"Americana\\" is \\"The Kids Aren't Alright,\\" an 80's metal-fused, power anthem. In the end, \\"Americana\\" isn't Americana. At least, let's hope not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD! Nearly every track is excellent!","review":"This CD is awesome! It was my first Offspring CD, but I have since bought Smash and am soon to get Ixnay. Surprisingly, Pretty Fly is not the best song on it. I think that WDYGAJ, She's Got Issues, and The Kids Are'nt Alright are all better than it. The only bad tracks on it are Feelings and Pay The Man(except for the very end of Pay the man). Welcome is about 7 seconds long, so that doesn't really count. I have bought many CD's since this one of various bands, but this is still probably my favorite.

It's a totally different type of style they're using. None of the songs have the same addicivness except for The Kids aren't all Right. That's probably the best of the whole CD. And Pretty Fly?

This is the first CD I've heard by this group and it will certainly be the last. Maybe I'm too \\"mainstream\\" but I will stick to music that is a bit more melodic.

I am with those who consider \\"Melt\\" Gabriel's best, but \\"Security\\" is still terrifically ambitious and rewarding, with weird, subtle, world-musicky soundscapes that reward cranking up the volume on the best music system you can find. To me, it's gratifying to hear a musician slightly on the fringe stretching, stretching, going further out on a limb, which makes this more satisfying, to my ears, than \\"So\\" (which is still a fantastic album, though, sigh, commercial). \\"Security\\" is to \\"Melt\\" as \\"Kid A\\" is to \\"OK Computer.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Animal Gems!","review":"This book had exactly what I was looking for.

The DVD menu selection, however hard the editors tried to make it interactive, doesn't do a very good job. The \\"highlights\\" of the games are simply that, extremely short snipets of the games. There are interviews intertwined throughout - which I'm guessing are the only fools that would agree to be on video. It's a sporting event - show sporting activities. The panning of someone's crotch is not what the Gay Games is about. And if you wanted to go that route, pan more crotchs and worthwhile ones at that!

I have had the printer for about 6 months. The printer crashes on a regular basis. Every light on the console comes on during these crashes. The on/off button does not function during a crash, so the only way to reset the printer is to pull the power plug, push the plug back in, hit the on button, and print the item I want before all the console lights come on again. The troubleshooting guide does not include any useful information on what to do when all the lights come on at the same time.The printer does a great job of printing when it is working. I am very disappointed with HP as a result of my experiences with this printer model. I used to consider HP the premiere manufacturer of printers, but this model is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's intended use","review":"I have had these trays for quite some time and I am often amazed at reviewers who obviously don't know what the product is or does. First of all, yes, they are flimsy. They are silicon! They are supposed to be so you can get the tubes out without breaking them. Just get a small cookie sheet and place the trays on the cookie sheet and there you go. They are also small in diameter so they can fit in just about any size water bottle opening. We do a lot of hiking and these are great for small water bottles and canteens. We also use them to freeze juice because they are just about one ounce and that works great for cooking. So, if you are looking for a tray that you can stack 6 high in your freezer, go to Wal Mart. If you need a tray for water bottles and you understand what the trays are made of, get these. They do what they were designed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but flawed execution","review":"I like the flexiblility of getting them out and the shape is great, but with nothing rigid, placing a filled bar in the freezer is very delicate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"The ice trays are shallow.

Once you do get it frozen, though, the results are pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silicon bottle ice tray too floppy","review":"I got this bottle ice tray thinking it would be a great way to put ice into drink containers with narrow necks. The idea is great, and there are some products that can make the bottle ice, but this silicon tray isn't one (at least not for me). I found the tray too floppy to handle, both empty and full, and the long narrow indentations were too shallow to make good bottle ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"nifty ice cube tray","review":"Overall, I like this ice cube tray. Yes, it can be difficult to fill because of the unique shape of the tray and its flexibility. But, its great to be able to add several of the cubes to water bottles before I go running. A quick word of advice for filling, find something that will help keep the tray flat as you move it to the freezer. I found that if you refill it right after emptying it, the new water will start to freeze right away. It won't completely solidify, but it will form a very small layer of ice on top, which makes the water less likely to swish around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this item and sent it back the next day. The floppy silicone is not a good choice for an ice cube tray, and the slots to fill are so shallow (approx. 1/4 inch deep) that filling them is a messy experience. I wanted to fill them with sweet tea, as that is my favorite drink and I don't like it watered down. I think I got more tea on the counter than I did in the tray.

The keyboards, drums and guitar have strong similarities to Dream Theater (think Images & Words or Awake).But after subsequent listens, other similarities stand out on this excellent cd. I find that the guitar actually reminds me of Dokken and Conception just as much as it does Dream Theater. The vocals remind me of Conception, too. Though Vanden Plas's vocalist has a higher range than does Roy S. Khan of Conception, they both have similar voices. The music is strong and powerful and Vanden Plas concentrates on writing great songs rather than self-indulgent technical silliness. This is where Vanden Plas has the potential to be superior to Dream Theater, they (Vanden Plas) know what music is about.Progressive metal is about musical innovation, not technical masturbation.If you like Dream Theater and Conception, I think you may like Vanden Plas."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only Our Novelists Could Write So Well","review":"Jeal's biography became an instant classic upon publication some years ago. It is doubtful that Livingstone will ever be so fully portrayed, \\"warts and all,\\" as the saying goes. Quite apart from the life depicted, this biography is a work of art. The prose is gorgeous, quite simply among the best biographies of the decade. One is simultaneously gripped and repelled by the author's extraordinary subject. Livingstone is one of the two or three singularly impressive Victorian figures whom contemporaries admired but whom we now regard with dismay. Still, there are no such grand figures in our time, and it is doubtful any will ever emerge again with such courage and daring. He was in so many ways as hateful as his age, but a better man than we in our time who praise ourselves for finding fault with his undeniable accomplishments from the comfort of our little lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Sensational, absolutely fantastic book","review":"This author provided a great, unbiased account of Livingstone without being disrespectful.

The Rees are experts in their field, not popularizers, however their book is not an arcane tome intended for Ph.D candidates.

Johnny Deep was good as Dillenger and Bale really fit his role well. The other crooks were mean, tough, and bad - just like you want them. The sets, especially the banks, really brought you back to the 1930s. If you are a gun fan, there is a lot of Thompson and BAR action galore. Crank up your surround sound.I'm a Micheal Mann fan but this didn't seem to have the same feel as some of his other work. Maybe he was trying something different. In any case, it works.I'm not a fan of movies over 2 hours, but this kept my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray Disc Does Not Work even after updates & different players.","review":"Plain & simple this Blu Ray Disc did NOT work on my Blu Ray Samsung & LG players even after both machines had been updated.

If you aren't the type to judge a movie by the whole of it, than this choice would not be one of your bad ones.

Where gangsters ever so boring? Example: at the beginning of the film guys escape from prison. FREEDOM! But are they estatic, laughing, horsing around? Nope, just blank statues. I have more emotion leaving work on Friday afternoon. There should be the extreme highs of pulling off a robbery along with the extreme lows of constantly being hunted, the constant nagging thought of being ambushed by the law at any moment, all mixed with a overiding desperation of a life shoved into smaller and smaller corners. If the characters aren't feeling it, why should I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, wimpy and boring","review":"Traditionally, I'd give this movie a longer review, but since I was so incensed at the meandering plot and not-so-compelling character developments, I'll wrap it up with this: Skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"I'm not saying the acting isn't good, but honestly this movie just doesn't work. I never cared much for Dillinger character or his love interest. I never cared if Pervous quit the FBI.

Just a movie that misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Video Quality","review":"Already have a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.Very disappointed.

I wish it had been a double disc , that they would of took the time to make this movie twice as long and elaborated more on historical facts executed in movie. That is the only fault i can find in it, my husband is very hard to please on movies especially historical outlaws, he is a history channel nut and he loves this movie. He is rarely satisfied with new movies today of that era.

Depp is completely wasted in this slow, ponderous, bland, characterless drone of a movie. Bale is non-existant. Cardboard cutouts have more character than those portrayed in this movie. We know nothing about them at the start - and even less once it's over. You'll be very happy when it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh yawn","review":"If you want to watch a seemingly endless series of fire fights with automatic weapons this is the movie for you. It has Johnny Depp in it, but no movie is perfect. Apart from Depp it is reasonably well acted. The problem is, aside from actors shooting blanks at each other, there is not much here. The movie is at least historical inasmuch as it shows Dillinger being gunned down after watching a movie. I hope whatever he saw was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Heat' Revisited","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this film because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale; I also enjoyed the work Michael Mann put into Heat. As I was watching this movie, I simply could not forgive the fact that this movie was just \\"Heat in the Depression Era,\\" and that's what this movie boils down to. If you want to see Depp and Bale in a movie together, go ahead and rent Public Enemies, but if you're looking for a good film about the cat and mouse game of cops and robbers, save yourself some money on this and watch Heat instead, because Heat did it before and Heat did it better.I've never written one of this reviews before, but I really wanted folks to know what they were getting into with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really expecting a bit more from this movie. The plot was rather hollow, the dialogue was hard to follow at times, and the characters were very one dimensional and uninteresting.

I am even from Chicago and went to the sneak preview! It turned out to be a mess. It was boring and Christian Bale was so bad. He tried to pronounce words and talk like Obama and it was laughable. The slow motion ending at the Biograph Theater was pathetic. The theater I saw it at was packed and yawns were resounding throughout my aisle. I still remember my disappointment today and have to say that it was one of the big bombs by a major director."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was pretty good","review":"The story is always going to be interesting. The Story of John Dillinger is always gonna be a good one. I was weary about the fact that Johnny Depp was going to be in this because he is a hit and miss actor and I really didn't want him to ruin the role. Surprisingly he played the role pretty well in this movie. The Direction and Acting is pretty decent nothing to stand up and clap for but for sure a decent depiction of the Dillinger story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, however, this movie is just so so.

One of the worst transfers I've seen. I hate to judge a film based on the transfer, but it is tragically and distractingly bad. It's very dark and you get a lot of white flashing, noise, and a lot of grain. I've seen some pretty bad transfers on older films, but movies like The Good, Bad, and the Ugly which are three decades old looked better than this. No where near the picture quality of more recent releases like Dark Knight, Seabbiscuit, or Star Trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie....but not blu-ray worthy","review":"Great movie - I'm not a gangster fan but I am a Johnny Depp fan (and he looked amazing!).

Take Benjamin Button for instance. You can't even tell that it is was for the most part. However Mann did not attempt to hide the fact with this movie. The frame rates seemed to be inconsistent, especially in the action sequences. The colors were bland and boring and everything had that shiny video look (look at the actors hair). Night scenes were horribly washed out. The audio was terribly inconsistent. Ugh.A period piece should be shot on film and not video to give it that authentic look.

The movie, however, is superficial, cheaply made, and of low quality. Visually, do not expect anything associated with the goddesses (as the chapter titles suggest) like beauty, elegance, or physical perfection. Not just that, the facial makeup and body decorations are neither tasteful nor necessary. The dictions are superficial. The photography is not of professional quality. I do not know what one can get from the movie. Eroticism? I am afraid it will more likely to turn you off. Sensuality?

There is excellent stuff in this book but for an individual investor managing her own money some of the recommended research is not practical. The book is more appropraite for someone who works in the industry such as a mutual fund manager. For example as an individual investor it is just not possible for you to obtain all the necessary information on competitors, industry, suppliers, etc... on every company whose stock you own.

The informal style of the 1934 edition can be easily read and understood by just about anyone. If that one was good enough for Warren Buffet, it's good enough for the rest of us. This latest edition reeks of academic arrogance and is poorly written with points that ramble on forever with no conclusion and examples that make no sense.

I got this CD because of the rating from allmusic.com. It was like four stars or something; I've noticed they like ambient stuff more. This album might be more 'developed' or something, but I just do not feel the vibe. I actually enjoyed \\"Catalogue of Desires, Vol. 3\\" more than \\"The Third Chamber\\".

Rick brought the Jams that you hurried on down to the record store for. this was a good mixture of styles and vibes. Rick Vocally brought it.

The first thing that strikes you about the album is Rick James' appauling dress sense and poodle-like permed hair (the only reason for buying it in the first place). Second is the cheesy 80s script writing and 'pyryamid' theme owing to James' ideas of 'unity'. The music however is merely cheesy 80s pop, with a noticeable funk influence. Tracks such as 'Cold Blooded' are quite listenable though, with great dance beats and classic 80s synth sounds. The last track - 'Unity' - is awful. Attempting to be a heartfelt expression of James' ideas of \\"unity\\" (whatever that is), this song is laughable compared to the other tracks which have more to do with 80s glitz than saving the world. All in all, a pretty average album worth buying if only for one or two of the tracks which are distinctively 80s in character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized and unclear","review":"In my opinion, this video lacked the organization and clarity to make it good.

Most annoying, is his Copycat song, he states that Chrisopher Columbus steals the thunder from Amerigo Vespucci, since America took it's name from him. This is retarded, because Vespucci was simply a mapmaker who never came to America, but put his name there because he could. It just irks me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Naval War in the Mediterranean 1940-1943","review":"Standard short battle history. No new insight or information. could have been copied from Capt Roskill's wotk of the 1950s. If you read this you must read Sadkovich's work for balance and insight into the Italian war effort and why what the UK mediterranean fleet did was not always very inportant to the out come of the campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a Better Editor","review":"If I had a dime for every grammatical error in this book, I'd be a rich man. The editing was horrible, and made it difficult to read.The information presented was, on the whole, good. It was nice that the authors made available material from numerous Italian sources. However, the work relies greatly on secondary sources, and aside from attempting to present a balanced perspective, offers little new to the study of the War in the Mediterranean.I had the impression from the dust jacket and other reviews that the book made far more use of primary sources. I was disappointed that this was not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for astronaut fans!","review":"I bought this for my 4-year-old boy who is crazy about rocket ships and astronauts. It really is a bit old for him b/c he can be rough on toys, but he hasn't broken it yet! It is very well-made for a small scale toy, comes apart to show you the various stages of the spacecraft and provides endless hours of pretend play. I would highly recommend it for children 5+ who have an interest in rockets and astronauts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"I've heard a lot about this, and I wanted to see it, but very few of the tweets actually made me laugh. Also, most of the jokes were just gross : / But hey, everyone laughs at different things, you might enjoy it. I'm just saying I wish I hadn't payed, cause it was a waste of money. :( It's for a good cause, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"Only a couple folks were hilarious. A few were mildly funny. The rest were pretty bad.But it's for a good cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb in Several Ways","review":"You get a first rate musical performance of one of Handel's most tuneful operas. The blu-ray presentation is extremely fine. As noted by the reviewer at blu-ray dot com, the variety of black levels are something you can't get on an ordinary DVD. And then there is the very inventive comic pantomime that the performers engage in along with their singing duties. Two scenes were sensational: There was Trasimede dressing Antigona as the huntress Diana, accompanied by some delicious hunting horn music, in Act I; At the beginning of Act II, Hercules in a side splitting comic book manner takes over the reception room at Hades to rescue Alceste and some other unfortunate souls. Once you get into this fascinating production, you don't mind the updating at all. Handel done straight, with three and a quarter hours of da capo arias, is often a soporific experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INSPIRATIONAL MIX","review":"My dad got this for me for christmas after it first came out and I was amazed at the songs. Among my favorites are WALK WIITH YOU, LOVE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS, YOU WERE LOVED, COLOUR EVERYWHERE, and INDEPENDENCE DAY. I listen to this album all the time. TESTIFY TO LOVE is good to. Get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"I bought this as soon as it came out. I first heard a preview of the song \\"God Loves You\\" from a Jaci Valasquez concert and have been waiting for it ever since. The songs on the albulm are inspirational. I did wish that it had more Christian artists on the albulm but none the less, it was still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring. Music that will lift you up.","review":"As a fan of the show, I'm always moved to tears by the words of wisdom delivered by the angels in every episode. Just like the show, the soundtrack will inspire you. It will touch your heart and make you smile. It will give you a desire to do good. This CD truly testifies of God's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRATIONAL, LIFTS SPIRITS.","review":"My husband bought this CD as a little gift for me.

It can lift one's mood even when they are depressed and lonely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably uplifting!","review":"I bought the album not knowing quite what to expect, but it's turned out to be the best money I ever spent on a CD.

Great soundtrack overall"},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation","review":"The combination on this CD is remarkable \\"When I See You Smile\\"is the most beautiful remake I've heard to date.Uncle Sam does a great job in harmonizing on this lovely track. Wynona retains her star power voice for her two tracks on this album along with Faith Hill, Deana Carter, Amy Grant and Celine Dion.Della Reese shows her vocal power as well in an alternate version of the shows theme song.Whether you are a fan of TBAA or not this album is wonderful and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music","review":"This product really touches my spirit.

Has anyone heard if there will be a new release?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD will \\"Touch\\" you!","review":"Wow! I listened to this CD after the 100th episode of TBAA, and it was so worth the wait after having the CD for a week or so. From Della Reese and friends opening song \\"I'll Walk With You\\" to Wynonna's version of \\"Testify to Love\\", this CD is the perfect gift for those needing a lift, or for those who want some great music along with a great message! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs of love, hope from TBAA!","review":"I love the compilation of artists on this CD.

However, with that caveat in mind, it's a fine overview - actually, the only really detailed English-language overview - of La Lollo's films, with hundreds of B&W photos, synopses, and excerpts from reviews. This is one of the essential resources for any serious Lollobrigida fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply isadorable...NOT!","review":"Why must an artist of Duncan's immense stature be forced to die a thousand deaths at the indulgence of blood-sucking vampires like Lori Belilove and Co. who insist, without reservation, on claiming to be Isadora's offspring. As everyone knows, both of Duncan's children died by drowning when they were quite young. Is the Duncan family aware of the claims that are made in the Amazon product description for this DVD? This outright lie - and the complete lack of artistic merit which relies on this fabrication - is the kind of self-aggrandizement that turns people away from Isadora's artistry and finally made me so sick to my stomach that I left my position as Executive Director of the Isadora Duncan Center, left New York, and left the dance profession all together. Bravo. Lori!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME company!","review":"I was so excited to have these shells on my wedding cake. There was a mistake in shipping and Laurie, from Olde Naples Chocolates, was amazing! She got back to me right away and fixed everything.

Great company to work with, and great product! Thank you Olde Naples!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Received my copy in the mail yesterday and immediately played it. Good disco however, the sound quality is atrocious!!!!!!!. Really bad recording, Viola does not come through as clear as she should, quite muffled, and the orchestra was overpowering, drowning her vocals. I strongly recommend giving this CD a miss........it does not do justice to her. I am throwing it in the waste bin, an absolute waste of money!!!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"Despite the bomb he dropped on his carrer some years ago I think this CD is proof that the man is capable of great things. From the hip party jams through the funky-soul tracks right down to the soul searching ballads this collection will keep you captivated for the entire session. This is definatley worth the money for your music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best, and then some.","review":"When it comes to pop, \\"George Michael\\" is one of my favorites, and even though these 2 discs are great, I think 1 disc would have been excellent. I mean, up to this point, he did have only 3 albums out. It could have been a flawless 18 track disc. Anyway, more is better right. Disc 1 has the ballads like \\"Jesus To A Child\\", \\"Careless Whisper\\", \\"Father Figure\\", and \\"Praying For Time\\". Disc 2 has the upbeat tracks \\"Too Funky\\", \\"Freedom 90\\", \\"Monkey\\", and \\"Outside\\". Plus there's numerous covers and duets, and all pretty good. My only complaints, there's no \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\", and the version of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" isn't the single version. Otherwise, this should be all the \\"George\\" the casual fan could want."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE IS TIRED...LETS GO ON TO SOMETHING ELSE.","review":"George Michael's latest effort shows he is past his prime. His latest effort Outside just sounds like another one of his hits...Too Funky? Fast Love?...I am so confused...He left out some of his best songs, Hand To Mouth, Soul Free, and Older, and puts on B Sides like Desfinado and Somebody to Love....boring! George you better come out with something new and fresh soon, or its curtains honey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best music of all times!","review":"Perfect music for your heart and soul. And if you dance, so much the better! You'll never feel sorry having this wonderful set."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This album has got to be one of the best I have heard in a while. I was never a great fan of George Michael until I heard his \\"Older\\" album. But when I heard he was releasing a best of album, I just had to buy it. Congratulations George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation CD","review":"If you love George Michael, then you will love this collection of his hits. I was a little disappointed that the \\"I want your sex\\" song was not the version I had hoped it would be. This one is the slower one which I didn't too much care for. But there were plenty other songs that I liked so I was able to look passed this little change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Let me tell you that George Michael is awesome and talented! When I saw that MTV videoof \\"father figure\\" in 1988, I was very excited! George Michael is such a cool guy, and thatgirl fashion model that he picked up in his cab was an absolute babe! I still play that videoall the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another superb piece of work!!","review":"As we get older it seems that the music we once listened to has changed in many ways. I was a R&R baby who never dared to listen to \\"pop rock\\" Now that I've aged just a tad. The music I listen to now is much more enjoyable. Hence this box set from G.M. I was never a big fan until now. The quality of music not to mention the choice is first rate. It'll bring chills to your spine. Great music from a great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing his hits with Wham!","review":"I would have given five stars to this collection of George Michael music if it had included some of his hits with the pop duo group, \\"Wham,\\" from the 1980s like \\"Last Christmas\\" and \\"Freedom version\\" and others that I remember like \\"Wake me up before you go go.\\" Just because he went solo doesn't mean he can forget those Wham years. He was really instrumental in making a Wham success. Maybe he couldn't get the rights to the music but his rendition of \\"Last Christmas\\" and his Wham songs are worth listening too.During the Wham years, the music was mellow and shallow but his musical career matured after he went solo. His songs on this collection like \\"Praying for Time,\\" \\"Freedom,\\" \\"Careless Whisper,\\" and his duets with Aretha Franklin and Sir Elton John and the song, \\"Somebody to Love\\" with Queen are fantastic but I still miss his Wham songs which would have earned five stars easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some decent songs by George Michael","review":"I don't like everything he writes, but there are some great songs in this collection. I prefer the \\"for the heart\\" disc, to be honest, as there are some fantastic songs and melodies on this CD. George Michael's solo material is very inventive and original, although to be honest I've always found more appealing his \\"Older\\"-era music; the more tortured, closeted melodies, and not the more contemporary dance-party \\"Amazing\\" material. Just my own preference though.Some great songs on both of these discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"A great collection--thought I do like one Disc better than the other. I've heard that GM has been talking about retiring-which is a shame, but frankly I didn't follow him into his techno-music phase. But this CD is the good stuff. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - An amazing talent","review":"This is the only CD you need to own by George Michael.Even more enjoyable is the DVD version. It has a few different tracks, but his videos are amazing and entertaining. This is my FAVORITE Music DVD, and I own too many!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I love George Michael's music and did not have all of his albums, only Faith, but I loved some of the later stuff and earlier stuff too, so I just had to have this CD. If you love the hits and don't have those albums or singles, get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame if Michael really retires","review":"I can't believe those two editorial reviews actually saying the first disc is bland. I love it. It really is from the heart and for the heart. And it really showcases Michael's beautiful voice. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE.....BY FAR","review":"I THINK GEORGE MICHAEL IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED SONGWRITERS OF ALL TIME AND HE HAS WRITTEN SOME OF THE BEST SONGS EVER.

Keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the heart and for the feet indeed... benissimo!","review":"The new song 'Outside' is excellent... hopefully a sign of what we can expect in the future from George.

I rarely get a chance to find a versatile, melodious, undulating rollercoaster of CREATIVITY in an album, but this one fills the cup! Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Michael Bolton! Better Than Neil Diamond!","review":"I am not the biggest fan of this man's music. This man's songs are boring and his singing has always sounded forced, even during his Wham days. Sony seems to have a stable full of artists who they have thrown ungodly sums of money at, talented or not. Michael is more skilled than, say Michael Bolton, but his songs are soulless."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE'S MUSIC DOES NOT STAND THE TEST OF TIME.","review":"When I listened to George Michaels single \\"Outside\\" which could only hit one Billboard chart, the Top 10 club play...is it no wonder that this man can't have a hit anymore? \\"Outside\\" is just a rehash of \\"Fast Love\\", \\"Too Funky\\", \\"Monkey\\" and a little of \\"One More Try\\" rolled into one. George get out of the 80s! come to the new millenium...Listen to Robbie Williams and get some inspiration! None of his songs stand the test of time except \\"Too Funky\\", which George even noted in an article as Pop Trash. George definitely wrote songs for quick digestion, to make his bank account bigger, and his fan base smaller. Don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service","review":"I never received this item...the system would not let my update my new address AFTER I ordered it...so it went to my old address...I never got the CD and I as of yet I have not been refunded the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"older but definitely not better","review":"I didn't like the songs.

Thanks George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could it get any better?","review":"George Michael is one of the greatest artists ever. This compilation only helps to solidify his immense talents as a songwriter and singer. Only a few can write ballads so wonderfully coupled with great, intense dance tracks. If you haven't bought all of his other albums -- this is definitely one you need to add to your CD collection. With this release, you get a sampling of the \\"old George\\" but more importantly, you get to take advantage of his perfected talents as a singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Michael is my day to day companion...

A hit from GM is always a hit. How about the Best of Wham CD released late last year that I won at a Wham tribute night. I was so proud and now it's gone. BUT...along comes this simple 2 CD set that replaces all of those CD's in one hit! There is nothing on this set that doesn't exude his charm or cheekiness. The bonus is that when you put \\"For the Feet\\" into the CD-Rom on your PC, you get connected to a site that promises to email you with more pictures and info on GM, including a report from the man himself! Try it. Never a bad review from myself as I adore George Michael. There is nothing better than singing these hits in the car, with the windows down, of course!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasures","review":"In fact I own two Beck albums(see \\"What Critics Say:\\" above)and I just bought Listen Without Prejudice...Why did my girlfriend look at me with concern when I said I was buying a George Michael CD?....Come on, AREATH! sings a duet with him, that's good enough for me. I guess I'll have to file this under guilty pleasures right next to the Romantics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Collection of Sensual/Electric Music","review":"Highly recommended for all music lovers. This album reminded me just how many hit songs George Michael had in the 80s and 90s. A journey begins as one listens to the soft, sensual, \\"for the heart\\" CD with Careless Whisper, A Different Corner and One More Try or the fast-moving, energetic, \\"for the feet\\" CD with Faith, FastLove and Freedom. Thanks GM for the memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"George is a genius!","review":"Yeah this is it! George Michael does a best of album. In my eyes he could have done 4 or 5 CDs in this Best of album. Great, it really reminds me of how much great songs he sang.

Disc 1 is very soothing. Some of his songs are just beautiful and timeless. And Disc 2 when you want to get funky. There are a few songs missing but overall it's a great collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vocals, look & attitude!","review":"No questions asked...when it comes to George Michael, he's one of my favourite male vocalists.Maybe the best of these last 20 years.This collection has got all of the hits singles he ever produced - only MONKEY and OLDER are the two notable missing songs here... - along with lots of goodies such as b-sides, live tracks and unreleased stuff.The cd in Europe was massively promoted by the dance tune OUTSIDE (inspired by his \\"toilet behaviour\\"...), which is definitely the grooviest along with FASTLOVE.Another incredible tune is the unplugged cover of IF I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME by Bonnie Raitt...really slow and soulful.Just as soulful is the duet with Mary J. Blige - boycotted on the american version, i hear??? - on the Stevie Wonder's classic IF.Point is, if u want someone to sing properly and get you goosebumps, this is the cd for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely, The BEST of George Michael!","review":"I own all of his albums, but I still bought and love this one.

The content is well-organized and easy to understand. And the review questions are so far so good. What I disappoint is that lack of illustration. If it can contains more figures to show the steps, I think it would make me easier to understand. Also, it does not explain some concepts in-depth and the converge of materials is not good enough. I think it can be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to the game!","review":"It took me a while to understand what is involved in this game. The idea behind the game is so simple that at first I didn't believe I had it right. You have to match the pattern on some gifts to a pattern on the clothing of the witches. The trick seems to be that one of the five witches is almost impossible to find. This means that you look at the same screens over and over and click on the same pictures again and again. The witches come out and say things that no child could understand; it has a very dry, very adult sense of humor. And very, very boring!!!! Also, the game pops back and forth from Dutch to English at its whim. Very annoying when one of those long speeches comes on and you have to listen to the whole thing in a foreign language. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun Book!","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. Fabulously written and fun to read accounts make you feel as if you are there too. Highly recommended to all women who like to travel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have Steve Vai CD don't bother with this one","review":"Toshi is a great guitar player in the fact that he can play the same licks as Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. If you have any of those two artists CD's then his is not neccesary to own. The most original song on the CD is the last one, which ironically has the least guitar playing on it. He did not push any envelopes with this Cd. A lot of talent, but short on originality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooo boring...","review":"[...] This guy is in no way original. His music lacks of soul and his technique is just ok. [...] If you are looking for some \\"new\\" guitar player other than Satriani/Vai you can buy Andy Timmons just because he's REALLY great!

I don't recommend it at all. I was highly disappointed. I heard some people rave about it. ... He has some chops but simply doesn't cut it musically. His playing lacks feeling and he just doesn't cut it in the writing department. The music is not very original. You are better off buying CDs from people you are familiar with...guitarists you have heard before and already know they are nothing short of phenomenal. I'd give it zero stars but it wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Age of Songcraft","review":"In an age of stale and unrelenting bad music and \\"Feel My Pain\\" bands, Toshi suprises with an awesome debut. His talents are mainly shown through his thrilling guitar talents. However his love of songcraft and excellent writing techniques lives up to the title \\"Full On\\". When I think of the re-repeated hoe-hum songs we hear everday on the radio I couldn't even begin to tell you their names. Mainly because they all sound the same. But when a daring and extraordinary guitar/compser as Toshi Iseda comes along. I promise, no one will forget about this new talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind boggling!!!","review":"You play guitar for years and years and practice like your life depends on it, and just when you think your good at what you do this CD comes along!I can not believe how great it is!The total package is right here folks!!!Buy it and you will not regret it.Why this guy is not yet a mega-star is beyond me!There is not a bad cut in the bunch.The only thing that could make it better is about a 100 or so more cuts on it(BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!)...I'm gonna sell my guitars now and take up golf !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album by an excellent artist","review":"Joe Satriani and Steve Vai are my 2 favourite artists, so when I first played this CD I was expecting another instrumental CD whereby the guitarist attempts to break The Great Kats' record for fastest playing (like so many other \\"unknown\\" guitarists) Not so for \\"Full On!\\"Toshi has included a few musical styles that seem to be a standard for guitar CD's - rock, blues & experimental. What is great about this album is it isn't a derived copy of someone else (i.e. ripping off Vai or Satriani nor does Toshi try to compete in the finger Olympics like a Malmsteen). Instead you have a great CD with great tracks such as: Prelude to a kiss, Predator, Custer's last stand, Mayjane Rottencrotch, High Noon. The CD is just fantastic!!As a final note, I am mot a guitar player, so I can't comment on the technical aspects of Toshi, but if you like instrumental rock, GET THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Designs","review":"Quilt designs are cross-stitched on blocks and then sewn into various projects.

Schlauch argues that apart from a few unusually innovative English writers and translators, the modern English novel owes less to these purveyors of genteel glurge and more to the jest books that enjoyed wild and widespread popularity among the lower and emerging middle classes.

Its torture listening to this garbage. Celine Dion needs to have her mouth taped shut, w/ unbreakable tape! Why don't all you losers who listen to this go listen to some real music w/ instruments like KoRn, Offspring, Everclear, Green Day, Metallica, Nirvana, or anything that actually has talent involved. All this lady does is sit around and sing badly. The real talented people actually play Gutar or bass or something that sounds good, and uses talent, instead of getting all this money for singing crappy songs, and acting like a dumb@$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Are Special Times","review":"I purchase three christmas album this year, and celine was include in the package. Why I purchased it I dont know...Okay I thought with Celine's great voice she could nail some Christmas song. Well she Nail them, but not one single note she hit moved me in any shape or form. It's as though she's a robot with no feeling, no heart. Saddly to say I will not be playing \\"These Are Special Times\\" for Christmas. I took her right back to the store for a refund along with another christmas song. Celine please try to feel the music, and sing from your heart and not pretend to feel it. These are the special times wouldnt recommend, I would recommend you keep walking passed it or get bored to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cd would not play in my car.","review":"I love the music on this CD and was disappointed that it would not play in my car.

I happen to think this is quite a good album although not the best one Celine Dion has released, it's still a decent X-mas cd. The highlights include 'The Prayer' which is a duet with Andrea Bocceli written by James Horner(Titanic), 'I'm your Angel' with R. Kelly, the title track 'These Are Special Times' written by Diane Warren and 'Don't Save It All' just to name a few.This one will definately make the most ideal gift for Christmas and will leave a warm fuzzie feeling to those who appriciate the good and simple things in life. Like all her other outstanding efforts, this one's unpretentious and comes straight from the heart.Merry Christmas and may the holiday season bring peace and goodwill to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas","review":"The ultimate holiday collection. Period. This IS christmas music at its very best. The variety of musical styles is incomparable- there is something for everyone. Whether your great grandparents or your teenager, this is a MUST- It has to be on your stereo during your holiday get-togethers. Best Cuts: Oh Holy Night, Blue Christmas, Another Year Has Gone By, The Christmas Song, Christmas Eve, Happy XMas (War Is Over), and the platinum #1 POP single I'm Your Angel. Get it now- there is NO time to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Are Special Times (1998)","review":"This is a pretty good holiday album. I got this album only because of I'm Your Angel and The Prayer. Celine performes The Prayer with Italian Opera singer, Andrea Bocelli. This song was played at my grandparents' (on my mother's side) 50th Wedding Anniversary, where they renewed their wedding vows, back on May 14, 2000. 2 1/2 years ago, my grandfather sadly passed away. Everytime I hear this song, all I can see is him sitting in that church, so happy, and everytime I think about that, while listening to this song, I start to cry. It is such a beautiful song and it is a song that I will keep close to my heart forever. I'm Your Angel is performed with R. Kelly. I have also dedicated this to my late grandfather because the words fit perfectly. Buy this album and listen to those two tracks. You will listen to them over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Christmas albums ever recorded","review":"Celine's fine vocals shine on this album. Unlike most Christmas albums, it is not full of over done Christmas classics. Instead, you are treated to alot of original material such as \\"The Magic of Christmas Day\\", \\"Another Year Has Gone By\\", \\"Don't Save It All For Christmas Day\\" and others. My absolute favorites are \\"The Magic of Christmas Day\\" and the spine-tingling version of \\"O Holy Night\\". Unlike the screechy and annoying Christina Aguilera, Celine actually sings the songs, so you actually know what the lyrics to the songs are. Celine shows off her amazing vocal range throughout the whole album without over doing it. She could teach Ms Aguilera a thing or two about how it should be done. This album ranks up there with other holiday classic albums released by the Carpenters and Mariah Carey. Celine's is certainly to be a favorite for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a Christmas Album?? It doesn't sound like it.","review":"When I heard Celine was working on a Christmas album, I was so happy. I thought it'd be up there with Mariah Carey's \\"Merry Christmas\\" and Gloria Estefan's \\"Christmas Through Your Eyes\\" as one of the greatest Christmas albums ever. However, I am truly dissappointed.After listening to the album, there aren't many songs on here that sound truly like Christmas songs. They are your typical pop songs from Celine Dion. Celine should have listened to Mariah and Gloria's albums to get a taste of what a real Christmas album is.The highlights on the album are her powerful duet with Andrea Bocceli, but again, it isn't a Christmas song. And \\"Happy X-Mas (War is Over)\\", which Celine sings beautifully.If you're shopping for a great Christmas CD, look in Mariah and Gloria's sections, avoid Celine's. If you're looking for a great pop album, buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To spend the money on such...","review":"It's really terrible to have listen to such a awful CD, every songs are similar, no improvement at all! The same shouts come out from the same kind of songs...Please choose any other Christmas Album other than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Depth to it","review":"Mariah Carey she is not!

Almost all of her songs are very interested for me and I always collect her albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, Celine is the best!","review":"out of 120 review there are about 5 people who didn't like Miss Dion, That means there's a lot of people who has a great sense in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but good Christmas CD","review":"Dion's Christmas CD is about what I expected. Some of the tunes are great. Her rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" is the best I have ever heard. I can't believe how long and strong she holds the high note on the last refrain. Some of the tunes are a bit weak and seem to be an effort to make this CD a little different from the norm, just for the sake of being different. All in all, I find it to be a good solid album that will be played in my house for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for this Christmas season.","review":"This is Celine's second Christmas album, the first being available to the United States. She shows her natural talent, style and grace with a flair only known to Celine. In another wonderful show, she gets the whole Dion clan together to sing \\"Feliz Navidad\\" and you can hear the fun in the song. She has tremendous scope and range shown in everyone of her songs, and her upcoming sabbatical will deprive the world of the joy she has given us for over 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous CD!!!!","review":"Celine Dion is incredible.

Yes, this one is a MUST ADD to everyone's holiday music collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, absolutely incredible!!!","review":"It's a great CD, I would recomend puchasing it right away. My favorite songs are I'm Your Angel (duet w/R. Kelly), Christmas Eve (this song is SO COOL), Happy Christmas (War is Over), the title track, Feliz Navidad, etc. The only song I was disapointed in was \\"Don't Save it all for Christmas\\".

What a terrific gift she has given all of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am your angel","review":"I have loved the song I am you angel every since it came out.

I danced with him to that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"EThis CD shows the supreme talent of Celine Dion","review":"Each song is done very well and you will want to play this CD all year long.

You will enjoy every song on this set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Feel of the Most Holy Virgins Prayer.","review":"The Ave Maria sung by Celine is a heart mover.

If you are a Celine fan, you ahve to gt this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Angel in heaven is missing a voice.","review":"This is an amazing piece of work. This album is worth buying if only for one song - O Holy Night. I have listened to this song over and over again since she came out with this album in 1998. It's about 10 years now, and I am still deeply moved each and every time that I hear it. I even listen to it outside of the Christmas season. Truly the best rendition of this song ever performed... and it may never be topped. Ave Maria is another song that she sings with extreme emotion... and another one that makes me want to weep like an old Italian man at the opera. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"First cd works.. the second doesnt... not at all happy!","review":"I bought this item for myself as I love Celine Dion's ave maria.. i bought the collectors version because i planned to give one cd to my friend who also loves her music..Well the joke is on me.. cause only one cd works.I am not even seeing the option to contact the seller.. so its just a waste of money if you ask me.Would never buy again from this seller.. learnt my lesson there.Sabrina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album,but not her best","review":"Celine has been a great favourite with my family(this has been the case,especially with my sister),since quite some time. I think she did a great job for this album; as always she has a great voice. And besides, this album is suppose to have a religious significance. Yet, it pales in the shadow of her other albums - albums the like of \\"Let's Talk About Love\\" and \\"Falling Into You\\". Another thing, just in case the music fan from Canada didn't know this,it is true that Franz Schubert (1797-1828), wrote Ave Maria. However, he wasn't the only one who did so. Gounod (1818-1893), DID write a different version of Ave Maria quite some years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine Dion: These are Special Times","review":"CD is great, but all it has it 3 pictures while the music plays. I though it was her holiday special. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD for All Occasions","review":"\\"These Are Special Times\\" is a very 'nice' CD.Songs ranging from the contemporary \\"Feliz Navidad\\" to the R.Kelly Duet \\"I'm Your Angel\\" is quite a contrast on one CD. My favourites are \\"The Prayer\\" with Andrea Bocelli, and \\"I'm Your Angel\\". They are both indescribably beautiful. They could almost make you cry no matter what language you speak. They are so heartfelt and self-engrossing it feels like they are giving you a personal serenade. The climax of \\"The Prayer\\" being the phrase in the lead up to the chord they build up to and hold a long time gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside. \\"Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful)\\" is exquisitely accompanied by a vocally lilting gospel choir. The title song \\"hese Are Special Times\\"s quite a contrast with a pop feel.This is a great CD for all occasions even if it isn't Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining, incredibly annoying voice of a over-rated woman","review":"Having listened to her previous three albums, I can;t help noticing that Celine Dion makes no attempt to produce anything that even borders on the original.

I felt the point of both books was not to elevate the art of literature, but rather to convey the life-shaping experiences of her years in the arctic, using literature as the medium. I understand Jean and Tom filmed portions of their time in Alaska during the \\"Arctic Son\\" period, and I would love to locate a copy of that, if possible. Any help out there????

So I filled it in with cigars which were about 70% humidity. Two weeks later and it was back to 55%.Left it overnight in the balcony open when it was ~80% humidity. In the morning it was showing 75%. Two weeks later - 50%. I open the box only once per 2-3 days.I gave 1 extra start just because the box itself looks good.

Snug top, does the woosh sound when you drop the lid. Latch works great, cool beveled glass top. The included humidifier is of the green floral type which works great when combined with 50/50 distilled water and Propylene Glycol however the velcro did not stick to the side for more than one day it could have been all the humidity, but thats okay I just placed it on the bottom of the humi. The included analog hygrometer is very accurate and the humidity after seasoning is holding steady at 70-72 percent. The box itself is somewhat on the smaller side but still a great starter humi. I have about 20 sticks in it right now. Great buy for the price and quality. I recommend this product and recommmend the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"The container that holds the distilled water doesn't work well, and the actual box leaks humidity.

I normally have great luck with amazon purchases, because of the reviews. Hopefully this will help someone else pass on this humidor. The humidor itself is gorgeous, I love the look and build quality. However my hygrometer like so many others does not function properly. Mine did NOT come with the divider that was shown in the pictures, and the humidifier it comes with is very mediocre. Upon buying other humidifier products and a digital hygrometer mine functions fine. However for the price spent I could've gotten a nicer unit from the get-go. Look somewhere else if you want a decent deal on a humidor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, functions just okay.","review":"I have had this box for a year and was my first. It was good to learn with. It looks really nice but it doesn't hold humidity very well, as others have stated. In the winter when the air is dry outside the humidity drops below 70 easily. In the summer when the air is moist the humidity fluctuates along with the humidity level outside. So I conclude that it probably leaks. The outside humidity affects the humidity inside the box so you need to keep up with it in winter and lay off it in the summer. It is possible to maintain the level most of the time but it takes more work and tinkering. It is made of quality materials it seems and has a great price. You'll need to upgrade later if you decide to become a cigar aficionado as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to calibrate","review":"Got this as a father's day gift. I had trouble getting the humidity up to the recommended 70%. I was only getting 50% (or so I thought). Turns out after I used the instructions to calibrate the hydrometer it read a perfect 71%. It was off a whopping 20%.Works great now.... I used the propylene glycol / distilled water mix (by Madelaine) to fill the humidor. Great deal for the price Amazon is selling at.

It is well made and they used quality wood that has a nice finish to it. The fit is just right and the seal is tight. It doesn't have a lock to keep out the curious but with the glass top that's ok. The instructions to care for the humidor are concise and well worded. It comes with everything you need to get started except the distilled water and that's easy enough to get at the grocery store. The case even comes with a brass plate that you can have engraved. I would recommend this humidor to anyone as an entry level to medium cigar affectionado. Great bang for the buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, cheap humidor with a couple caveats.","review":"The humidor is entirely functional and really looks very good, it's much better looking in person than in the crummy Amazon photo (the cedar inside is a pinkish hue and the outside is a reddish cherry color). The glass top is nicely beveled, thick, closes with a satisfying thunk. The humidifier works well but, because the top is glass, you have to cut into your cigar storage space to place it away from the hygrometer.Speaking of the hygrometer, it's a cheap POS and is my only real complaint. I got lucky that mine reads exactly 5 units low because the \\"adjustment screw\\" isn't a screw at all and is completely non functional. If you get one on a good day you're golden, but if you're unlucky and get a unit that is way off there really isn't anything you can do, except buy a new hygrometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks better than it works","review":"I ordered this for my husband at he loved it at first.

I was looking for an historical account on the life of an influential person, but instead I was faced with the personal opinions of someone whom I had never heard of.

Double up the action and the weapons, but take away the level of gore the first one had and you pretty much have Blade II figured out.

I didnt like the face That I could spot the weak CG special effects off the movie. And one of the best characters 'Snowman' had a small part in the movie and was killed off. The plot was thin, its like people wanted a Blade movie, and they got this, semi-ok movie. The first one was alot better. All in all go watch a good movie like Black Hawk Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even in the same class as the original movie","review":"Has the movie-going public sunk to the level that garbage like this can be released and be profitable? The original Blade was a first-rate movie. The story was coherent, the characters had some depth, and some actual thought appeared to go into the script. None of that is present in this movie. It's like watching a John Woo travesty; one dumb action sequence after another, with little or no story in between. This movie flashes before you eyes like an MTV video, and is about as memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still can't believe this film was a hit!!","review":"The original Blade was a much better film. Blade I's story was solid and the characters quite interesting. I expected the sequel to be even better but unfortunately it relied too much on uninteresting special effects, the wrestling scenes were a joke, and gore. The character Whistler had much more dialogue and actual \\"Character\\" in the first Blade film as did Blade himself. The Vampires (The Blood Pack) in Blade II were in no way frightening or even semi believable. Ron Perlman was good in City of lost children and Enemy at the gates and is obviously a better actor than portrayed in Blade II. The first couple of minutes of the film was great with the \\"blood bank\\" scenes in the train station but it quickly went down hill with a thud. Buy the original and get a memory wipe in regards to Blade II (I hope Blade III gets this series back on track)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOOO Bad","review":"I was sooo bored in the theater when I went to go see this with my bf, who liked the first one. The theater only had 4 other people in it and by mid-movie, only 2 were left. I think they were sleeping. Speaking of mid-movie, by then I was so bored I was actually looking around for something to do. Yes that's how restless I was getting. Good vampire v.s underworld of vampire evil. Now I love vampire movies, but this was bad. But you know, at least my bf was transfixed; when he pried his eyes off the screen he knew that was the last time he'd pick a movie. and yes; he thought it was a pretty good movie. Ahhhh!Anyways, the whole thing was really dark lit(obviously, and very redundant- even the fight scenes.

I think it was the change in directors. Part 1 had a better look and feel then this one did. The movie got boring after awhile and around the end the movie REALLY fell off.

I was so exicted when I heard they were making a sequel because Blade was such a good movie, and then they come out with this mess. With a rather dreary plot, the movie projects much more gore on the audience than necessary, and the movie lacks depth. Wesley Snipes is always good, but even he can't make up for the rest of this movie.

It features Blade, taking on a new breed of vampire called the Reaper, which feed on humans and vampires. The reapers are practically immune to all of blades attacks except one, and they reproduce like rodents. This forces blade into an unlikely alliance with his most hated enemies, the vampires. Gore and fun ensue. I had to take off a star for the sometimes hokey CGI scenes (When Blade and Nyssa fight in front of the lights) that detracted from the movie. The reapers mouths look like cooters, and are fittingly disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Yawn","review":"If your taste runs to the sophomoric ideation such as the WWF and that ilk, by all means, run to see the film. However, if you are seeking a storyline that isn't interrupted every few minutes with inane martial arts, puffed up chit chat, and an accompanying Rap soundtrack, avoid it.The best bet with this is to rent it first. Personally it was a money waster for me and I regret buying it based on the original Blade without having seen this sequel first. It won't hold up well on repeated viewings the way the first one does.When all is said and done, this film seeks to financially cash in on the Rap/Hip Hop culture and the many anime/martial arts fans while dressing it up in a pseudo-vampire theme.Those associated with this film should be embarrassed to have lent their questionable talents to its creation.Better luck next time New Line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real CUT-UP","review":"I had forgotten about this movie,and the price was right.Now while viewing this I found a 4th video, so that is inthe works.Yes, they do have a dual disc set of all fourmovies.

I absolutely loved the first Blade, and was half expecting the sequel to disappoint me. I was wrong. The movie clicked along at a great pace. Watch the deleted scenes and listen to the commentary. These guys know how to make an action movie and keep it moving along. However, the sequel was much more of an action movie - the first movie had more character development and, actually, I liked the vampires in the first movie better. But the action and the visual effects in the second movie made for an excellent time! The extensive use of computer generation was very fitting for a movie based off of a comic book. I will gladly watch this movie again and again. Simply awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"blade2 the greatest vampire movie","review":"Many of you sci-fi buffs out there realize the ups and downs with the success of a good vampire movie!Personally,i am very picky about the intelligence of the plot,acting,and special effects.Blade2,is a 5 star movie,delivering exceptional graphics,to a story that will leave your hands in a fist,\\"The entire movie\\"!!I am a proud owner of this movie,and personally, i have not wanted to purchase a movie since the extrordinary movie the matrix.Go out and get blade2 today.It will stimulate you to see it again,and again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonstop Action","review":"Blade was a great movie and I actually liked it a little better then Blade II but if you are into action this is the movie for you. The first quarter of this movie tells the story and explains a few thing then the rest of it is one long ... action sequense.

Snipes explains the rationale of each of the fight scenes and has stories of stunt mishaps.The Director, Del Toro and the producer Frankfurt have a party on their track. They mock some of Goyer's dialogue and applaud the stuff that worked just right. A lot of fun.There's even an isolated score track! (Just the music.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"For a movie that was supposed to be real great, I thought it was a piece of junk! Throughout the whole movie they did nothing but fight. It's real great if you like guys showing off their martial arts skills, but it gets a little boring after a while. I recommend renting it, before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is movie making taking this direction?","review":"Nothing in this movie redeemed its deplorable violence. The first Blade was original, interesting, and uber-cool. Blade II is a shadow of the first; it is empty, cynical movie making, pandering to the dregs of (male) society. There was nothing surprising about this movie; there was no story in this movie. It tried to make up for this by filling time with the most horrific, violent, bloody, disgusting scenes I have ever witnessed, but it didn't work. It was violent without reason or cause. All of the fight scenes looked staged, and all the technology, which was so ahead of its time in the first movie, looked dated and out of place. Save your money and buy a genuine action movie -not a mimicry of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Doodie","review":"'Blade 2' suprisingly was just as horrible as 'Blade 1'. 'Blade 1' was absolutely awful(just look at Wesley Snipes' totally 1991 haircut)and this sequel was just as crackerjack crappy. The only saving grace is the much underused Donnie Yen(who also did the fight choreography in the first half of the film, which was the half of the movie that sucked slightly less than the other), but he can't even save this turd of a film. Total Doodie. Can't wait for the third one to come out. I'm sure having the girl from '7th Heaven' playing a vampire hunter is totally gonna continue the legacy that is 'Blade'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help, I need a transfusion","review":"One more reason why sequels so seldom work. Kris Kristopherson should have stayed dead. This movie is more like \\"A tribute to Wesley Snipes\\". The storyline is weak, the plot thin, and if the producers had actually ever read the comic book this was based on, it might have had some promise. The only thing going for this movie is action, probably to cover the pitiful dialogue. If you are looking for a bloodbath, you found it and that's about all. The first Blade was good, Blade II is redundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incrdible sequel","review":"The mix of martial arts and horror is outstanding. This is a very well made film with few flaws. The acting is stand out as well.Now to the flaws. The first is the occasional bad cgi. Especially during the fight between Blade and Neesa(sp?). It slips back in later, but is not half as bad as that mentioned scene.The DVD itself is flawless. Quite possibly the best picture and sound available on DVD. The extras are good as well. The pact of blood doc. is very nice. There's an assortment of trailers and featurettes also on the disk.All in all, this is a great DVD and is well worth the money. The only thing that could make this better would be if Paulina Rubio came with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grittier, heavier and plenty more fun than before","review":"Successful sequel to the 1998 gore-fest, this time Blade (Snipes)teams up with an elite vampire squad called the Bloodpack (who are actually trained to kill him) to hunt down and eliminate a new and tougher breed of bloodsuckers called the Reapers (reminiscent of Max Schrek's portrayal of NOSFERATU) who attack both humans and vampires. More dark, gothic and grotesque than the original with even better visual effects and martial-arts scenes. Gabriel Beristain's atmospheric photography and Del Toro's focused direction also give this bloodthirsty film a real, horrific European feel. Flawless entertainment all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie kind of..., kind of good too!","review":"The acting was pretty good, some of the action scenes were well done! The parts I hated were all the gory, those were the bad parts, plus the plot wasn't strong, but that didn't matter too much to me. Just the gore!

This film opened up a whole new gateway to crap CGI too.For more information, see the scene in front of the huge lights, somewhere near the beginning of the film.Or just watch as Blade moves like a cut scene from a Playstation 1 game.Yep, another rant to a horrible movie that needs to be showcased that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as good as the original","review":"I liked the sequal slightly less than the original.While this film still possess the kill'em all,take no prisoners attitude by our favorite vampire killer Blade,there was something about this film...it lacked what the original had.It is still greatly entertaining,and the boosted quality in the cgi effects are great,as well as the makeup.It has a decent storyline,and it follows through with a good finish,setting up our hero for his next venture(soon to be released in December).It's a good movie,and well worth watching and owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"Watching Blade II was like having a bad dream. Not a nightmare, which might be interesting to watch: just a bad dream. It's like what might happen if a studio ever agreed to try to produce (and to make sense of) the excited fantasies of a seven-year-old. A load of nonsense, and the action isn't even very good. Really not worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of the Reapers...","review":"The film brings back to the screen the story of Blade, the vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must ally with his enemies in order to prevent a new breed of vampires from taking over. It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, though the choice of Norman Reedus as Scud was poor at best as he does overdo it with his character's \\"attitude;\\" it gets tiring, not to mention extremely annoying after a while (but then again that could have been done on purpose in order to pave the way for his \\"ending\\"). In any case, he is not convincing in his role.Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT! Blade is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the series.","review":"The 2nd installment of the Blade series is my favorite and I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere but here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snipes is back in action","review":"Blade II (2002) Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlman, Luke Goss, Leonor Varela, Norman Reedus, Thomas Kretschmann, D: Guillermo del Toro.

This time, he sides with a band of his hard-hitting enemies to take on something they both have never encountered: a vicious super-vampire that is making its own type of vampires. Spectacular special effects and style, which are more confident this time, get in the way of the mythology of vampires and crucially the story; the movie also turns mind numbing and grotesque. Running Time: 117 minutes and rated R for strong persuasive violence, language, some drug use, and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Two is not about Christmas","review":"Tom Flynn's collection of historical tidbits makes this a fascinating read. Unfortunately, he has an axe to grind and he sharpens it through a considerable portion of the book. He surmises that Christians should shun Christmas because of it's pagan roots, and that Americans should reject it because of its manufactured nostalgia. I agree that children should not be allowed to believe in Santa Claus, but to reject the holiday symbolism because of what it used to mean simply overlooks what it has come to mean to millions of people across the globe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not abolish ALL holidays?","review":"Why stop with Christmas? All holidays should be abolished. Life should be colorless and bland with nothing to look forward to. That way we can work more and produce more.Honestly, why tell people, via this book, that they can't have a holiday? Christmas is what you want it to be, and it's different to different people. It constantly evolves. If some have no religion in their version, so be it.

After that the CDs sounded even greater than they may have if I purchased them first. The Masterplan is a great--if not one of their greatest--albums. The only real problem I have with the album is the adding of \\"Swamp Song\\". It just doesn't give the CD the excellent flow that would have been there had this track been left out. All in all, though, these B-sides are some of the best Oasis songs I've heard out of their entire collection I own.

Though influenced (and which major rock/pop band isnt) by the beatles, Oasis stands for evrything the beatles didnt. Rocking Chair, Listen Up, Going Nowhere, Fade Away, Stay Young, Half the world away, All great songs musically, but if you step inside the lyrics, you find views expressed formally in punk rock. Like wanting to be great in a town where average is expected. These kids from Manchester hated the town, had a poor childhood, and found that there only outlet to their depressing lives was music. As heard in Fade Away- \\"While we're living, the dreams we have as children fade away.\\" Perfect.

If you put every oasis song that has been put on some kind of cd (album,ep's,lp,s etc) you will find this to be the best collection of the 90's by one band there's no doubt. I don't understand why the 'masterplan' wasn't put on the morning glory album it would have made it an even better album because the song is as good as wonderwall and better than most of the others on the album.The rest is good 'round our way' and 'aquiesense' are two crackers.

Noel copies less stuff on this CD, so a lot of the songs really sound original. They're also delightfully varied. There's punk songs (headshrinker,fade away) and then there's really soft ones.

But, I don't know how they left off \\"Cum on feel the noize\\" and I don't know why they included one of the lamer Oasis songs I've ever heard \\"Going Nowhere\\". Oh well, it's definitely worth the money to get this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too early for a B-side album","review":"If Oasis had waited rather than milking the market we would have received a better package probably resulting in a multiple cd box set. Though few tunes are impressive, most are filler material which is why they were made B sides in the first place. I would really liked to have seen the Noel version of Cum on feel the Noize put on as well. Poor song selection from a poor crop of songs results in a extremely poor album."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-sides?","review":"how are these songs b-sides. i ask this question to myself all the time. songs like goin nowhere and rockin chair should have been on another cd, as shoudl the rest of the songs.

I will leave it at that and if you like any other cd, then you will love this one evenmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Oasis Album!","review":"Forget Definitley Maybe, Whats The Story Morning Glory.......the over indulgent Be Here Now and Trippy Hop Of Standing On The Shoulder of Giants.......this album is a collection of Oasis B Sides....but is a better than any other Oasis album.The good thing about this album is that its just a really great all round album with no singles like other albums have.Every track is great, and the whole album not only has some loud rockers but also slow acoustic songs like \\"Talk Tonight\\"and \\"Half the World Away\\" and one of the best Oasis songs ever if not the best \\"The Masteplan\\".It also features some punkish rock sounding tunes such as \\"Headshrinker\\" and \\"Fade Away.\\"If your want to hear a really good album from the best band of all time (or one of the best if you want to argue with me)get this its just a fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best oasis CD EVER!!!!","review":"I love oasis and have all the albums. The b sides collection \\"The Masterplan\\" is the best!!! it's better than what's the story, and even better than the great definately maybe. It's got my altime favorite oasis songs. the songs on here have the best lyrics (rocking chair, underneath the sky, and my favorite, talk tonight) as well as great music (the instrumental full version of the swamp song) the songs on here are pretty personal, a lot more feeling than shakemaker ever had... songs such as half the world away, rocking chair, and listen up seem to show a bit of isolation from the community. the album is a killer, the best thing released in the 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"Probably their worst album ever. I am surprised so many disagree with me! There are only two really good songs featured on this album, \\"The Masterplan\\" and \\"Acquiesce\\". All of the others are terrible. The most hideous would have to be \\"I Am The Walrus\\". I am minimally impressed with this work. No wonder their all B-Sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't Freddy scary anymore?","review":"By the time Nightmare 5 came out Freddy Krueger was a pop icon. Nightmare 5 shows this because it tries to make Freddy less scarey and more funny. His one liners aren't that great and I don't know if this is right but doesn't it seem liked they toned Freddy's burned skin down ever since he became a icon? Bottom line this movie trys to be scary but just can't make it. I would not recommend this movie to any Horror fan or any movie fan in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful CD","review":"This is one of the best kept secrets in Gospel music.

We have been carefull to tightly recap the pens. Even tried storing the pens in different positions to see if it made a difference. If they work, it's a few dark scattered dots. The pens still work for drawing on the doll, but the color is very dark and unmake-up like. We have also found that the pens do not wash of of the skin with soap.

In fact, there's no mystery. If you can't figure out who did it, you should not be allowed out of your house. The sex scenes are not sexy, erotic or titillating. The movie is just plain boring. You want a sex movie to arouse you. This just made me yawn. Besides, who wants David Caruso to star in a sex movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hum-Drum, Ridiculous Psuedo-Erotica","review":"This film is supposedly an erotic thriller but it turns out to be only a mess. Linda Fiorentino lacks the presence and sex appeal of Sharon Stone or even Nicole Kidman. Chaz Palmentari is cadaver-like and David \\"Who Needs NYPD Blue\\" Caruso in no leading man. And the cast is just the beginning of the problems. The plot and script are silly though Director William Freidkan tries in vain to raise the suspense. There are some unintentional momemts of humor: the blackmail photos of Richard Crenna have obviously been doctored to give him a seemingly buffed body and the \\"erotic\\" scene with Fiorentino, a stranger, and some panty hose is so poorly staged it's a riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE FINE PRINT!!!","review":"Jade [Blu-ray]This film actually features Chaz Palminteri, Linda Fionrentino and David (I left TV for this and now nobody likes me)Caruso.

If you're wondering why red-headed men never become movie stars (unless you count Yosemite Sam), David Caruso has the answer for you; he sticks out here like a carrot on a bed of romaine. The press said this movie was actually WORSE than \\"Showgirls\\", released in the same year, if such a thing can even be imagined. Joe Eszterhas shouldn't be allowed to write a check, let alone pen anymore \\"screenplays\\". Why someone bothers to preserve this while something like \\"Chinatown\\" has yet to appear on DVD is anyone's guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamburger served on a silver plate","review":"The technical elements and the production values in 'Jade' are first-rate - fine photography, a creepy James Horner score and lavish, elegant sets. If you are studying production design or film music, this is a good movie to see.The problem is that the script is trash. It's not much more than a 'Basic Instinct' clone with elements, such as ones set in Chinatown, that lead nowhere at all. They just fill the skimpy story out to a feature length running time. Of course, if you are studying script writing, you get some ideas of what not to do.The marvelous cast is wasted because this is one of those movies where the characters do what they do only because the script says they must. AS a result, Caruso, Fiorentino and Palmenteri can do nothing more than give a little color to their cardboard characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I saw the previews for this movie and I thought it would have been a lot better than what it was. I wish I rented it 1st instead of bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you need to trust the bad reviews","review":"I rented this movie mostly because they goof on it in \\"The 40 Year Old Virgin.\\" I like Caruso on CSI Miami, but I have begun to see that Caruso always plays David Caruso. Yet, here he plays an even less cheerful cop. What fun. His character in Jade is so stoic that he makes Dirty Harry look like a neurotic. Sadly, this is one of those erotic thrillers that is neither thrilling nor erotic. It's better than your usual Shannon Tweed erotic thriller twaddle, mostly because you get Chaz Palminteri as a supporting character rather than, say, William Katt. The plot makes no sense, however, and the sex scenes are boring. If you want good-looking sex, rent some porn. If you want a good thriller, rent Rear Window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than expected","review":"Very nice, but this runs real small.

John Langdon's Wordplay allows the reader to look at this from a different point of view, and brings insight into how he goes about creating his intriguing ambigrams. It should appeal to the type of person who likes visual riddles or illusions.

So is \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" and \\"Kicking and Screaming\\". Vinnie Jones made an auspicious debut in a bit part as a debt collector in \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\". Asked to shoulder the heft of a starring role Jones just doesn't have the acting heft. His co-stars in director Guy Ritchie's debut film(Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vas Blackwood)run circles around him in this vehicle. Truth be told soccer holds as much interest to me as grass growing. That said I'm not a hockey fan but I loved \\"Slapshot\\".

And the colors in the photos are brilliant, capturing the startling and moving contrasts and color selections that distinguish Amish quilts.

You can use it as a low-security bike lock with a padlock of your choice. Onguard's web site rates the security of their products and the rating on this one indicates the amount of security it provides. You can also use it in tandem with a u-lock to secure your front wheel to the u-lock and the rest of your bike. In this situation the security provided should be quite good.Secondly, the quality of this cable is outstanding for what it is. All of the pieces fit together very nicely and the materials used are excellent. This is a far nicer choice than many others out there.So if you are looking for a decent lock in low-crime areas or if you want something to use with your more protective u-lock this is a great choice.

I didn't learn anything from it and it was not inspiring. I don't know where all the rave reviews are coming from. I guess from people a lot smarter than me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autumnal style Mahler beautifully played, superb recording","review":"Most Mahler collectors and enthusiasts have at least a few recordings of each symphony and most likely several of their very favorite Mahler symphony. This recording, so beautiful, clear, so lacking in digital harshness, such detail and dynamic range emerge - that it can fit into any Mahler collection. The ASO give suave, well defined tone, that allows us to hear the full score. While Levi conducts without a neurotic Bernstein character, nor the frenetic \\"greased pig\\" style of Karajan, this is world class playing beautifully captured. Tempi are just right. Comparatively, I would opine that this is Levis' best Mahler effort. Von Stade sings beautifully and the Wayfarer songs are most welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"As others have indicated, the quality of Teach Yourself varies from book to book. Teach Yourself Swedish is confusing, boring and of little value to the true beginner.1. First, the book does a poor job of explaining regional pronunciation differences and does an even worse job of explaining general pronunciation.2. Not all of the dialogues written in the book are recorded on the CD. Therefore you are always skipping through the book trying to figure out which dialogue you are hearing.3. The storyline in the book is tedious and boring.4. The different portions on grammar are OK, but there is very little organization with respect to vocabulary.To conclude, the book and CD are disorganized, confusing and of very little help to people with no prior knowledge of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has helped me significantly","review":"When I first became interested in learning Swedish, I bought this book. As I had no previous knowledge of the language, at first it seemed a little hard to understand the dialogues and paragraphs, but by the time I reached the last chapter, I had learned quite a lot. After I finished the book, I started reading Aftonbladet, which helped me to learn new words and phrases. I constantly looked up unfamiliar words and wrote them down in a notebook. Then I bought another book, Colloquial Swedish, which cantains more advanced material, and it has also helped me. These two books are a good way to start learning Swedish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT beginner level and has scant information!","review":"If you are searching for a beginner-level book in order to learn enough Swedish to enjoy visiting the country, don't waste your money on this book and tape like I did!!Although the audio tape included with this book is a good way to get a feel for how Swedish sounds, it is definitely not at a beginner level. The book does not have enough detailed information for someone who has no prior background in a Scandanavian language to be able to learn this language without lots of extra help (and having learned Spanish and Japanese previously, I found them both MUCH easier to learn than this book made learning Swedish)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Help, but not much","review":"I really found this book difficult to use, leaving you with a small stock of colloquialisms but no knowledge of the actual structure of the language. Why has the \\"Teach Yourself\\" series changed their format so much? I have a copy of the \\"old\\" Teach Yourself Swedish as well, and while it's short on dialogues it certainly covers the entire grammar of the language, as well as giving a complete explanation of the pronunciation.With the tapes, this book can guide you to some skill in pronunciation, but I suppose any book with tapes can do that. Aside from that and some of the cultural notes I didn't get much from this book. The material produced by the Swedes themselves is much better and written for literate adults, which doesn't seem to be the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Negative View","review":"As a former member of the scion society of The Silver Blazes, I found this alleged biography of the life of Sherlock Holmes well researched and doubtless correct in many of its assumptions. Having said that, however, I must also say that I have rarely read a book so tedious, uninteresting, and downright plain dull; I only finished it to see if it could really get any worse. The author takes a career filled with events of the caliber encountered by SH and reduce both them and him to insignificant ciphers of unimaginative and prosaic mediocrity. This is not my kind of book: is it yours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This film was highly recommended to me by a couple of people who know movies and usually have great taste but I didn't enjoy it at all. The concept was pretty good but it just doesn't deliver. The characters are stylized in a way that just doesn't grab you in, the writing, direction and editing feel slapped together and the voice overs are interminable, not funny and don't move the story along. The script also throws in some ugly and gratuitous scenes/language to try to perk your interest but it just cheapens it further. The movie comes across as a very poor man's \\"American Beauty\\". Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"election","review":"Just dumb! Not worth the time it takes to watch this production. Surprised at those actors in this level of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not funny.","review":"Although there were a few humorous lines the movie as a whole was pretty disappointing. Matthew Broderick gave a credible performance but the script is lacking i.e. Marlon Brando as Barney the dinosaur wouldn't be very interesting.The films' premise was a good one and certainly promised to be funny but it just wasn't. Not funny from either a high school perspective (check out '3 o'clock high') or a political one (I recommend 'Bulworth').Broderick's great talent was wasted in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie","review":"I wanted to give this no stars, but the system does not allow it. This was one of the most deceiving movies I saw last year, billed as a great comedy. The Mtv movie productions should clue you into what will come next. It is crude, highly offensive and you should save your money. If you like Matthew Broderick in a high school movie, watch Ferris Bueller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year","review":"Don't buy this DVD !!! I invited some friends to watch this lame excuse of a movie. They wanted to take me out and shoot me. It is not funny !!!

I can't believe Reese Witherspoon would associate her good name with such garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highschool student-teacher sex is funny?","review":"I believe a teacher having sex with one of his students is considered a felony. In this film its a comedic plot. Why is it the Broderick films I have seen all attempt to find comedy senseless criminal acts? What generation/group is Broderick a member of that thinks causing pain and suffering is so funny?The redemption of this film is found in Witherspoon's acting and the fact that all the criminals in the film got their just punishment.I gave this film four stars because I was able to ignore Broderick's comedic(?) narration and billing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even free can't cut it","review":"I could kick myself for shelling out the one day rental fee for this. Even if it were free, I'd pass on this one. Reese Witherspoon should have 1) hightailed it out of town when she had the chance and 2) should have thought about throwing herself in the dumpster with her characters posters. The trailer itself rates 4 stars-watch that and enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comedies ever!","review":"I was going to start this review be saying that \\"Election\\" was the best comedy of the Nineties. But I thought about that and decided that there aren't too many comdedies from any decade that I find as funny and as incisive as \\"Election\\". Reese Witherspoon is absolutely terriffic as the ambitious, obnoxious Tracy Flick who wants to be Senior class president. Matthew Broderick is the mediorce, middlebrow teacher who would foil Tracy's ambitions and he plays his part to perfection. The pacing and dialogue are excellent. We've all known a Tracy Flick in our lives. We've all felt that she didn't deseve the rewards she reaped. But you know what? If \\"sensitive\\" folk like the rest of us had Tracy's drive maybe we'd be where she landed. Remember Yeat's line about the 'best lack all conviction, while the worst are filled with passionate intensity\\"? Well this is one of the dynamics at work in \\"Election\\". But enough of being heavy; this is a funny, funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"painful","review":"The brilliance in this work is in its pain. We all knew Flick in high school, and we all wanted to strangle her little neck. I was very surprised when I saw it thinking that it would be another one of those high school movies, but it is so much more about cruelty, and Matthew Broderick's teacher character's problems with life, and in the fact that he, like the rest of us, wanted to strangle that girl in high school. It incorporates all sorts of adult themes that I was not expecting... his domination fantasies where he dreams of having sex with his student instead of with his wife, his affair, and then in the end he still loses and she wins, and the cycle continues in its inherent truth. A must see, not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plot shored up by sex and failure. Depressing !","review":"The irony of the plot is lost in the in your face and constant display of sex which really has no place in the movie other than to shock you and depress you over how willingly the characters choose to ruin their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Flick = Film Icon","review":"Ever meet people that claim to be 'big Reese Witherspoon fans...all the way back to Legally Blonde?' Love Reese, but never heard of 'Election.' What's up with that?Well, this is the movie - and role - that made her. 'Legally Blonde' was 'green lighted' based on Witherspoon's performance here. Do you know her movie production company is called 'Type A Productions'? In 'Election,' she portrays the Type A prototype: Tracy Flick.Okay, Matthew Broderick is really good here, and so are the others to a lesser extent. But this movie belongs to Witherspoon's Flick and director Alexander Payne. In other hands, this might have been a goofy teen comedy. But under Payne's excellent direction, it becomes a steel-eyed battle between Witherspoon and Broderick.Once you've seen this movie, you find yourself identifying certain actions from others in your life as 'Tracy Flick behavior.' It gets a knowing laugh from anyone who has seen the film. Rent it today and get in on the joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pick Flick!\\"","review":"A sharp and witty satire with great performances not all the same. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully twisted as the obsessive go-getter who acts as if a simple student council election were the opportunity of a lifetime. She basically steals the movie from the rest of the cast, which couldn't have been better, but in this case it's like comparing somebody like Marlon Brando to... oh, I don't know. Edward Furlong? One of the best of '99, but did we really need the subplot of Broderick's trashy lifestyle? Maybe the film tried to make it's characters easy to hate. The highlight of the movie is when Broderick gets stung in the eye by the bee. Judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"This movie hits so close to home I can't help loving it! I know a girl who is EXACTLY like tracy flick! I told her not to watch the movie so she wouldn't get any ideas. The teacher, mr. mccallister is just like a teacher in my school too! such a funny movie...i think you have to be a teen to appreciate it though, i know a lot of older people who hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"\\"Election\\" is one of the most intelligently-written, original and well-acted films to come out in years. The storytelling is never predictable or conventional, yet everything that happens feels honest and correct. The characters are far more fully-developed than those in any recent Hollywood film I can think of. In the beginning, you expect Broderick to be the hero and Witherspoon to be the villain, but the former does some despicable things, and the latter proves to be somewhat sympathetic. Although \\"Election\\" is a comedy (and a very funny one at that), it makes more valid and honest observations about human nature than most \\"serious\\" films."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"I really thought I was going to like this movie, but I didn't. I thought it dragged on continuously and the story was third-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too harsh for my tastes","review":"I knew going in that Election was a black comedy, but it was a bit too harsh for my tastes. Standout work by Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon (her performance should dispel any teen queen preconceptions). The overall story presentation was well paced, but there were moments of jarring darkness. Not one I will be watching again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling & Smarmy","review":"I thought a lot about this film, which usually means I like it, however, I think this film comes up short. I think whether it meant to or not, this film had a pretty low opinion of women, there wasn't one in the film that wasn't domineering, backstabbing or a lesbian. That isn't a lot for a male to choose from. This movie rambled on way after it should have ended, the entire \\"New York\\" episode could have been cut. But my biggest complaint about this film is: who am I supposed to like, to \\"connect\\" with? almost every character in this film is odious. \\"Rushmore\\" was far more poignant and \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" was far funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and disgusted","review":"Perhaps it's because I'm a teacher, I live in Omaha, and I'm a women (and this film disgraces all of those), but I think the most likely reason I really didn't like this movie was because there weren't any characters you wanted to root for (except as others mentioned, maybe the lesbian). I like funny movies, but this was not funny. It's a pretty dumb film overall, a waste of brain space, and needlessly smutty. Will not be blindly picking movies with 4 stars again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is like two movies in one.","review":"My brother told me that this was the funniest movie of the year, so I rented it. I just didn't find very much humor in it. I felt like I was watching two movies at once. The one about the high school election was at least interesting, but the one about the teachers and their wives was dull and unbelievable. A true mixed bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Awful","review":"Reese Witherspoon only did the best job. She has the aggression just like everyone has running out for something. Like I did running for Student Council Secretary. Matthew Broderick did a terrible job. It was so bad I laughed at it. Although it was not funny. The football and cheerleader porno video was so dumb to put in there. It made the movie slutty, disgusting and on it's way to an x-rated film. I don't reccommend this film to people. This movie contains some sex,lesbian issues and things worse than that. Chris Klein just made himself looked just as stupid such as in the movie American Pie.

It was made by MTV films which says alot about the politically motivated aspects of what happens when a Music Video cable channel decides to starts making movies which are politically based and totally one sided. Its hard to believe that Matthew Broderick went from Ferris Bueller ( A Hero ) to a conniving,evil,audulterer (Mr McAllister). Another thing that hurt (following MTV'S political agenda) was that it glorified Homosexuality and made men look stupid,evil, and immature. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie!","review":"This movie was disgusting, disrespectful, and a waste of an hour and a half of my life!

That's what I was thinking. The fact that MTV Films produced this movie should have been enough of a warning. Election is not funny, nor clever, nor interesting. All the major characters are immoral bad people doing immoral bad stuff. I am not a prude and if this movie was entertaining in anyway I could have set aside my judgement of the characters. However, it is not entertaining, nor do any of the characters show remorse or grow in anyway. There is nothing redeming about this movie.Please don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen!!","review":"I've read so many good reviews about this movie and thought it would be another great Reese movie, but turns out it was BAD.

My misconceptions were proved to be wrong when I realized that Election is *not* a teen movie, as I had assumed it to be due to the fact that Reese Witherspoon was in it. Election is dark, satirical comedy. People looking for a movie about boy troubles featuring giggling teenage actresses will not be satisfied by this and will probably not get it.

There are some R rated movies that I have watched while the kids were home, but just not in the room actively watching it.

Finally, years later after graduating from college and now a young senate page, Tracy appears to be repeating the pattern she's established w/ older men; the implication being that she's having sex w/ the Repulblican Senator from Nebraska.

I've watched it several times and think I enjoyed it more the second or third time, especially if watching with a friend. In simplest terms, for me this movie is a metaphor for, \\"Once you have found the magic, don't let it go.\\" Its a little campy and probably not for everyone. It is especially cool if you have seen Huell Howser's \\"California gold\\" episode on Newberry Springs (the setting for Bagdad Cafe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, but Engaging","review":"I'm one of those people who doesn't like sci-fi, fantasy, silly romances, most comedy. I like drama. And don't give me obvious humor and expect me to laugh. I don't like weirdness much, either. I like things straight-forward.I refer to this movie as \\"The weirdest movie I like\\" and when I've gotten others to watch it, they liked it, too. It's on the cusp of mainstream and artsy. Most importantly, it's very UNDERSTANDABLE and entertaining. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated Actresses","review":"This one of the best films I have ever seen.

The contrast of certain German (or perhaps more specifically, Bavarian) standards with American is a source of hilarity to the viewers that know both cultures, but everyone I've talked to agrees that the gradual rapprochement between all these quirky, essentially warmhearted characters is endearing. Yet it almost miraculously manages to avoid sentimentality and certainly avoids superficiality. The music of the soundtrack is also haunting. I would have given it 5 stars except that there is one scene with a musical number that seems unnecessary and drags down the flow of the story only at that point. But otherwise it's a thoroughly charming, atmospheric film that I absolutely love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baghdad Cafe","review":"This movie on DVD was excellent.

As I began the book, I couldn't shake the feeling that Roy and Sam were in their mid-50s, not their actual age of 35, and it really affected how I took in the novel. Their actions did not seem congruous with the way they spoke, and vice verse. The dialogue was stilted and the writing was often confusing with unnecessary phrases. I keep reading reviews claiming that Berger is a \\"master of the human psyche\\" but I found his \\"revelations\\" to be weak and obvious. Additionally, I found Sam incredibly unlikable and could not understand why Roy and Sam bothered to maintain such a \\"friendship.\\" This was my first Berger novel, and I wish I liked him so I could read his many other works, but I will not be reading another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper its printed on","review":"This book was an absolute waste of time.

Some even seem to have reversed interlacing (but that may be my imagination.) The worst, and probably the best examples of this problem, are the season 5 episodes \\"The Game\\" and \\"A Matter of Time\\". I find the effect very distracting and uncomfortable. It basically ruins the product.. To add insult to injury; The Season 5 episode \\"Conundrum\\" is missing \\"unavailable\\" \\"due to licensing\\" from Amazon Instant video .

Sad to say, it wasn't required reading. I read it on my own, and it's one of the few books from that era in my life that I remember having read. I know Koine Greek, so Jeremias' quoting the original language of the New Testament was wonderful to me. However, for those who don't know Greek, there is a condensed Greek-free version of this book titled, \\"Rediscovering the Parables.\\" It's probably available somewhere used. If you're reading this review, then you're interested enough in this topic to get your hands on either version. \\"The Parables of Jesus\\" is a book you will read and revisit through the years. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the historical Jesus scholars","review":"Forget about those silly ... over at the Jesus Seminar. Jeremias is the real deal. He dedicated his life to building a bridge from the primitive church back to the actual words of Jesus and I think he was remarkably successful. The heart of Jesus' message is the parables and this book takes us into the company of Jesus. It's as if we're hearing him for the first time. A simplifed version of this book under the title \\"Rediscovering the Parables\\" was published back in the sixties. It shouldn't be too hard to find in a used book store specializing in religious books. That edition translates all the Greek and eliminates some of the scholarly detail without at all blunting the power of this profoundly insightful key to Jesus' teachings. It's a shame that so much of Jeremias' work is out of print. John P. Meier in his Marginal Jew series makes great use of Jeremias and in many ways agrees with his findings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book Inside","review":"The cover of the book was as described.

The picture freezes a lot and for some reason only what is in the foreground of the picture seems to stay focused. Everything in the background shakes from side to side during the entire concert. Imagine watching an entire movie oscillating your head side to side really quickly. Its annoying and nauseating. I don't know if it is only my copy that does that? All my other 3D movies play without any problems. The silver lining is that I was able to see this concert live, so I am not left wondering how cool it must have been to be there.

Which, with no remastering visuals, or Blu Ray is like watching classic anime from the late 70's or early 80's. Do waste your money. Watch it on your Youtube app for free on your cell, or on your tablet, Hulu and YT, even Veoh for free is the way to go. Unless you need to nap for over 35 hours without the PC on then by all means.

I beg you to do an internet search for the Pierre Bernard's \\"recliner of rage\\" ROBOTECH piece on Conan Obrien several years ago. He speaks to the madness that is the ROBOTECH video release system. I suppose you can't blame Harmony Gold too much for not having produced any quality follow-up to ROBOTECH in almost 30 years.

Basically, it's another one of those very pathetic films about pathetic people who don't have anything else to do other than worry about other than how uphappy they are.

It has a story that is not simplistic or overwrought but has the feel of looking back and inward. Walk on the moon as a title works because the nation was held in wonder mirroring the way both Pearl and her 14 year old daughter are at the way their life is turning. It is a pivotal point for the main characters in this gentle movie. The main review states \\"Although its tale of marital crisis unfolds a bit too cleanly...\\" You know, I don't find it difficult to believe that there are some people left in America that are able to go beyond a crisis and find a way to reach out and hold on....that not everyone thinks a talk show or reality show way of handling life is the only way. I will admit this is a bit of a feel good movie that allows us to walk on the wildside and still have the security of home and hearth. I loved this movies music and the 60's theme really worked for me. I sure hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, intriguing movie.","review":"Diane Lane is simply one of the best actresses there is. Unfortunately, she is rarely seen on screen due to the fact that she is tasteful, has integrity, and is picky about her roles. In this movie, she plays a bored, burned-out housewife looking for romantic adventure. When it becomes clear to her that she isn't going to get that from her nice but straight-laced husband, she turns to a traveling blouse salesman, and the steam begins! They begin their affair on the night of the moonwalk and goes on through Woodstock. Anna Paquin does an outstanding job playing Lane's daughter, also experiencing a longing for some romantic attention. The chemistry between them is great. This film is definitely not for the judgemental. Still great, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk on the Moon","review":"Here's a chick flick for the baby boomers out there.

It is a tender, gentle, heartbreaking, and beautiful story of a housewife in 1969 finding her way in the world. It is also the story of her teenage daughter discovering herself and coming to terms with the confines of Judism, the struggles of teenager-hood, and the freedom of the summer of 1969.Viggo Mortenson and Diane Lane are excellent in this film. Viggo is~~ finally emerging~~ as~~ an A-list actor with~~ his~~ performances in Lord of the Rings but Diane Lane is still underappricated.There are several beautiful scenes in this film one of them being a tender scene under a waterfall--tastefully done.

Such a scenario as evidenced by the movie plot has been played out by many people. Anyone who did not follow his dreams can identify with something in this film. I have to agree with at least one reviewer that this is a highly UNDERRATED film! I thought the acting was superb on the part of everyone. Diane Lane is a talented beauty. You can really feel her pain if you are not already jaded! This movie makes me yearn for the friendlier times when people knew their neighbors, felt much safer and when life seemed less complicated. If you're a romantic you will probably enjoy this film. If you didn't grow up during the two decades I cited above, you may be incapable of appreciating the nuances of this film. The simplicity of the story line with few, if any, special effects results in a very good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we review the DVD instead of the FILM?","review":"I think that is a very fair question, considering the gushing over the film and five star ratings for the DVD. Ordering it on a whim, I have to point out now that this disc has never seen so much as a frame of playtime on my 32\\" plasma set, and never will. The reason is abundantly clear during the opening credits. The jagged edges in the credit text, visible on a 19\\" CRT, leave one wincing at a bad viewing experience about to be had. A viewing on any PC software such as PowerDVD reveals why this disc is so hard to look at. Clearly taken from an interlaced source, a frame-by-frame viewing shows the line structure becoming visible whenever there is any kind of motion. In summation, this is a dog of a DVD, and even if you seriously dislike the film itself, you cannot argue that any film does not deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Lane is a sexual goddess","review":"Diane Lane stars in this great movie set in 1969 upstate New York.

The Cross Movement are easily the most fantastic name in gospel hip-hop on the quality of their lyrical content alone. Their style and imagery are downright masterful and their theology is more profound than anything you will find in ANY genre (and more than a lot of preachers I know!).This album was their debut, and shows its age a little bit. In my opinion this is their weakest offering it all (thanks to a couple tracks that are complete flops) and STILL it is better than probably 80% of the gospel rap you can find! A must-have for any CM fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing read!","review":"I have just finished reading this book which my mom bought for me in the UK.

The book traces Sandra's investigation of her own father, and the hideous discovery she uncovers of his [love of underage children] and the deplorable policing that failed to investigate the murder or pursue many allegations of [physical] abuse against Alexander, Sandra's father. The lesson in this book is to recognize that abuse is everywhere, often in front of our very eyes, and we need to be conscious and vigilent in order to prevent it's continuance. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies of the Canyon","review":"Pleasantly surprising small movie, loosely based on Joni Mitchell, according to the director. Frances McDormand is great. The soundtrack is catchy, sort of Coldplay-ish, as is the band character, who even looks like Cold Play's lead singer. It's a chick flick, but it's high quality. Great cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"and predictable, one really good line of dialogue, and i can't even remember that! good cinematography and professional production values, nice overflight of LA area, and the swimming pool looks very refreshing, all in all a seemingly very self-indulgent self-referential theme, which means: boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't waste your money on this stinker. Either McDormand and Beckensale needed some dough that week and were willing to look foolish to get it, or they were swept along by Hollywood's distorted social consciousness. Maybe both? In any event, this is a silly porno movie without any porno in it: a repressed girl opens up to \\"new experiences,\\" egged on by her campy record producer mother-in-law, made lonely by her absent doctor-husband. Sound like a 1970's paperback? You bet. Want to see McDormand and Beckensale kissing for about 4 seconds? This is the film for you. The main mover behind this four-legged barker is someone named Lisa Cholodenko, who both wrote and directed it. Hopefully film has heard the last of her because Fellini she ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda.","review":"Fine acting and good photography wasted. This film pretends to be a study of fidelity until the girlfriend starts a threesome with the mom and her boyfriend. While watching Kate Beckensale kissing Frances McDormand you discover the film is saying that all women are repressed lesbians. This is not true at all but obviously is the fantasy of the writer. It is gross and proposterous to see a man's girlfriend cheat on him with his Mom. What were they thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as ditchwater","review":"This is one drab & predictable exercise. A young couples strength is tested by rock stars and foreign accents. Christian Bale as the uptight, stuffy guy and Kate Beckinsale as the repressed bookworm. After the temptations are overcome the 2 lovebirds relationship is all the stronger for it. Just like life only stupider. Avoid this like the plague unless you are a big fan of head trauma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurel Canyon DVD","review":"Great movie. Received the dvd quickly.

I'm, of course, a huge fan of Frances McDormand. She can do no wrong in my book, but I thought the story and the acting was wonderful on all fronts. In some ways we are all embarrassed by our parents, as they are us, but as we get older, we learn to extend our limits of patience and realize it is all about love..the love you give and receive. Sometimes you need to test your boundaries to find out if your choices are the right ones. The soundtrack blew me away and I've just ordered it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"LADY OF THE CANYON","review":"Maybe one has to indulge in lead character Jane's party favors to enjoy \\"Laurel Canyon\\", a domestic comedy about a newly graduated physician intern who temporarily moves into his rock and roll mother's home with his girlfriend. As it is, the lusts and loves of the characters inside this Canyon mini-mansion mostly reminded me of a Frankie and Annette beach party movie complete with the foreign exotic beauty who shows up on the beach to steal Frankie's heart. Successful rock and roll producer Jane is all attitude, no characterization, strutting around her recording studio in a muscle T-shirt, smoking joints, and behaving like a poster child for a renewed subscription to 'Rolling Stone' magazine. The rest of the characters buzz around her like equally bland insects to a glaring light. This movie concerns corporate rock and roll and that just isn't cool enough. It also suffers from a sad desire to be \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAAAAATED IT!","review":"I hated this movie. Not one character has a redeeming quality. Mom is an aging hippie in denial who smokes pot and boffs rock stars half her age. Rock star is a self-centered self-important no talent.

[What happens during a fire?] We see a strange household and hear strange conversations. They are working at home to avoid expenses for rented business space. [Acoustics?] The conversations reveal their personalities and quirks. Is that a crazy business? Polite isn't her thing. The boring conversations roll on. Are they tedious? \\"It was nice meeting you.\\" Sonic ooze?I couldn't watch it for more than 30 minutes. Was it meant as a joke?

I went to the local Best Buy and looked at every Ray Charles CD they had, and this was the only one with this song on it. It was only $4.99, so I bought it. Ugh. As the previous reviewers said, the recordings are NOT good. At least the one song I wanted isn't too bad. Several of the others are duplicates of others I already had on disk, and those duplicated songs on this disk are much poorer recordings.

However, the adhesive is less than what I had expected for the price. I have used it on different types of surfaces and it just didn't hold up.

I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted. The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness. The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.

West Side Story, Sweeney Todd, Into the Woods, Sunday In The Park With George ... even Company has sad moments. Although there were tear jerking scenes in this show, as well, it was mostly a satire on the hypocrisies of relationships.

They will fill an entire room with a fragrance or scent, whereas Candle Bay reed diffusers which I tried do NOT fill a room with fragrance. I do not recommend this product.

Although some people may not like some of the actions on the stage, I think they're necessary because the Salzburg stage is simply so large! Besides, they're mostly very appropriate.

However, if you travel back roads, camp, fish, hike, canoe, etc., then this book is invaluable. I have relied on this book to provide us with out of the way camping spots and it's never let me down. Most state and national forest campgrounds don't appear on highway maps, but this book has them. It's also especially useful if you want to find alternative routes, scenic drives, or short cuts off of major highways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as up-to-date nor user-friendly","review":"We got the atlas for an 11-day trip to Minnesota, and ended up hardly using it at all.I've used many road atlases, as I prefer them to folding maps, but this one was more of a nuisance due to its size and unclarity.I also doubt its up-to-date-ness, as a couple of roads that looked promising in this atlas turned out to be non-existing or dislocated.To me, the most undesirable trait was the fact that it was quite unfriendly - graphically-speaking.Some main roads (and even freeways) were represented similarly to smaller roads (color and width), which required really exerting our eyes in order to figure out which is what.We drove ~2500 miles in Minnesota, and after a couple of attempts, the atlas ended up on the back-seat, and we switched to the AAA map we had with us, luckily.Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Gazetteer","review":"Extremely useful, as are all the state gazetteers.

The lock replaces one bolt. There are 3 other bolts that assemble the Allen bike rack I purchased. The lock bolt attaches the rack to the hitch. Another bolt can be removed to steal the rack. However, doing this would require the thief to somehow purchase the missing peice to attach it to another hitch. The missing piece may be cheaper than a full rack. Also, the nut for the lock bolt did not easily fit on the lock bolt. It wasn't machined properly. I used the bolt from the screw pin that came with the bike rack and it worked. Not sure if another manufacturers bolt would work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does lock","review":"This is one of those things to foil the casual thief. It does fine as a replacement for the usual non-locking hitch pin. It will not keep your bikes safe.

The Allen hitch has been fine. This locking hitch pin installed OK although it was stiff to put on. Taking it off resulted in the stop nut (with interior plastic collar) SEIZING and the hitch pin head broke loose and unscrewed - it is supposed to be permanently fixed to the pin! The nut is jammed but good so now I have to cut the pin off near the nut. Should take about an hour with a hacksaw and it won't be fun. When it's off, I'll use the original unlockable pin with a regular nut, not a stop nut. Now that I think about it, if you just use a regular 3/4\\" nut on the locking pin, maybe with a lock washer for long trips, then you will probably be happier than I am right now.Later, the manufacturer replaced the pin under warranty and I think it will work fine as long as I use a plain replacement nut instead of the included stop nut.

Was suppost to be an anti-wobble locking pin, but did not keep it from wobbleing.

My favorite genre is comedy, and this is one of the best have seen, and it only gets better every time I see it.''Zongo's in the house!!!''"},{"rating":"1","title":"Salmon gone off","review":"Basically this is a movie for those that like the genre of comedy, with physical and sexual and bathroom humor. It has everything, bad language and back stabbing as the wait staff tries to win a prize in Slammin' Cleon Salmon's (Michael Clarke Duncan of \`The Green Mile' fame) restaurant...so the evening is shown with the customers and staff; with some guest spots by people such as Morgan Fairchild, eating their meals and the wait staff trying to make a huge amount of money.The DVD has English subtitles for hard of hearing and Spanish subtitles. There are outtakes of goofed lines over the end credits. There are two audio commentaries from the writer/director/actors and an extra of the movie trailer and one called 'Hellish Kitchens: Art Imitates Life' but the sound on that part was so bad, since it was recorded as they were riding in a van, I could barely under stand them.All total not a complete waste of time, but just not a great use unless you like this type of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This really was not a funny movie.

Both Beerfest and Super Troopers are truly fantastic comedies. Having seen all of their movies, I had really high hopes for this film, but was quite disappointed. Duncan was fantastic, and there were some funny moments, but would consider this their weakest movie by far. The Slammin' Salmon looks stunning, and the pacing improves after the 30 minute mark, but much in the same way I felt Club Dread fell flat, this movie just doesn't quite deliver at even that level. If you are a fan of BL movies its worth watching, just beware that this doesn't come close to the very high bar they set with Super Troopers and Beerfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get this movie","review":"I guess this movie is supposed to be funny, but to me, it was awful. My husband agreed. Maybe we just didn't get it?It wasn't that the humor was too gross or weird, it just was not funny. Again, I'll add that maybe we just aren't cool enough to understand this film, but we cut it short about 2/3 of the way through because we just couldn't take anymore. Only about 5 films ever, that I didn't watch the entire thing and this has now been added to that distinguished list.I'll add, I was really surprised to see Michael Clarke Duncan in such a rotten movie.

I like comedies, watch a great many, and didn't like this one. To me it was not funny. Again, it's subjective. The humor, using the term very loosely is slap-stick. Characterization is poor, probably because there is not much story to build characters on. What can I say? Check with friends who share your sense of humor. If they like it, watch it.

Their theatrical releases have been at least watchable with a few decent laughs. This one which went straight to DVD did so for a reason. Just a poorly done movie from start to finish.One of the most interesting things about this movie is watching how far Michael Clarke Duncan has fallen.

Frankly it is depressing, as is this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A broken broken lizard","review":"Don't get me wrong, the movie was ok, but just barely. The plot was a pretty bad idea in the first place. I really enjoyed Club Dread and Super Troopers, and thought Beerfest was decent.

The highlight of the film, and really the only moments I laughed out loud were with Zongo."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"This movie was silly and often downright stupid. There were a few laughs but the plot was silly and contrived. The acting was mediocre.

Maybe this movie is more for people aged 25 or less or younger than 17, Sorry it has a R rating. As an older adult it mainly falls flat. Of the 339 movies released in 2009 it ranked 322 and this was a Christmas season release! I don't even think the theatres wanted to show it!

It's a wild ride of zany, enjoyable comedy that manages to be both silly and quasi-intelligent at the same time. In particular, I appreciated the fact that the film's setting was limited to a restaurant over the course of one evening, which gave the movie the feeling of a two-act play. And best of all, rather than being a throwaway gross-out comedy, this one is clever enough that it probably deserves repeat viewings.

It's not fun, and it happened again tonight.The comedy is low-brow and juvenile; even awkward at times, and while there are some endearing moments, they were so few and far between that they made no difference. This is just a horribly ran comedy.I think it's time I came to terms with the fact that I'm not a Broken Lizard fan.Aside from Super Troopers, this crew is clearly failing.- t -21 June, 2010"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to their original standard","review":"The Slammin' Salmon is a mildly humorous attempt to document the comedies of daily life in a restaurant. The movie highlights Slammin' Cleon Salmon's attempt to pay off a gambling debt with one night of sales in his restaurant, all while seemingly inept employees are constantly sabotaging their own jobs and each other. The employees of the restaurant are promised a handsome reward if they are the top seller, getting Salmon to his goal of $20,000 in sales. The night ensues with crazy antics and wild attempts to coerce patrons into spending more money on top dollar items. Each employee is trying to one-up the other. Unfortunately, the movie lacks consistent comedy and leaves the viewer with relatively few moments of laughter. The creators of Super Troopers really did not provide a solid encore performance with this movie. I'm glad that I don't have to eat there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Slammin' Salmon Lacks Punch","review":"Broken Lizard has created a cult following with mildly funny comedies on the cheap, their latest of which is The Slammin' Salmon, a movie that just never comes together. Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) gets plenty of laughs as the owner of the Slammin' Salmon and former Heavyweight champion who seemed to have a few screws punched loose during his days as a boxer. As does April Bowlby (Drop Dead Dive) as an over eager waitress. But the actual members of Broken Lizard, as waiters and cooks in a contest not to be fired, bring nothing to the film. And cameos by Olivia Munn, Morgan Fairchild, Vivian A Fox, and Will Forte fall flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Movie","review":"First off: Don't buy it on Blu-Ray. There is no reason to, and you can save a few bucks if you just buy it on regular DVD. The movie itself is very entertaining. It has a breezy tone that is great. The characters are all funny, especially Nuts. Broken Lizard movies hinge on the chemistry of the actors, and where they faltered with \\"Club Dread\\", they succeeded with \\"The Slammin' Salmon\\". All the actors work well together, with major props going to Michael Clarke Duncan. He was much funnier than I was expecting, and had some of the best lines.

That they strayed from the source material is evident the moment this epic begins. That they had no desire to lay claims to anything but Verne's title is also evident. A cynic would push that suspicion one step further by stating the obvious; they hoped to cash in on Verne's book and its reputation. Which makes this a cheat, fraud at the worst. When certain expectations are offered but not given, purposely, that's the definition of a swindle.All that aside, this is simply not a good feature; the title is the best thing about it. The journey aspect was brief and then they became landlocked, embroiled in a get rich quick scheme (seven years in the making, something that was not explained in the story).They should have named this movie something else so I wouldn't have bothered buying it.

I agree that the human-like lizard monsters were pretty cool, and the whole center of the earth environment was pretty cool. Trim this puppy down to a solid 70 minutes and you might have had a cult classic - but alas, not a mini-series.

The initial discovery of the underground world is awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, after those 50 minutes things manage to get absolutely horrendous. The effects look cheap, the acting is mostly amateurish, and the action scenes are sloppily made. Not to mention that the soundtrack sounds more appropriate for an episode of Beastmaster than a miniseries. Oh, and what's with the back of the box stating that this is 139 minutes long?

The costumes and scenery are definitely out there and the whole story is a light-hearted fantasy. Plus, it's got two love plotlines (both with men pining for supposedly unattainable women). Sure, you know how it will end, and yes, it is not one of the most intelligent plots, but it's not boring or annoying! I thought it was sweet and humorous. Parents with kids, the special effects and dinosaurs will keep 'em entertained and you'll find it amusing enough to stay awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.....","review":"....This is a bad movie, but I must clear something up.

They release remakes and adaptations of enjoyable fantasy movies and legends with a modern twist and great effects. Naturally I saw their stamp on this DVD and thought \\"Great!\\" Oh dear....what a shame.This movie tries hard to be interesting and it is watchable, but only just. Explorers searching for a missing doctor make their way to the centre of the earth and get caught up in a conflict between two prehistoric races. There is almost nothing from Jules Verne's classic story here, as has been mentioned already, but I found even for a fan of fantasy this was much less than what I expected. I think it is fair to say that Hallmark relied on the cast and title to sell the movie rather than a decent script.

Hallmark once again you have taken a classic story that all ready had a great movie of it and you made a second rate copy. On it's best day it can't hold a candle to the 1959 version with James Mason and Pat Boone. I can only hope since another great movie, Mysterious Island, is finally coming out on DVD October 29th, that perhaps they will put the original Journey to the Center of the Earth on DVD as well soon.

I too rented this so called 'waste of time' in hopes of being entertained but the quality of the production was almost unbearable. Honestly, the sound recording was terrible, the acting performances were that of a high school play and overall there was no stucture to the story that would allow someone to follow.

The directing is awful with no talent being displayed in any area, the production design, lighting and casting also very bad and I truly feel [let down] ...I mean really!

First, it was one of the first concept albums to ever be made, along with The Wall and Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band. Second, it was possibly the first album to tell visions of apocalypse, since there is that theme running through it. And third, it was the first album to reveal the tortured lifestyles most rock stars at the time had. I won't bother explaining the concept of the album, since most people already know it. So, I'll just say this: If you don't own this album, buy it NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The vinyl is the value","review":"I think the CD is a better remaster than the Ryko issue or the last reissue, but the differences aren't that major and certainly not worth the price. I bought this for the vinyl, and it was well worth it. The record sounds better than any CD version, comparable in fact to the original British pressing.

The poetics of Bowie's lyrics and the phenomenal guitar riffs hold this album together and are what makes it a classic, must have album. This is Bowie at his height of fame and truly captures Bowie's glam rock side of the late 1970s. I could not choose a favorite song from this album because, to me, each song builds off of one another like a good concept album should. From the opening of \\"Five Years\\" right to the end \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\\" shows the various levels of Bowie's artistic ability.This is a must have for any serious collection of Bowie and for anyone interested in good, wholesome rock showcasing one of the best artists of the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"Now, I know I'm probably gonna get beat up for saying this, BUT i dont particularly care for this CD. I'm a huge Bowie fan and I have most of this CDs. Maybe it's dated, or maybe I just dont understand early Bowie all that well, but I was very dissapointed in this album. After all the hype, I expected a listening extravaganza, but it didn't quite happen.I like Scary Monsters, Low, Outside, and Station to Station much better. These are stand-out stellar cds. Get those instead.Ok, now you guys can rag on me all you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleased his teen fans, not his best.","review":"The stage persona of Ziggy is one of the most famous images in rock. But is this a great album?I suggest Hunky Dory, or his tryptich (low/heroes/lodger), or even Scary Monsters. All have more complex and interesting songs. Ziggy itself is a great song. Soul love, Starman have memorable offbeat syncopation with the guitar, but much of Ziggy is done better elsewhere.If there was one record of Bowie's to get, this would not be it, though this is probably his most famous work.It is funny to see how androgynous Bowie was, to say the least, and then suddenly in the macho 1980s he made a big goof of it in interviews. Rock's Chameleon for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"This album has always been over-rated. Bowie only had 3 or 4 decent songs from the 70's (Fame, Golden Years,Changes). Most of his stuff from that era was just glam garbage that appealed mostly to British teens who couldn't seem to get enough of all those self-absorbed, self-important and mostly over-rated glam acts like T-Rex, Slade, The Sweet, Sparks and Gary Glitter.

Well, OK, probably, after all it is catchy -- however I doubt nearly as many people would have taken notice. The music on its own is kind of irritating. I still can't deny there are some good hooks like the main guitar riff from \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". However there is just some kind of sickly sweet quality to a lot of the music, mostly in the vocals, which just bugs me somehow. The first time I heard nearly all of these songs I felt it, and it grows with repeated listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang Ziggy!","review":"Probably the most overrated performer of all times, Mr. Bowie is a perfect mystery. While there are moments when his genius clearly shines through (Life on Mars, Space Oddity, All the Madmen, Kooks, notably The Man who sold the World and few more)it remains a pretty frustrating thing to like him overall.I saw him live couple years ago and he really pulled the crowd's strings, undeniably an incredible showman. What about Ziggy Srardust then? A classic rock and roll album topped with Bowie's characteristic juicy English eccentricity.That's all fine, but why should everybody go raving mad about it?I'm utterly perplexed.At the time of its release much more talented bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who were in full swing, Queen were just starting to gain prominence, but people still paid much more attention to the thin white duke.Oh well, must have been his make up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And a great resounding snore was heard around the world","review":"... and the people went into hibernation for two years to wait for the next useless Pink Floyd remasters.Ziggy Stardust releases.., 2012 Remaster, 2002 30th Anniversary...2003 remaster, 1999 Enhanced, 1990 Au20... nothing new people...move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable Glam Trash","review":"This is one very overrated album.

I had previously heard only Bowie's Space Oddity and knew hardly anything about him. Five Years got my attention, Soul Love gave me a taste, Moonage Daydream got me hooked. This is good stuff folks. That summer I went to see him perform the Diamond Dogs concert. He acted out every song (including Space Oddity w/that platform reaching out over the audience). The two young ladies I went with told me it was the best concert they'd every seen. Knowing I had seen and heard something special, I agreed. There are so many classic cuts on this CD, but none affect me more than Rock n Roll Suicide. Desperate times didn't seem so desperate after listening to this track. Although I didn't discover this album until the summer of '74 (thanks Cyndi!), without it I wouldn't have made it through that difficult time in my life. My second most favorite album of all time.

I know Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" and remember him in an 80s Disney movie, but here is what propelled him into stardom.Uh, why?I'm sure David Bowie was super cool in 1972. Whacky guy in crazy costumes! Songs about a band from space! Woah! However, this album is like a giant 1990's cellphone; interesting at the time but now we snicker at them as we browse the Internet on our iPhones. The glam rock idea has been greatly improved upon; look no further than The Darkness, Adam Lambert & Semi-Precious Weapons for proof.

The lush strings on \\"Starman\\" are just amazing, and never has Bowie's acoustic guitar sounded more angelic.I think it was a good decision to put the orginal tracks on one cd and the bonus material on another. It preserves the experience of the original recording, as well as lets you catch your breath! You need a moment of silence after such an incredible album. The bonus material immediately following such an amazing closing song as \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\" would almost lessen its effect and power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with bonus tracks on 2nd disc","review":"Superb art. Melancholy and hopeful at once. One of a handful of truly timeless modern classics. The best thing about this anniversary edition, aside from the great sound and packaging, is NOT putting the bonus tracks on the same disc as the original studio classic. The extra tracks are terrific, but detracted greatly on the previous Rykodisc release with tacked on bonus material. Elvis Costello's Rykodisc releases also suffered from out of place bonus tracks, and he, too, has wisely put the additional material on a separate c.d.

It was innovative in scope upon its release, with a rather dark view of the future of our planet, but even more importantly every tune is a winner. And how can you go wroing with lyrics like: \\"My brain hurt like a warehouse\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust","review":"Easily the most consistent album by one of the most inconsistent artists I've ever heard - that probably sounds negative and in a way it is, but it's also a testiment of Bowie's constant experimentation in alternate forms of music, which is commendable.I'm a huge Bowie fan and own several of his albums. This is one of the few of his albums that I can listen to all the way through without becoming side-tracked. Every song is very listenable and you don't necessarily have to be a Bowie fan to appreciate them. I would definitely recommend this album for those of you just starting to get into the whole Bowie legend. Other recommended albums would be Heroes, Hunky Dory, Station to Station, Scary Monsters, and Let's Dance - though they're not quite as consistently brilliant as this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, not so great ECD","review":"I can't say enough about the music of this CD -- I love it and never tire of listening to it.However, I did want to comment on the Enchanced CD (ECD) part of this cd.

His art, genius, humor, talent shine through in this collection, which is still fresh, fun, and rocks decades later. I am grateful for the joy he has shared through his music and voice.If you're interested, here is an interview with David Bowie (from Rolling Stone) done by William S. Burroughs in 1974 about The Rise And Fall of Ziggy Stardust:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a legitimate concept album, but good nonetheless","review":"I would like to start by saying that despite Bowie believing this was a concept album, it wasn't. Most concept albums tell stories... for this one, you had to read up on it to get the story. However, \\"5 Years\\" is a beautiful, end-of-the-world song. All of the tracks are stupendous! I'm sure EMI has done a great job remastering it (I have an old vinyl copy). No, this is no concept album, but it is a beautiful masterpeice. No musician could have the mental capacitiy to make something this great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy As!","review":"Some of the catchiest songs I have ever heard are on this amazing CD.

As with most Bowie records of this period, if you hit the skip button, you are missing the point. This album is back to back greatness, and the one-two punch of 'Ziggy Stardust' and 'Suffragette City' is unbelievable. Mick Ronson's guitar playing is great, and by the end of the album, you feel you know the 'leper messiah', and mourn for his inevitable death. Be careful, though: The movie Velvet Goldmine is based on the story of Ziggy Stardust, and while that sounds like a good idea, the movie is one of the worst crimes I've ever witnessed. It somehow took a good story and made a really crappy movie about it. Stick with Ziggy and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star record - 1 star for massive error","review":"We all know this is a landmark album, we all agree on that point.However....The ENTIRE STEREO L - R CHANNELS ARE REVERSED!!! Not just one song, EVERY SONG!Many are wondering how does it sound? I am a sound geek, here is my take. The bass and drums are a touch muddier and have more warmth then the previous releases. I think that is good because Bowie's vocals are more prominent in the mix giving each song more bite. The older pressings on cd have more of a vintage feel. This is basically Ziggy Stardust version 2.0 for a new audience.But still, how can you have the sound channels reversed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As It Should Be","review":"A remastered Ziggy Stardust finally done right.

Jones is fine but Kert was even better. And of course this includes the now legendary version of The Ladies Who Lunch sung (?) by Elaine Stritch. But the star of the recording is Sondheim. It's a brilliant score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Company 1970","review":"Saw this on stage in London in 1972 and loved it then. Had the LP but got rid of it years ago.

I don't feel comfortable spreading some toxic insecticide on their fur so this is a better choice for me. Instead of killing fleas it sterilizes them so they cannot reproduce. It is taken with food and works as birth control for fleas, so it takes 3 months for all the fleas to be sterilized and stop reproducing. I have no fleas on my cats, nor in my house after using this for many years. Because I have been involved with feral cats in my neighborhood, this is often the only way to administer flea control as they are too wild to be touched and will not approach.

The belt was the same way. The boot covers didn't cover the pants properly. The hat looked like it was made from construction paper. Also, when we opened the item, it looked like it was used and sent back by another customer. The seller shipped the item quickly and offered the item at a better price than others.

It is a rare glimpse into this closed society and of how music definitely is a universal language. Congrats to all involved in making this concert happen and in making it avalable to all those of us who will most likely never get a chance to visit Pyongyang. Image and sound were very good so the viewing experience is most satisfying. Enjoyed the special feature almost as much as the concert itself, although it makes it very evident that brainwashing is alive and well in North Korea. Sadly, North Koreans seem terrified to speak (like the beauty who could not utter a single word when interviewed) and those music students who dared to speak made it a point to say that they could learn nothing new from the visiting musicians because their teachers were just as good.

Sure, it has some songs that aren't available on other Madonna Karaoke compilations, but the other reviewer forgot to mention some key things.The most important thing to know about this cd is that, though lacking background vocals, the vocals that the singer (you) would be singing are all put in every song with vibraphone-esque instruments so that melodies aren't there for the singer to sing alone. This gets really annoying and makes the singer feel like they are competing with a melody that shouldn't be there in the first place.Also, the music isn't done very well. It's obvious all of the instruments came from a computer (and not a very good one).So beware. If you don't mind the added melody then you'll probably love this cd. But even 'More' and 'He's a Man' are ruined with this added unecessary melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know Lightwave","review":"I knew nothing of Lightwave going into this book. -- This book is very in-depth in some subjects... but very light in others. -- The reviews saying it is mainly for Lightwave 6.5 arent' far off. There is infact very little version 7 material here. That isn't so bad though as most stuff translates pretty well. My main complaint about the book would be that it does very little to explain how to model stuff in Lightwave. -- That is that very little time is spent modeling. The basic primitives.. and bolean divides are present but not much more than that. All in all... I feel I am becomming very familiar with Lightwave and so I certainly don't regret buying this book. I very much enjoy it's pace. - The tutorials are all laid out *very* well. I'll just be buying \\"Inside Lightwave 7\\" so I can learn more about modeling. I'll say it again though...

The coverage of the program is seriously lacking. There many areas of LightWave I wish the authors covered. I think the few tutorials included are good, the book isn't really the best for really learning Lightwave. There's no information on expressions and very little modeling coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightwave Applied, Version 6.5 & 7","review":"I am a totally new user to Lightwave so this may help some newbies. This book is excellent for getting your feet wet and exploring a lot of what Lightwave is capable of.

With poignantly perceptive and erudite analyses he counteracts the two most dominant and dangerous responses to nihilism: apathy and the desire to overcome nihilism with some other form of transcendance. For Critchley, the appropriate response to nihilism lies not in establishing a meaning for life outside of life but in revisioning the everyday existence we all must lead. The true merit and deepest insights of this book lie in its ability to open the reader, at once, to the beauty and frightfulness of radically finite existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISOREINTING PERCUSSIVE MINIMALIST TECHNO","review":"This is definitely not an album for techno neophytes or fans of commercialized, diluted mainstream techno. If you're looking for a good first time Jeff Mills purchase, I would probably suggest \\"lifelike\\" or \\"the art of connecting\\". However, if you know what you're getting into, and if you're looking for some of the most uncompromising, hard detroit techno out there, this is definitely a must. Here, Mills weaves swarming, harsh percussive loops that progress and mutate through subtle sound layering. To the uninitiated, this will sound like the same loop is being played throughout the entire song. Only two of the tracks on this cd are what I would consider \\"accessible\\". Yes, this is very tribal, repetitive stuff. If you're looking for a warmer, more melodic sound, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't be so regional!","review":"it's true that detroit djs invented this flavor of techno. but the soul of techno music has always been in london, england.all the waveforms recordings betray mills' love affair with europe. for those of us privileged to hear the master during his long residency at the voyager club, london, this record brings back memories of long hot summers full of raves and festivals.government legislation has destroyed the soul of the dance scene in the uk and the us. corporate infiltration has buried the body. but this music stands as a worthy tombstone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this isnt his best","review":"What a bad first impression of Jeff Mills. I hope the King of Techno is better than this. My biggest complaint is this ISNT MIXED! Big 5 second breaks between songs. So no DJing here, just Jeff Mills composing techno. I thought the dance music standard was to mix your CD and release the vynls with seperations for Dj's. If your CD has track marks your asking for every cheeze ball CD-spinng DJ to play your songs. If you can forgive Jeff for this and just try to listen to his compositions, they are still terribly weak and repetitive. Some of the songs sound decent, hence the 2 stars. Maybe they would be better if they were DJ mixed but not much.

One of the worst was the heroine referring to a garment \\"two sizes too small.\\" Standard clothing sizes in 1749? Yeah, right. Does anyone really think that the gifted, intelligent writer who brought us quality work in the Sanguinet series and the Golden Chronicles could possibly have written this book? It reads like a poor imitation of Veryan. The humor here seems forced, the romance contrived, and the main characters just not very interesting. And it hurts my feelings to say these things in regard to an author whose work I have treasured for years. The quality of the work began eroding -- IMHO -- with the first of the Riddle series (although the first two books were ok; not great but ok) and has declined with each successive book. It's very disheartening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book was a little different from the style of romance I usually go for.

As an avid reader of her books, I was quite disappointed. Usually, the name Patricia Veryan on the cover is a guarantee of a wonderful read. Not so in this book. The plot is muddled and implausible. Our heroine, Elspeth, is dimwitted and silly. She gives us absolutely no reason to like her. Our hero, Gervaise, is rude and unkind. It is unclear why these two fall for each other. However, they deserve each other! Steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"this cd is a major letdown especially in contrast to their excellent album, a place in the sun. the songs on atomic are boring and redundant and simply do not display the talent that they showed on their previous effort. it may grow on me will more listening, but i dont foresee that. its a good thing i only paid $5.88 for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock for the New Millenium","review":"This is simply one of the best rock -n- roll albums....I've ever heard. I loved Lit's last album, \\"A Place in the Sun\\", but this one is all that and much, much more. Every single song is so catchy, it's almost funny. The record is a combination of all the best of 70s and 80s arena rock, with a modern edge. Every one of these songs deserves radio play. Lit says they listened to a lot of classic rock during the making of this album, and it shows. There's so many great songs on the album that it's hard to pick favorites, but I like \\"Addicted\\", \\"Everything's Cool\\", \\"She Comes\\", \\"Drop D\\" and \\"Next Time Around\\" the best. An unbelievable driving CD. Pop it into your car stereo, and enjoy the ride...just try to stay on the road!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Energy...? Maybe they should be called Lit(e)","review":"To the guys in Lit, what happened? All the energy from the last two CD's is gone. A bunch of mellow wimpy tunes with some of the dumbest cheesy lyrics I've heard in a long time. It just sounds like the boys didn't have many good ideas this time around. I love good melodies that are interesting but this album is so predictable and juvenile. Buy either \\"Tripping the Light Fantastic\\" or \\"A Place in the Sun\\" before this. I love bands like All, Descendents, Strung Out etc. but this album pails in comparison. Next time, they need to rock out more. This is lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic will blow you away","review":"This cd is a incredible mix of songs.From Lipstick and Bruises to Addicted it is sure to be a crowd pleaser.These guys are so multi-talented ,and in this day and age ,it is so rare to find a group that really stands out..With all the BSB and Britney wannabe's it is nice to find something that has a nice beat but with a edge..I would deffinately recommend this cd to anyone that wants a feel good /ride in ya car/hang with ya friends sorta cd...plus the Limited Edition cd has a extra cd with a awesome video on it..

To make a short story shorter, if you wanna satisfy your cravings for catchy tunes, incredible lyrics, and HOT GUYS, (A.Jay, call me...) then you should check out Lit... I'm sure glad I did. Ever since I bought their cd, it has been in my cd player... I bought it in SEPTEMBER... think about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Having listened to 'Atomic' for a couple of weeks now, I can safely say that it's a grower. It takes a few listens to really begin to appreciate the songs, which aren't as immediate as the hits off 'A Place in the Sun'. But, after investing a bit of time you'll come to love them as I do. 'Something to Someone' is a real crowd pleaser to kick off with. 'Addicted' and 'Lipstick & Bruises' are first rate power pop tunes (something that can be said for most of the album in fact). For me the two real standout tracks are 'Happy In the Meantime', which is a very well-crafted, mellower number, and the simply awesome 'She Comes'--this *has* to be the equivalent of 'Miserable' or 'My Own Worst Enemy' for this CD. Overall, I think 'Atomic' has fewer weaker tracks than '...Sun' (I think the last few tracks there aren't as impressive), so...Lit still rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lit album....PERIOD.","review":"I wanted to buy this album after I heard \\"Everything's Cool\\" on the Orange County soundtrack. I am SOOOOOOOOOO glad that I bought this album. It's a million times better than \\"A Place in the Sun\\" and the \\"S/T\\" album. This album is catchy and I absolutely love catchy music. I think this album is perfect in every way and it's gonna be impossible for Lit to ever top this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes place of A Place In the Sun","review":"This third album by the band Lit follows similar lines of their second album A Place in the Sun. The guitar on some of the songs resembles the more hardcore musical stylings of Tripping the Light Fantastic, but keeps that So. Cal. feeling. While some of the songs sound more like pop, there is still a feeling of the boys from Orange County. Atomic is a good album and is a great addition the any fan of Lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars for Two Good Songs","review":"There are only two good songs on this album: Something to Someone and Everything's Cool. After hearing My Own Worst Enemy on the radio dozens of times I decided to give the band a try. The store I went to didn't have the CD with that song on it, but this one was only $5.88 so I bought it. What a dissapointment. You can tell the band didn't even put much effort into this album because there isn't even a booklet to go with it, there's just a paper with the tracklisting on it. I will admit that all the songs are catchy but they're also entirely shallow and generic. This CD was a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a big let-down","review":"I made a big mistake buying this album. I loved their last album(A place in the sun) so much, that I bought this CD without even listening to it online first. The things I liked about the last album(the lyrics and guitar playing) are gone. Some of the songs sound good, but the lyrics are really annoying. I mean, who cares if you took her out on a Friday night and got smashed? The lyrics are so blunt; they are pathetic. Embedded in them are so many cliches, that the lyrics to the songs get annoying. The lyrics are not something you would want to catch yourself singing in the shower. If you want a good CD, go buy \\"A place in the sun\\", or try Blink 182 or New found glory. At least Blink and New Found Glory sing about something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawless recording of a flawless show","review":"I can't even count how many times I have seen South Pacific. Some productions have been great, and some have been less-than-great, but I can tell you with confidence that the original broadway cast production is the best that there can be. Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza are the perfect matches for their parts--they are inseparable.

Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza are truly ecstatic. The OVERTURE and DITES-MOI are very pleasant. A COCKEYED OPTIMIST, A WONDERFUL GUY, I'M GONNA WASH THAT MAN RIGHT OUTTA MY HAIR, and HONEY BUN are all sung by Mary Martin; making them wonderful to listen to. William Tabbert renders YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME and the prejudicial YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFULLY TAUGHT. Ezio Pinza's SOME ENCHANTED EVENING and THIS NEARLY WAS MINE are very robustious and majestic. Even Juanita Hall sings well in BALI H'AI and HAPPY TALK. The chorale songs are THERE IS NOTHIN' LIKE A DAME and BLOODY MARY, which are quite rousing. The finale is pleasant, but the most familiar tune is the TWIN SOLILOQUIES, the only song that both Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza sung in.

MOST OF IT IS about the astronauts, suiting up, launching and then repairing the telescope. We were disappointed. This was a grand opportunity to present the awe and wonder of space through visualizing the images brought back from the Hubble itself. Instead we were given images of astronauts unscrewing bolts in space and discussing the lack of toilet facilities while on EVAs. Again, hats off to the courage of the astronauts.

There are precious few shots of a VERY few of the discoveries of the HST over the years. A few of these are animated to abstraction, closing in or moving away from the objects that are subjects of the current view. I'll save the jewel case and toss the rest of it. I'd be too embarrassed to sell it to anyone, even used, and I surely wouldn't wish to build up anybody else's hopes and have them crash as mine did.

If the author was going to steal his ideas for characters from Tony Hillerman (a legendary retired Texas Ranger instead of a legendary retired Navajo police captain, a black sheriff's deputy instead of an indian police sargeant, etc.), it would have served him better if he had also learned something from Hillerman's genius for recreating authentic speech patterns and plausible, imaginative and frequently witty repartee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true to life redneck Texas tale!","review":"A great read!

I turned a friend of mine on to it; she was disturbed enough to decide to never see the film again, though it was one of the most chilling movies she had ever seen (she loves good, intellectual, chilling movies such as this).

Several years ago, Texas Governor George Bush (now US President) commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. This was the only death sentence Bush commuted in Texas.It was shown that Henry was actually innocent of the murder he was convicted of. A time card had shown him to be at his job in Florida the day before the murder was committed in Texas.

Add a rather hokey music sequence and it comes across as a violent movie of the week. The opening montages of the victims was effective, and the scene with the family IS disturbing and graphic enough to make you go \\"Whoah.\\" But one whoah doesn't make it a must-have.I suggest those with a fetish for serial killers read about Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole instead of watching this.

They touch on his antisocial behaviour for a second and then went completely off track into what appeared to be a mental cognitive disorder. This guy was as dumd as the day is long. That was the frightening part - that society would not attempt to take care of him when he was child with a mental disability.

His baton technique is so plain and, almost, textbook-like that one could almost say amaturish. But, the results are excellent. Both the Mendelssohn and Strauss are pretty stright-forward (Solti's video of the Mendelssohn with Chicago is better). The Bartok, on the other-hand, gets a spirited peformance. This suite was composed, some might say it was also a reaction to, Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring\\". So, it is not a piece one can sit back and mellow-out to. This work, and the performance, is highly charged and one helleva wild ride. It's a shame he didn't do the entire ballet (which is only 15 minutes longer), but, that would have required the addition of a chorus.This would make a good addition to any collection.Frankly, I am eager to see what other videos DGG has out there to release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the positive reviews fool you.","review":"Season 2 was very disappointing. Poor writing and plot development. Mya one of the new characters is made to be this naive, stupid woman, who will turn on her own brother to be with Sylar who she just met. Ridiculous. The funny HIRO in the first season, is nothing more than a love sick school boy in season 2. New characters come in, only to be killed right away. No character development, no creativity in the plot, if you are a fan buy it when the price goes down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't barely get into it.","review":"I bought season two because i was so addicted to season one. I rush home to put it in, and BAM instant disappointment. First off it had two less discs than season one. (not that big of a deal, i figured it would still be amazing) But then I put it in and I just couldn't get into it. I still haven't finished watching it and I started it a couple weeks ago. It just doesn't have the same suspense and it doesn't keep you interested. Plus, for me, it was quite predictable. I'm going to to try and watch it again and see if it was just an off day for me, but as of now, it was a disappointment, and a waste of 30 something dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Season","review":"This is the best season of a show that could have been great! Great start and the story was hot. The development of the players was well done. TAfter this season the show went downhill and became trash. A must buy for people who like super heroes and villians. This is the only season oof the show that you should watch or buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very excited with my purchase","review":"It was sold as used but in great conditions so excited to get started watching my seasons with no interruptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it really is that bad","review":"It is a given that many television series have a \\"sophmore slump,\\" where the second season does not live up to the first. Heroes did not have a sophmore slump. It had a sophmore plummet. What were they smoking when they wrote this season? Clair's storyline was pretty much a rehash of the one she had in season 1, with all the stuff that made it good taken out, and plenty of stuff to hate added in. DL survives getting shot by Linderman only to be killed by some random thug offscreen before the season starts? Peter has amnesia and ends up working with the villan?? Not to mention the new characters introduced this season, most of whom did absolutly nothing but suck up screen time. Some (Maya and Alejandro) were just boring, while others (West) made you want to kill kittens. I doubt Heroes will ever get back to where it was in season 1, and even if it does, it will always have season 2 hanging over it like some curse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 2 was a huge disappointment","review":"The whole Hiro in the past was tedious and the resolution of the Shanti virus was completely underwhelming. Plus, that kid with the power to take apart electronic stuff is annoying and useless. This was probably due to the lack of funding, but this show always failed to deliver a truly climactic superhero battle. After the Watchmen-like awesomeness of Season 1, the second season really killed it for me. Slap anyone who compares Season 2 Heroes with anything from Lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great looking box, with loads of additional features, came fast and in perfect condition! Looks great on the tv. Looks great on the dvd shelf! I know that most people didn't like this show last season, but I really did. it was awkward at time, but still a great show. I do think they are trying to pretend like this season never happened. The show seems to not break from the 1st to the 3rd and two is not necessarily needed to keep us on par with character development. so if you don't like the second season this is really not necessary, but if you thought, \\"hey i kinda liked that\\" then it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare to be forgotten","review":"If you loved Season 1 and were addicted to how brilliant it was, you may be compelled to think about Season 2 and Season 3 DVD sets as an essential purchase. But don't be fooled. Be informed that that the sophomore seasons of Heroes have a noticeable drop in:- writing quality- directing- acting from certain members of the cast (ahem-Hayden Panettiere-ahem).Overall, it was a bad year for Heroes. The DVD-treatment itself is excellent: audio and video quality rarely gets better than this. The problem is that with episodes this bad, boring and ridden with plot-holes, you won't want ever to rewatch them or even access the special features.In retrospect, I think watching Season 2 and 3 is not necessary to understand what will happen next. I am not sure whether this fact is a compliment or a criticism of Heroes. Save yourself the $$$ and just wait out this year and watch Season 4. Forget Season 2 and 3 like you forget a bad nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT.","review":"So I was a little nervous about buying this season because of all the negative reviews...my husband and I weren't expecting much when we popped it in the dvd player. But we seriously don't know what everyone else is talking about when they say this season sucks. Its just as good, if not better, than season 1. I just wish it didn't have to end so quickly. I definitely wish there were as many episodes as season 1. No, its not EXACTLY like season 1. But whats wrong with that? They spiced it up, switched it up...and made it just as awesome. I would HIGHLY recommend buying it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroes good show, but bad season","review":"I love Heroes show, but this second season i really don't like. Dvd's have very good Bonus Features, good audio commentaries, many deletes escenes, and we have the oportunity to see the missings episodes 12 and 13.In this season, we see new characters, the best new character is Elle (Kristen Bell), and of course last season characters Peter, Nikki, Suresh and Sylar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suitable","review":"I don't really understand the terrible ratings here...yeah it was a short season, yeah it was a tad convoluted at times.

But of all 3 seasons (at this time we are not 1/2 way through season 3 on TV) this is the weakest for reasons that could not have beeb determined. This season was full tilt when the writters strike began and hence problems arose with what to do.Of interesting note is the extra's on Blue-Ray where you can listen to the writers and directors talk about the challanges and what they WERE going to do instead of the unclamatic ending that we got.If you like Hero's this is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.... this was stupid.","review":"Just thought I'd add my rating.

Although the production quality is amazing it feels extremely rushed and there's way too many cut corners for my taste.grrr! rabble-rabble-rabble..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just sit back & enjoy","review":"Was season 1 better than season 2? Yes. The novelty of a new show and the curiosity of where it will go will do that. Was it a shame that there were fewer episodes? Of course. More is always better. Was this a bad season (to the degree that many have put it)? No. There was a plot, a catastrophe to avert and a villain to stop (albeit a villain who I feel was depicted to be alot more fearsome and intimidating than he should have been considering his non-threatening ability). New characters were introduced. Old characters had their own personal issues to contend with in the midst of everything. Sure, it could have been better if there were more than 11 episodes. I wouldn't say extremely better because it wasn't a bad season. So just enjoy the season for what it has to offer, knowing that it is leading into what should be a thrill ride of a season in season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"T short","review":"Ill admit season 2 did not live up to the first, but it was still well written and put together. The only major disappointment was the length of the season. I think the reason why most of the reviews here are bashing season 2 is because it did not has enough episodes to build up into anything big. Hopefully season 3 will get the show back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Great as Season 1, but a decent DVD none the less","review":"Like most Heroes fans I absolutely loved Season 1 and wasn't to crazy about Season 2. When I bought this DVD and started watching the special features I watched the commentary from Tim Kring and watched where Season 2 was supposed to go if the Writers Strike never would've occured.The Season 2 episodes definately aren't as great as most of the Season 1 episodes were, but after the story line gets moving again it picks up, but by then the seasons over. But the special features are worth it too because along with the Tim Kring commentary you get to see the Heroes Untold Stories which is where they were meaning for Heroes to go later on in the season, which was really cool.If your a Heroes fan you need to add this to your collection anyway because something tells me after this Season the show is just going to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes Season 2","review":"My kids have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 2, so now we have to catch up before season 3 starts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the worst TV I've ever seen...","review":"Season One was a comic booky mystery goodness, but they totally dropped the ball this year. Even with the writers strike complicating things, there's no excuse for the rampant plotholes, laughable dialogue, complete dismissal of continuity, and horrendously acting. Production quality also hit rock bottom - was this shot on a soap opera stage??Don't give these people any of your hard-earned cash. In a perfect world, Tim Kring would be paying us by way of apology for this drek. I'll not be sticking around for Season Three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to follow an excellent 1st season","review":"Season two can be summarized neatly into one word: disappointing. Beyond that King showed us that instead of taking the characters we love and developing them further, he would rather split the plot to introduce new heroes who are ultimately killed off. Yes, our main villain with the eyebrows is back, (Sylar) but most of the season he spends it in amnesiac wanderings. Then there is the story of Hiro, who travels back in time only (oh so predictably) to be the cause of his own altered timeline (these paradoxes get repeated in almost every single time travel show in the history of tv/film, including the animated comedy Futurama where Fry travels back in time to sleep with his own grandmother, ugh). Anyway, if you want a good show watch season One. Season two will notoriously disappoint. Not sure how season Three will recover this failed attempt, but I am hopeful it does. There is not that much to watch on tv these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Kring what are you thinking?","review":"Your show has fallen to pieces. I hope the real writers are back not the 2 cent replacements for season 2. Heroes was horrible and hope they can make the characters just a little believable as in season 1. I am sad to even respond to series as season 2. Do not get this unless you can get a copy fot $ 5.00. This show had so much potential.

You have to give them credit for how well they pulled off the change from where they planned on taking the show, to where they ended up taking the show. They had to totally reinvent the series at the last minute. I think they did a fabulous job. As for owning it on Blu Ray...I wouldn't have it any other way.

Most of the romantic elements of the score are absent -- a BIG mistake. Instead, we get a \\"suite\\" by Rabin (Track One) that really doesn't distinguish itself in any way for me.

This book is worth looking at for the original views presented, and Prof. Fried is certainly offering the book at a reasonable price.

Cusack plays Poe at volume 11, nearly screaming every line of dialogue he has in the film. I'm guessing that was his way of interpreting Poe's alcohol addiction and macabre persona, but for me it felt overacted and at times a little cartoonish.Most of the film was forgettable for me, a cheap thrill ride with a lot of atmosphere but no real substance. I don't believe it was the intention of the movie to frighten, but I do believe it was meant to be suspenseful- in any event, on both counts it fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"A midnight dreary","review":"A strangely slap-dash creation. Everyone involved has done better work elsewhere and you never get the sense that any of them particularly care that The Raven is distinctly \\"off\\" -- or that it's not within their power to do anything much about it. Uncharacteristically, Cusack over-acts massively -- a side effect of his miscasting as Poe -- and the film, oddly paced, seems to stagger from empty scene to empty scene, waiting for someone to take it in hand and give it focus and meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar Allan Poe's Writing And Death","review":"This movie gets four-stars from me. I am an avid reader of Mr. Poe's written prose. This a fictionalized of what might have occurred if a psychopath were to use Poe's written works to emulate them in actual deed. The possible events occurring in his life and the road he must travel to seek that which his heart most desires. Yes, a probable cause of his cause of death is ruminated on with a reference point of an utterance made by the real Poe before his death. I recommend this movie to anyone who may not know who Poe was or read his works so as to whet their appetites for more. Leave preconcieved beliefs at the \\"play\\" switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe Runs Wild","review":"Edgar Allan Poe, people think of many things when they hear his name, blood, murder, dark, creepy, melancholy, maybe not John Cusack though. I am a fan of Edgar Allan Poe's works, and was intrigued when this movie was released. The story is well done, and entertaining how Poe is entangled within his own stories and characters. I appreciate books and movies that have the literary characters involved in their own works. The mystery that plagues Poe (Cusack), in this movie is well done with many clues, but leaves the audience still guessing until the end. The ambiance of the whole film is dark and mysterious and alludes to many of Poe's stories and life. Knowing somewhat about Poe's life, if I had anyone playing a person who seems to live just at the cusp of reality, it would be John Cusack. His performance, not exactly Oscar material, was entertaining and did a great job at recreating the master of the macabre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe-esque","review":"This was a lot better than I thought it would be, it had a fair amount of intrigue. The movie allowed Cusack to show Poe historically and use bits of prose in the dialog but just to the point of being overdone. Of course surrounding this is a Poe-esque, gruesome murder mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot overall lacks pretty much everything a fan of Poe is looking for in a story","review":"This movie was somewhat terrible, as a fan of Poe and some of the main actors I had to force myself to keep watching after the first 20 minutes. In retrospect I should have just caved to the urge to turn the movie off.Both the protagonist and antagonist are 1 dimensional, and the plot overall lacks pretty much everything a fan of Poe is looking for in a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"The picture and sound was great quality, the movie was good, but not as good as I had hoped it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great!","review":"It was entertaining at best! The story was a bit weak, but the actors were good. If you are into Poe's work, you may find this movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and ridiculous","review":"I'm not sure why John Cusack agreed to do this movie, usually he has somewhat better taste. Then again, I guess he was in that 2012 movie, so perhaps this is just his recent trend. The Raven does seem like it has at least some kind of interesting premise and certainly has a nice visual atmosphere. Unfortunately, the positives stop there. At no point does it appear at all likely that Edgar Allan Poe was ever like this character, which seriously hampers the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief. Horrible acting made worse by a terrible script. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK, nothing special, not really bad.","review":"I must say that I saw actor Jeffery Coombs (Reanimator) in a play about Edgar Allen Poe and I felt he really captured the character of Poe we have all read about. I think he would have made a better star for this film that John Cusack did. That being said he did ok. But, in my opinion this film is just ok and I will never watch it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel of a movie!","review":"The cover of the movie is a great portrayal of how the movie is going to go.I thoroughly enjoyed this Poe-twist story line. It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end. As in his (Poe's) books; the fast-beating heart, time ticking away fervently, and turmoil to keep you always on the edge of your seat, was done well. At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash. But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him. Each piece of the plot gently wound it's way to a complete story that would of course only end the Edgar Allen Poe way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A weird tale of a weirder man.","review":"It's just fiction that may or may not be part of the real story of the legendary Poe.The plot takes you down a path that's takes you to nail biting, edge of the seat anticipation.It's a bit gory in places (well a LOT of places) but to EAP fans, it's required viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not","review":"I simply could not get into this film.

The acting is not the best in the world and it is a bit too gory for my usual taste. But being a big Poe fan and collector I really enjoyed the movie.

John Cusack is on top form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interseting.","review":"I found this movie interesting and enjoyable. The story is more of a morphed Edgar Allen Poe storyboard with Mr. Poe placed into the action. Its basically a detective story using some of Poe's shorts. It kept my attention throughout and was actually pretty good. I personally do not like when Hollywood destroys great literature but I'll let them slide this time as they didn't truly alter the works. For Hollywood I give them a \\"F\\". They still come up with nothing new. Stealing old work and twisting it to make a movie is purely lack of imagination. At least it wasn't \\"Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Raven","review":"Loved It! Story line paralleled the possible demise of Poe.

This is not the Poe I know. The actors must work within the realms of what is written, and they perform admirably. The writer didn't quite catch poe as a character. Ladies man? Bar room brawler? They missed a chance to give life to a weird, dorky, twisted genius. Pearls befor swine."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this movie!","review":"I saw this moving in the theatres when it originally came out and was smitten. I love the way Cusack channels Poe with the arrogant entitlement mixed with extremely witty repartee, including insults where the insultees barely realize they've been insulted. I love the complex sentence structure in the movie, unlike the cutesy one-liners so popular in films these days, and the poetic literacy Cusack nails in the film. Unlike what SOME reviewers (not naming any names, but the one that comes to mind is a famous half of a once very famous movie critiquing team) have commented, nowhere in this film does it state or imply that the scenario posited for Poe's demise was an actual attempt to explain how he died. This is a work of FICTION, and the scenario used to depict the way Poe COULD have died is just that: a possibility that happens to work very well for the story. The way the writers intertwine Poe's writings with an all-new murder mystery is ingenious."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought it was a great twist on Poe's life","review":"This movie was great, had a great twist on the last days of Poe's life.

Since this is not possible, I give it a one star for all the jobs it provided in the making.Read a book about 10 years ago entitled 'Nevermore'. Brilliantly written by true crime author, Harold Schecter, he craftily manages two characters, Davy Crocket and Edgar Allen Poe as they try to solve a number of grisly murders. The murders are similar to those committed in 'The Raven'. Where 'Nevermore' is extremely well done and the odd couple compliment each other in 1834 Baltimore, 'The Raven' is disjointed, and uneven. Furthermore, the acting is horrible. The idea for the film is clever and could have been compelling, as was the case in 'Nevermore'. 'The Raven' is a complete flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got to see it","review":"Time ran out before I was able to watch the time frame to watch was to short but my fault not the movie I did go an rent it and was very enjoying"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this movie!","review":"Although against many critics and many people who say that couldn't possibly be true....

From the way they spin words to the wonderful integration of stories, this story was great from beginning to end. As usual John Cusack does an amazing job of creating a character haunted by the darker emotions of the human plight. If you're looking for a good tale of suspense without the constant threat of explosions and corny dialogue, this is definitely the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Movie!","review":"As a fan of a good thriller as well of John Cusack, this movie looks like it was going to =be one that I was going to love. I was not disappointed. The movie itself is a great period piece and though only loosely coupled with true facts of Poe's life, the movie is still an adventure ride and fun for all viewers (in my perspective). I thought Cusack did a great job as Poe and the mystery itself that unfolds is definitely spellbinding and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.On top of all of this, the bonus features on the Blu-ray are amazing and add much to your understanding of the movie itself. For me, I loved the behind the scenes bonus features as it allowed me to see inside of the minds of the creators (which I always enjoy) as well as the deleted scenes.All-in-all, I really enjoyed this film and think you will too, just get ready for a fun-filled thrill ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and boring","review":"I really liked the actors involved in this film but it was a mess.

I liked all the historical accuracy and what looked like the actual cobblestone of today's historical Baltimore. I thought that it was cute that he had a pet raccoon and petted a dead rodent in the street. This all being an allusion to the conspiracy theory that, perhaps, Poe died from rabies. It was slighty fun to see him argue in a bar. I really like all of the trivia and literary allusion. But it just was stupid and it dragged on. I honestly don't remember how it ended. It wasn't very well made. And Poe as the red hot lover of the blonde actress with the constantly heaving breasts was pretty unbelievable and kind of gross. Disappointing because my video rental lady said that she loved it. I want my money back! Oh, and by the way, I'm an English teacher, even though I used the vernacular!:) So I enjoyed some of the clever details like the pet raccoon which I do think is made up, but funny, because of the rabies rumor."},{"rating":"1","title":"More guts then glory","review":"I kept watching this thinking: \\"is that really how Poe would have acted?\\" I don't know of course, but I guess I'm saying it felt cheesy or fake.

John Cusack is wonderful as Poe, and the story is gripping! I suggest if you don't know much about Poes life, or more importantly, his myseterious death, just pull it up on Wikapedia and read the summary on his last days. The story will be that much better and make more sense at the end.

This show struck me as trying to be too big, too fast.That being said, I feel that there was a lot of good writing and a lot of good acting within a large ensemble cast.

The fact that it was only on for one season just validates what the show is about. This show is whitty, dry, hillarious, and thought provoking.

I could not more strongly recomend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another casualty in the war on intelligence","review":"In all honesty, I suppose we should count ourselves lucky that a show this smart was ever allowed to see the light of day in the 21st century.

Excellent acting by the majority of the cast, particularly Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry.However, I didn't feel that Amanda Peet (as Jordan) was the right person for the job...she's too cutsy and I had a hard time believing that any network would let the Jordan character run their network!Also, the skits for the \\"Studio 60\\" show just weren't funny at All. I think the show would have survived longer if the comedy skits had actually been funny!I had high hopes for the show, especially after seeing the pilot (which was the Best episode of the series). Unfortunately, for me the show peaked at the pilot episode and went downhill from there.However, Aaron Sorkin's not-so-good is still better than the majority of shows out there, so this series is a keeper for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast, strange show.","review":"The writing, especially the later shows, was very good. The cast meshed early on and it just got better with each episode. They even tried to show both sides to an issue a few times. There were jokes, ironic stories, lots of ironic stories, but no actual comedy sketches. You would tend to think they'd throw one in on occasion as this was supposed to be a show about a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" type show based out of LA. Instead it came off as The West Wing via the Sunset Strip. That could be why it failed. I'll miss the cast and hope they all find work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"A former employer once rejected a recommendation stating \\"if those changes are necessary, there are better businesses to be in.\\" Such is the philosophy of Mr. Sorkin, the creative half of Team '69.

He and Mr. Schlamme were given the opportunity to present real insight and courage (e.g., a Jeopardy parody with Jesus, Mohammed and Moses). Instead they gave NBC nothing more than a Public Service Announcement with commensurate ratings.Nevertheless the effort is not totally without merit.

I'll have to admit that as the show progressed and the story lines evolved, I was focusing more on the dialog between the main characters, so natural so genuine. It reminded me of three other series that didn't make it but were also superbly written: Tattinger's, Twin Peaks and Grapevine. In terms of theme and storyline, these shows were the antithesis (can you have antithesis with three?) of each other: one a drama, one a spoof of itself and the third a comedy that broke the fourth wall. Back to Studio 60. I loved it because it was dark and the action moved quickly, driven by the dialog; there was no laugh track and only incidental music. You had to listen; that's what I call entertainment. There were no surprise twists, no dangling for the other shoe to drop or complicated story lines to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season! Too bad there was only one...","review":"I am a huge Sorkin fan, and this season was no disappointment. The only reason I am not giving it a perfect rating is because it is hard to get excited to watch a season 1 when you know there will not be a season 2, and a lot of things will be left unresolved. I wish this season had done better, because it was classic Sorkin, with a lot of ex-West Wing actors/actresses returning with new roles.Overall, you will enjoy it, but you will be disappointed that there is no follow-up once you are done with the one and only season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chauvinism run amok","review":"On the job, when a man asks a woman out repeatedly, and she repeatedly says no, and she then asks him point-blank to stop and he says, \\"No.\\", that is, by definition sexual harassment. Not only does the show seem to think this creepy behavior is romantic, he actually gets the girl. There were parts of West Wing that were sexist and condescending to women, but this show is far, far worse. I am so glad that it went off the air after only one season. It deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prime-Time Show","review":"Its not a vain boast to say that this is the best prime-time show ever. It was very satisfying to watch. Very tragic that NBC didn't allow it to go on for more seasons. You will enjoy the witty dialog and the plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore TV - Fascinating Psychology","review":"Studio 60 never quite found itself as a TV show. However, as a view into post-breakup angst, it was fascinating.Aaron Sorkin and Kristen Chenoweth (TV Producer & Talented Christian Star) had ended a romantic relationship. Studio 60 follows a TV Producer & Talented Christan Star. He tries to get her back, even though they have some pretty serious irreconcilable differences. As Sorkin writes this couple, the show feels almost like stalking. Art may have suffered, but the insight into some very private issues was stunning and creepy.Eventually, the TV Producer & Talented Christian Star go their separate ways. On and off screen. But by this time, Sorkin has created an alternate couple (Other TV Producer & Network Executive) who he uses to fulfill his \\"running off into the sunset\\" fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best writing TV has ever broadcasted.","review":"I love this show. My husband loves this show. I'm so glad I can still enjoy the series now after years of being off the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a shame","review":"Its a shame this one did not make it. I have watched the entire series twice. Very quick, witty writing. Great cast had lots of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish there were more seasons","review":"I really enjoyed this series, only wish there were more episodes available to watch. Another great show canceled far too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, check your discs","review":"Love the series, though there are a few things to consider:Sorkin puts a lot of his life over the past several years into the plot/scripts, which is not bad, but makes it pretty real, which isn't what the public in general looks for. If you want a story that escapes from the production business, this isn't for you.If you're expecting great SNL-style humor from the clips of \\"Studio 60,\\" again, this isn't for you -- it's not about the show, it's about the people that create and produce the show.From the technical level -- we had an issue with discs 3 and 4 reading properly, from multiple DVD players, so make sure to test (i.e., fully view/play) the full series shortly after you receive it to make sure it functions properly. The replacement we received was just fine, so this may be an isolated issue.Highly recommended for a truly intelligent show, doubly so if you enjoyed Sorkin's/Schlamme's other collaborations."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT WRITING, ACTING, CLEAVER","review":"I watched this sitcom through my prime subscription. What a pleasant surprise.This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. How did this only have one season? I think the network gave up too easily. They did not realize that they had the next hit show right in their hands. This could have gone 10 or more seasons. The writing is cleaver, the acting is excellent, the timing is superb, and the ensemble cast is perfect. I am sooooo disappointed that I cannot continue watching. It makes me angry to see all the junk shows that are on the air season after season knowing that this quality show was cancelled. It seems as though it must have been cancelled for personal reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I absolutely adored The West Wing, so I was naturally very excited for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Sadly, however, the series was just plain bad.Exhibit A: Bradely Whitford. He plays essentially the exact same character he played in The West Wing. It's sad that this wasn't a more defined character, especially as it is far less entertaining without a Donna type character.Exhibit B: Humor. The West Wing had a great dry wit to it, and often would cause you to laugh out loud at least once an episode. Strange, then, that a show about comedy writers wasn't more funny. Studio 60 does have its funny moments, but on the whole it takes itself far, far too seriously.Exhibit C: Sorkin's Soapbox. So, so, soooooo many episodes revolved around Christianity. I don't mind this. But I DO mind that 1) The approach taken to it isn't particularly intelligent or interesting and 2) It comes up so freaking much. C'mon, Sorkin. Surely you can think of other things to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chauvinism continues","review":"In this episode, a former employee has accused the show of a violation of fair employment laws after she was fired, allegedly for resisting sexual harassment, and for not fitting in to the good old boys club on the show. In the show's portrayal, a good old boys club atmosphere in a writer's room is not a problem, co-workers having sexually exploitive relationships with writers is not a problem, and men on the show talking obscenely about the ways that they would like to have sex with a woman on the show is only a problem because she is dating a man on the show and they are being bad friends to him. Come on! I can't really imagine how the women who work on this show didn't walk of the set at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Studio 60 at hte sunset strip","review":"Well i see why this was so cheap. The first two episodes kept automatically changing from wide screen to reg size screen. It was very distracting to watch. I loved this series and was very disappointed that I couldn't just sit down and watch it. It was the quality of someone bootlegging it of the internet. I don't know that I would buy this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorkin Fan","review":"A very good show, it was getting better towards the end, and I can understand why it didn't have the appeal of The West Wing, who cares about rich young wise guys? Anyway, I missed it mostly when it was on the air, but did enjoy the complete series... Sorkin's style of writing is my favorite. If you want something lighter try Sports Night, also written by Aaron Sorkin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio 60 = TV Heaven","review":"Well-written, consistently funny, likeable characters and engaging story lines - these are the traits of Studio 60. It boggles the mind that this could possibly be cancelled. I have never enjoyed a TV show this much. One of the arguments for its cancellation is that \\"people are not that smart in real life\\". Of course they're not! That's why we watch. The alternative is the highbrow reality TV show. Aaron Sorkin's latest masterwork comes fully recommended, unless you're after canned laughter, the primitive grunts and curses of reality TV show contestants or mere slap stick (other obvious forms of comedy are available). If Studio 60 is cancelled then perhaps it's because it cut too close to the bone, and the already-sweaty TV execs grew panicky."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Immensely impressive thanks to the brilliant fearlessness ofwriter-creator Aaron Sorkin on the making of a television show, that phenomenon fuelling the grand American entertainment industry and itsowners, media magnates with smiles like the silver fittings on a coffin.Great acting by Matthew Perry, Bradley Whitford. Amanda Peet makesno bones about life among the ratings: only the best and the brightest need apply.An unbeatable dialogue highlighting a biting criticism of the present state of the American television profiles the sexy guts of the series. So what if American viewers preferred Studio 60 to disappear asbest cancelled tv show. Seeing it on DVD makes it rather obvious that this is indeed a very wrongly cancelled show. An absolute must for everyone in love with the best of American drama comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! We couldn't wait!!!","review":"We are so happy to get these copies of the only show worth watching since the West Wing ended. This is probably the first show to be cancelled because the networks are too slow to recognize the vast numbers of people who Tivo their television viewing. By the way, Aaron Sorkin, we are conservative Christian people who very much appreciate your always careful examination of issues vital to all thinking, caring people. Keep writing - we're still watching!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, quick, smart television","review":"What a joy to hear Aaron Sorkin's words, with sharp direction by Tommy Schlamme, delivered by a sparkling cast led by Bradley Whitford, Matthew Perry and Amanda Peete. The terrific team that gave us \\"The West Wing\\" has produced a funny, intelligent show that clicks along with lots of laughs and great stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Bad Time Slot","review":"It's just sad that Studio 60 wasn't picked up for a second season. What a great show it had become by the end of the season. It's not surprising really, because it was on too late and was coupled with \\"Heroes\\" which catered to a totally different audience. Had the show been on an hour earlier and following a \\"Law and Order\\" type of show it could have fared better. At least NBC aired a full season even though it took four months to finally get the last six episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"Studio 60 is probably my favorite show of all time. It was fast-paced, witty, and the characters were hard not to love. Plus it had Matthew Perry in it. To be honest, he's why I watched the first show, but by the end it was hard to say which character I loved most. Worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I love this show.

Does that tell you something? It should. What can I say about one of the best shows I have ever seen on Cable TV. IT's fast. It's funny. It's Smart. The whole cast was unbelievable. The show Studio 60 dubs as SNL behind the scenes. They had me from the 1st 10 min. when Judd Hirsch went on live tv telling people to \\"turn the channel! Really! Turn off your tv. That remote you have in your hand is a crack pipe.\\" The Christmas episode was by far my fav. Wonderful Music every show. THE CAMERA SHOTS are to die for. Everything was perfect. IF only the world would have been watching NBC but CSI--your killing me. We are now at a loss now with out Studio 60.

Meanwhile, another character is not present for the kidnapping drama because he is at the hospital while hiw not-wife has a baby. Sound familiar anyone? There are so, so, so many parts of this show that are just West Wing rewritten, but West Wing was great, and this show was definately, definately not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio 60","review":"I love this series however I had to return this becasue disk 3 did not play the one i recieved as a replacement worked perfectly.

So, I didn't want to watch this show because I thought it would just be another inside Hollywood show developed by people who are enamored by what they do and thinking it funny/engaging to the rest of the world. I was wrong and am now addicted to this show just like I was for a time to West Wing. The dialogue is so engaging and smart - why do so many of us turn on TV and tune out when this type of delightful character banter is available for consumption? I will weep when this show gets canceled. I'm rather certain that the content may prove to be too narrow to engage middle America which is so very sad because there is more to this show than just an insider's view into TV production.

Recently purchased on auction I keep watching this one over and over again. I don't want to give away all the details but the Reverend Ray Porter (Tim Curry) and his wife Darla (Annie Potts) operate a TV ministry getting rich off of their viewers. Bill Paxton enters the scene to recover his girlfriend's (Linda Kozlowski) $50,000. The spectacular ending is just not to be believed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful comedy - Curry is great, Annie Potts is too.","review":"In this spoof of televangalists Tim Curry is quite fun, and Annie Potts, as his long suffering wife is at her best.

Also, good sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Hilarity!","review":"I first saw \\"Pass the Ammo\\" in the late 80's, and felt that they needed to establish up front that Claire's grandmother lost $$ at the Tower of Bethlehem. Then last week my ex brought me a copy of it and I watched it again. This time, I loved it three times as much! There are loads of \\"lessons\\" here, from the quote by Anthony Geary (Stonewall): \\"It doesn't matter where you're at on the outside. What counts is where you are on the inside.\\" I think the movie is well done, and to see a British actor (Curry) doing an Arkansas accent was priceless. I don't like the line about what they're going to do to the preacher on national TV. Aside from this, this movie needs to have a wide distribution!TWO QUESTIONS: Who \\"shot\\" Jesse and Claire, and Where can I buy the soundtrack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny, Tim Curry and Annie Potts are fantastic","review":"I love this movie!!! Although it is not available to buy got to you local video store and rent this. Tim Curry as Rev. Ray Porter is wonderful. The \\"I can feel the Devil behind me\\" scene with Curry is not to missed.

Had Hollywood done the thing, it would be full of cheesy dialog and even worse: slow motion. As it stands, however, the movie contains great acting and follows the book by Andy McNab almost perfectly, without the over-dramatic Hollywood car chases, slow-mo explosion shots, slo-mo shouts of \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\", etc. Hopefully it is soon released on DVD as it is a rare gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A could have been.","review":"As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"It's hard to believe that they could make something as fundamentally interesting as the SAS's Bravo Two Zero raid so dull.The basic facts are well-known - that Andy McNab's team were dropped behind Iraqi lines in the Gulf War to find and destroy the Scud missiles being fired at Israel, the mission went wrong almost immediately and they had to fight their way to freedom. They failed and were imprisoned but became the most decorated patrol in SAS history.With such background and a charismatic lead in the hard as nails Sean Bean you have to ask where it all went wrong. It's just poorly scripted, badly acted, confusing and a real mess. Chris Ryan's story - filmed as The One That Got Away - was a considerably better effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enjoyable","review":"I bought this DVD with high expectations and was very disappointed. The video quality is very poor--even for a movie made for television.What I expected was a fast paced military adventure film;not a thinly veiled propaganda screed. Another gripe I have about this particular film is that the British actors speak so quickly and with such accent that I lost alot of the dialogue. I have a very high regard for the star , Sean Bean , from the Richard Sharpe series of about 10 years ago , but in this film he winds up looking like a serving of hamburger helper from all of the beatings he absorbs in Iraqi captivity. Not a pleasant film to view , and DEFINITELY not for younger viewers.I have never reviewed a film in a really negative manner before , but unfortunately , this one desereves it. Barely 2 stars. Not recommended.Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get us out from under Wonder Woman!","review":"I enjoyed this book. I really liked the photos and learning the history.

If you want to know the ins and outs of how Wonder Woman left the island, or what went on in later alternate universes of DC, well... This ain't your book. But if you are interested in an astute history of the character as she exists in our culture, this book offers a lot. And when I scoured the internet, it was the only book I could find on the unorthodox life of her creator.Chip Kidd's design is fantastic, the book's layout is easy to read and the images are beautiful. Sadly, the binding on my paperback version cracked the first time I opened it, and while reading it, the pages got more and more precarious.

There is nothing new in this book, which was published in 2003. Mistakes that the author makes like calling a moving average a trend line don't inspire much confidence in his overly-simplistic Three-Point System, which simply enters a position in the direction of the long term trend if either the short or medium trend is also moving in that direction.One of the worst books on trading that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh...My.....God!!!!","review":"I saw this group play live at the Sundance Film Festival along with BT and Moby, and i was blown away.

He gives us enough background information, narrative and details to present a complete picture of this historical period and not jus a partial one as is normally the case.

However, in tackling so vast a panorama, the author fatally damages his own efforts.

His family members were hardworking, decent, church-going people, who were as shocked as everyone when it became clear that he was a psychopath -- killing birds and frogs at the age of 5.He was an incredible liar and used this autobiography to enhance his legend in the Florence County area of South Carolina.

The book was written in 1912 and this is a reprint of that original publication. Despite his disclaimers, the author definitely has an ax to grind. It doesn't seem so much to be one he wields to disparage, as it does one wielded by someone on the outside looking in, who is green with envy. The antiquated writing style of this author is pretty boring. He goes on with endless lists of names of papabili and the women they allegedly recruited as patronesses. It's hard to tell which ones are men and which are women, and that really confuses some of his tales. When the author zeros in on a couple of major pope makers, like Mathilda of Tuscany or Donna Olimpia, it gets a little interesting. As a period piece, it is a good one, but it just doesn't work beyond that. Use the handy dandy index to look up Mathilda and Donna and you will get those good fifty pages I mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but doen't work well","review":"I purchased the unit several years ago and the receiver (the unit with the pressure display) always seems to lose connection to the transmitter.

So if you're like me and you don't quite have the money to buy yourself a nice speaker system yet, you can pump it through your TV, computer speakers, etc. in the meantime. You can tell it's built from solid materials and it doesn't look cheap, even though you've paid less than $200 for it. It takes a limited amount of assembly when you first receive it, but the directions are easy and you shouldn't have a problem with it.All in all, if you're not looking to spends hundreds/thousands of dollars on a nice-sounding turntable, this is a wonderful option for you because it sounds great and doesn't have any trouble with any record you put on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent TT and Amazing Value","review":"I don't have much \\"mileage\\" on the TT yet, but after replacing the stock cartridge with an Ortofon 2M Blue and bypassing the internal phonopre with a decent but inexpensive Cambridge Audio 640P, I find the sound to be excellent...not quite on par with my 6000 other analog TT setup, but not at all embarrassing either.DrJR"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fine Turntable","review":"I got my pl-120 today and put it together very easily.

I have had Gerrards, radio shack, And pioneer turntables, and this one is the best by a long ways. This turntable is worth every penny and more. I ordered the shure M97XE cartridge to get a little bit more highs out of the records. I have about 2000 78's and will be playing them on this turntable.

I tried installing a Sure M78S cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started. There was noticable hum even when playing records. I also installed an Audio-Technica AT440MLa Cartridge. This cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies. The hum was outrageous from the second I turned the thing on. The cartridge works fine in my brother's old Kenwood direct-drive unit.

After putting everything together, following the directions as close as possible, I spun the platter around for fun. I noticed a significant wobble to it, looking along the top and not just at the rim where the dots are. I put an old record on, and the needle immediatly bounced off the record. Tried removing and cleaning the seating hole and spindle and carefully re-seating the platter, with no improvement. Finally got fed up and I am sending it back today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"If anyone is looking for an inexpensive turntable that performs quite well, buy the Audio-Technica AT-PL120 turntable. With the built-in phono pre-amp the turntable is quite versatile. So if your preamp or receiver has no phono input, you can plug it into any AUX input. There are many used records on the market for as little as a dollar or so(as well as new ones still being produced). This turntable coupled to an integrated amp makes an affordable package. Get some good monitor speakers and you will have a fine music system. Check out the small speakers from such companies as PSB, Polk, and Monitor Audio. Find a used integrated amp from NAD or Cambridge Audio (or buy a new one for around $350). For less than $1,000 you will have a music system that will be satisfying for quite a while.

Have needed and used only the standard settings (quartz speed control, clockwise turntable rotation, 33 rpm), so can't speak for the other capabilities. Sound quality from the supplied cartridge is excellent, and I'm hearing a lot of acoustic nuances from my records that I never noticed before.

And it passes my most critical quality test. When I first operate complex equipment, I always refer to the user manual, if supplied. You can tell a lot about a company's attitude toward its customers by the effort they put into this piece of paper (or booklet, if you're lucky).Despite being a Japanese company, Audio-Technica actually hired a native speaker of English to write the 12-page booklet. I couldn't find a single error in grammar, spelling or punctuation. How refreshing in a world where most such documents are apparently written and translated by idiots or, worse, by computer software and never checked by a speaker of English.

I've read serveral reviews about the hum noise on the PL120 to take care of this problem, when changing to a new cartridge, make sure you use metalic screws,some cartridge have metal heads that pick up noise. If you experience the hum noise try unscrewing the cartridge from the head shell lead leaving the wires intack and connecting it back to the tone arm, if no hum is detected get metalic screws.

It makes my records sound flat and blare-y. In fact, MP3s played on my computer through the same stereo receiver sound as good or better than my 180-gram records when played with this needle.

When I played my first lp, I couldn't believe the sounds I'd been missing all these years.

Creepin on ah come up's production has songs like no surrender with a fast tight beat that blows up lyrics. A defenite satisfaction, but due to the lack of number of songs it only gets 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"kinda short but tight","review":"prolly da only song i dont like dat much iz creepin on ah come up and no surrendermy favorites are down foe my thang,thuggish ruggish bone andfoe tha love of $"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thuggish Ruggish Bone","review":"Bone Thugs~N~Harmony have a song for every mood, Creepin' On Ah Come Up focuses on the Westcoast gangsta music, as Eazy-E as the producer, they make an excellent collaberation, This is one of my favorite Bone albums, all the tracks are sick, this was the first Bone album as Bone Thugs~N~Harmony, and Flesh~N~Bone's first album with the group, he gave a pretty good first impression on the song Down Foe My Thang, so, if you dont already have this CD, go buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepin on a classic!!!","review":"Bone Thugs n Harmony's first album is as good as it gets. Off the streets no less then two weeks when they hit the studio, you can hear the raw agression in songs like Foe tha luv of $, and No Surrender. Thuggish Ruggish Bone was the song that first propelled bone into stardom, with the late great Eazy E producing, and DJ uneek laying the beats. Krayzie Bone lays down one of the best raps in Thuggish Ruggish Bone and the hook is memorable.The real hidden jewel on this album is the title track \\"Creepin on a come up\\". A song about how to survive on the streets really shows Bone at their most gangsta. That coupled with one of the best beats I've ever heard makes that song a classic. Krayzie Bone: \\"Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t.\\"That line about sums up what bone was about.I definitly think this album, albeit short, was really as good as it gets in the rap game."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE HOOK","review":"even though this cd only has 7 songs, it is still hardcore, this is thr claisc cd that made bone who they are today. Bone thugs n harmony are the best rap group period. I think you should go and buy this cd. it has the classic song \\"thugish rugish bone\\" and Krazy, Lazy, Bizzy,Wish, and flesh Rip it in this cd, so to all yhall hatein ass people out there, i say...Forget all yhall, and to all yhall real ass sa's out in michigan, KEEP IT GANGSTA"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is great","review":"this cd is a great cd. the hits thuggish ruggish bone, and foe tha love of $ really make this cd great and thats hard to say cause the whole cd is really great"},{"rating":"1","title":"bone sucks!","review":"who ever said bone is the greatest rap group of all time is dead wrong. this c.d. like all their others is awful. they are nothing compared to groups like A TRIBE CALLED QUEST and my favirotes MOBB DEEP. I wold suggest passing up on this eight tracks of (bull) rap you can't even understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific debut EP from the Cleveland group","review":"This album shows a new style of rap that has not been tried before and works very well. Although the lyrics are not too clever the music style is perfect and the album starts off brilliantly. A master find by Eazy-E."},{"rating":"2","title":"2ND BEST","review":"EVEN THOUGH THIS ALBUM ONLY HAS 8 SONGS, IT BRINGS A WHOLE NEW EXPEREINCE TO THA RAP GAME. THA WAY BONE CHANGE THEIR TONES OF THEIR VOICES, THA DIFFERENT MUSIC BEHIND THEIR SONGS AND THA COLLABORATION WITH EAZY-E IS TOTALLY THA BOMB. THEY TALK THA REAL TRUTH, BOUT THA STREETS, AND INTRODUCED THA WORLD TO THA STREETS OF CLEVELAND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, not enuff music","review":"This cd was good and all, great Rap, but not enough tracks, 4 stars- with more tracks 5. Nonetheless worth the 9 Bucks i paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang Bang Gotta Get Down Foe My Thang","review":"Creepin on ah Come Up gives you just a taste of what's to come. Bone is one of the best groups out there basically cuz they revolutionized the game. On this cd you get a chance to expierience some of thier style but not all of it. It features such great tracks as \\"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\\" \\"Down Foe My Thang\\" and the hard hittin \\"No Surrender\\". Every Bone fan must have this cd in thier collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THUGGISH RUGGISH","review":"there is only 1 bad thang bout this ep here...only 5 fulllenth songs. this is very diffrent from bone enterprise though. they dont say nuthin bout no girls..and they rappin hella fast. the homies frum the doubleglock couldnt have came out better though...w/ production from nwa's on dj yella, and westcoast g's like rhythm d & u-neek. they mentor Eazy-E ( rip ) appears on foe da luv of money.down 4 my thang is my favorite. they sound real westcoast like and you can practily picture the area around them when they rap. i liked everything on this even the 4 tha luv of $ instrumental w/ that chick doing the little sex thing. No surrender is a favorite of all real g's (...)! Thuggish Ruggish Bone is real tight 2...its da sing that put dem on the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"One of their Greatest albumns to date. This was before they established their harmony style but it is influenced by West Coast beats and features the late great Eazy E."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Ok, I'm dead serious when I say that this is a must have. The only downside about this album is Eazy E's voice on Foe tha Love of $, but else, it's genius. I would totally recommend you to buy it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Transformer was an addition to my SCX Digital Slot Car track. Having the additional power is great. The transformer does not get overly hot. It was packaged professionally and works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soundtrack music!","review":"I love the music of Ron Goodwin, particularly \\"Battle of Britain\\" and \\"633 Squadron\\". Beware, though, that this is not cut from his soundtrack recordings. This is the BBC Philharmonic (i.e. small-time studio orchestra)and directed by some mysterious unknown conductor named Rumon Gamba. Some of the music is chopped up and poorly edited. The entire beginning of \\"633 Squadron\\" is cut out and the music starts probably 10 seconds or so from what should be the beginning. \\"Battle of Britain\\" is done as a medley of sorts and the individual segments are thrown together with no rhyme or reason.Forget this CD and spend a little more on the original soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"For band lovers","review":"I bought The Film Music of Ron Goodwin for my husband who previously played the trumpet in a military band. A great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring music","review":"I bought this CD after hearing a theme tune which featured on the collection on the radio one morning. I wasn't disappointed, there are faithfully orchestrated versions of all the themes I knew on the CD and some I didn't know. My only gripe is that there is a bit of filler in it. They should have stuck to purely the film and TV themes that are known. it's well worth a listen regardless. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"None Better","review":"Goodwin's music is outstanding. His World War II scores are outstanding. They have drive and purpose. They sound good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad (and that ain't good)","review":"I have the first two Bad Plus CDs and when I burned my own \\"best of\\" compilation it didn't come close to filling the available 80 minutes. As a jazz fan I've never been able to take Bad Plus seriously either in a traditional sense or as a post-modern experiment but I found them a good, somewhat edgy listening alternative when the mood struck. And they win the prize for clever song titles. But, while, all the technical skills are there, the net result on Suspicious Activity is a king of loud boredom. When I finally got to track 6 (Lost of Love)I sensed that they may pull the recording out of the doldrums but about 4 minutes in it just became an over-dramatic muddle. That's what this is - a muddle followed by post-muddle. That said, it wouldn't surprise me if these guys someday turn out a minor masterpiece given the amount of talent lost in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fault with Colombia corp. copy policy","review":"This is a fine work of art.Then, why 2 stars for this product? The record label limits the means by which you can copy this cd. I don't want to make real player files or windows media files tracks from this cd. I want to create simple mp3s but I suppose those are too easily shared using P2P applications. Well, let me tell you, I DONT CARE what the company wants. I care what I want. For the future I will always avoid buying CDs in this format. Educate yourself before you buy. I can't even choose my bit-rate with this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Different, But Still Bad","review":"You've all heard it by now, Suspicious Activity? is decidedly lighter and more subtle than The Bad Plus's previous releases. I find this to be a great direction for the trio; that is, to show the music community they can not only charm listeners with their bombastic in-your-face rhythms, harmonies and melodies but also with very subtle and inviting blends of sounds as well. This isn't to say this album doesn't contain King's aggressive and almost over-bearing playing (you've gotta love it) or Iverson's dueling melodies on the high and low end of the keys; it's just to say that they're used in slightly more moderation this time around. If you're a Bad Plus fan or have liked their previous work I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy jazz and copy protected","review":"Stupid album from trendy jazz wannabees. Copy protection software not only denies your right to rip to your iPod, but it has spyware that will kill your computer.

It may have the dreaded Sony XCM protection which renders the disc little more than a coaster in computer CD players.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your old Bad Plus","review":"They've gotten a lot freeer on this album. If you want pop-like structures in your jazz you may not like it, but if you like to be challenged, give it a try. (I'd hate to see what the other reviewers would say to Coltrane's Ascension or anything by Albert Ayler). As to the copy protection, I'll never put this disc in my computer, but it's fine in my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM = Dangerous Rootkit Malware","review":"Sony should be ashamed that PCs are infected just by playing this CD.Amazon should stop selling this CD immediately given the known damage that it causes to computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missa Gaia/Earth Mass","review":"I enjoyed the CD of Missa Gaia very much as I saw this Paul Winter Concert locally,in person, a few years ago. However I was disappointed that the delivery took longer than I'd experienced in the past with other items I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped a scene (Online streaming)","review":"The movie isn't bad, but it's not great either. The biggest issue I had was that around the 1hr mark, there was a scene that was completely skipped. I tried rewinding and got the same result. I waited until the following day and still got the same result. Not sure why it happened, but the scene appears to be missing (Drunken father falls after wedding). The movie picks up right at the end of that scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly 3 hours of alexander? no thanks","review":"Look, three hours is too long.THis movie is not a good movie but I don't want to be so mean.The cast is very poor. Colin farrel playing a hero and a bold and loyal conqueror? sorry, he doesn't fit it. I always see him playing a druggie or a bad person, he's better at that as it suits his raunchy personality.Colin and angelina Jolie do not fit. The battles look boring and hopeless. talking... blah... and things like that.the story line is not good. Please view a documentary. its more informative. There are some good parts but are over shadowed by the faults in this movie.I wish there were 2 Alexander films, then there woulod be more competitiona dn you can choose to see which one is better.avoid..!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"They have Scottish accents through the first half of the movie. A ton of historical inaccuracies, like characters quoting Virgil who wasn't alive for another 200 years. Poor acting. Just an overall bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Ever since its theatrical release I think this is a fine movie, it is not easy to bring such a character to life, Alexander was really something, merciful, tyrane, loyal, king, he was even considered a son of Zeus. It is very easy to tear the movie apart when you do not know the REAL story, Stone did well, Farrell did a great part too, some great historical facts were not included, but I think is impossible to say absolutely everything about Alexander, he was simply bigger than life."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can it be?","review":"so much bad reviews...boring..the worst movie of the year etc....Alexander is a masterpiece absolutly thrilling with a lot of action.The photography is sometimes truly amazing and a real wonder.I refer for instance to the scene where alexander horse\\"bucephal\\" is fighting with the elephant..it is a blow for the eyes.Rent it buy it but don't consider all these bad reviews.make yr opinion after watching it.Alexander has the same quality as gladiator and is slightly superior to \\"Troy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sauce","review":"Decent movie. I was turned off by the fact that all the guys have eye shadow. Simply stupid...but otherwise it has some of the biggest most epic battles of any movie.Cons: Its a BD.....yet it doesnt fit on one disc!? Hmmm maybe it doesnt fit because its really high quality AV....WRONG!!! Terrible VC-1 video with...you guessed it....NO HD AUDIO AT ALL!!!!!!! Just regular DVD quality Dobly 5.1........not even DTS.....no TrueHD, no PCM, no Master audio..nothing. Horrible. SHAME ON YOU!!!!Also Angelina's accent was terrible. Not at her best by far"},{"rating":"1","title":"All that needs to be said","review":"I remember when this movie came out, I was a Junior in High School. A few of my buddies and I decided to ditch the remainder of the day after the first two periods, so we went to the movies to see Alexander. We ended up walking out of after about 75 minutes and decided to GO BACK TO SCHOOL. It was that bad. I have not seen a movie since that would even come close to inspiring such a reaction. That pretty much says it all in my opinion. I hadn't thought about that event in years until I found myself at a buddy's house the other day, scanning his hard drive for a movie to watch. We had concluded that we wanted to watch some \\"ancient adventure movie,\\" and it didn't really matter what it was as long as it had \\"spear battles and stuff\\" a la Gladiator. So I saw Alexander on there and, after telling that story, decided to give it a shot to see if it's still that bad. I assure you it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"top o the mornin ta ya alexander","review":"stones cool but i just cant get past all the accents real and contrived IT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. can we stick to one american or gag british accent since know one speaks ancient greek and everyone can do american?

The battle sequences are so messy, you can't see anything. The blatant homosexuality is nausiating. The only redeeming quality in the movie is the very fine Angelina Jolie (if only this was the story of Odepus, eh?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I CANT WAIT","review":"Oliver Stone is my favorite director next to Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott and George Lucas. To think he's gonna make Alexander is overwhelming. I know everything about him and will comment when the film is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matthew Edmundson there's just one problem","review":"When first hearing there was going to a movie released that was going to cover the life of \\"the Great\\" I must admit I was enthused. After reading about how Stone would be covering this, who would be playing in it (Val Kilmer and Colin Farrell two of the worst actors in history), and saw the screens for the way they were being dressed (Colin's armor-ridiculous, and although I shall not lie I didn't mind seeing it: Angelina Jolie's toga was just a tad tight, on purpose perhaps? You tell me Stone). Anyway, I knew at once that I would NOT be catching this flick, therefore, Matthew Edmundson you are absolutely correct, except you paid money to see this terrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander as a proto-liberal","review":"Here's Stone's Alexander in a nutshell:Alex is a good liberal who defies his parents (as all good liberals must), is bisexual, miscegenates, berates his fellow soldiers for their ethnic bigotry, and dreams of a future world where all races mix into one. His only real stated reason for conquering the known world is not for power or glory but to help bring freedom and a decent education to the poor, oppressed people of the world.If you enjoy your BS in heaping shovelfuls then Oliver Stone's Alexander is the movie for you. Me? I just want the 2.5 hours of my life back which I wasted on this left-wing revisionism.Possibly what I hate the worst about this is that in terms of history I'd rather people be completely ignorant than that they accept a lie as truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"Now I remember why I had the faint feeling that this was a horrible movie. I vaguely remember that it was a mess and figured a directors cut might fix it(like Kingdom of Heaven), then as I watched it I realized that if the director is horrible a directors cut wouldn't do much.He just made it longer, not better. Wow, do I hate this movie, waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spinoff of Troy and Braveheart.","review":"Please do not see this movie it is horrible. His character disgusted me in the movie because he was bi. The battle scenes were like watching Braveheart and Alexander kind of looked like the character off Troy. It was like watching a remake to Troy. This movie is not history at all. It was really boring and I almost left during the middle of the movie. Do not see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda Driven","review":"This could have been a real good movie, but the social agenda of the director and I would suspect producers get in the way. On top of that, the battle scenes could have been much better. Any Howard Hawks western from a bygone era would be an improvement. The agenda of forcing a just below the surface homosexual tone was always in the movie. It seems the movie was ahead of it's time in this regard. All in all, a waste of even the $3 rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious motivations.","review":"What this movie boils down to is one great battle scene surrounded by incessant character assassination. Why, more than two thousand years later, a popular director should be so offended by a historical figure as to create work of such intense defamation has to be wondered about.The film segments which show any of the major characters in anything resembling a positive nature could be edited down to several minutes in total. The remainder is dedicated to proving that Macedonians were foul people, their leaders even more foul, and the world around them only a debauched cesspool.Three versions now of this pejorative portrayal. How could one director be so obsessed with such perverseness?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, script, music, sets, lighting","review":"So disappointing. I wanted to love this, and instead am embarrassed for Oliver Stone, and anyone who participated in this film. The acting is abysmal, and the writing even worse. Overacted, over-written, schlock. The score is dreadful, and the costumes and sets look amateurish. Check this out at the library and see for yourself before you buy this nonsense. A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very thrilling","review":"Let me sum this up for you in simple terms and fairly quickly. this is not Braveheart. Its not \\"300\\" Its not even Troy. heck the 13th warrior was a true masterpiece by comparison.. for the record i liked the 13th warrior. This movie plugs along with big name actors and a big budget and no direction in my opinion.. i dont care if its historicaly correct or not. Im not watching the history channel im watching a movie and want to be entertained. This movie fails to do that. Its not the worst thing ive ever seen but its far from the best.. save yourself the heartache and just re-watch braveheart and be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!","review":"What a waste of time! After viewing the original I had higher expectations for the new director's cut. With all the flashbacks it was difficult to follow what was going on at certain times. Keep your finger on the fast forward button, this is the only way to watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"finish watching this and you will feel almighty","review":"For those of you who are put off by the long reviews already submitted for this film, here's a quick and accurate description.Just plain god-awful. Why was this made? Why do all of the Greek and Macedonian men of 200-300BC have Irish accents. Why does Angelina Jolie speak with a Russian accent?These and many other questions spring to mind when watching the film. It could be mistaken for a Colin Farrell \\"vehicle film\\" ala Vin Diesel in ..Riddick, but since the film actually makes him look like a complete idiot this couldn't possibly be the case. Woeful acting abounds throughout the movie on top of all this, along with some purely ridiculous homosexual tendencies from Alexander, not ridiculous in context mind you, ridiculous in execution.As you may have guessed i hated this movie, i only finished it out of principle - to rise above it all...just like Alexander, to become a god among men. whatever...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a history movie!","review":"Oh my god I can't believe my friend was dumb enough to say this movie was great. I went to see it and to me it's not. The fighting scenes were horrible and it also felt like I was watching a spin off from The Last Sumuari, Troy, Patriot, and Braveheart. Alexander was not greek! I mean this movie is just a bunch of [...]. It actually shows Alexander kissing a guy and a woman and it looks like he's [...]. I was sittin down for three hours waiting to go home and if you are smart please do not go see this movie you won't believe it at all. The Alexander books are good but not the movie. The movie is full of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent rubbish","review":"What a pitiful excuse for a movie. Not only is it boring and self-indulgent, but it is also a insult to the subject matter. I'm not talking about the homoerotic overtones, that is as it may be and wasn't a big deal for the culture and history being depicted. But I strongly object to the depiction of the greatest general in world history as weepy and simpering, on the one hand, and an unlikely action hero the next moment. This is a person who conquered most of the known world, is he really to be depicted as the tearful loner in this film, or someone who would ride out alone to confront hundreds of enemy warriors (elephants and all). And Jolie's performance - words fail me, if only they had failed the writers of her role.There are some great pseudo-historical action movies; Braveheart, Gladiator, Ben Hur. Go and watch one of them again, and give a miss to this sad waste of three hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great interpretation of a classic hero/tyrant. Some believe he's one or the other, but if you believe he's the hero, then this movie is worth a look. Great use of not using a linear narration to keep things moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Alexander is Excellent! I couldn't stop watching it. Have viewed it over and over. Extremely well done. Loved it. Highly reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense revisited","review":"You can revisit nonsense all you like and it is remains nonsense. What we have here is a revisionist take on history (from a northern European professor, of course, the Grand Masters of revisionism) telling us that Alexander was a blondie blue-eyed gay boy who conquered the known World to usher in Western Civilization. Funny, I've been to Greece and pretty much all over the Levant and the only blondie-blue eyes I ever ran in to were tourists. Also amusing that Alexander imposed the death penalty, Uganda style, for homosexual acts.The Prequel: Blond-haired, blue-eyed gay aliens arrive from space to build the pyramids and submit a thesis to Oxford."},{"rating":"1","title":"queer eye for the so called greatest alexander","review":"I had high expectations for the movie. I was sadly let down. This is trash, pure & simple. Alex wasn't \\"great\\"... he betrayed his own people, wanted to conquer the whole world due to his own relentless selfishness and was bi-sexual! The scene w/ him and boy george disgusted me, that dark amazon looking wench was gross too. don't waste your time or money on this filth...PASS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Same disaster, only...it's longer!!","review":"This so-called \\"new\\" version is nothing more than the original theatrical release...which TOTALLY bombed at the box office! People found it too dull, drab, boring & self-serving. The studio behind Alexander's release, in an attempt to try and salvage something, had Oliver Stone cut 40 minutes from the DVD release the first time around. Guess what? Didn't work! People still thought it sucked!Whether those 40 minutes are in there or not, Alexander is stiil the same total & utter failure that it is. Don't waste your money on this stuff, folks. There's better things to spend it on then a bastardization of history designed to get somebody their weekly yacht payment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No star","review":"with all the big names and big money, (a lot of extras, fancy props and sets gone to waste) I was shocked at the terrible result. The movie was biased more towards making sure every one knew that homosexuality existed in the ranks than it was with portraying historical accuracy and detail. It was more a political statement enforcing the mass acceptance of this practice in the modern world. The fact is that there is no ancient document that clearly attests that this was the way of things (at least in the \\"universal\\" degree portrayed in this film), therefore to included it so heavily in this film is an attempt to bias history in an unwarranted fashion. Unprofessional and unsuccessful, a sad reflection of our times - demoralized and disintegrating into darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Was this boring!","review":"Ok, I must admit I only made it through 120 minutes of the 160 minute run time. Maybe all the good stuff happens in the last 40 minutes, but I was bored out of my mind and couldn't take it anymore.I like the genre, this was just a painfully dull execution of it. Get Troy instead -- that was a solid movie. Good story, good action, keeps you interested the whole way through.Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay soap opera","review":"For starters, Collin Farrell is a very poor choice as an Alexander. His dyed yellow hair was getting on my nerves and his acting was just about as annoying. Second, if you want to see a movie about Alexander The military leader this is not the movie for you. Oliver Stone is so fixed on alledged gayness of Alexander that he forgets everything else. I don't know if he has gay tendencies himself since he lovingly showcases Alexander's alledged \\"love\\" affair with his best friend, and his numerous gay encounters with persian boys wearing eyeliner. Alexander's closest circle of warriors look laughable-they are so effeminine that by no stretch of imagition can you picture them fighting in a war. And last, Angelina Jolie and her ridiculous accent which incidentally sounded russian to me.I saw this movie with my mother, my father-in-law and my husband. My father-in-law said\\"too much gay stuff\\", my mother offered\\"Collin Farrell has nice legs\\". Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"Poor dialogs.Content-free editing was also bad.Lastly, the visual effects is so badly done, I almost turned it off midway thru the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice historical interpretation, but little else...","review":"This is a fanciful and somewhat interesting interpretation on the life of Alexander the Great, but as a film epic it is sorely lacking...especially in the screenplay and leading performances. Jolie, Farrell, Kilmer, Hopkins and Plummer are all wasted...buried under hair and makeup effects. Jared Leto seems to have fallen in from MTV. Alexander is more of a hysteric than a hero and this Director's Cut is particularly long and tough to endure without a few hits of the Pause button.The Director's Commentary track, however, is the most worthwhile thing about this...for hearing Oliver Stone's own opinion, thoughs and defense of his title character is a bit like attending a university lecture by a professor who is very ethusiastic about his subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This movie was really entertaining. Nothing more or less. But the big thing here for me was the ability to see gay people for a f#cking change. One of the reviewers summed it up beatifully in his review: \\"no one cares if he was bi-sexual or not.\\" It is percisely this attitude of straight people who make poweful media decisions that leave gay audiences begging to see their lives honestly depicted on screen.So, Mr. and Mrs. Heterosexual, too f%cking bad if you are uncomfortable seeing Colin and Jared stare at each other. Join the club. Do you know how bored I am seeing heterosexuals fondle and grope at each other all for the possibility of selling me deodorant or cereal?A good movie. An even better opportunity for honest portrayal of gay lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed In Stone & Farrell","review":"I expected a lot more from Oliver Stone especially after reading the product description. I expected to see a Gladiator/Spartacus type of movie which added to my disappointment. While it may have been historically accurate and even though I'm not a prude as I was a prison guard for 25yrs. the sexual immorality as Stone depicted in the movie which he portrayed to be Alexander's heart throbs, was disgusting. In addition, to see Colin Farrell galavanting around looking for his next love affair in a blond wig was also very disappointing.Hopes this helps to give a complete review whether you agree with my summary or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! What happened Oliver?","review":"This movie doesn't even deserve the star i gave it. It was a terrible waste of talent on Stone's part and the trailer decieved the public making the film look epic.

If you can make it through the glaring historical inaccuracies, you'll still be subjected to Farrells abyssmal portrayal of Alexander. I got the impression that this was his first acting job--ever. Seriously--it's embarassing to watch, even by yourself.Avoid this movie and save yourself 3 hours of exposure to this rotten egg of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Expected","review":"This movie got so much bad press when it was in theatres I avoided it, but that's what makes DVDs so great. I actually enjoyed this film, but then I came into it with a predisposition to liking films of this genre. Films like Spartacus, Ben-Hur, and Gladiator are among my favorites. That doesn't mean this film lacks problems. Some of the plotting was a bit long and boring and the acting was not always up to par; however, Colin Farrell was very good in the role of Alexander the Great and Angelina Jolie took mother-behind-the-scenes to new heights. From an F/X standpoint, the battles were big and exciting, if a bit on the bloody side. Anyone who enjoys over-the-top historical films full of battles and sex and exotic locales should enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great DVD of a very good film.","review":"If you are looking for an intriguing plot, great battle scenes, and truly beautiful people, you will find all of that and more in \\"Alexander Revisited.\\" This film's new director's cut really shows the vision of Oliver Stone in a way that is much better than the first. Find out the real reason the guard was willing to kill Phillip. Get more insight into the terrifyingly seductive Roxanna. Be awed beyond belief with the simultaneous bravery and vulnerability of one of the greatest men who ever lived. This is a film that will not gather dust in your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"three strikes, you're out.","review":"MMMM... I don't know what I was expecting. I had only seen the original theatrical release some time ago. Disapointed with that version. I can't see anything remarkably different here. The basic product is flawed and no ammount of rejigging is going to create something amazing. I've seen Farrell in other stuff and he can act, with presence. See \\"intersection\\" I think its called, a great little Irish film where he plays a thug, very impressive. Real menace. Shame that was not allowed to come across here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to Captivate","review":"I took a chance on \\"Alexander\\", even after all the horrible reviews the critics wrote about it, but every single one was right. I was practically asleep by the end of the movie. It skipped around far too much, if it weren't for the length of Colin Farrell's hair I would have had no idea what time period we were in. The acting was decent, except for the fact that almost every character save for Angelina Jolie had an IRISH accent. \\"Alexander\\" was based in Macedonia, not in Dublin! The look of the movie was fantastic, I would expect nothing less of the hugely talented Oliver Stone, but he failed to captivate me as he did so well with the Doors movie, in which he portrayed Jim Morrison fabulously and correctly. In the end, \\"Alexander\\" was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"What story were they trying to tell?","review":"The movie was a mish mash of a decided lack of focus. The director/screen writer couldn't seem to decide if they would look at A's relationships or his concept of sharing knowledge or his strategies and so they didn't do a good job of any of it. And the long-distance battle scenes were very amateurish, particularly compared to the overly stark and detailed close up battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Agony","review":"Alexander, Revisited an expanded version of the original only adds more time to the agony of an already poorly produced film. While the battle scenes are amoung the best I've ever seen, the editing all but destroyswhat should have been a great story. I only bought it so I could say I had all 3 versions. On this I give 4 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this movie at all...","review":"I am usually very easy to please when I see a movie, all I really want is to be entertained for a couple of hours. But thismovie was such a dissapointment. The subject matter was great,but Alexander was portrayed as such a whinner. I felt more sympathy for his boy hood friend and lover than I did him. There were some good moments in the movie, but I honestly did not think it would ever end. Who cares if he was bisexual (or gay)? But I did not need to be beaten over the head with it and felt the movie focused on this more than his amazing accomplishments. Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer played great parts, but were in the movie very little. My husband hated the movie and he likes everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander The (Not So) Great.","review":"Well this movie managed to do what all other pieces on Alexander did. It completely ruined the historical figure as a hero for me.Stone has portrayed Alexander as being nothing but a drunken, boy loving, mamma's boy-with a serious oedipal complex. Who did nothing but butcher his way across the known world. What's so great about that? I thought that Alexander wanted to conquer the known world in order to civilize it. Not according to this movie. No Alex did it to get away from Mommy.The movie is bloated, and boring. People don't talk they give speeches. It is just plain awful.I don't know how accurate this film is regarding Alexander's life. But if it isn't I hope someone comes in and rectifies it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last! New version makes the Richard Burton one look good.","review":"I was always dissapointed with the Richard Burton version, and wondered how could anyone make a bad movie out of the story of Alexander the Great. Its big problem was that it ran out of time to tell the last part of the story and thus seemed uneven and boring. With this one, Oliver Stone managed to make that 1950s movie look good and not so boring. The battles are all wrong, even the choice of which to leave out, and only Anthony Hopkins gave me hope at times that it would not be so bad. I was embarassed for my sons and everyone (not many people) at the theater found it dissapointing, to say the least. I do not say don't watch it. Do so; you won't believe me if you do not. This one even makes the awful Troy seem not so bad - and that takes quite an effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Hopkins is still the best, but himself alone cannot save the movie.Too bad. Fight scenes? I guess Gladiator set a standardand nobody can reach it yet.More to say, but ...I'll save it.Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie of all time.","review":"This is truly the worst movie of all time. This is what I have been saying for the last year. I was one of the fools who paid to see this at the movies. And somehow managed to stay until the end. The only enjoyment that came from this film was hearing the other theatergoers laughing at this sad, sad film. If you love motivational speeches there are about ten in this film. If you love pointless attempts at being contraversial. Then this may be the movie for you. But probably not. Please dont fall for the 'Directors Cut' ploy by the studio. A director who has fallen as far as Oliver Stone cant be trusted. And I doubt Spielberg could help this one. Maybe someday we can get a laugh track version of this film. That may get a little action from the discount isle. But again I have to say probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Warrior","review":"The Movie was GREAT. I know that the \\"professional\\" reviewers did not like the movie -- I did. I liked the way it taught the history of the period -- quite accurate -- I liked the way it tells us that we do make our Heroes Bigger than Life -- even if they are just human like the rest of us. Collin Farrow was terrific as Alexander.Oliver Stone did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this have 3 stars?","review":"Not very often do my wife & I watch a movie & NOT get anything out of it. Almost 3 hours later, we could not connect or feel for the main character of Alexander. The war scenes were rapid, almost too fast, lots of spraying/squirting blood & gross noises. After watching, we just did not feel like it had entertained AT ALL and were surprised that Oliver Stone released such a sleeper. Dialogue was too \\"far out\\" to understand really, and considering the star power here, it goes to show that even Angela Jolie & Anthony Hopkins cannot save a poor movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rented It","review":"Alexander conquered most of the known world in the BCs. Historically, he was a fighter class man. Unfortunately he was homosexual, dying of grief after his lover passed on. Overall, a decent Holywood effort of bringing the Alexander the Great story to film. Worth seeing maybe once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar","review":"Well, from seeing this movie, I can say that this movie doesn't live up to Alexander's name(\\"The Great\\"). I thought that the story was totally contrived and the acting wasn't very good. The only reason why I watched this movie at all is to see Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson.This movie was a disappointment and I would stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, slow, confusing, gratuitous everything","review":"How bad can a movie be? If TROY wasn't bad enough, now we have to sit through something even worse? A hero and actor playing him even worse than Brad Pitt as Achilles. Over the top violence, stop spearing the horse already. Ridiculous accents by everyone involved including Jolie. Oliver Stone needs to get a grip or an editor for his screenplays. This one was terribly disjointed and very confusing. The viewer doesn't even like Alexander or anyone else. Nothing compelling in the film whatsoever. I would not recommend it to anyone.This was such a bad movie. I wanted to like it, I love the Alexander legends! But it was so sadly poor to be almost pathetic. Angelia Jolie was an utter wooden disaster in her role. The movie just didn't hang together and the character relationships were lacking. It wasn't at all the rousing epic it was supposed to be. Too much pomp and not enough circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeezus, Angelina your so hot but your TERRIBLE lately","review":"I even like Colin too, but he's speaking in an IRISH accent the whole movie. Angelina's accent is Russian, and the movie is just one bad turn after another. It's almost unwatchable. A guy on the plane sitting next to me (with no sound) said it looked like a horrible movie just glancing at it.You want to watch it because you think it can't be THAT bad, it's a big budget production after all. Think again..The sad thing is we'll have to wait another 10-20 yrs for someone to remake Alexander the way it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander","review":"I would advise anyone to watch the original \\"Alexander The Great\\", starring Richard Burton, Fredric March, and Claire Bloom, made in 1956. This newest version of the life of Alexander The Great starring Colin Farrell was a big disappointment to me at the theatre. I would rather had watched Alexander's conquest of the Mediterranean rather than watch him cry over what appears to be his lover in this movie, and the lover crying over him. Even if Alexander was a homosexual, which was probably an accepted way of life for the greeks at that time, the movie didn't have to focus on that so much. I like battle scenes in movies like this. The movie \\"Gladiator\\" is a good example. \\"Troy\\", starring Brad Pitt, is also a much better movie to add to your collection if you're an ancient Roman time movie collector like myself, rather than this latest version of the life of Alexander The Great."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"If you want to see emotion-choked actors sobbing and chewing their way through Babylonian furniture, watch this movie. In one scene I actually predicted that Alexander was about to cry out \\"Do you want to live forever?\\", a gratuitous, hackneyed phrase that peppers poor-man's epics and brands the film an amateurish effort. If you want to learn about Alexander the Great, read a book. Start with Arrian.And why was a horrifically UGLY individual chosen to play Roxanna? That was a tough face to look at on a big screen and even on a small one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"COLIN YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANOTHER MOVIE INSTEAD OF THIS ONE!!!!!","review":"Alexander is a waste of time and your money so if i was you i would not rent or buy this movie!!!!! What happen Colin why this movie????? You could have done another one!!!!!! Like i said don't waste your time on this movie it's not worth it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great sleep aid","review":"I liked Gladiator, Troy, King Arthur, and Kingdom of Heaven.So, Alexander has got to be something I would enjoy because it's a similar genre, right? Wrong, it's not in the same class as the other movies I mentioned. I fell asleep less than halfway through the first part. I did not try to watch it again.Nothing about the brief part of this movie that I saw captured my interest. Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't The History Channel","review":"Seems to be Oliver Stone's attitude in this battle-heavy biography of the legendary leader of ancient Macedonia. Frankly, the History Channel would have done it better, because they would have explained the significance of events and battles. All the viewer of this gets is a mish-mash of brutal battles and pretty scenery (and a shadowy glimpse of Colin Farrell's bare parts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hats were good...","review":"Normally I don't agree with the pointy-headed intellectuals who write newspaper movie reviews, but for once they were right -- this film is awful.To begin with, the life of Alexander is one of those stories that is TOO BIG to fit into a movie of normal length. There are too many characters, too many battles, too much politics, too many drunken brawls. It really calls for the TV miniseries format.But Oliver Stone made a tough job worse by using every trite gimmick in the B-movie director's arsenal -- flashbacks without warning, people reading letters, a silly narration by an old veteran (does this make the whole movie a flashback???), and so help me, a sequence where the colors are all changed!!! Ed Wood could have done a better job. To get my brain cells working again, I had to watch SPARTACUS three times.I gave the movie 2 stars because the spears and armor are historically correct, and the Macedonians even wear authentic floppy sun hats."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than i thought it could have been","review":"terrible. boring. blah. i read the reviews when it was in the theaters and thought 'hmm big names, oliver stone, couldn't be that bad.' rented it, jeez was i wrong. such a mammoth figure in world history reduced to this mess of a film? why do i have the feeling oliver stone never left his tent while filming and took the studio's money and ran? abominably bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone finally gets it right.","review":"Wow this cut is simply awesome way better then the other versions. Oliver Stone finally gets it right this is what should have been in the theaters. Everything flows so well and it's easier to understand. When I first saw this Revisted version I thought right away Stone your beating a dead dog with a stick and nothing you do will improve this movie. I was wrong not only did Stone make a better movie but it feels completely different too. So if you were a fan or somewhat interested in watching this, watch this version and no other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushed","review":"When I heard the bad reveiws for this movie I couldnt belieive my ears. I mean with a cast the likes of Angelina Jolie, Collin Farel and Val KIlmer how could this movie be bad!!! So I bought this movie hoping to see another classic done with a new twist. I didnt beleive the bad reveiws on Troy and I was extremly happy when I saw it a classic reborn with a new twist and a new generation of actors that climb to rival the old generation of stars from the 50s and 60s. When I watched Alerxander my hopes were crushed. The actors did their best with the material they had but I beleive the story was too convoluted and kept jumping from future to past and present too much. The story line was hard to follow and instead of keeping the story linear it was just too confusing. The battle scenes while acted and performed well were just as hard to follow. In my humble opinion I would pass on this movie. If you like period peices from mytho9logy I would suggest Gladiator or Troy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for straight guys","review":"After hearing Collin Farrel and Val Kilmor with Celtic accents..It was like watching Brave(Gay)Heart part two, I thought Slavic was the dominant language in Macedonia???

Collin Farrel looked like a fag in this movie, not that he's already one to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I buy used ...","review":"I lived in rural Alaska for some years and missed being able to browse through my favorite new and used CD/DVD stores in the Bay Area ... Rasputin's and Amoeba. Happily, I live near them again. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This movie is the near perfect reason why you should buy used. This movie does what only a handful of movies have done before ... it both blows and sucks! I haven't witnessed any comparable level of bad acting in recent memory. I won't address issues regarding historical context here ... it's a movie people, Hollywood is Hollywood and they don't care about history ... they care about entertainment, or they care about the lowest common denominator, or they care about both ... whichever choice will make the most cash. As for Oliver Stone, he can be entertaining, but here he is just inept. I lay the fault for this crap squarely on his head. One question, though: Colin, dude, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars","review":"This movie is really really bad. There is no other way to say it. I hate very few movies because I can usually find something about the movie I enjoy (music, relationship between 2 characters...), but this one has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. When I saw it in the theater, about halfway through I began recasting AND rewriting the movie in my mind. So don't bother seeing it and especially don't bother buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Stoned and Alexander","review":"I have had a sore spot for Oliver Stone since he made the movie JFK, which was and is a travesty.

I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!And I won't even mention the blonde wig!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's great","review":"the critics say it's awful. don't believed them. i truly enjoyed it. i liked the distinction oliver stone made between spiritual love between alex and his friend and sex between alex and his staff. i'm sure that gay people will grip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"This movie was just dumb,it was extremely boring.

In the case of Alexander, there is a wealth of potential for a wonderful epic. However, Stone, ever the Hollywood liberal, turns it into an expose on the gay lifestyle. Who cares if Alexander was gay, or if he had a complicated relationship with his mother. The fact is, he was one of the greatest warriors and military strategists of all time. However, in this version, all that is incidental to his relationship with his boyfriend. If David Lean were alive, THEN, we would have seen an epic of epic proportions. His portrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (a character similar to Alexander in many respects) portrayed the complexity of his character, including allusions to his sexuality, with class and in line with the overall storyline. However, Lean was a great film maker. Oliver Stone is many things, but, a great film maker? Me thinks not!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over Cooked","review":"'CLICHES' The only word to describe this dinasaur.

Alexander the Great is well known and should have been a perfect movie to depict the life and times of one so popular in his realm, but the amount of homosexual innuendos suggested in this movie made me sick. It ruined the entire movie for me and my family. YUCK YUCK YUCKIf you are sickened by extreme presentation of homosexuality, disregard this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"A fantasy tale about the life and times of Alexander the Great. At moments it reminds me of that Simpson episode spoofing the release of the Phantom Menace. A whole movie about tax code. In this case recounting a weird creation-myth involving the Greek gods, supposed conflict with his father and mother, and obsession with Darius. With a boring narration by Anthony Hopkins.This movie effectively replaces Dune (original movie) as the most muddled retelling of what should be a fascinating flick.All the Irish, Scottish, and British accents really helped the authenticity of the piece, too.Colin Farrel (who, despite the \\"star\\" thing, is a great actor) fails to convey why people would follow him to their deaths.Overall--pure rubbish. The only thing missing was Peter Ustinov."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER","review":"Having just slogged my way through this marathon of messiness, I must conclude that a better \\"final cut\\" would have been into little pieces with a scissors. However impressive visually, the battle scenes are almost impossible to follow. Everything else is boring and/or repetitious. I've not seen previous versions of this clunker, but if this is the best of the three, I can only conclude that its initial critical drubbing was understated. I can recommend this cut only to those who value length and cheapness above all else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander the Mediocre","review":"A very average film. A little hard to follow with all the narration done by Anthony Hopkins in telling the story of Alexander and his quest to conquer the known world. Alexander 'the great' who amassed the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The story begins with Alexander as a boy to his passage through India and back again.The film makes hints of Alexander's bisexuality but doesn't go any farther than subtle suggestions. The action scenes are average with a less inspiring speeches than what we've seen recently in Troy and King Arthur. Colin Farrell looked a bit odd with his dark eyebrows and bleached hair. Angelina Jolie however was cast perfectly and did a magnificient job."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very, Very Bad","review":"Most people aren't going into a sword and sandal flick, even a pretentious one, expecting them to get the history right so the fact that this is a frustrating mix of getting things really wrong and doing a good job of dramatizing other things isn't important. The real issue is that this is a jumbled up mess of a movie. The story jumps back and forth in time with little context for what is happening. It has a large cast of characters with names that are unfamiliar to American ears and does little to make many of the supporting characters stand out as individuals so it's often confusing as to who is doing what and why. Stone spends most of the movie minimizing Alexander's relationship with Hephaestian as much as possible but then has to quickly set things up so that Alexander's grief makes some sort of sense. Even at three hours it feels like there was a lot of material cut out that would have made this thing into a coherent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander Revisited - Blu-Ray","review":"Colin Farrell is hot, Jared Leto is even hotter. The film looks great and it made me wonder how much more there was to the real story. Unfortunately, this film is split onto 2 discs. I can't figure out why because from what I understand, you can fit about 5 hours of high definition video onto a single blu-ray disc. The film is 213 minutes. I know this may sound petty, but it would've been nice to have the entire film on one disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collin Farrell as Alexander?","review":"Collin Ferrell as Alexander the Great. Need you say more. Nothing against Farrell, he is mediocre for most things, but not a strong leading man by any stretch. As soon as you saw he was to portray Alexander, quite possibly the greatest conquerer of all time, you knew that it would be difficult to take at best. He is just not capable of selling that kind of strength and power. Few people are. That being said, when it came on cable I had to check out, despite my misgivings, as I am a huge admirer of Alexander and his achievements. I had hoped that there might be some good battle scenes, or at least that some of the brilliant tactics might have been covered, but as far as I could see there was nothing good about this film. I am not a fan of Oliver Stone, but this type of movie, if it were done any where near right, is clearly far out of his league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscasting at its worst!","review":"Colin Farrell was absolutely the worst choice for Alexander. He was never believable. It was the most cardboardish characterization in movies I have ever seen. Colin Farrell looked like a bleached blond porn star. Yikes! What was Oliver Stone thinking!?? Horrendous. The fact that Anthony Hopkins spends a sizable chunk of the movie narrating the movie to a scribe does not help either. Rent, don't buy if you must check out the train wreck for yourself. Try Troy if you're looking for a nice epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history movie","review":"I have read all the bad reviews written on Amazon about Alexander and I do not share these opinions.Frankly, there wouldn't be a better way in putting the story of Alexander in a movie.The acting is perfect, great scenes, costumes, graphics and music; excellent DVD image and sound quality as well.Highly recommended for the History lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever?","review":"Hell yeah...This is a Greek tragedy.The money spent on this movie could have been used to pay off 3rd world debt....hell, you could have even given starving africans swords and the chance to win some food and made the battle scenes more \\"authentic\\"...that would have been less sickening than this crock.I reckon there was far too much coke involved in the making of this...it's not even funny in a B movie ironic way...it's just awful.One of the most anoying things about it is the defence it gets from areas of the gay community...look...the film is crap...If you want a gay movie...make a gay movie, fine, but please don't defend this movie or try and describe it as \\"a move in the right direction\\" because some boys kiss in it..please!..then there's the accents...AAAAAARRRRGGHHH!0 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 3 hours back!","review":"Yes, I sat through the 3 hours.

Nothing could have saved this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"When the movie started, my expectations were high. I expected many battle scenes. I expected it tell the whole story of ALexanders life, and actually tell the audience why he was called the great. It turns out that a majority of the movie was of Alexander with his friend Hephastion having gay moments. The 2 battle scenes are pretty majestic, but the homosexual scenes were really disturbing. I wanted to leave the movie theater early if I wasnt with friends. It was really that bad. COlin Ferril usually is a really good acting but only with a good storyline. This movie really stinks. A great cast but this movie couldn't deliver anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah","review":"Not quite the \\"Alexander's gay romp\\" that my friends made it out to be, but not the quality of epic historical movie we have seen in the past decade or so.Angelina Jolie was the the only believable roll out of the bunch.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't SOMEBODY tell Oliver it was crap?","review":"This film is like the Hollywood version of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\" Surely, SOMEBODY should have told Oliver Stone \\"y'know Oliver...maybe Colin Ferrell is a bad casting choice.

I just didn't believe anyone would follow him to the ends of the earth, let alone a whole army. He was a good actor, but he seemed out of place in the ancient world. Jolie had a strange accent and even a stranger role. The movie just sort of stopped when she was on.The battle scenes which were usually Stone's forte, were boring. The movie flipped back and forth several times in flashbacks. This did not help the already diffused narrative thread. Alexander's sexuality was addressed. I guess it was supposed to be better in the director's cut, but it was still not very well done. A pouting boyfriend hanging around in the background with no substantial role was not interesting. Alexander's wife had very little to do too.The good parts are the exotic scenery and the supporting caste, except for Jolie. Plummer, Kilmer, and Hopkins were good. I just had a hard time sitting through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TURKEY AWARD IN WAITING...","review":"If I could give this a negative number, it would have it!!!I am so glad I didn't pay to see that movie in the theaters!!!! You would think that with an all star cast,even the worst script would have potential with the likes of Anthony Hopkins (one of the greatest actors ever) and a beauty like Angelina Jolie not to mention Director Oliver Stone...so what happend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Greek Trajedy","review":"This is among the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the cinematography was stunning, the screenplay, directing, and editing was painfully intricate and wandering. Stone combined endlessly long, droll monologues with continually distracting time jumps. In the end, Alexander is protrayed not as a noble character with a fatal flaw, but rather as a flawed character devoid of any real nobility. The only memorable performance was delivered by Jolie. Her portrayal of Alexander's psychotic mother was brilliant. This, however, was not enough to save this traject waste of celuloid. This is one of those situations where you should believe the critics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander is Great!","review":"Excellent movie carefully trailing the greatest moments or perhaps the whole life of Alexander of Macedon. The conqueror of the grandest part of the \\"then known\\" world. His pains and joys, his relations with many historical figures, his molding to become a great ruler, and his exceptional character are well portrayed in this epic aga which may as well be \\"Oliver Stone's Iliad\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much different from theatre release","review":"Alexander Revisited is much better than the original theater release. The extra minutes and the re-editing have made it a much better movie. Its still not a great epic film but a very good one. Seeing it in blu ray is a must for the battle scenes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of Alexander","review":"Although I prefer this incarnation to the previous two that Oliver Stone produced, I am still disappointed that so much of Alexander's conquest has been simply ignored...and we're talking about historical feats such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, the sack of Tyre, the battle of Issus and his pilgrimage to the oracle in Egypt - all of which are critical to the career of Alexander. It's hard to believe that Oliver Stone thought these events were not worth the time. All in all, however, it's a much better edit that the previous two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't say we didn't warn you!","review":"Yep, it really is that bad. I was going to write a review, but instead, if you are considering watching this film, I'd suggest you go over to rottentomatoes and read the large collection of professional reviews. They pretty much say it all--just a grand, big budget mess of a film. The serious acting is comical, the plot is pointless, and Angelina, who are you kidding with that ridiculous accent? I think the best review would be by a psychoanalyst trying to psychoanalyze Oliver Stone through this movie. I think there's a lot of frustrated subconscious mucking about in this one. Of course, now that you've heard it's so bad you'll want to watch it just to see how bad it is. Use the fast forward a lot--you'll feel better if you do. I'll give it two stars for a few moments of good historical recreation, especially the elephant stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding movie... but with terrible acting.","review":"Alexander Revisited is difficult to review... I am giving it 4 stars because the production is outstanding, definitely a new standard for the movie industry. This movie had the potential to become one of the greatest movies of all time. However, the acting is really horrible... Colin Farrell is constantly overacting and he is very far from making a good characterization of an Emperor of those times. Definitely, it doesn't depict how a man like Alexander could possibly behave. The same apply to the rest of the casting, including Angelina Jolie; they talk and behave like if they were acting in a TV drama series... the way they are acting is very distant of how the nobility behave. I can't understand why Oliver Stone did it in that way. Still, Alexander is the kind of movie one should not miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus, people.","review":"The movie was okay. Just that. Nothing more. I, for one, couldn't care less about Alexander's sexual orientation. Too many reviewers do. Focus on the film, people! The movie itself had moments of greatness, but was too long, too disjointed, and lacked any sort of clarity. In most battle scenes you simply couldn't tell what was happening. There was none of the sense of tactics or purpose that characterized battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator. The director's habit of leaping backward and forward in time was confusing and awkward. Some movies benefit from these temporal leaps (Pulp Fiction or Momento) but Alexander does not. Last, there was some BAD casting. Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrel's mother? Come on. All in all, not Oliver Stone's greatest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective use of some good actors","review":"And by good actors, I'm not including Colin Farrell. Much longer than it needed to be, this film's storytelling was not so hot. Too many \\"main topics\\" to keep my interest in any single one. Farrell's constant bewildered countenance was tiresome. Unsure why there was a need to make his bisexuality and race-mixing ideals such a major part of the story. It's the 21'st century... Most of us have accepted, if not embraced, it as normal. It somehow gave me the impression that featuring these \\"hot button\\" themes were to make Alexander seem freakish. Or at least not mentally sound. Or maybe this is an indication that we, as a civilized society, stillhave a long way to go before everyone is accepted equally."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of film","review":"about 10 seconds of rosario dawson topless and 1/2 hour of battle scenes (desert battle average - elephant battle pretty good) doesn't make up for the remaining 2 1/2 hours of puerile rot. it is a common failing of directors making movies of ancient heroes to attempt to connect with modern mores - macedonians bringing freedom and western values to the middle east, in this case. the persian empire of darius was probably more open, and certainly more sophisticated than the macedonian one. and, in any event, alexander was concerned only with conquest and certainly did not suffer from the angst manifested by mr. stone's updated counterpart. i did kind of enjoy alexander's yiddishe momma (angelina jolie) describe how great zeus was in bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!","review":"This movie is for any Yaoi Fan Girl because of all the lovely sussness in it! (minus one scene which can be fastforwarded).And I hate the fact that so many ppl give it bad reviews when it is such a great movie. I even learn Ancient History and I didn't have a problem with it's so called 'inacceracy'. And I love the fact they kept to the Bisexual -more homosexual- theme, while Troy completely delve away from that when Achilles' MALE lover was never mentioned.Though a long movie, I watched it all the way through finding myself laugh and cry in places and let out a cry of pleasure when Alexander and Hephaistion profess their love for one another, and Alexander sleeping with his slave boy Boagos. You'll find yourself begging at the TV for Alexander to go back to Babylon before its too late.I highly suggest everyone should ignore the horrible reviews and watch it for yourself because it is a trully beautiful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic Boredom","review":"Wow! I thought they stopped making these yawn-fests back in the...sixties~!Put Cecil B Demille on crack and you get this epic tragedy.

One of the lines makes reference to \\"ironic love\\"...uh...hmmm?!I paid relatively little for the blu-ray version, so I should have known there was \\"something wrong\\", but I recommend paying as little as possible to watch this boring waste of time.Here's a valuable suggestion: read The Persian Boy, by Mary Renault(then the whole trilogy and most of her books!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broing and confusing","review":"Alexander the Great is an amazing story, yet Stone failed to doanything with it, instead delivering a confusing and boring film.Some of the key elemnets from the Alexander story are left out, like the conquest of Egypt, and Darius betrayal by his own generals.The Richard Burton film form the 60s is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone me!","review":"I bought this in the hope that the critics had been wrong about the film. They hadn't been. It is quite awful, especially for those of us who hate snakes. The Irish accents; the cutting from one point in time to another...and back again. After an hour I was bored; after ninety minutes I was desperate. It took two seperate viewings to reach the end.

Director cutted the parts that were good in the original theatrical edition. However, some terrible / strange parts ( especially some inflate acting...etc...) were kept. Besides, the movie loss its focus. I can't feel the great of Alexander. I can't feel his emotion and personality.

Bad, Boring, & Senseless movie","review":"If there is an official Hall of Fame for bad movies, Alexander should definitely be on the top. If you think Showgirls was bad this is 50 times worst. The movie was so boring that after watching it I was still bored. The feeling lasted about a day and I am not exaggerating. Not only it was boring, the story line is very unrealistic eventhough this is based on history. Even with makeup, can you imagine Colin Farrell's mom is Angelina Jolie? This movie does not highlight the greatness of Alexander the great but instead brings out every painstaking irrelevant detail that no one cares about.Don't waste your money and time on this. I should have asked for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this movie couldn't have been made worse!","review":"I couldn't make it through this movie because it is way to long and it doesn't focus on anything but how gay Alexander is. The gay scenes in this movie were just to interupting of the flow of the story and in actuallity did not have much to do with histories portrail of him. Now that I have gotten that out of the way.I don't know about anybody else but why in the hell would you cast Colin Ferrell who doesn't look like he could fight his way out of a paper bag? I would think less of a pretty boy and someone more rugged like Russell crow with some curly locks! Im sure he was quite the ladies man and the mans man but pale skin wimps are not convincing to cast as one of the greatess leaders of the ancient world.

Essentially, every time one version of this film--which manages, amazingly, to be neither exciting in terms of action nor well-developed in terms of characters despite its long running time--flops, Stone makes another one.

But in my opinion, this is too little, too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst historical movie I have ever seen! :-(","review":"I can find so many words to describe this film, but the one I feel fits best is simply TERRIBLE.

Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother in the film, and as history recalls her, she was a power-hungry maneater who had great ambitions for her son and watched them come to fruition. Rosario Dawson portrays Alexander's lover, then wife.Oliver Stone has wanted to make this film for many years, and struggled a lot with getting it into production, so here's hoping it'll be well worth the effort, and we will finally have a definitive film of one of the world's greatest rulers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend documentary","review":"This movie consists of one long speech after another mostly by Farrell. Messy battle scenes, cut in between these speeches that give no indication of Alexander and his generals great military tactics. There's no intrigue, no story to tell. Don't waste your 3 hours. Check out the A&E or History channel documentary instead. It has more depth more intrigue and more appreciation for the Great Alexander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great battle scenes the rest stinks.","review":"There are only two battle scenes in the entire 214 minutes.

Too much seductive and suggestive body language. Abusive behavor and battering. Hated it because there's too much gay stuff going on which made me sick to my stomach.

Now I know that some prudes out there find the explicit nature of this movie to \\"untasteful.\\" Well, let me just say this, \\"THIS IS A FRINGIN' AWESOME MOVIE!!\\" Now, to the review. I watched both the theatrical version and the Director's Cut of Alexander, and by far, this is the best. It brings together a somewhat accurate description of the life of Alexander the Great. Now, granted, it's not all accurate, but it's accurate enough for an ancient and classical history buff like me to enjoy it. I particularly enjoyed Jared Leto's portrayal of Hephaetion. Also, the battle scenes are handled beautifully. If you are a person who enjoys movies like Troy or the TV series Rome, I assure you, you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"Being a hardcore costume drama fan, I was hoping to like this movie and tried to be open minded, despite viewing Oliver Stone as mixed bag.

But not even a Platoon of big name celebs could save this near turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord this was crap!","review":"I have nothing to say about this movie except don't see it. I'm not really a Collin Farreell fan I just saw it because it looked interesting but it wasn't good as I thought it would be. It was like I was watching another Troy movie. Some of the battle scenes were a lot like Braveheart but this movie was dumb. Do not rent it. It's a waste of money. If I were you wait till it comes on TV if you want to watch it just don't rent it.

I, therefore, went into the viewing of it with an open mind. I became bored in the first 1/2 hour. The script plods along in a seemingly mindless and pointless lack of direction. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...it did. The lackluster battle scenes, the lack of a well-written story line, and the prurient inclusion of homo-erotic and attempted rapes are not a substitute for good writing, acting and directing. The story of the REAL Alexander is better served by NOT viewing this movie. The sheer length of the movie (nearly 3 hours) is ample time to get it right, but the movie fails to do so.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone that wants to enjoy a good story of an incredible historical character. This movie is best left collecting dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on, no chemistry","review":"I love action films, but this film drags on and there seems to be no chemistry between the actors.

Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal. There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life. Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much. I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie. They are the redeeming features of the whole thing. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue. Read a good book about it!! Sorry, Oliver, but it's JFK all over again. Plausible, but just not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I cannot imagine, that anybody was thinking: this is the movie we have been waiting for.

Although everybody speaks English in a normal way, she is using a strange kind ofaccent. Only the fighting scenes do pass the test, but that is the only aspect of the movie that does. Do not go and see this one if you like this genre. You are still better off watching Troy.That one wasn't all that either, but at least that movie's cast isn't so bloody annoying.

Since it was not rated, I should have been more alert as to the probable content. Casting Brad Pitt as Alexander and Anjelica Jolie as HIS MOTHER was certainly a stretch, although if he was born when she was 12-15 years old, the age difference probably wasn't that important. I doubt I would ever watch this movie again and found it a waste of over three hours. Amazon's price caught my eye and influenced my decision to buy. I have a hard time passing up a bargain. In addition, it was rated as far superior to the earlier Alexander the Great, which I also purchased for a comparison.

Stone has Colin Farrell, with bleached blonde hair and some of the worst line reading in history.Although Farrell isn't alone in his campy and over reaching acting skills, we have Angelina Jolie doing the best 'Natasha' voice since Rene Russo in the \\"Rocky and Bullwinkle\\", and the poorest acting by pretty-boy Jared Leto, in quite some time.I never did view the chopped up mess that hit the theatres, this version is a little long and heavy on dialogue and light on action. but if they only chose different actors, this one would have been a masterpiece in waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic waste of money","review":"No one I know likes this film.

The 1956 version with Richard Burton didn't exactly set the world on fire, but at least it was watchable. This mess from Oilver Stone is about as hideous as movies get. Avoid this turkey"},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete Alexander","review":"I really like this version. It gives more detail to the characters. I think Colin makes a great Alexander. He was a complicated and interesting person in history. This version shows more of his bisexuality. I think that is what a lot of folks do not like about this film, but it was part of who he is. I own the Director's Cut as well. The action scenes are more brutual here but also more dramatic and stunning. So glad this unrated complete version has been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander Revisited","review":"I think this movie combines some of the best parts of both previous versions. It had all the major scenes from the theaterical release, and it had the same timeline as the director's cut. Anything I disliked was personal. So if you liked the previous movies, then I think you will like this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly amazing inspiring film","review":"You can trust me to tell you that this is a great film that captures one of the greatest momnets in the history of our world. But if you don't like history you won't like it. A must see among history lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Men With Mullets and Celtic Accents","review":"Alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident.There is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander's strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite...","review":"If your impression of Alexander is based on Plutarch's \\"Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans,\\" then DO NOT WATCH THIS! I understand that interprative leeway is required to accomodate the 2-hour or 3-hour movie format, but this is HORRENDOUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the ticket","review":"Is Alexander as bad a disaster as the critics are saying? No. Merciful heavens, it's worse. I mean this is in the class with Heaven's Gate and Town and Country. In this movie Alexander the Great is portrayed as whiny, often weepy mama's boy with a complex the size of a mountain about his mean old dad. That's it. You sit through what feels like several hours of weeping and pychological mish mash. People around me were actually laughing at the movie and it's not meant to be a comedy. Colin looks silly in that wig/dye job and Angelina Jolie as Olympias was ....strange. Val Kilmer gave such a great performance as Doc Holiday that it's sad to see him hamming it up in this movie. I liked the elephants though. If you don't go to a lot of movies pass this one by or you'll be left furious for wasting your ten bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Troy","review":"The only good that came from this movie is Angelina Jolie... too bad she looks like colins little sister.... well bad for the film, good for the viewer.Oh, and why are there so many reviews of people saying that the movie \\"LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE GOOD\\" and giving it a 4 or 5 star rating... nimrods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out and historically inaccurate, at least the first 10 minutes that I saw","review":"Started loosing interest from the first few seconds of the movie when they try to pass images of old Persian syllabary (alphabet letters) and symbols of the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda (Persian again) and stone carvings from Persepolis as Greek. Then was just drawn out and too \\"verbose\\" from there on. Closed out my player when it started to get really ridiculous about 10 minutes in with the Angelina Jolie's snake show. (Was watching it on Amazon Prime for free - Good thing did not pay to see it at the movies.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I walked out of this movie in the theater. It's the only one out of 300+. That should tell you what kind of terrible film this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collin Farrell... What Happened?","review":"When I first saw Collin Farrell in Tigerland I thought, \\"this guy is really good and is going to be somebody'. Then he became the 'It' guy of the moment and was showing up in just about everything and doing nothing really well. This movie, he is totally miscast and out of his element. I think the movie, like a few others, was trying to cash in on the success of the Russell Crowe movie Gladiator. It was over long, focused too much on Alexanders sexuality and had the dumbest casting. I mean Angelina Jolie as Farrells mother was just plain nonsensical. Val Kilmer was really horrible too which is a suprise cause he usually is really good. But the major flaw is the story itself. It tries to tell too big of a story in a limited amount of time. And Collin Farrell is in over his head. I have decided he is not that good of an actor. He is just a pretty boy who was good in one movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"Stone should seriously consider quitting the film industry after creating this wretched movie. It's embarrassingly bad in every respect. For the misguided reviewers who think this criticism is largely based on homophobia: you're wrong.

He must mean the fundamental good taste of viewers world-wide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly about the Potty at All","review":"This is an entertaining enough cartoon for kids to watch, and mine do, but it is only in the most tangential way about learning to use the potty. It's a fifteen-minute movie and the kid doesn't even get the potty for about eight minutes.The fact that everything is in rhyme bugs only me. The kids don't mind, and you do turn it out. The 21-month-old likes it more than the three-year-old. It's probably not a coincidence.We got this with a little book called \\"The Potty Book\\" about the same little boy with the same art. The book is of great interest to the baby, although it still doesn't really have that much to do with the potty either. The movie and the book are just about an ordinary little boy who learns to use the potty while doing ordinary things. It doesn't tell anyone how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids Like It, But.......","review":"Yes - our son loves this video. However, the grammar is awful, so we'll have to un-teach the bad English, once he's potty trained...... Also - the music is super low-brow, rock-n-roll-ish. I was hoping for a catchy tune which wasn't quite so ..... crappy..... (ha ha ha). In general - if you don't care about the free-fall of culture and civilization, this video will do the trick. If you do, you might want to make your own video, and sell it to the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst dvd ever!","review":"This movie is absolutely annoying and my son doesn't even like the movie! My daughter who is seven was like not this again. And I only played it twice. I tried to be positive of the movie but can't. If you are trying to get your child out of the diaper it takes like 7 or 8 minutes to get to the point that you should use the toilet. It talks about doing the doo doo and pee in the diaper and to me that was making it okay for my son to stay in the diaper. Then it goes to using the toilet it to me is confusing I just do not encourage the purchase in this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS POTTY MOVIE","review":"According to the blurb on the back cover, this movie includes a song called \\"Bye-Bye Diapers\\" (to the tune of The Beatles' \\"Bye-Bye Love\\").It's to that tune, alright, but the words are NOT \\"Bye-Bye Diapers.\\"Here are the lyrics:BYE BYE PEE-PEEBYE BYE POOPNeed I say more? What parent wants their kid singing THIS song in public?And, the child psychologists who wrote this movie either had no role in the lyrics (a shame) or if they did, they need to be fired. Because, when we potty train, we don't say BYE BYE to peeing and pooping - that stays with us for life.This movie only played in our house for one day. Ironically our son is looking for it everywhere because the song is so catchy, he wants to sing it all the time.

It's designed use is for the computer and telecommunications fields. But it works great to find wires in walls too.Ever wonder where that sneaky electrician ran a wire? Turn the circuit off, this tool isn't made to work at 120vac, then connect the transmitter to the wires. As long as the wires are not shorted together (like a light switch turned on, or something plugged in) you will find the wire easily. To make sure you have the correct wires, simply touch them together briefly, and the tone will change, verifying that you have the correct pair.Works great through lath and plaster walls for pinpoint wire location."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR ALL ELECTRICIANS","review":"I participate on a Regional Building Committee for Sound System installations and this tool was recommended to me by one of our Senior Regional staff. It has worked perfectly. An example, we had a speaker can installed in the ceiling prior to drywall being installed. The Drywall staff covered over the speaker can and the paint crew then did their job. I came into the room and was able to trace the wire and find the speaker can in the ceiling in the matter of two minutes (literally)! I have used for several other instances and it has proved to be invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this is a great product and reasonably priced.

The builder neglected to label the wires in the switch panel, so I had no idea what was running to where. I connected the tone source to a jack and used the probe in the panel to try to identify the wire. Unfortunately, the signal was not strong enough / loud enough to be detected in the switch panel. I have a two story house and all the wires go through the walls to the attic and back down into the panel on the ground floor. I was only able to detect 1 jack (an upstairs jack with the shortest run of cable). If you have shorter runs of cable, it may work for you, but it didn't do what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on from this one","review":"This is second one I have tried in a couple weeks. The first one didn't tone at all and gave nothing but static, so I figured I would just exchange it as sometimes you get a bad one, it happens , I get it. Well when the replacement one came it DID tone but I had to crank the volume all the way up to override the static so I could hear it. I sent this back too and just requested a refund. I'll keep looking at others. I was very surprised that Fluke put out such a crappy toner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluke Pro3000 does not operate","review":"The toner/probe doe not function as received. New batteries were installed and it still does not detect a tone at the the end of a conductor. A call to Fluke did not produce any resolution. As an aside, the volume control on the probe interferes with the case, making adjustment very difficult. I'll try one more call to Fluke support before I return the umit.

I thought the plot was very touching and heartbreaking, but kind of unrealistic. What made me buy this book was the cover. It was really pretty and it looked like a good book.

However, with all of the commercial references it seemed as though various companies sponsored the book. There were some parts that contradicted one another, such as Trina's favorite book before she died was Koko, but sometime later the author wrote \\"her favorite book after Koko was Green Eggs and Ham,\\" which wasn't consistent. The peak of the novel was the very first chapter. A good first chapter is what gets a reader interested in the book, but the rest of the book was a little disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried very hard, largely failed","review":"You'd think that a book about such a horrible topic could avoid stereotypes, cliches, and other boredom, but that's largely what you'll get from these characters.

It touched a deep chord in my mind and even after I fell asleep my mind continued to churn on it, to the point even of giving me a nighmare (unusual for me). The book takes us through the paces of how tragedy can tear a family, and lives, apart. Very moving - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"This one is an okay read. But it is honestly a bit tedious. It's the story of a woman's life after her son accidently kills his 2 year old sister. The horrible tragedy, unfortunately, unfolds in the first two pages of the book so you never really get to see the family that is destroyed by the tragedy. This was a major mistake in story telling. The characters are drawn almost too sympathetically--so that no one is ever to blame for anything. The only character who stuck with me was the son, Teddy. The ending, which is a tacked on scene from several years later is too pat and too self conscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice TV for decent price","review":"I received this TV as a gift and was very pleased.

Now that I have read it, I know it is absolutely worth the price for which it is now being sold. The writing was awesome. I felt I was right in the main character's head. I enjoy reading about people whose lives are so different than mine, but non-fiction books don't usually hold my attention. I learn so much from fiction books like this one. The author put a lot of time and energy into researching the culture and circumstances in which these women live. I would definately recommend this book to anyone YA and up, men and women.

This book was so amazingly written, I literally could not put it down. I stayed up all night last night finishing it!

The details it has on the uniform, face, and even gloves and shoes are great. It's made out of hard plastic and it is very durable. They even painted his shaved beard on the figure, how more detail can the designers really get? My only complaint would be that it only looks like Jeter on a certain angle (the first angle i showed in the pics). But once you see his face up front, it kinda looks like another person. I suppose this great figure was based on a photograph or a still from Jeter in motion. But otherwise, i have no other complaints, I think it's a great figure, especially for a Yankee fan.

Other than that, it blows air AT your laptop, not away from like I expected it to, but maybe thats just what I thought it would do.All in all the USB hub is really a nice feature to have in here - makes this thing like a dock, just way cheaper.

Fellow Mac users, try this first: smcFanControl (Google it). It's an app that lets you set the minimum fan speed, and has dropped my average CPU temp by about 15 degrees.

I've had one of these for a couple years now (bought it while it was on sale at a store). If it works, it does its job, but that's a big if. Sometimes the fans start grinding for no apparent reason for a few minutes, then work perfectly. Sometimes they start grinding, then continue grinding. Powering it on USB (rather than the AC adapter) sometimes resolves the problem (as it runs at lower speed). Lately, one of the fans has been grinding almost continuously, I suspect the motor might be shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Worked fine in the beginning.

It started working again only this time the fan sounds like a helicopter is in the room. So i had to tape down one of the fans so at least half of my laptop would stay cool. The usb works great and frees up space however. However you could just buy a cheaper cooler and a separate usb hub. I would totally pass on this and would not recommend this product or brand to anyone else. I'm going to buy the Antec cooler now, hopefully it'll last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No USB Ports - No AC Adaptor","review":"Item is useless! Pictures show USB ports, it has none.

But the truth is, they have a lot more talent as songwriters than almost any \\"hair metal\\" band. Perhaps a better comparison would be to fellow Illinois band Cheap Trick. Chip Z'Nuff and his cohorts play melodic hard rock -- and they do it really well, whether it's on their first hit \\"New Thing\\" or on later tunes like \\"There Goes My Heart.\\" If you're into melodic hard rock or power pop, you will probably enjoy this CD.

Controversy.Titling an album with the word \\"Virgin\\" was pretty gutsy in 1984. And what happened on the very first MTV video music awards had some in shock. But, like it or not, Madonna had found America's \\"button\\" and she pushed it with glee.Labeled \\"An annoying one-hit-wonder, with the voice of Minnie Mouse on helium\\", Madonna's second album found her branching out to new musical genres.

And that album was misguidingly titled 'Like a Virgin,' after the excellent hit single that gives the album its two-star rating. Avoid this, or if you must have it, do what I did, and buy the cassette for $1 at a rummage sale. This album is nowhere near the caliber of Madonna's later work. Instead get her underrated debut album."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE HER AN ICON BUT IS THIS ALBUM REALLY GOOD","review":"The songs of Like A Virgin and Material Girl are the only worth listening songs here, the rest of the album is pure filler. No wonder she promoted by the VIRGIN years two tracks that were not on the album, such as the superior dance song INTO THE GROOVE and the melting sweet ballad CRAZY FOR YOU, LIKE A VIRGIN produced by CHIC crooner Nile Rodgers falls so far behind from his clever years with the DISCO act...fact is that Madonna dislikes MATERIAL GIRL, and LIKE A VIRGIN sounds classic but extremely overplayed.

Like a Prayer suffered the worst from this because the cover looks blurry and lifeless. I was most excited to get this one since \\"Like A Prayer\\" was the first album I purchased (back in 1989). This reissue also clearly didn't have any patchouli splashed on it.In second place, Like A Virgin doesn't have the same tint as the original cover and is much darker. The image on the back is also no longer flipped upside down but is now right side up which didn't keep with the original album lay-out.With that said, the best looking re-issues happen to be \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Erotica.\\" Lastly, the \\"Madonna\\" album seems to have an improved cover due to the brightening of the image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain and simple, a great album.","review":"On the whole this, is a very enjoyable album. Had Madonna added just a couple of more songs, it would have been better. Its short length sort of leaves you hanging. The songs are classic. Of course the title track and \\"Material Girl\\" have made their mark, but I think \\"Angel\\" should have been released too. That probably ties \\"Like A Virgin\\" for the best song on the album.

This was the second album Madonna put out and contains 9 songs that are just as pop-rific today as the day they were released. Case in point, I was listening to this Cd when I took my nieces to their dance class. Afterward, at dinner I heard my niece humming 'Shoo-Bee-Doo'. The songs on here are catchy, witty and just plain fun. Along with the title track, you have the Madonna standards the 1980's inspired 'MATERIAL GIRL', the sugary sweet 'ANGEL', the sexy, swank 'DRESS YOU UP' and the power ballad 'LOVE DONT LIVE HERE ANYMORE\\". You also get the perky, motovational 'OVER AND OVER' and my personal fave, the somber, introspective 'SHOO-BEE-DOO'. As you know, this is classic Madonna. Even the pictures for his album are timeless. The cover art is simple black and white, yet utterly sexy beyond belief. This is Madonnas best work as the Queen Of Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to sell","review":"This album made of Madonna the big star she is now, but it's far from being her best.

Other good songs here are \\"Angel\\", \\"Dress You Up\\" and \\"Shoo Be Doo\\".

Of course, you can still have your Material Girl and Like A Virgin - the most memorable Madonna songs on the face of the earth! Also, make sure if you haven't that you see her Vogue music video - it is honestly sooo amazing and fabulous! This cd is one of her best from the earlier years - don't skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a GOLDMINE !","review":"This is a classic example of 80s Pop perfection. Madonna became a massive global star due to the strenght and quality of the production on this release. On this project, Madonna (aka: MADGE to her U.K. fans) continues to vocally sing in her higher register. Some may find her vocal performance to ressemble MINIE MOUSE trapped inside a danceclub. However, her vocals add more flavor to the 80s kitch factor. Having a massive hit with \\"LIKE A VIRGIN\\", considered as a controversial single for radio in the mid 80s and peaking at the #1 position on the BILLBOARD charts greatly assisted to turn little MADGE into \\"THE MTV DIVA of the 80s\\". Other radio hits on this album are \\"ANGEL\\", \\"DRESS YOU UP\\" and \\"LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE\\" while \\"OVER AND OVER\\" became a huge... danceclub hit in late 1984.

I had a hard time keeping my patience while I sloshed to the end. The language is quite dense at times, and I had to look up the dictionary for more clarification. All in all, if you have read plenty of books detailing of Hitler's death, I doubt very much that you'll find anything new in The Last Days of Hitler. Let's just say, H.R.

Also, there is a fifteen minute scene they cut out where the girl is getting Rambo to take them to Burma. In that scene we are let into Rambo's head, we understand his motives, and he instantly becomes more accessible to the audience. I think Sylvester cut it out but he knew all of Rambo's motives, he was the character and the director.

A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I bought this because I didn't think that it came with the Rambo collection but I was wrong.

Would recomend to all who are in need of this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rambo Rules Again!","review":"If you are looking for Sylvester Stallone at his best, then don't miss Rambo. At his age of 60 he does the character in all of its action packed glory! I am in total agreement with the other people who have received five stars for the comments on the movie.Rambo goes after the mercenaries in his own way. Raw, powerful and plenty of blood. It's the movie that may not be for everyone with its brutal scenes but Sylvester Stallone rules again! RAMBO ROCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live for nothing, die for the teak","review":"Last time I looked, the Karen and other heavily armed national minorities in Burma had a deal with the evil SLORC dictators about splitting the proceeds from smuggling. I think it was fifty-fifty.Why didn't Rambo just tell the Karen to call the Burmese army, hand over some teak wood, and save the day?As usual, Johnny has no reality check when it comes to world politics (although he's good as an archer). I mean, last time he aided al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan!Live for nothing and...die for nothing.What a guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stallone's intentions were good, but unsatisfing.","review":"It is true that this movie had tons of action throughout every second of the movie, but was completely overdone. The storyline was completely boring and Stallone's role in the movie was not a major one since the mission was only to save the damsel in distress; too cliche. I don't know if anyone else noticed but in all of the other Stallone movies he showed how tough he was like all other tough guys like Arnold and the Rock by having their shirt rip throughout the movie revealing their six pack, but in this movie, i don't know but maybe Stallone was embarrassed to show anything but his arms and face....getting too old....yup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambo gone wrong!!","review":"Was so very disappointed. No real plot, Stallone was a bit overweight and not built as in his first and never took shirt off and just looked bedraggled.

And this tough guy has little to say to the bad guys, since his actions speak louder than words.But with explosions being featured throughout Rambo's rescue mission, what potentially could have been Hang 'em High in southeast Asia becomes a huge fireworks display gone ridiculously awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of bloody action.

Having said that the action is extreme and very well done. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rambo!","review":"This is a silly but action-packed production.

Looks great on blu-ray too. Excellent Movie overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Baaack....","review":"At an age when most action movie stars should have allowed their careers to go in a different direction Stallone delivers up his biggest mayhem fest to date. Anyone familiar with the previous offerings in the Rambo franchise can attest to the fact that this film doesn't deviate from the basic formula much. What is remarkable is the actual increase in brutality and mayhem from the previous films. Definately not for the squeamish. Worth mentioning is the great film score. The film ends with his return home to Arizona. A great idea for a sequel if he's up for it would be Rambo taking on a violent Mexican drug cartel after a family member is kidnapped. Just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Rambo Movies","review":"I bought this on Blu Ray, and I must say the picture and sound are both excellent. As for the movie, well it is a Rambo flick, so lots of violence and action. I would say this movie ranks up there, better than the second movie but First Blood is still the best. Be warned this is the most graphic of the Rambo films, very disturbing violence, but it does add to the horror of the bad guys. I highly recommend this to the action fanatics out there. Rombo delivers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rambo Movie","review":"Rambo 4 is an incredibly violent yet entertaining action adventure. It's the best of them all actually. It's short but sweet but certainly not cuddly sweet. Rocky Balboa was a bit better but still this turnt out better than I expected since I'm not a big Rambo fan.I just felt like everyone but Rambo's life was in danger in the movie. He was too much of an animal here, I mean he's like Michael Myers type strong. While it's so violent and even some-what disturbing that you'd think Rob Zombie was directing it. Performance wise though Stallone still does Rocky way better than he does Rambo. Rocky at least has a personality. Stallone handles the action great but when he's not violently destroying his enemies he's frowning like he has a stomach ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like ol' fashion Rambo, this got it!","review":"I like this movie, especially watching it in Blu Ray format. It brings back the good ol' fashion soldier fighting the guerillas. A total 80s action (and I grew up in the 80s). I just love this movie, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to bake a brutality cake.","review":"This latest tale of John Rambo is sticky sweet gore candy. It seems that Sly woke up one day and decided it was time for a carnival of violence that wold make Verhoeven stand up salute. Easily 60% of this movie an a homage to carnage, a shining temple to trauma with our man Rambo getting gnarly on waves of blood normally reserved for only the most hemorrhage happy anime.Sure sure, there is a message floundering at the bottom of this Mariana's Trench of brutality. It amounts to this; don't go to Burma. Especially if your an unarmed group of idealistic white folk from Colorado. Outside of that handy little moral, the undercurrent of this unabashed slaughter riot is how to make a film into a veritable vessel of viscera.There are zero pulled punches in this tale of a horrid civil war. Men, women and children are killed, maimed, beaten, raped, tortured and eaten. Not in a \\"suggestive\\" sense either.Rent. Enjoy. Keep all children under 23 and females out of the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAMBO","review":"This is a great 4th installment of the Rambo series.

Of course, they got caught up in the war and Rambo came to rescue with bunch of self-righteous white mercs. Hmm, if you are god-believing church person coming for \\"humanitarian\\" work, why did you hire bunch of mercs to do the killing? Why not let God take care of the humanitarian's fate? How hypocritical!Of course, the evil Asian guy must not rape the poor white girl until Rambo stood behind him. Give me freaking break!There's no character building, no plot, no interaction/connection between characters, nothing but people being blown into pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad","review":"I should have known better than to rent this and expect it to be anywhere near the original First Blood and Rambo films. Those were made when Stallone was at his peak. Here, he's just pathetic. The acting is horrid, the plot is pointless. Save yourself the trouble and rent the originals.

When I heard about this movie I just shook my head and groaned. Trailers looked interesting but still I abstained. I rented the movie just on a whim. Now it is my favorite of the series. I thought Stallone was making a mistake on this one, but I was wrong. You'll like this movie if you enjoyed the series and are able to watch a movie, and enjoy, without dissecting the film. It is what it it is. It is entertaining and probably the bloodiest film yet. This is not an Oscar contender with witty plot and award winning soundtrack. I highly recommend this movie as good entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RAMBO SINCE FIRST BLOOD!","review":"I have always liked the original 'First Blood' film, but I hated both Rambo 2 and 3, so I had little desire to see this new entry in the series. After seeing 'Rocky Balboa' and thinking it was the best Rocky film since the original I had some curiosity to see this new entry in the Rambo series.While this film is short on brains, it's not short of adrenaline pumping action and stylish gore! Sure, Rambo is up to his old tricks, but this time it's a well paced film with some fun poked at the character.This should have been the only sequel to the original film and as far as I'm concerned....it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This movie is horrible. It has no point. It is so gory and graphic that it's almost laughable. After you see the 20th guy get his head blown off in shaky slo-mo, you're like, ok whatever. They could have done so much with this character but instead chose to create a ridiculous storyline with no purpose whatsoever. We wasted $15 on this movie to complete the set. It was better without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more baloney macho fake adulthood","review":"Did you see any of the previous Rambos which were specifically made to make U.S. citizens think that the Vietnamese majority were somehow...ugly, terrorist, maniacs (defending their soil) while the the US Armed Forces really were like one bigger than life humanoid, so cartoonish you have to laugh along with the machine-man. Well, if you could swallow that stuff with a straight face then you probably fit with the other positive reviews here. If you expect something more than foolish caricatures and superficial cardboard cut-outs you'll be sorry you wasted any time, money or energy on Mr. Stallone and the infantile script he mechanically acts out.Sheesh -- with all the talent and brains out there the studios push this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambo","review":"i have to say that this film did more in picturing realistic slaughter, than any of the current news links. that said, the film tends to reinforce old stereotypes of noble westerners trying to save the helpless, godless heathens, who lack basic humanity and civilization. the movie also shows the old image of a perverted asian male who lusts after the blond,unattainable white woman. but no need to fear...rambo rescues her before she's dishonored. just as our cavalery once did for american indian-captured white women in the old west. in view of today's globalism and the closeness of other cultures through the travel, media, and immigration, these are dangerous ideas to perpetuate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i bought wideScreen edition but guess what happend when i got the package ??? it was widescreen from outside only !! but when you play the DVD you see FULL SCREEN !!! for plaxma and LCD guys i think you know what is the difference between full and wide SCREEN !! the movie is GReat !! but the seller is Crazy !!!

If I could give it less than one star I would. The theme of this movie is that killing everyone is the best solution to problems in less civilized areas. The pacifist missionaries are shown to be foolish for ever thinking that they could spread a gospel of peace to such \\"animals,\\" and in the end one of them completely compromises everything he stood for the enitre movie and kills a member of the enemy's army.

Sly just got lazy and did not prepare for this movie. He is over weight, out of shape, and looks really old. Now I know make-up people can do a lot of things,perhaps he was meant to look that way. I expected a RAMBO not a HOBO. I have all three of his previous Rambo films, and they were great. I would not tell people to buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Gore","review":"Yeah, it's a war film, so killing, blood and rape are to be expected. In this film, don't expect much more than that. It's extremely graphic without much more to fall back on. The setup is simplistic--missionaries want to do the right thing by bringing aid to those oppressed by the Burmese Army, and nothing about it goes well.Everything about this film is an effort to exhibit the most gross aspects of battle, with almost no character development, minimal context, no chemistry amongst the cast. Even the action can't stand without a blood bath. The only other notable facet of this film is trying to figure out what cosmetic surgery Stallone has done. The irony of missionaries vs murderous rampages is more than a bit blunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambo","review":"While the movie kept my interest, the language was so terrible and somewhat ridiculous. How many times do you need to hear one person saying the f*** word over and over and over. The violence was a over the top as well. I enjoy a good violent movie but this was extreme and became a turn off. I have enjoyed most, but not all of Stallone's movies, this is one I would say 'Pass.' Stallone directed this movie and I believe it shows that he is about finished with making good movies. My advice: Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Rambo!!","review":"This extended cut is awesome, adding more depth and character than the theatrical version.

Emit wrote strong songs that would make any fan of Badfinger, The Beatles or Big Star smile.Discovering Emitt long after he faded into a footnote made me a bit angry. Emitt should have been as big as any pop star on this planet, but it was not to be.Speaking of the compasion I am not supposed to speak about: even ole Emitt must ahve embraced it as he has recorded Macca's \\"Woman Oh Why\\" on a recent (2001) McCartney tribute album.C'mon Emitt, it is NEVER too late - get back wehre you started and give the world more gleaming pop gems!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyman's Wine Reference Book","review":"I recently purchased (from Amazon) The Glory of Wine, by Gloria Bley Miller.

A love that allows them to leave their pasts behind and live with hope for the future -- where I believe their love and shared sensual pleasures will go on long past where the story ends.

I am eagerly awaiting Ms. Schone's next novel. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"I loved THE LADY'S TUTOR. Not this one though. Lots of sex--some that I could not quite picture, some that I'd wished that I couldn't. It was boring after a bit. And a little too dark. I never cared about the characters nor did I understand how or why they loved each other. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book for the plot.","review":"I don't know why this book has been rated so highly. While I agree that the book is somewhat titillating, the writing style is AWFUL!The author keeps repeating lines over and over again for shock value or whatever reason but this starts to irritate.There is just a sense of the whole story being written just for sex and if that is what the reader is looking for then just scan through the book for the sex parts. The plot is flimsy, the characters one-dimensional, the villain so evil that it's unrealistic and the dialogue silly. Buy a used copy instead (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Overpriced","review":"Compared to The Lady's Tutor (which I LOVED), this story has no depth. I'm all for pushing the boundaries in fiction, but there just wasn't enough of an emotional connection between the H/H to make me believe they had fallen in love by the end of the story. I will definitely try Robin's next book, because I was so impressed by TLT, but I may wait to get it at the used book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST CHANCE AT LOVE","review":"THE LOVER first gets one's attention with its vivid red cover, which promises sensual delights and it doesn't fail in that light. The book is the story of a proper \\"past-her-prime\\" English spinster, Anne Aimes, who seeks to achieve one month of sexual fulfillment before accepting the finality of her spinsterhood. This fulfillment will be accomplished by the hiring of a legendary \\"gentleman-of-the-evening\\", Michel des Agnes or Michael of the Angels. Her request and his acceptance lead them on a journey of the anticipated eroticism, where the author is excellent in her intense descriptions. However, this story is complicated by Michel's very secret and very dark past, which centers around a phantom figure called the man. That past also includes murder and sexual deviation. This is a good read, but not for the faint at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story of love and redemption","review":"This is the type of book that either really moves you or it REALLY doesn't. It really moved me! That two such wounded and lonely people as Michael and Anne should find each other was extraordinary. And Gabriel! Oh MY! I certainly hope he gets his story told soon. These people were rejected, used, and damaged and yet still wanted to believe in compassion (and passion), redemption and love. The sex and the abuse are very explicit, and certainly not for everyone. However, if you are looking for a deeper level of love, sex, evil, and redemption, this story is a marvel. This book tests the boundaries of love and suffering and yet leaves you with a feeling of joy. AMAZING! KCS"},{"rating":"2","title":"holy smokes!","review":"i don't read this type of book. however, a girlfriend convinced me that i should take the time to get through this one. wow...she was right! i fell in love with the characters. the sex was hotter than hell and you could sure tell it was written by a woman. men out there...you need to read the sex scenes. this is not only a great story, it's a perfect \\"how-to\\" book. got me? if you read it, you will!i'm dying to get another book by this author...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped.","review":"This is not MY LADY'S TUTOR. It doesn't have nearly the polish or stylishness I adored about MLT. It doesn't have much of anything, and I found the tale of what Michael endured as a child gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"Wow, sums it up in one word. half romance half horror novel, it might've worked if the writer mixed them equally. the 1st half of the book is smokin' hot, full of sex. The 2nd half is puzzling and quickly deteriorates into a stephen king novel - not the best setting for a romance. I don't want to spoil the whole plot for people who haven't read the book: But If you knew a crazed stalker was following you and would bodily harm you & whoever you were with, wouldn't you limit contact with others or at least warn your lover????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped","review":"After devouring The Lady's Tutor in one sitting, I just couldn't find a way to care enough about The Lover: Not its characters, their relationship, nor the cause of Michael's dire rumblings about his past. I was so exasperated that I didn't finish the book. Sure the sex is hot, but that's not enough to sustain a book. Go to any porn shop bookshelf for proof of that.I, too, tire of the man as sexual teacher and the virgin heroine. At least The Lady's Tutor didn't resort to the latter. The Romance genre desperately needs some new ideas, some writers who will push the envelope. The Lady's Tutor was a book that did that; The Lover did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"My erotic first taste of Robin Schone","review":"This is the first book I have read by Robin Schone. I guarantee I will read her others. The subject matter and characters were rather dark but I still could not put the book down. I was captivated by the two title characters and felt strong emotions as I read about them. The sexual interludes were erotic and in some cases enlightening. In criticism I would say that I hope I never have as many people around me that would tend toward betrayal as these two title characters did and I would have liked a more definitive end (one that would let me know about our lovers life together after the book) -- it just stopped and left me wishing for a little more. I will definitely search out other Schone books - I think she is destined to be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"It =is= a love story","review":"I loved the book, even though I'm not always comfortable with such detailed lust scenes. There's always a small part of my imagination that's going \\"Do people really do that, and why would they want to?\\" I thought the love story was very well developed in Michael's enchantment with Anne and her concern for his pleasure and welfare. They cared about each other--for more than just great sex. I'm looking forward to Gabriel's story, and I hope Anne and Michael are in it as secondary characters. All three of them deserve to have \\"happily ever after\\" endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I loved this book it was a page turner it kept me interested and i did not want to put it down a good romance novel i would recommend to read on the beach"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinfully Satisfied...","review":"At first, the book started to get irritating when phrases were repeated in almost every chapter, however, it all made sense when it came to the end. The sex scenes were really good ^.^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly Awful","review":"I love Thea Divine, Susan Johnson and other writers so I took a chance and bought 2 books by this author-big mistake. The couple meets has sex, sex, I never thought I would say it but the sex is awful and the story is awful. It doesn't sound exciting for them or the reader. Stick with Thea Devine and Susan Johnson and avoid this writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a favor and skip this one.","review":"Ms. Schone no doubt has her fans, but I am not one of them. She seems to be fascinated with the dark, seamy, ugly side of life. I found the book extremely depressing. Her sex scenes could not even warm me to the story and I love erotica written by women with strong characters. I read romances for the feel good escape, neither of which I got with this book. I also had ordered another of her books and I didn't even bother reading it. Read a Susan Johnson book or Nicole Jordan and save your money. They are steamy and sexy and know what true romance is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat - this book even makes sex boring","review":"Unbelievably flat characters and dialogue - I kept reading hoping it would get better - but the contrived situations and stilted prose never ended. Wow - a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My gosh, are women this desperate for erotica???","review":"I mistakenly bought 4 of Robin Schone's novels. I should know enough by now to try one first to see if I like it. Robin Schone is in my opinion, the worst writer I have ever read. I understand fantasy, but to use a male prostitute as a hero??? Reality just hits me in the face here. I worked in San Francisco around real male prostitutes and let me tell you it is not a romantic or sexy picture. As for the 30 something spinster as heroine, I just hate it. Why can't a writer use experienced female characters. Most of us have had sex. Why have the male characters had 100's of sex partners, but the women none? These novels are just sad and not at all erotic for me. Can't anyone just write a really good romance novel with realistic explicit sex scenes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you buy this book if there are no sex scenes?","review":"I only have one question to ask. If there is no hot sex in this book would you still buy it? Will you still rate it 5 stars? I for one think that all the star ratings is for the sex scenes. Please be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanting more","review":"I enjoyed this story very much and now can't wait to get my hands on some of her other books. This one even helped me brush up on some of my French."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice doorstop and little else","review":"God, this was bad. It was pretentious, serious, and dull. The author likes one-sentence paragraphs, and her characters are melodramtic and serious and tedious. She has a really annoying habit of italicizing significant things, but she does it every twentieth sentence or so, so you keep getting pulled up short by something that isn't really that dramatic getting the dramatic treatment. The characters are superficially different but that's only on the surface: the guy is still a stud----so much so that the author feels compelled to, um, confide the dimensions of his endowment, and I'm not talking about his trust fund---while the heroine is just blah. After a few chapters, the seriousness and the pretense just got to me, but I should have given up, frankly, when the writer breathlessly confided that bit about the guy's, er, moneymaker, I guess you could call it, and did it in italics. It was painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the romantic at heart","review":"I was first introduce to Ms Schone by her short story in Captivated and was interested in her work. This is my second foray into her style of writing and while it was interesting, I would not call it romantic. Erotic horror (or mild porn) is more like it.I found the storyline was extremely confusing at times with all the dark undertones. As well, trying to figure out who the Man was gave me a headache.I am not sure if I will read anymore of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to reading THE LOVER, but I didn't think the book lived up to its promise. Robin Schone is a fine writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed The Lady's Tutor and her short story in Captivated, but this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was darker and more gothic than I expected. Maybe the abuse of the hero turned me off. Maybe I didn't feel drawn in to the relationship of Anne and Michel. I was looking forward to the next erotic anthology from Kensington in the fall. But now I'm not so sure..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Erotic Read","review":"This book has hot sex scenes and shows the darker side of people and life. Very interesting, I also recommend Gabriel's Woman & The Lady's Tutor. Looking forward to Mrs. Schone's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"I read two of Schone's previous works, Awaken My Love and The Lady's Tutor, and really enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to this book. I could barely finish it. It's dark, gloomy, and negative, and the writing style is cold and choppy. The characters were not likeable, and the sex was not interesting. I read for enjoyment and passion, not to be depressed. This book went into the trash when I was done. Too bad. She started out writing good books, but I won't read another one of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worms?","review":"Other things as well made this very unsavory. Tasteless. No romance. Just sex. And those annoying fingers again. Is the author fixated on finger-play? Same old plot again too. And full of these. Annoying. Short. Sentences that aren't sentences.Terrible. I'd rank it lower if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull! dull! dull!","review":"The story line in the lover is like a negligee, wispy andbarely there. The dialogue is entirely centered on intimate activity,and it's almost as though the characters do not exist above the waist. The Lover is a derivative of The Lady's Tutor and A Lady's Pleasure, with nothing really new or different added to it. Worse yet, The Lover drove home the point that Susan Johnson is one of the few writers who can open a novel with a sexy scene and then capture and hold the reader's interest throughout. Why is this so? Susan Johnson actually dares to provide a substantial story.It's been three days since I've had this book; I'm barely half-way through and can't find a good reason to finish -- apart from the fact I spent my money unwisely. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"After being deeply touched by Ms. Schones previous stories, I eagerly anticipated her newest. I am still wondering what \\"The Lover\\" was about, other than gratuitous sex scenes (and not very stimulating ones at that). \\"The Lady's Tutor\\" involved characters who suffered serious emotional traumas and overcame the difficulties to find a wonderous love. It was the most sensual novel I have ever read. In \\"The Lover\\" the characters seem unable or unwilling to make the effort to rise above their problems and almost seem content to wallow in their misery. I know that Ms. Schone has enormous talent and I hope her next effort is a story that makes the reader wish the book wasn't ending as she has done in her earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porno meets Silence of the Lambs???","review":"Too dark for me, barely kept my interest, felt extremely creepy while reading it...forced myself to finish it.

This beautiful montage of inspirational pictures testifies to the diverse concerns, perspectives, strategies and dreams of an international movement for peace and global justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Impressions","review":"There are first impressions (we get only one chance at those) and lasting impressions. This book gives the reader both in case the reader missed the worldwide outpouring of anti-war sentiments and protests prior to the Iraq War. At quick glance, the reader can flip through the pages, getting a glimpse of how the world felt that day...yet on closer look, the reader can also read some poignant commentary that should leave a lasting impression. All in all, having witnessed that incredible day in history and documented it, I enjoyed reliving the vastness of that world protest, seeing people of all stripes in a show of peaceful solidarity. This is not meant to be a heavy tome about war and peace, but a way of gaining an impression or two about one day that will go down in history as the greatest outcry against war."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the nastiest \\"aroma\\" I have ever smell! :(","review":"The moment I took the cellophane off the box, the strong, highly unpleasant smell \\"attacked\\" my nose and throat!

Color plates are nice but far from thorough. Those looking for detailed regimental uniform histories will be disappointed - this is an overview and gives you the flavor of the era not the specifics. That being said it is interesting and a fascinating basic look at the period. The drawings for my taste fall below the typical Osprey standard but are adequate.

Santillo has no hidden agenda and packs a ton of well-written and reader-friendly introductory material into this smallish book. (That's quite a compliment considering how overwhelmingly complex this subject is.)The Enzyme Diet Solution is my 3rd foray into the world of enzymes. Though the enzyme section is OK, the other two books were much better. (The 2nd one is Enzymes: The Fountain of Life by K.

It has a couple of features that are nice. The rubber feet are great for damping down noise and saving the floor, and the multiple doors are great for reaching in from the top, etc. But I've stopped using it because it's so flimsy. The rounded corners are part of the front and back panels, and don't line up with the sides at all. On my crate, which is 25 inches high, there's just a single hook in the middle holding the side to the front, and there are 1 inch gaps at the top and bottom. Also, the back, which is designed to fold into the crate for storage, has such a shallow catch at the top that it actually fell into the crate onto the puppy a couple of times.This could be a nice crate if all the pieces fit together better, and had much better joins between the pieces, but as it is, I think it's dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!","review":"I have this product for my dog, it appeared sturdy however my husky easily bent the wire in multiple places, was able to undo the latch and was found with her head squished between open joints, This product was not well welded or assembled.

In comparison the Midwest doesn't look as nice and seems to be similarly strong. One advantage of the Midwest is that it has a door at each end that open up in different directions and a side door so there is more flexibility in placement. Either crate is very well made and you can see it if you compare them to \\"value\\" crates that use thin wire spaced further apart.

Gone are the fast licks as I can see that his right hand is trembling and he is seated throughout the performance. Gone also are the growling voice.Nonetheless, this is a must for any Winter's fan collection. Just ask yourself, are you able to play at 90yrs old? Even Stevie Nicks can't reach the high notes anymore!2 stars is not for DVD production but rather that those who expect a grand performance will be disappointed.I'm still happy to see him perform.The bonus interview material also include a 3min jams with the harp player(also very cool!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Time Cannot be Ignored","review":"It was difficult at times to watch and sadly, even more difficult to listen too ...

It is a shame that there are no DVD recordings available from his younger years, when he was in his prime.

It is very difficult to talk about Mercury since this planet rules your ability to talk in the first place and yet the yearly activities of Mercury are extremely important to a smooth running routine in life. Francis manages to demystify the subject and to provide helpful, comprehensive tactics to get the best out of Mercury's mercurial behavior! The book is easy to read, attractively printed and a great edition to a growing library of books on your favorite subject, astrology.

However, it showed the Nazi image that was so powerful a force in Germany. The author, a Hitler youth, and believer in the salvation of Hitler for the father land. The schools attended demanding the loyalty, the emptiness of mind, the willingness to conform to the German Military Nazi organizations. The Nazi staunch teachings are evident in this book no matter how the author tried, it still showed in his belief,actions,and his lack of not showing France as an Occupied country, not a defeated one.

Our favorite cast of characters has returned... along with a few new ones, who help provide a deeper insight into what it means to be a Longknife. Kris finds out much more about this for herself...The author's skill continues to progress and this story is much better in terms of the amount of skill. I am however dissatisfied with the author's obsession with mutiny. In at least 2 of the now 3 books in this series the main character commits mutiny and the other book isn't far behind! While I did enjoy this book more than the previous 2, my note to the author is fine a new plot element.I'm sure you space opera fans will enjoy this tail as well... so pick up a copy... In my opinion the series along with the author are getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris Longknife continues to grow!","review":"In this third volume of Longknife adventures, Mr. Shepherd' characters continued to grown and add aspects to their characters that make for an excellent read.

I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys good science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly exciting","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, the cover looked cool, and I wish I hadn't. This book was my first, and last, foray into the Kris LongKnife novels. The only character development in the book consisted of everyone telling LongKnife what a great person she was. That got real old after the 57th time that somebody brought up the \\"great\\" Longknife tradition. The space battles were entertaining, but seemed to drag in parts. The rest of the book was a bewildering collection of contrived scenes. If you're looking for a great sci-fi series to get into, check out David Weber's Honor Harrington series. Its everything that Mike Shepard is trying to mold the Kris Longknife novels into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I already read this?","review":"Too much of the same thing.

A few scenes are funny, like when Martin starts dancing to elevator music, and when a crazed sniper is forced to stop pursuing Martin because he won't disobey a \\"Carnival Personnel Only\\" sign.

Seriously awesome.Bad parts: Pretty much everything else. Silly and surreal, yes, but funny, no. Moronic and embarrassing, and clearly a vehicle intended to show Steve Martin at his most frenetic.

Why hasnt this film been cleaned up and at least out out on a widescreen format? Their is no excuse for this. They are by far the biggest and the worse dvd distributor in the market. They continually release dvd after dvd with framing errors-no digital transfers-no extra features---grainy dirty negatives without any concern about preserving these films. Its pathetic.To add to all of this they will release these films then pull them over and over again how many more re-releases of one film can you produce?Why? your not adding anything but new crappy artwork for the cover.Whens the last time the original cut of the Blues Brothers has seen the day of light??Now The Jerk is also among your lame releases.

Simply put UNIVERSAL SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking special purpose","review":"I hadn't seen The Jerk in at least ten years and was really looking forward to revisiting this movie. I wasn't concerned about commentary or other extras, but I was seriously disappointed when Navin starts excitedly shouting about discovering his \\"special purpose\\" and I realized that the memorable scene where his adopted father tells him for the first time about his \\"special purpose\\" is NOT INCLUDED.While other deleted scenes and dialogue simply robbed purchasers of this video of laughs, the deletion of this key scene actually robs the movie of sense. Why was it removed? Glad I only paid $5.99 for this because I ended up donating it to Goodwill.

But it was highly recommended, and the boyfriend wanted to watch it, so I acquiesced.I'm a believer now, completely. There were so many great scenes. Bernadette Peters was absolutely wonderful. The plot was so silly and unbelievable that it made perfect sense in a bizarre sort of way.There was physical humor (knife throwing, motorcycle riding in carnivals, etc) and subtle humor (he's hitching a ride in the back of a pickup truck while the stray dog he's adopted rides in the front seat) and it's all delivered in a great style.I didn't see the original movie, so I can't comment on how the DVD is compared to it.

However, one of the extras provided is worth the price of admission, \\"Tonight You Belong to Me\\" sung by Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, is excellent. It's nice they made it an extra so you can find it easily.Martin is his usual funny self. Sing along with \\"I'm Picking Out a Thermos for You.\\"Peters is absolutely gorgeous.

The movie was made way back in 79' and after watching it I realized it had influenced many movies, such as Adam Sandler's Billy Madison.

Why does this DVD stink, then? It's full-screen only...NO WIDESCREEN! This is blatant cheapness, laziness, and disregard on behalf of the DVD company, since many of their other '70s comedy classics (\\"Slap Shot,\\" \\"Animal House\\") have been packaged properly with both full-screen and widescreen options. There's just no excuse. It would've been nicer to see Navin and his \\"Special Purpose\\" without the sides of the film cut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Full Screen\\" means HALF SCREEN","review":"Full-screen means you lose about 50% of the picture (and still pay full price). It's one of the greatest and funniest movies ever made but I will not allow myself to be ripped off by paying for the 'full screen' edition. The stars are for the movie. The three missing ones are all because of the way it is presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The New Phone Book Is Here!!, The New Phone Books Is Here!\\"","review":"This 1979 debut for Steve Martin is one of comedy's greatest classics. This film definitley opened the door for people like Jim Carrey and all those types of comedies. This one will forever be the granddaddy of them all. Steve plays Navin Johnson, a white man who was brought up by a backwoods family who are black. Navin realizes he's not and sets out on his own to find his own life. It's one misadventure after the next. It's also one hilarious joke after another. Along the way he meets and falls in love with Bernadette Peters. There are also appearences by Carl Reiner, Jackie Mason, and M. Emmett Walsh. The movie is so slapsticky silly that it's hilarious fun to watch from beginning to end. I won't say what happens to our good old friend Navin. You'll have to see for yourself. If only the brilliant Steve Martin would return to this type of comedy. This film is pure comedy gold sent from comedy heaven. A definite must!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this DVD for my sister as a birthday gift after reading all the great reviews about it, and felt horribly ashamed of getting it after watching the DVD when she got it. My sister is a huge Steve Martin fan and found the movie barely funny after the first couple of scenes...If you're looking for a great Steve Martin movie, \\"My Blue Heaven\\", \\"Parenthood\\", or \\"The Three Amigos\\" are MUCH better choices!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is dumb, Dumb, DUMB!","review":"When I was a teenager in the late 70s, I liked this movie because it was considered cool at the time and it was before I was at the age where I developed tastes of my own.I saw the DVD last night and I had to really wonder what was wrong with me back in 1979. This movie is Dumb Dumb DUMB! Steve Martin's character marks the difference between what is funny and what is STUPID-this is the latter. F'rinstance, our man accepts a ride that is only going to the opposite side of the fence where he is hitchhiking. When Bill Macy (who us 70s kids remember as \\"Walter\\" from \\"Maude,\\")'s glasses keep dropping off, he says \\"Damn these glasses!\\" to which Steve dutifully replies, \\"OK, I DAMN THEE!\\" Then when a maniac starts shooting at Steve and hits these oil cans nearby, our man shouts-\\"HE HATES THESE CANS!\\"Are you rolling on the floor yet from these descriptions? Sound hilarious? See it, if your stomach is strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kids","review":"I thought I was buying the original funny movie I saw in the late 70's, but I was shocked and disappointed at the bad language and suggestive scenes that weren't part of the movie I knew and loved. I turned it off and threw it in the trash. I'm just glad my kids weren't in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sporadically Hilarious Steve Martin Comedy Vehicle!","review":"This terribly uneven comedy has it's moments but is basically feels like a 90 min. sketch from his old SNL days. Filled with a lot of low-brow humor and crude jokes, has some very funny moments, but after a while it gets tiresome. But don't get me wrong, it's one of the funniest films ever. You will like it even more if you're a Steve Martin fan. Steve Martin has never been funnier as Navin R. Johnson, who was 'born a poor black child', the typical rags-to-riches story follows and Martin meets the perfect girl, but every episode is filled with so many gags that we forget the story and just accept the premise for all the upcoming jokes. Very raunchy and sometimes the humor seems forced, but few movies are this continuously funny. A funny time if you're willing to accept the premise. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An oldie not a goodie","review":"Personally, I hated the movie. Yes, it was funny-ish, but the humor was almost exclusively at the expense of the cleanliness of the plot. In short, it was a dirty movie. The plot, in which a young abandoned Steve Martin is raised by a stereotyped Negro family in the deep South, leaves home, makes millions on an accidental \\"invention,\\" is sued, loses everything and then is picked up by his family and goes back to where he was, is weak at best. Anyway, I would not recommend this and I will never watch it again. It was, very simply, plain stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic late 20th century comedy","review":"The Jerk is still a classic late 20th century comedy showcasing Steve Martin's true comedic genius.

Nothing was new...and the recipes, although touted as easy could be a litle cumbersome, and the recipes couldn't consitute an overall program. So I was left trying to figure out what the book was trying to do, or was it trying to do too many things. Was it trying to be a synopsis of a bunch of Ladies'Home Journal articles on losing weight? And although the author states that good eating = no dieting, nutrition is not really that simplistic. Even in his own case, although he alleges he is a triathlete, he doesn't even figure in that that type of extreme competition might have a little to do with staying in shape...it was just all eating right = no dieting. A wrong message to be sending too many people. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"More nutrition eating the pages","review":"I saw the book in the discount bin at the book store and I thought the title was cute. I thought, well, the guy gotta eat so that's why he wrote a book so he could sell something to dopes and have enough money to eat...that should have been the whole title. The book was awful. The recipes were unappetizing, and the nutrition doubtful. It would have been nice if the author, and I use that term loosely, just like the stools some of the recipes induced, if the author had given us the nutrition content of the paper it was written on...surely it is better for you than any advice they tried to put on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy, practical guide","review":"I know first-hand the validity of the author's premise. I AM the friend mentioned on page 27 of the introduction. I ate lunch with Russ a few years ago, complaining about the difficulty of losing 10 pounds, all the while eating a plate of french fries. Russ' advice after that - and further explained in the book - turned out to be sound, practical and easy to understand and utilize! It is a great book for any guy who doesn't want to \\"diet,\\" but just wants eat healthily and , just as importantly, realistically!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gay's Gotta Get Better Advice","review":"I read the review in the Chicago Free Press and got the book...I can see where one reviewer said that the positive press has probably been the result of the author's own public relations company. But there was not one shred of information in this book that we all haven't read a thousand times, unless someone just doesn't read at all! Nothing new. Other than maybe that you can be a little sloppier with what you're cooking. But a spoonful versus a teaspoon is really that different for someone to figure out? I think the author is trying to take the community to the collective cleaners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved from the Deli!","review":"This is the first book I've ever seen that really understands guys and how we feed.I've defaulted to fast food and the deli for years simply because the whole grocery and cooking process was just too big of a hassle to figure out. I'm a smart guy, but I don't want to be a chef or spend time trying to learn what I \\"should\\" buy. All I want is something to eat!Klettke really nails it. Finally a no-brainer, easy book that takes \\"gotta start eating better\\" off my list of things I'm supposed to do.Ever more surprising -- I actually enjoy going to the store and making meals, because for the first time in my life I feel like I know what I'm doing.Thanks, Russ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One plate of french fries away from being slender!","review":"I guess I should have read the reviews before I purchased this bomb. One reviewer said that he made one meal in a fry pan and he's on the road to eating right. Another said that he discovered the secret directly from the author over a whole plate of french fries. Another said that she purchased it for the fatties in her life but didn't give any results. Maybe this book really is for people that don't know that a whole plate of fries isn't the best way to lose those extra ten pounds. Thank god I bought the book used, obviously from someone else that didn't think it was worth keeping. Anybody want to buy mine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful","review":"The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you. I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many \\"meals in 30 minutes\\" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly. Really quite silly. I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you. It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally. Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Here's what this book never explained: if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want. So why do you need this book? You don't. Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't. If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven. The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine. The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines. There was NOTHING in this book new. This was a major league disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on","review":"I read the book, came to this site to write a review, and was flabbergasted by the people that wrote positive reviews. Had they never encountered dietary information before? Was this their first knowledge of how food is processed in the body, and what foods one should eat? Even if that were the case, there are still better guides available. I found this book to be a cheap attempt to earn a little money at the expense of people wanting serious nutritional information. Maybe the positive reviews really were written by friends or by the author's own public relations firm...which advocates napping...induced by reading his own book no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude Food","review":"No, that's not the title of my review...that's another of the books in this genre...and a little catchier...I found it when I was looking for a Guy's Gotta Eat. Others included A Man, A Can and A Plan. Another was Can Opener Gourmet. Another was Help My Apartment Has a Kitchen! Even cuter titles, but all say basically the same thing. Different words, no new information. I'm guessing that since this book is Amazon's rank 37,585 or something like that that only these reviewers have actually read the book...and maybe not even those have read it. I'm thinking like one of the reviewers that said all the good reviews were written by the author's own Public Relations company. I don't guess they would give him bad press, would they?Anyway, I did read it, and I don't think there is anything new. And what was presented was done in a way that A Guy's Gotta Be An Idiot! Surely the American male is not this dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"I been SUPERSIZED with a load of bull","review":"After reading this book make me wonder if the two what wrote this book really be athletes or if they stay running one step ahead of the law. Sister give me this book cause she know I like to eat. And I do exercise. But this book stank so bad if you hold it next to the food you eating, you lose your appetite, and maybe your meal before that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe one of the worst","review":"There are so many other books about diet and exercise that are better than this one. It makes one wonder how it ever got published in the first place...maybe the catch title, I don't know. I liked what one reviewer said...if you're a gym bunny, you can pretty much eat anything you want and stay slim. Eating healthy is all about being simple...just look at any of the popular diet/exercise books. Broiling or boiling is all pretty simple, and unless you choose to make a complicated dish, most food that you cook in your house is certainly easy enough to do. The last reviewer talks about making the book a gift...actually several have. Diets and exercise are personal goals, not goals that are ascribed to someone through a gift. I think there is an infinite array of books out there that better suit a nutrition program than this dog of a book. Lastly, I would have to say that there was not enough variety in the food part to sustain a program over an extended period."},{"rating":"1","title":"If we lost any weight at all it was because of the laughter","review":"So four of us bought this at the office and we were all going to try it together. Like I said, if we lost any weight at all it was because this farce was trying to take itself seriously. I admit that I do most of my eating out, but I do know how to cook and even as a dilettante in the kitchen, I know that you have to be generally precise with some of the ingredients unless you're going to ruin the dish. Is it that hard to follow a recipe for what you like? Not if you're going to cook anyway. I feel like reading some of these reviews that I've been to a self-help forum where everyone walked out with the power except me. Then I noticed that most of the positive reviews were from Chicago, and I figured my group had just been tricked by the author's friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"'PLEASE STAY' IS A GREAT LATIN-INFLUENCED SONG....","review":"it's a shame it only made number 10 in the UK Charts as it is a nice feel-good pop song with a latin influence...it deserves better....she should also release 'your disco needs you','So now goodbye', and 'Under the influence' from the album...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst from Light Years","review":"Its any wonder or anyone's guess why this was chosen as the last single from LIGHT YEARS, Kylie's 2000 Disco influenced album. This track is weak, its hard to tell if its the production, lyrics, vocals, or instruments but this song is just plain bad, on an otherwise seamless set of songs on LIGHT YEARS. The remixes only worsen this song, which was a lost cause from the beginning. There was so much better choices for singles from LIGHT YEARS, \\"Disco Down\\", \\"So Now Goodbye\\", \\"Light Years\\", \\"Butterfly\\", etc so its curious why this latin influenced track was selected. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"please go...","review":"Ok so PLEASE STAY may not have been the best choice for a single. Get this cd if only for the video extra.

I tried moving the batteries around, and I even got another 3 brand new batteries out of the package just to be positive it wasn't the batteries problem, and still nothing.

It isn't long before dead bodies start turning up all around her, but is she truly becoming a bloodthirsty beast, or is it all in her head? Rino di Silvestro takes a brilliant concept and drags it through the 1970's Eurotrash gutter. The plot consistently falls secondary to the heightened sexuality at every point throughout the film. There are moments where the twist on the lycanthropic theme does shine through, however. The wolf resembles all of the primal urges that Daniela has been trying to repress, which manifest themselves as violence and rage when she becomes aroused. Unfortunately, WEREWOLF WOMAN is poorly acting and overly dramatic, and what is worse is that every attempt at eroticism is spoiled by Annik Borel's old, sagging body and complete lack of sex appeal. Outside of a few gory moments and plenty of nudity, there is very little to watch for here.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A WEREWOLF MOVIE","review":"The only interesting thing about this movie is that the DVD jacket is reversible. I had never seen that before. This only means is that you can have two different covers of a bad movie.This movie is about a delusional woman who thinks she's a werewolf. There is one dream-like scene at the beginning where she transforms into a...a...a really shoddy looking werewolf. After that nothing but a psychological case study. I gotta tell you I fell asleep shortly after the beginning and woke to an incesant hammering. In that half awake state I couldn't get the hammering out of my head. I thought I was going insane. I woke and knew the hammering was in the movie, but that I my sanity was still in question because there was still 20 minutes left."},{"rating":"1","title":"werewolf woman... no it is a insane woman....","review":"It talks about the werewolf, but there is only one scene, which a woman became a wolf at the beginning of the film. I thought that this film is the werewolf movie when I saw the title of this film, but there is no werewolf woman. There is only insane woman who kills people ridiculously. The woman kills people because her ancestor, who was a werewolf, appears and manipulates her to kill people. In addition, she has a memory that she was raped when she was young. After that, she has a terror about the male and also has a disgusting feeling about sex. So, she kills people when they have sex or they are related to sexual actions. The scenes of murder are crude, and bombastic performance as well. I think that this film is trying to explain the poor insane woman why she killed people. However, it is not convincing. On the contrary, it goes to the crudeness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One song extended with terrible singing","review":"This ain't pretty and shouldn't even be bought by anybody. If you hear Bob Mould's singing through all the guitar noise you wouldn't be surprised - it doesn't sound good and sounds so laboured and forced. The guitars are good for 1 track but when there's little variation in them there's not a lot else you can admire in them. I tried New Day Rising as well and Mould's voice still sounds so forced. Avoid although if you are determined to buy something of this nature I'd suggest Sonic Youth's Confusion is Sex/Kill Yr Idols - it has a bit more bite to it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it 4.5 stars, actually....","review":"This album combines Husker Du's debut single (Statues), their single In a Free Land, and their mini-album Everything Falls Apart, all of which were released in the early 1980's on their own Reflex Records label. This is RAW, savage, and hardcore Husker Du. While there is a lot of filler (that's still fun to listen to), there is some really cool stuff on here. From the Gut, Blah Blah Blah, Bricklayer, Let's Go Die, Target, and Gravity are all great punk songs. They do a demented and enjoyable cover of Donovan's \\"Sunshine Superman\\", and the songs In a Free Land and Everything Falls Apart hint at what was to come. Statues is a LONG single at 9 minutes, and gets sort of grating at the end, but is still a great listen and a fascinating document. Even at this early stage, Husker Du was pushing the envelope. While not essential for the casual fan, for the true fan, this makes great listening and is a slice of Husker history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible meddling publishers!","review":"Suck, suck suck! I was so disappointed to discover (as other reviewers have mentioned) that the publishers of this edition have seen fit to \\"correct\\" this book by replacing all the names of the original children. What a load of pc nonsense. Personally I can't stand to read this edition-not even to my kids. Like others I will look out for another (older) version. This edition should come with a \\"Warning:You will be disappointed if you loved this book as a child\\" label.What a pity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"While I accept Angry Tree Dweller's ire about the 'updating' of the new versions of the Enid Blyton books, I am pleased to say that it hasn't spoiled my daughter's enjoyment of the stories (although must say that the transformation of Dame Slap to Dame Snap kind of destroyed the plot a bit!). I read these books over and over as a child. My daughter is a much more reluctant reader than I was but has still been inspired to try and read this book on her own after I read it aloud to her which is a real testament to its appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new publications of this book are disgraceful","review":"I agree completely with \\"Angry Tree Dweller\\" who articulated my fury perfectly. I too will continue to search the second-hand bookshops for this favourite from my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Faraway Tree is Terrific!","review":"I remembered reading this book and it's companions when I was a child with my British Granny, so I purchased it to use as a read-aloud in my first grade classroom. My class LOVED it from the first page, and many requested the title and author so that they can read it at home too. Unlike many of the other popular children's titles available to the children in my class, this book is rich, full or detail and very wholesome while still being appealing. Your child will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Que baila!!","review":"This is the most fun cd I have purchased in awhile. It's impossible to sit down while this is playing!! Every track is great!

The EP's production is also the slickest of all their releases, which is good or bad depending on your opinion. The lyrical content, though, while still maintaining the occasional sense of humor, is a little bit weak and uninspired this time around (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), but not so much that it ruins the album. A couple highlits of the album are \\"The Unbearable Burden of Always Being Right\\" and \\"Weighted and Weighted Down\\" - which is a superior re-recording of an old favorite. Overall, this EP is one of Drowningman's strongest releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for a healthy Christian marriage","review":"I highly recommend this book. It has solid Biblical truths about marriage and how to create the \\"oneness\\" that God intended it to be. Reading this book together has opened up communication between me and my husband. It has made both of see our short-comings and strong points in our relationship and gives the the tools to balance it all out.I would also recommend P.B. Wilson's other books \\"Liberated Through Submission\\" and \\"7 Secrets Women Want To Know\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Marriage!","review":"I read this really expecting a blessing but didn't feel blessed at all. This couple fought so often and said so many horrible things to each other that I couldn't believe it.Their self-centerdness and explosive anger was amazing.I felt more depressed by the book than uplifted.They had no constructive advice only superficial junk.I honestly find it hard to believe that they are happy today though they say they are.Two books I can highly reccomend for wives are \\"Finding the hero in your husband\\" and \\"The politically incorrect wife\\" They are both much more enlightening and helpful than the above book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly accurate","review":"Sorry to disagree with the majority of reviewers, but the historic accuracy of this production is very poor. The plot includes \\"facts\\" from Barnum's life that were created by one of Barnum's lifetime enemies. Read Arthur Saxon's \\"P. T. Barnum: The Legend and the Man\\" if you want to know what Barnum was really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD ... stupid cover typo!","review":"If you love A&E;'s Barnum special on video, this is it on DVD. Completely perfect and always a joy to watch.Please be aware that - as another reviewer has pointed out - there's a typo on the DVD cover. It's not 94 minutes, there's 3 hours here. Both parts are on the DVD, as Amazon has described. They're not separated out on the DVD menu, but rest assured that Part 2 follows right after the credits for Part 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Building the Machine by Glenn Hughes","review":"Glenn Hughes is my favourite rock vocalist but I can't understand why he put out a funky soul album rather than heavy rock like \\"Addiction\\" and \\"Return of the Crystal Karma\\" I am very disappointed.

Mark gives us all a look at what not only the non-christians of this world go through in life, but also what even he himself, as a good Christian faces when he doesn't bow and follow the mainstream definition of those who twist the philosophy of Christ to fit their own needs and interpretations. Well done! Being a member of this so called \\"non-christian\\" group, I must say that this Christian, Mark Braun, has earned my respect, honor, friendship, and support by his very actions and examples in life! His acceptance of all in spite of our differences is what truly makes him worthy of the name Christian! If only everyone could be as good, loving, passionate, and pure hearted as him! Read the book, you might just be surprised! It's an eye opener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better every time.","review":"You can feel an author becoming confident and skilled. Krueger has produced a great book. The hero, torn by two cultures, searches for the nature of faith. Around him people fall short, losing or betraying their own faith and self-esteem. A real good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great installment in the series.","review":"I have been reading this series over a period of weeks and enjoyed the books to date. This installment puts Cork and his wife Jo at odds with the town people and the current sheriff. As usual, Krueger's prose is excellent. I have never visited this area of the country but his descriptions of landscapes and rural geography are compelling. More importantly his storylines are credible and well written. His characters have the depth of real people, not cartoon character super heroes. The story takes a sharp left turn with a surprise. This series shouldn't be missed if you like mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well paced, compelling and highly satisfying read","review":"Cork Corcoran, ex-sheriff of Aurora, Minnesota is searching for answers as to the death of Charlotte Kane, a young woman who disappeared several months before and whose body has turned up after the snow has melted. Cork wants to find the killer in order to exonerate his friend, Solemn Winter Moon. Complex interrelationships among the locals complicate the investigation. However, nobody is prepared for Solemn's claim that he has seen Christ in a vision or the miracles that soon follow.William Kent Krueger is one of perhaps a dozen American midlist authors who through his style of writing and creation of characters sets the standard for the rest of the genre. Kent is not capable of writing a bad book. Some may be better than others but the work will always have a high standard. This is of no exception. Well paced, compelling and a satisfying solution make this an all around highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cork does it again","review":"Excellent story, well written and totally entertaining. Many, many twists and turns.A young girl is found murdered and all evidence and suspicion points to her former boyfriend with a criminal past. Cork is not convinced that he is the murderer and delves deep into the investigation uncovering lots of hidden secrets and hidden identities. WIll keep you guessing from first page to last. A must read. Next to Boundary Waters, Krueger's best yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformational Book","review":"Having recently finished Mr. Catton's book, I find myself at once awed and humbled by the mind that conceived and communicated so well the vision of where humanity now stands and how we climbed out onto this wobbly precipice. I cannot say it any better than the other reviewers here - only can I add another voice saying that this is clearly, in many regards, one of the most important books I have ever read. Open your mind, read it carefully, and I suspect that, like me, you will see with new clarity what is happening before our eyes, circa 2008. The book is transformational; that it was written 26 years ago is even more astounding.

Since the only two people there were Leeroy and Keith, there wasn't too much talking going on, but Keith is less insane than I had thought. He goes out of his way to be crazy (on the back of the CD, the picture shows him flipping off the camera, and he looked like a bald lady for a while), but he actually sounds pretty intelligent here. The only bad things about this CD are that the audio breaks up in a few spots, they are near train tracks, and there are only two band members.

The chapter on \\"Soapmaking Online\\" is hilariously out of date.Way too much of the content is based on the author's biases and world-view. It's hard to sort fact from opinion and trust any of her pronouncements.Some of the recipes have a lot of ingredients.

The author relies too heavily on grapefruit seed extract to preserve her soaps; GSE runs about $75 a quart and isn't a true preservative! She also needlessly complicates the calculation on determining the quantitiy of lye for any given formula.

My copy of this book is worn and stained from many soapmaking sessions. Despite the drift of time and my accumulated knowledge, this is one book that I return to frequently for review of all that pertains to Soapmaking. One of the strong points of this book is that it gets you up and running making soap. The recipes work their way from the relatively simple Soap Essentials Bar comprised of a basic coconut/olive/palm oil mixture to more elaborate recipes such as transparent soap and soap in the round. While Susan Miller Cavitch notes that this book is not that much of a basic book, yet I believe that even if one has never made soap before, this is an excellent book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information but some drawbacks","review":"This book provides a wealth of information about the properties of the different oils and other ingredients. I did not try any of the recipes, preferring smaller batches to the ones she has.

The conductor López-Cobos succeeds in drawing the spirit and rythm of zarzuela from the fine Mozarteum Orchestra.

It contains their greatest singles: Never Can Say Goodbye, Don't Leave Me This Way, You Are My World, and Disenchanted. But, the best part is that it contains all of the B-sides to these singles that were released back in the day on vinyl. Commundards didn't release your standard Disco song with a bunch of remixes. They threw in some gems that were not Disco. Hence, a lot of those songs were part of Jimmy's political view and love for show tunes.

The reason why is only because the author went too far, describing body parts, the SERIOUS relationship with Patrick (excuse me, but kissing someone on the eyelids in a friend's pool at 14 is plain SICK!), and about boy-and-girl things that referred to as usually grownup relationships.So I only read half of the book because halfway through the book, Lester explained things to Alice about things that young people shouldn't know about yet.

I was saddened beyond belief that morning when my alarm clock woke me up to the sound \\"In other news, astronomer Carl Sagan has died.\\" I never expected to read anything more from him... then, a year and a half later, I found this book sitting in my bookstore. I picked it up, and was up until 3AM finishing it up. Carl Sagan makes you think, feel, and wonder. All I can say is, READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking issues for the 21st century","review":"\\"Billions and Billions\\" is another literary winner from Carl Sagan. He stresses the importance of such issues as global warming and the depletion of the ozone and he warns us all of the grave consequences in store for our planet if we do not take quick action. Sagan makes a good scientific debate of abortion and , as always, he is very careful not to offend anyone (although I'm sure that there are extremists on this issue who will be offended anyway). Because \\"Billions and Billions\\" is written using articles from magazines and newspapers, it has a somewhat choppy feel. But it is still good reading material. Many may not appreciate Sagan's loyal adherence to the scientific method. But, like it or not, everything that he says makes good sense. If you like this book, then you should read Sagan's \\"The Demon Haunted World\\" which is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that shows the effecs of Sagan's illness","review":"This book will dissapoint Sagan's fans. The mind of the master is worn and torn by his cancer and yields a bland discussion on an uncoordinated series of topics. In the first few pages, petending to be PC to those with little scientific background, he engages himself on trivial explanations of maths and physics - these will certainly be useful to primary-school students but not to those who have followed his writings.The highlight of the book is an extraordinary discussion on abortion and on the general pro-choice vs. pro-life arguments. Absolutely brillant, especially if you are pro-choice.New readers to Sagan would be better off by buying Shadows of Forgotten Ancerstors or Broca's Brains. Those who have read Sagan, may be better off by stopping at his second to last book, his masterpiece: The Demon Hauted World."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile","review":"I have read every Carl Sagan book except \\"Comet\\"--I keep forgetting to read \\"Comet\\". This is easily the worst. There are lapses in the prose style, and occassionally Mr. Sagan seems to be talking down to his audience or addressing adolescents--he was dying as he wrote it. But \\"Billions and Billions\\" is still very much worth your while to read. Goodbye, Mr. Sagan. I'll miss you.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"While I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Sagan , his work and the institution he represented, this book is a disappointment. These essays are ramblings, very liberal in outlook and mere drivel. Nothing of substance is presented. These writings may make good reading in popular magazines but certainly nothing new or noteworthy is presented. I believe the draw for this title is that the author was a very popular figure and has now passed into the cosmos."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star in the Universe","review":"Billions and billions of stars in the universe but only one for this book. Why? Because Carl Sagan was totally ignorant of the subatomic world and the possibility of multiverses. He saw only one star in the sky, and its name was Sagan. He was a sophist who appealed mainly to a pop culture that looked for easy-to-digest science in support of its secular morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest mind","review":"Carl Sagan has to be the greatest mind of our time and this book is a prime example of why. Absolutely stunning and astounding work from a man who didn't live long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and readable.","review":"I've used this book in a unique way, being able to site it in just about every paper I wrote for a science class this year. Sagan covers many of the pressing environmental and ethical dilemmas facing us in the modern world. It's a very readable book that makes the case for being an environmentalist without becoming dogmatic. Sagan also outlines the significance of exponential numbers in the universe and everyday life, with fun and interesting examples. A very useful book to have on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight into an athiest going to his death","review":"A brilliant book, but he is preaching to the converted. I found myself nodding to the words on the page and putting down the book to mentally expand on the ideas and predictions of this great popular writer.The book is sectioned into several clear cut responses to world human problems,and after each one you just have to know his thoughts on the next world dilemma.The end chapters are devoted to his illness and impending death he mentions the afterlife and re-incarnation but just as fanciful wishes,it will be just his luck to come back as a Phsycic ,spoon bending,mind reading alien abductee."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important book","review":"I have read this book a couple of times and I think it's value lies in making you want to go out and protect the enviroment, work for peace, increase science education, etc..... I liked it because he was a wonderfully eloquent person and really made you want to understand more about the enviroment. I also enjoyed demon haunted world and would recommend either book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read","review":"This is the first book by Sagan that I've read. Simply said, it's written brilliantly ! I was amazed when I read the chapter on abortion. Sagan leads you to start thinking about issues in a different plane altogether. His systematic, analytical & scientific approach to solving problems would help anyone with a little logical bent of mind. The chapter on '20th century' seemed to cover environmental issues (again !) though Sagan had dealt with those exhaustively in earlier chapters.All in all, definitely worth reading. Pity that we don't have him around to share his views on what is going on in today's world !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety of subjects...","review":"This is the first nonfiction book I have read by Carl Sagan, although I have read one of his fiction works, Contact. In this book, Dr. Sagan offers his opinions and thoughts (although, backed by facts) on many, many different subjects, including abortion, the environment, politics, religion, the military, and many others. The author is an atheist, and the book has atheistical implications throughout, but he also treats religion and the followers with a great deal of respect. I myself am a Christian and did not feel he was attempting to push his beliefs on me any more so than people of other religions would.I strongly recommend this book for the scientist and non-scientist alike. It has a lot of scientific topics in it, but they are dealt with using low-level science that is easily understood. I found the sections on abortion and the military particularly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl lives on among billions and billions of minds","review":"An amazing book by an amazing man. Carl Sagan is one of my heroes who has shown me how breathtaking the universe is. In this book, Sagan speaks very personally about matters deep to him, issues he was engaged in during his life. He presents arguments like the Prisoner's Dilemma and his solution to the arms race.The book ends with him talking about his last round of cancer therapy, and is then completed by his wonderful wife Ann Druyan. Though Carl is no longer with us, his memory lives on in the minds of billions of earthlings now and I hope all future generations will appreciate this great man as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"best crest album ever!!!","review":"Dude idk what that dude talkin about., this album has sooo many good songs!!

Cambridge University published both volumes together as the Second Edition in 1973.I tell you this because booksellers do not always understand, and you might order the \\"Second Edition,\\" but only get one of the volumes. I have it on the excellent authority of Dr. Rupert Thompson of Selwin College, Cambridge, that Cambridge will not publish the Third Edition for several years at least.

Users will be disappointed to discover that contour lines are rarely labelled. There is no distance scale, either on the pages or in the key - an oversight which would produce an automatic 'F' in introductory cartography. Furthermore, land ownership status is not indicated on the maps by color coding as with other atlases - instead there is only a single statewide page which is essentially useless. Finally, the maps on each page run to the edge with approximately a half-inch overlap between pages. Although convenient for inexperienced map users - it is a source of frustration for those with greater map experience. If you really need a Nevada atlas, then get this one. Otherwise, wait until Delorme reissues a new edition correcting its most serious flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Benchmark atlas.","review":"In the other cases where I have compared DeLorme & Benchmark side by side (California, New Mexico, Arizona), I prefer DeLorme. Not this time. As other reviewers have mentioned, BLM land is not marked in the main body of the atlas, only in the whole-state map; this alone makes the atlas nearly useless for those interested in exploring public lands. Benchmark's marking of public lands at a coarse scale in their \\"recreation maps\\", but not in the finer scale \\"landscape maps\\" is not ideal, but it is workable; DeLorme's approach for Nevada is not. I also notice that Benchmark includes more campgrounds (including one I stayed at last summer south of Silver Springs) and other fine detail for Nevada than DeLorme, whereas in other cases the opposite is true. Elsewhere in the west, stick with DeLorme. For Nevada, get the Benchmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many errors","review":"Took a number of non-roads shown as roads in this atlas and almost became stranded once. Also missed some interesting roads not shown in this atlas. I later reviewed these errors in the other brand atlas of the same size and found them ALL to be correct in that atlas. I continually find errors in the California, New Mexico, and Nevada versions of the DeLorme atlases. I have since converted my usage to the other brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trip planning tool","review":"I use the Delorme Gazetteers, including this one, for planning my fishing trips every year. They include comprehensive coverage of the state in question with sufficient detail to identify all the major topological features one will find, including streams and lakes. Also, they show all the roads. One criticism is that they don't contain road mileages between locations, unlike a highway atlas. But, a highway atlas will not show topographic coutour lines, or indicate locations where one may launch kayaks or rafts, or show locations reputed to have good fishing. I keep a Delorme Gazetteer for each state in which I expect to travel on any extended drive. They enable me to find campgrounds (in the indexes and shown on the maps), roads, topography, and all the essentials to plan a trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"Thank goodness for survival skills! This atlas suggested a road going north from Black Rock Desert was graded gravel, but it turned into a challenging 4 wheel track. I triple checked GPS coordinates along the way, so my position was correct. What should have been a 1/2 day drive at most turned into 8+ hours with an overnight roadside stay. This Atlas would be better for target practice than back road navigation. One good quality is the overlap from one page to another, saving page flipping when traveling along roads that border the page edge. Don't buy this Atlas!

This movie is not faithful to the gospels. The words of Jesus were changed, most notably at the Last Supper, and great liberties were taken with the historical events that surrounded him. In all movies adapted from written material it is necessary to pick and choose which events will be included and which will be excluded. Yet, I can not comprehend why such major events as the raising of Lazarus from the dead, the eviction of the moneychangers from the temple, and the second appearance in front of Pilate (the death sentence and the washing of hands) were left out of this account of Jesus' life."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Testament Revisionism","review":"If you are not familiar with the new testament be warned. This movie leaves out MOST of the important moments in Jesus life/career and gives short shrift to the divine Jesus. This movie seems to be more concerned with the Roman occupation and resistance by the jews. Much more space is given over to the enemies of the jews, jewish suffering under occupation etc. Jesus is not really even seen in this movie until he shows up at the Jordan for baptism by John, a scene which is grossly inaccurate and incomplete along with the following scenes of 40 days in the wilderness.Save your money. If you want a more accurate portrayal of Jesus life and ministry consistent with the New Testament, purchase Franco Zeffrelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\".

Unfortunately, the critics displayed their conventional bias against goodlooking actors and blamed Hunter for KING OF KINGS being such a weak movie--it's too long and boring--and then Hunter's career went into a gradual tailspin that was accelerated by his then wife Sandy Bartlett's decision not to allow him to stay on as the Captain of the Enterprise after his appearance in the first Star Trek pilot, and then Hunter stumbled through a series of terrible movies like DIMENSION 5,and SERGENT O'FARRELL OF THE NAVY with Bob Hope, and by 1969 Hunter was dead.But if you want to see Jeffrey Hunter's unusual combination of all American good looks and acting ability see him in STAR TREK's \\"The Cage,\\" or in KING OF KINGS.

King of Kings lack the essence of the biblical accounts of Jesus that were important to the story. For example, much of the story was emphasized on the political events of the time, instead of the central message of Jesus' teachings. A lot of details on Jesus's life were missing. The motivations for Jesus' persecution and death were not faithful to bible accounts. Also, I feel that the passion, suffering and death of Jesus was not portrayed realistically by the actor - there was just not enough human emotion to make it a good movie.

Jeffrey Hunter plays Jesus. You have to be tall and good-looking to be Jesus. They are all here: Pontius Pilate, John the Baptist and Barabbas. Rebel Barabbas is freed and becomes the first man for whom Jesus dies. Like other movies from the period, there is no blood in battle scenes. It seems strange. There is no humor unless you count the perverse glee of Herodias when she is given the head of John the Baptist. Although stiff when compared to The Passion of the Christ, King of Kings is faithful to the Gospels."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pay for what you get","review":"As my title says, \\"You pay for what you get.\\"The case can carry my ipod, but I cannot do anything on my ipod touch while in the case, so each time I need to select a song or adjust the volume I have to remove it from the case every time.

By \\"fundamental\\" I mean beliefs supplied by those persons pretending to interpret God and what God desires for us, rather than what God communicates with us directly. Yes, the Bible is one more tool used by humans who wish to control us by pretending they can give us the word of God. Only God can do that. This author analyzes her situation in view of traditional fundamentalism, and not in the spirit of Love that is God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good step for understanding","review":"I struggled with pornography for several years before and after I was married. This book provided a better understanding of the chains that I was in and gave my wife a perspective on what I was struggling with. It also gave me a small perspective of what she (my wife) was dealing with.That said, I think this book helped me to understand my chains, but did very little to help me be free from them. Setting Captives Free: Pure Freedom <ASIN: 1885904304> finally helped me to allow Christ to set me free fully and completely.The two books are excellent companion pieces, though.

For those of us living in a relationship with a sexual addict in the preliminary stages of addiction, the information provided, while insightful, is also tormenting in the sense that it opens one's eyes to things that may or may not be occuring in one's own relationship. Personally, I began second guessing my husband more and more and it proved to be more detrimental to my relationship than helpful in terms of degradation of trust. Just something to keep in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I spent way too much money for what I thought would be a new book that turned out to be used.

If it is helpful it is because you have NOT been through the devastation of pornography in your life. My emotions went on a downward spiral which is NOT what I needed. There were no helpful hints on how to get out of it; it only pushed me downward. The only people I can see that might be helped out by this book is the addict. If a spouse is trying to work through the pain [...] of pornography in their life---this book is NOT the one to read. I was so hurt, broken by reading about all the specifics. [....] I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this book","review":"While there was some good information in this book the author's viewpoint seemed self-righteous and extremely judgemental. A lot of information that was presented as factual was really just the author's opinion on a select group of academic studies.

We can even talk more openly about issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before there is a problem","review":"I agree with another review that this would be an excellent book for couples in pre-marriage classes. Women tend to underestimate the prevalence and strength of lust issues in men. Men tend to be clueless about the destruction their lust can wreck on a relationship.

After I had finished I couldn't stop thinking about the insight I had gained from reading this one book. This book looked at pornographic addictions from many different angles. It showed the physical, and spiritual long lasting effects that sin can cause and reap in a persons life. Just about the time I thought I couldn't read another word and I began to realize the heaviness of sin on our minds, the revelation about God and his forgiveness brought hope and peace back to my heart. This happens to be one of the top 5 best books I have ever read. After I finished this reading this book I felt much more aware of my surroundings. Some of the things I read in there have changed my outlook on life forever.

But it is nowhere close to a respectable Butter Chicken sauce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes decent...just nothing like butter chicken","review":"When I think of butter chicken, I think of a smooth, creamy, almost sweet sauce with complex but subtle flavors. This sauce, while it tastes pretty good and is easy to use on chicken, tastes nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had. It tastes more like a red enchilada sauce (yes, as in Mexican food!) with a little bit of Indian spices added in. The flavors are too strong, the texture is thicker and not as creamy, and the mild sweetness is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird smell","review":"This sauce kind of has a weird unappetizing smell.

Anyone that wants to investigate the case should go to callahan.8k.com, the case transcripts are here, the reader should pay attention to Woods Affadavit, and Exhibit 500, which contain the mental health records of Damien Echols.The book was fairly well written, but its not about Damien Echols. His colorful descriptions, of people are very disturbing, for some reason if you are not one of his celeb friends, you are some low life. To read the true Damien Echols, read the trial transcript, not this made up life he has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent and Inspirational","review":"I just received this book today and could not put it down. Despite having read and watched everything I could find about the West Memphis Three case, to some extent Damien Echols remained an enigma. This book makes it personal. Damien shares his story with honesty, intelligence, and wit. Although this tragedy has been and continues to be devastating to all involved, Damien perseveres with hope and grace. With all the hard work of so many determined supporters, I hope his next book will be about the release and vindication of Damion, Jason and Jessie"},{"rating":"2","title":"damien echols almost home","review":"This book was an excellent portrait of a person who was inprisioned on appearances only. Damien has had a rough life, hes been through so much, an the fact that he has maintained his humor and positive outlook is truely a testament to his intelligence and the size of his heart. This book is not a bitter account of someone who feels wronged but rather and accurate story of overcoming hatred and becoming a better person because of the negative in your life. I appreciate and admire Damien Echols. Everyone should read this book to enlighten themselves to the negative side of the judicial system, which is so often overlooked. You read this book and it will leave no doubt in your mind as to Damiens innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a crime...","review":"Damien was wrongfully convicted on no evidence...Its a shame..You get to see the real side of this \\"so called monster\\".....His sense of humor, his ability to see the beauty is all his memories...Its horrible what they have done to him, Jessie and Jason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud of you Damien","review":"Damien did an amazing job on telling his own life story and keeping it real and simple.

I hope and pray one day this poor boy, now a man will find justices because he has already found forgiveness through the pages of his life story he writes.

We have the chance to hear things in an honest, heartfelt manner from Damien Echols himself. He tells his life story from his painful childhood, the conviction and his life in prison now. Damien is an excellent writer with a great sense of humour. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book. You will feel the full range of emotions from heartache and longing while Damien speaks of his childhood and his conviction to love and hope when speaking about his wife, Lorri, and the split second he sees Jason Baldwin for the first time in over a decade.

I was SO excited about this book. To actually get, in Damien's own words, an account of the events was WAY too much to pass up. I was FAR too curious and this book really quenched that for me. Finally, he speaks up freely and tells it like it is. I'd buy a million copies of this book and pass them around, if I could. The insight he gives to his mind, heart, and soul is unreal. This book took me on a rollercoaster of emotion. I devoured every word and, still hungry, look forward to volume 2. Hey, you can't have volume 1 without a follow up, right? I recommend it to ALL readers, young, old, informed, and uninformed. The story is simply too shocking to not be told. Buy it, read it, pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"As I have been following this case for sometime now, finally reading and understanding things from one of the three's point of view is amazing. To see how twisted the media can turn things and make people seem worse than they appear.Damien wrote very well, and used such detail in his work. I almost cried several times reading the story that he told, the story of his life. If I could I would do everything for him.This book is a must read by any person.

James argues for the enshrinement of George Davis as the best player not in the Hall of Fame (written in 1995), and like magic Davis is enshrined this year. James is THE baseball guru."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had a chance and James choked in the clutch!","review":"The Baseball Hall of Fame is full of paradoxes and Bill James turns into a literary paradoxical decomposition throughout this effort. Nevermind the man is not at all funny as he uses poor choices in language (do not read this book to young children), but turns his book into a paradoxical attack on \\"Scooter\\" Rizzuto and manages to trash Don Drysdale and a few others. If one is seeking the good and the bad along with a history of the HOF voting and members, then prepare to be left in scoring position; you may not be able to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Sabermetrics is all about","review":"Back in the 70s, when Tony Kubek was considered a baseball savant, Bill James began popularizing a rigorous statistical analysis of baseball. In the 80s, when the pedantry of the Elias Baseball Analyst team threatened to remove the ideas from the study of the game, James kept chugging along with his yearlies, and the Historical Abstract (another must read). Later he produced this, probably his best work. For anyone who shakes his head at a player or manager dismissing another's opinion by saying \\"He never played the game;\\" for anyone who is not cowed by the received truth of an inside \\"authority\\" or eyewitness, for anyone who loves baseball and thinks we can do better by using the tools at our disposal, Bill James is a godsend. If you're a big baseball fan and you don't know who he is, get this for yourself. It will open up your appreciation of the game, its history, and the numbers and debates that keep its history alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Hall of Fame Perspective; Must Read for Baseball Fans","review":"I always wondered why Babe Ruth was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame with only 95% of the vote; how could he have deserved anything less than 100%?James methodically explains why players like Sandy Koufax are in the Hall while others like Don Drysdale shouldn't make the cut. He presents Vern Stepens's candidacy for induction (you'll find out who he is) while comparing him to Phil Rizzuto. He educates us about the Hall of Fame voting proceedings in the Veterans Committee of the 1970's, led by Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch, and the several biased selections that were made. Why IS Ross Youngs in the Hall of Fame? Could it be that he was a teammate of Frisch's?James gives us a magnificent perspective as to the Hall of Fame's voting proceedings and rule changes, and he gives a thorough and enlightening history of the Baseball Hall of Fame's bureaucracy and maturation into the Mecca for baseball history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good homeowner association information","review":"As a board member of a homeowner asociation I found this book very useful in explaining the rights of homeowners and the function of the board.

If you know anything about the newspaper business, yellow journalism, or even if you know nothing at all you'll love this book. Waugh pokes fun at everything from imperialism to the British upperclass in this satire of early 20th century journalism. A London newspaper mistakenly sends a garden columnist to cover a foreign war and the series of screwups that follows result in the story of his career. I highly recommend this one to anyone who likes a nice, light, and intelligent laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Cautionary Book for Aspiring Journalists","review":"This is not Waugh doing Waugh so much as it is Waugh doing Wodehouse (the Jeeves the Butler author). Shows you what Waugh is like when he's actually nice to his characters. Chirpingly silly, this one was written for the masses, not for Those Who Understand - this ain't no \\"Brideshead.\\" But it's still devilishly clever and entertaining - \\"B\\" Waugh perhaps, but still better than the \\"A\\" work of a lot of other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"Every \\"journalist\\" should be forced to read this book, at gunpoint if necessary. Scoop is a great book; I found myself laughing out loud every few pages. Waugh pokes fun at numerous targets, but I think that his jabs at the newspaper trade and the pretensions of its practitioners are especially scathing. It's a tremendously funny novel, and it rings true more than six decades later. I'd give it 100 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scoop - A letdown","review":"I was eager to read Scoop, it has great adjectives attached to it: Intriguing, ebullient, witty, etc. I did not find it to be so.This book is in no way a classic. I realize that it was written in what? 1937, so the social mores have changed. The casual rascism was jarring to say the least, and it took me out of the book often. It was no Huckleberry Finn, where the character was doing the talking, it was text, straight from the author's head. It doesn't hold up well to modern eyes.There was one laugh out loud funny part, and it occured near the end. In no way did that joke make up for the pages gone before. Overall, I felt that it was a one joke book, from which perhaps Saturday Night Live could perform an unfunny skit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"I love Evelyn Waugh's writing, but I'm giving up on this book at page 88 because the racism is intolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Satire","review":"Few would dispute that Waugh is a great writer with a memorable style. However, this book has a rather weak plot, and thin character development. The biggest disappointment is the much vaunted satire that comes across as dated and humorless. Read it quickly if you are interested in journalism. Otherwise, your time would better be spent watching an episode of the Gilmore Girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny,","review":"Although I normally enjoy satirical comedies--in this case, hilariously mistaken identities, and the haphazard ways of war reporting, and the British classism and humor--I had a hard time staying focused while reading this one and had to really try maintaining my interest. However, I must say that because I appreciate this author whose styles are so versatile,(for example, this one is so different from Brideshead Revisited, which is my favorite Waugh) and his writings are of such high quality and wickedly poignant, I have to give at least 4 stars regardless of my preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"SATIRE AT ITS BEST","review":"Evelyn Waugh, one of the greatest satirists that ever lived, does it again in Scoop. With his brilliance, wit, and keen observational skills, he weaves together one unforgettable story of mistaken identities, colourful characters and superb irony. This book had me bursting out into uncontrollable peals of laughter (but then again, what Evelyn Waugh book doesn't?) time and time again. This is, simply put, a work of genius-- no doubt of that. Evelyn Waugh will forever remain one of my literary heroes.

There are several songs that are just plain fun to dance to with plenty of embellishments for improvisational moments. The best part, however, is that the liner notes not only include a translation of any lyrics contained in the songs, but also give you an idea of what kind of song it is - the rhythms (slow, fast, rhumba, etc.) and what level of dancer each song might be best suited to.I am a dancer of intermediate skill level and would readily recommend this CD for anyone at this level or below (could not speak to its appropriateness to those at a higher level).

The topics covered are all useful to anyone with an interest in the psychology of influence, and probably to anyone in the business/sales/marketing world. The examples and studies given in between the text are a joy to read. You'll probably find yourself discussing them with friends and acquaintances in between chapters.

Great and unnerving at the same time, the book is filled with various studies in the field of social psychology. I cannot recommend this book too highly; an entertaining and informative read.

It is one of the books that has influenced me the most (no pun intended), and I have read it several times over the years. This book is still one of my recommendations every time someone asks me for something interesting to read. To some 21st century readers the book may seem old hand, but that is only because the knowledge in this book was so definitive that it permeated the culture and all subsequent work on the subject.

There is nothing wrong with purposeful betterment of ones ability to communicate or influence- as long as one's intent is to truly benefit the buyer. As a matter of fact, if you believe you have a product that people will greatly benefit from and you don't try to help them get it- you aren't sincere.

He does a very nice job, through anecdotes and summaries of relevant research, of explaining why we decide -- and how we can be influenced to decide -- even when those decisions would seem to work against our best interests.

He explains different methods and then proceeds to elaborate on them. The book is packed with helpful tips. Each chapter includes true stories and potential situations. In addition to the book being extremely helpful, the book was hilarious. The author slips in humor and wit with ease. The book was a very enjoyable read rather than what could have been very boringly elaborated on.The section about employees at booths was especially helpful to me. It has it all!This book is helpful and a great book to have around. I've read this book numerous times and it never gets hold. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for everyone","review":"One of the best psychology books I have read to date and all the people I have bought it for irrespective of career path have enjoyed it as well (or at least they tell me they have). Social psychology is fascinating in general, and Cialdini has an incredible way of showing us how we fall victim to various psychological phenomena. I think it would be near impossible to read the book and not think to yourself, \\"oh yeah, I have done that before.\\" I think that is the charm of the book; Cialdini is able to take his vast knowledge and expertise in psychology and illuminate many key concepts in a book that is readable for all ages and education levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book Title","review":"A better title for this book would be \\"How not to be influenced by shady sales people\\". I was looking for some ideas on how to talk to people so they would be more interested in what I have to offer. I think I'm pretty good at that already, but I'm always looking for new ideas. This book had no ideas at all - it was simply telling me how sales people who don't have your best interest in mind are using games to make you buy from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad...","review":"what a waste of money....the first chapter seems promising but then the whole thing falls apart..as the book goes on his logic becomes worse and his writing gets sloppier...i stopped reading halfway through when he used the word brilliant to describe a \\"scientist\\"'s theory that people crash planes on purpose after reading about suicides in the news because they want to copy-cat suicide but they think it will embarrass their families . seriously. he says that theory is brilliant. ugh. what a nightmare....at least sixty pecent of his evidence for his claims is anecdotal evidence from his life, most of which evidence seems pretty clearly made up...in other words this book is a huge waste of time. don't bother!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares about making friends...","review":"Who cares about making friends...this book details six ways that we can leverage our innate cognitive biases to influence people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Tips on Persuasion","review":"This is a good introductory book on NLP, because it provides some good tips on persuasion. For example, if you give someone a small gift (i.e. a cup of coffee) before you ask them to do something for you (i.e. buy some Girl Scout cookies), the chance that they will in fact do that favor for you increases drastically. And if you give absolutely any reason (i.e. I'm running late.) for cutting in line, most people will let you get in front of them.Katie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprising Pleasure to Read","review":"This book sat on my Wish List for years. I wish I had read it when I first heard about it. I heard that Cialdini was an academic who established foundational issues about what influences behavior. That's a wicked truth.

To redeem the card on amazon.com was horrible. I clicked to use the gift card, Amazon charged my credit card on file.(I placed the order early today and saw that the charge was on my credit card and still had the gift card balance)I phoned later the same day. Their solution was to return the item when I receive it and try again to place the order; then try again to navigate multiple screens to redeem the gift card. They are incapable of issuing a credit to my credit card and applying the gift card as I initially indicated. The gift card redemption screen clearly reads that eligible purchases will be automatically deducted. There is NOTHING automatic about it. Plus the Chat & phone reps were rude and unhelpful. I should have rated a minus star. Gift cards do NOT automatically get deducted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Gift Cards","review":"Amazon needs to make some major adjustments to their gift cards.

Amazon's answer was to report the code number on a form meant for problems with a 17 digit order number which, not surprisingly, the form would not accept. I sent a screen shot of the nonworking form with the none working code number as a return email. Amazon's return email to me repeated using the the nonworking order form.

I don't know if they issued the same number to more than one person, or if I was just scammed. Either way, I am out $200 and was told that I would need to contact my credit card company to file a claim. Well, it's been 10 months since I purchased the card so it appears that I am just out $200.

I purchased this for a recipient who has no credit card, not knowing that a credit card number is required to redeem the certificate. After being unable to redeem the card, he spent some time on the phone with customer service, as did I. There is, apparently, no way to use the card without a number, which seems to negate the whole point of a gift card. At one point, the customer service rep blithely replied that the recipient could use his debit card. Apparently the whole concept of being cardless was beyond her comprehension.

The gift card took over a year to use including extra money Amazon gave her for her inconvenience. Amazon dose not mention that the gift card can not be used on every item. Also, after checkout the gift card may only apply 20% to each item, leaving you with money left over and your credit card charged when you thought you finished the gift card. Believe me it's happened multiple times. Save your self the stress and time of multiple phone calls to Amazon and choose any other company for a gift card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift Card Nightmare","review":"I received an Amazon Gift Card as a workplace gift in August 2012.

After a couple of emails and one extended phone conversation I was told by Amazon CS on 8-10-12 that my gift card amount would be credited to my credit card. I checked with my bank on 8-22-12 and no credit was posted. I once again contacted Amazon CS and got yet another email reply saying my gift card amount would be applied to my credit card, in 4 or 5 business days.

For example this book is described as being in English (see above). Is it? Does it contain the original Latin text. Some of the reviewers seem to suggest it is but who knows?

Totally discarding that T-80, has the most powerful gun fitted to any tank, and that it has the capability to fire an anti-tank missile at ranges well beyond those achieved by The Abrams or the Challenger. The whole book is structured to expose USSR's armoured weaknesses, some of which are quite fictional, while not even mentioning the setbacks the \\"Western\\" armies have. Steven Zaloga's reference to Russian people as \\"Russkis\\" is quite symbolic of the tone in which the entire book was written. Drawings by Simon McCouaig are of high quality, especially the detailed look at the Tanks from Top, Side and Rear viewpoints. Also note how the \\"Russian observer\\" looks, compared to all the other people drawn in the \\"colour\\" plates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading!","review":"I don't understand the one- and two-star ratings here.

Although my expectations may have been higher than someone who hasn't read his previous work, I just can't imagine anyone connecting with this novel.While I clearly do not recommend this book, I VERY HIGHLY recommend his previous work, \\"One Thousand White Women\\" which was phenomenal.

After reading the first six chapters, and working through most of the problems, I have to say this book is great. I highly recommend this to anyone who is learning on there own. In particular, the chapter on residues is excellent. The chapter on series is also good, although I would have liked more worked examples for proofs involving uniform convergence. Also, a little more emphasis on the Arguement would have been nice. Nevertheless, 5/5 for this one, it is extremely well written and the authors really provide motivation for the theorems to come.

This served as a great online reference and has a corresponding book: COMPLEX ANALYSIS: for Mathematics and Engineering, Fifth Edition, 2006 by John H. Mathews and Russell W. Howell.

For example, Harry Walker's (Jansen) favorite song is \\"Three Little Fishies\\". At one point in the chase, he can be seen singing along with the record. In this travesty of a DVD, he's singing along to some xylophone solo.

Much of its contents now discredited. No longer used as even a secondary source for historical studies. This two-volume masterpiece is a must-read for any Fundamentalist. It traces each major branch of science from its origin through its struggle against the omnipresent bludgeon of Chrisitian wickedness.In the end science (aka. Truth) always reigns victorious over a jealous, wincing and befuddled Church. Yay!Students of more careful and more recent histories of science are forgiven for snickering. One must think of this as a snapshot of late 19th century thought. White, too, is forgiven. The author sometimes lapses into the prosaic styles of Robert Ingersoll.
