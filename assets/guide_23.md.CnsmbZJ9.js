This is just as sorry as any of Hollywood's worst make-a-buck sequels ... more inane, just about as much gore. But not gory enough to top the horror masters (so, again, nothing new). All in all, nothing for anyone (except the lead actor and actress's families, I guess)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"As previous viewers have pointed out, this movie is absolutely horrible. While it can be argued that the wildly overrated Battle Royale is imbued with some relevance given its supposed social commentary concerning the flaws in modern Japanese society, this movie is limited to a childish and inexplicable Anti-americanism. A scene justifying the 9-11 attacks, at the beginning of the film, is the perfect example of this.But perhaps the most unforgivable flaw of this movie is how unbelievably boring it is. I have a large collection of Japanese films and I can say unequivocally that this is the worst of the bunch.If I could give this horrible movie zero stars I would. Buy this at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Erase the Grey is one of the best bands I have heard in quite awhile, and even though this cd only has 5 songs on it, they are 5 high-quality songs so it doesn't even really matter. Erase the Grey produces a well-balanced formula of hard rock and melody. \\"The Melting Side,\\" \\"Pariah,\\" and \\"2nd Chance\\" are the heavy songs on here, while \\"Waiting\\" and my personal favorite \\"Rain\\" are the melodic songs. Jon Sayre, the vocalist, can sing extremely well with a lot of passion behind his voice. The lyrics are simplistic, yet they are also meaningful as well. Everyone in this band can play their instruments with good precision, and that's a requirement if you want to form a band as good and as entertaining as Erase The Grey. So what are you waiting for? Go buy the freekin' cd! NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GIVE ME MORE!!!","review":"What else can I say about this CD? Not much. People have already stated what a great compilation this first EP by Erase the Grey is, so I leave it to the common listener to decide. Here's how I see it...Think of Flaw, a great group with awesome staying power. Now, take Staind and that group's depression rock mastery. These guys have a hint of both with a style all their own, which gives this CD a quality that allows you to listen to it over and over again. I heard their track called \\"Pariah\\" on a Music Choice channel and I finally found the CD with this song and other heavy favorites like \\"Rain\\", \\"Second Chance\\", and \\"Waiting\\". In fact, I liked the whole CD. I did notice one thing though, the CD just didn't sound complete.Supposedly, they are going to release a full-length album this year.

And where is the bag for the letters?? I bought a newer version because I wanted to leave a game at my mountain cabin where we have no TV and play games at night. I'm going to look for a version of the game where the game pieces are larger and better made. The game is still worth buying and playing with kids and adults.

Big Up to them for putting faith in JAH, and not the record company, to guide them into making a beautiful album.(I'm sure Elektra wanted them to follow the mold) Any positve minded person will appreciate this album both musically and lyrically, even if you have never given them a chance before. Check out songs: One Good Spliff, All I Need Is You, and JAH Will Be Done. And the amazingly personal song Won't Let You Down, in which Ziggy calls to his father in Heaven.

Then came Editor John Campbell and did he manage a field of great authors! Asimov, Heinlien, Clarke, and many others grew up under him.In our modern era, science fiction has once again fallen prey to 10 novel fantasy series and the (...) EMPIRE of Star Wars and Star Trek books (I hesitate to call them novels).Asimov's Science Fiction is the bright shining light where fabulous SF is being written by writers that haven't sold out to the Motion Picture megabucks.

Don't get me wrong, the stories are usually of high quality, but when I first subscribed, I expected serious SF only.Other than those two complaints, I enjoy this magazine thouroughly and look forward to it's arrival always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Jo Verso's style reminders me of Legoland, simple, charming and appealing to the heart. True to form, her book encompasses everything she can imagine to tell the story of the year's activities. There are samplers for months, seasons and holidays. There are celebration themes from sports to weddings. There are events from Spring planting to Fall canning, to watermelon and ice-cream cones in Summer. She also includes flowers and simple wreathes. And, borders, borders, borders! Another gift for us to learn from. Simple, yes. Educational, definitely. It's a steal at the current rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know it would take so long","review":"I placed the order in the last few days of February and got it on April 13th.

I was actually surprised that the talking head professors who were interspersed into the action did not turn most teenagers off. I come at this with a classical perspective (I'm a Latin teacher) and my one serious qualm was that the production did not address the fact that there are usually several versions of the same myth; there is in fact no one canonical version, contrary to what this series implies. Different authorities give different versions of the stories.

For instance, when the letter about Clarkson arrives I cry. Not cry, but break down. I have read this book so many times, that it still has the same effect on me. Kathryn Worth does a fabulous job creating these characters into something more real. They do stay with you for a long time. Everyone I have ever had read the book feels the same.

Both books focus on the poetics of space. The former does it in great detail. The latter does it in brief with wit and from the perspective of an artist and a writer. But both communicate its varying degrees well, as well as its profoundness. The Poetics of Space is an intellectual dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true sens of the poetry in the modern age.","review":"Bachelard is a famous critic about the poetry, constructing models who relate the sense of the words with the mind dynamics. It is a cultural back-ground for analyzing the traditional aspects of the literature, but this vision is particularly interesting because it offers us an analysis by a modern view, or also a post-modern view. This research is an approach to the sounds and to the motivations who can be related to an human psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book.","review":"Sorry to those people that have got something out of this book, but I couldn't finish it.

It does not so much \\"talk\\" about space and place, but rather gives the reader a thoughtful experience of the subjectivities and meanings of space. For example, Bachelard presents poetic interpretations of enclosures, inside/outside, and other spatial phenomemon while applying it to such entities as the nest, the shell, the corner, the drawer, etc. A work to savor, slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and thought -provoking book","review":"I was asked to read this book before going to university and therefore saw reading it as more of an obstacle to be overcome than an experience to be enjoyed.

For somebody in a large company (like myself), this book provides a lot of guidance to leadership on how to bring small-team energy to a culture of slow-moving big teams. In that respsect, this is a great book.The only failure I see is that I didn't notice much attention paid to individual performance. A failing of large companies is that they tend to load so many roles, side-responsibilities, and conflicting priorities on their employees that enabling some folks to break free, focus on a small but impact-laden project, and really deliver it are a separate set of issues that need to be addressed as well. This book provides great information in an immediately-useful form-factor, but beware of using it alone, paritcularly if you're new to a company and its culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it!","review":"This is the first book I've seen that actually helps .. all the others talk about execution and how important it is, but that's where they stop.

Nice work Bob!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books on execution than this","review":"This is not a SCHOLARLY book on execution. Also it is submerged so much in detail that the author often misses his points. The book is more on interpersonal relations, communications, managing people kind of thing and very very basic.

This compilation demonstrates Wiseman's work throughout his solo career, (He was the keybordist for Blue Rodeo).

As opposed to titles that take you through the entire process of creating a website start to finish, this mostly introduces new concepts that help to build on your knowledge of ActionScript 2.0.If you're wishing to feel a sense of accomplishment after reading this title cover-to-cover, you will be sorely disappointed. The sample exercises show how key concepts can enhance your web site/applications/scripts, but there is no end result that allows you to sit back and feel that you've accomplished anything substantial.Any newbie to Flash wishing to increase their knowledge of ActionScript 2.0 should first learn how to create their own fully functional website using some ActionScript before tackling this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreading unleashed","review":"I am new to programming and I'm finding that this book does a good job overall in leading me through new concepts.

This abhorrently stupid film is notable for being the culmination of a '70s trend wherein corporate interests had entirely co-opted a witless counterculture; this particular disaster was produced almost a decade after the expiration date of that phenomenon. That Forman directed this doesn't make it any less painful. After all, he's also responsible for Ragtime.My entirely natural revulsion for the trappings of this movie didn't draw my attention from its forced, wooden performances and hokey songs. Almost every aspect of its production - musical arrangements, choreography, set design - is hopelessly dated, and no more charming or nostalgic for it. It's merely embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair-aldic!","review":"Still a great show. Music as relevant today as in '69 - maybe more so! I think the translation to film worked.

The music brings it all together in a wonderful format. To watch this movie, then look at the world as it is today, you will see many similarities. So much fun and yet with sadness and joy combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now That You've Seen The Broadway Revival, See the Movie","review":"Hopefully the success of the current Broadway revival will inspire new \\"Hair Heads\\" to see this film. It is nothing like the play, yet EXACTLY like it where it counts - capturing the essence and spirit of the 60's - in a fun, yet serious way. The emphasis on the importance of individuality, creativity, tolerance, commitment, fearlessness, living life passionately with sensitivity and respect, the real consequences/casualties of war and the power of unity and hope in troubled times should resonate with today's audiences.

Milos Forman, a Czech, does a remarkable job of dipping into a moment of time in America and portraying its own special character. I saw the stage play and liked it a lot, but this is one case in which the movie is much better. There is a plot to the movie which the play basically lacks and that makes all the difference.The actors are all spectacular, too...Treat Williams will grab your heart as will John Savage and all the rest. The singing is so good--the reverberations will stick with you for long time. There is so much life and joy in the story and the music that the actors and dancers are all inspired to give extraordinary performances.I don't own many DVD's but this is one I want...to play whenever I need inspiration.

I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like HAIR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"I grew up in the '60s-'70s so I know the show.

Maybe my memory is distorted, but I never did half the things depicted in this movie, and I don't know anyone who did. We could not possibly have been as annoying as to go to a high-society party and dance on the tables!Here's another one where the major redeeming feature is the music. Yes, the music is very good. No, the dancing and mugging which goes with it is not. The characters are all stereotypes, their performances amateurish, their costumes are costumes, not clothing. And of course there is the obligatory acid trip interpretation, which again seems to have been done by someone who never dropped acid. Or maybe some people did hallucinate like that; maybe it's a want of imagination on my part. But I did at least a hundred trips in my wicked hippie days, and they were never choreographed!Good music; don't spend the money on the visuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippies In Curlers . . .","review":"What a long strange trip it's been. Barely ten years after its original theatrical run, Hair was brought to the screen by people who either hadn't seen it, didn't like it or just didn't get it or the themes it explored. Director Milos Forman apparently missed the 1960s entirely (or saw them exclusively through the lens of Soviet oppression and student demonstrations in Eastern Europe) and he seems to think that David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Peter Frampton were hippies. Treat Williams is a surprisingly good singer and dancer and quite good in the role of Berger but the film just misses the point - socially, politically and (perhaps most importantly of all) musically. The whole thing comes across as a put on and proof of the silliness of the counterculture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"One of the only musicals I love. A great story.

Treat Williams is a joy - watch him in \\"I Got Life\\" Beverly D'Angelo is an angel, and for all the showqueens out there - - can you find Betty Buckley in this movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't do justice to the stage production, but great fun.","review":"I have seen this movie at least 25 times. My desire to watch it stems from my love of the musical after seeing it performed in Boston a few years ago. Although this movie doesn't match the musical, it is still a blast to watch if you're into \\"Hair\\" at all. The story deviates from the original plot of the musical, and the cast is not as talented as a Broadway cast, but it is a lot of fun and quite amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy, tragedy or a pice of history?","review":"The \\"Hair\\" musical is happy and sad. I will not ruin the ending for you, but if you are against the war, chances are, you'll be crying. The movie takes you through the hippie period like it was. The characters were shover and disrespected, but they didn't give up. The movie is filled with wonderful musical numbers, colorful scenes and enlightning moment. If you're a hippie, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy for your eyes and ears","review":"This movie is so good. The music is great. The story line is old but new again. A anti war movie that tells us to love one another. The movie takes you back to a time when protesting was in. Life was lived to the fullest.Great costumes and the hair,what can I say. Hippies rulled the day.PEACE<LOVE<FREEDOM"},{"rating":"2","title":"About the DVD transfer","review":"This DVD provides both a \\"Standard\\" and \\"Widescreen\\" version. (The Standard is actually a full frame composition, with more detail at top and bottom of frame. But the Widscreen is still well composed, and having seen the film theatrically, I suspect it probably represents what theatergoers saw.)Standard may have had a slight edge in audio quality(?) and, as noted, contains more vertical detail - but it was struck from a muddy print. However, Widescreen was struck from a pristine print - I wondered if it was remastered, it was that beautiful. Comparing scenes from both sides to the VHS transfer I also own, I found Standard was visually indistinguishable from the VHS transfer, but Widescreen was vastly superior - finely detailed, richly colored. Thrilled to finally own a clean copy of one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD contains buggy code !","review":"The movie is excellent. The problem is with this DVD in particular. It crashes any DVD player randomly. I checked many configurations and it always crashes. It seems that the region 2 version of it is better. But the actual movie is great !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but I watched the whole thing.","review":"Since I grew up in the 60's I remember the time very well and this film glorifies some things that I remember as being heard of but questionable. The film is rated PG and I disagree with that, there is full frontal female nudity and other scenes with nudity. It makes drug abuse (LSD) and the loose lifestyle look apealing and there is a reason that the hippie/drug culture died out. The life style killed many and the rest grew up and realized that their protest were being ignored because of their zany behavior. The African American people depicted in the film are somewhat realistic but there are a couple songs that are offensive in language. I watched/ bought the film because I remembered some of the songs and wanted to see what the story was. It ends sadly and unrealistically like the rest of the film. Not worth the time unless you are really bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Travesty","review":"This movie is not Hair, nor does it deserve to be associated with the musical Hair whatsoever. Forman took a great piece of Americana and one of the greatest musicals ever and twisted it into this poor excuse for a movie-musical. The songs are good, but they're too often sung by the wrong characters under the wrong circumstances, and the plot is completely trashed from that of the original production. If you really appreciated the show, steer clear of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH WHAT A SHAME!","review":"One of the best musicals ever; a sing of friendship, freedom, an excellent original music an stage work; and an incredible bad film.I think the worst adaptation ever made.In stage is 3 hours long, the end is different, the message is different, the songs are different !everything is different!Please: Miss it and go to the original one.P.D.- It's my personal favour, I directed the Original Cast in 1979 in Spain. I really know what I'm saying. Thanks for your patiente."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - One for the Dump","review":"I can't believe someone had the nerve to recommend this movie to me of all people. I'm not so easily persuaded by the theme of this movie or from the hippy movt in general; a bunch of brain-dead idiots with long hair who talk about \\"love\\" is not all it takes to sway me. Love and freedom are not actualized without responsibility. Hippies are about as responsible as a mama cat with a bullseye painted on her and surrounded by a pack of wolves. Sitting on the ground and mooching off of others while talking about love and freedom is nothing more than madness. This movie is garbage, rather than watching it I recommend that you check out a book called, \\"Acid Dreams by Martin A. Lee,\\" if you want to get the best and the worst of the real story. After seeing hippies as a gullible people who \\"tuned out\\" from harmony with the cosmos, I can no longer see them in the same light as I did before. They are of no use to me or to anyone else. 0 stars and not recommended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtitulos","review":"Me critica a este producto se extiende a la mayor parte del stock que poseen ya que carecen de la información pertinente en cuanto al idioma y los subtitulos disponibles en estos y que si se soloca la portada tambien se coloque la contraportada en un buen tamaño para visualizar las caracteristicas y saber si ralizar la compra o no del mismo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show","review":"Maybe I'm showing my age but this show was one of the greats of its days.

Wolfe starts with the supposition that \\"our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime,\\" that God is \\"an unwitting spirit\\" in \\"remote eternity,\\" and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope. The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in \\"a stone, a leaf, an unfound door,\\" (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since \\"There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger,\\" \\"YOU are your world.\\" This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.

I can only give it 4 stars though because there was only a brief mention of Venom with no clips of them. Also only a quick piece on Diamond Head who are one of the great bands of this era. They even say in the dvd that they should have made it big like Maiden so why the brief clip on them? lastly No mention of Holocaust which to me is a staple of the NWOBHM. Everyone into this genre has the Nightcomers and Live Hot Curry and Wine. What about Raven? Overall it is a great documentation on this great era in metal and a must have for all NWOBHM lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another U.S. label ripoff","review":"When the UK reissued MR FANTASY last year, it contained the stereo and mono versions of the album. When it hits the U.S., you're forced to buy two different cds to get basically the same single disc (several of the tracks are carry-overs from the UK reissues of TRAFFIC & JOHN BARLEYCORN). In the end, to have all three releases, you'll have to purchase four separate discs! This is why I buy imports, they come out earlier, and are usually better deals both price wise and in content. Compare the versions and you'll see what I mean. As for the music contained here - BRILLIANT! One of the top twenty psych albums of the 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon gets a low mark","review":"As Amazon has done before, it fails to disclose that this CD is recorded on MONOphonic sound.I wish they would be more up-front about this intrinsically inferior sound; perhaps its just part of their business model.Anyway, I suggest giving them feedback about their failure to disclose such basic facts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Digital Sound !","review":"This review refers to the 180g vinyl edition , released on the Vinyl Lovers label .I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it's original glorious analogue sound .Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celluloid Crap!

Play elicits raucous laughter, hoots, and substantial amounts of rolling on the floor. The game is essentially a new variation of charades. Players draw cards with various words written on them, then they are placed on a card holder. Then the player must act out (no speaking or singing or mooing!) each word so his teammates can guess what the words are. The big twist is the card holder has a timer with a little trap door and as the timer winds down the cards drop out of sight one by one. Players are frantically trying to illuminate their teammates as to what they are trying to communicate via pantomime, while their teammates (hopefully) are blurting out every manner of response. A great party game.A must have game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatre Game","review":"I use this game in my Beginning Theatre class and my high school kids love it!

Granted, it's not the Joy of Sex, but close enough. It is disturbing to think people show their kids how to copulate on skateboards, bouncers, etc. I do not shy away from discussing the real mechanics of sex with my kids, but stop short of a full demonstration!

It has graphic cartoon-like depictions of clowns engaging in sexual intercourse using various sexual positions such as on a skateboard and suspended in the air by helium balloons. I personally want my child to realize that sex is for grown-ups. I also don't want them thinking how fun it would be to try it on a skateboard.

I am not sure if the author is trying to teach about how babies are made or how to have sex.

The words never rang truer for \\"Out of the mouths of babes!\\" I found this to be quite charming and am sure that children would find it easier to relate with it being told by other children as oppose to by adults. Perhaps my opinion will change should the day ever come that I need to explain this to my three year old, however I am sure I will look back to this book for some assistance. My opinion: the concern should not be to avoid embarassing the adults, the concern should be in keeping the lines of communication open with the children.

With pop hook sensibilities that rival Paul Westerberg and Matthew Sweet, Freedy marries irresistible melodies, sung in a powerfully idiosyncratic voice, with clever, beautifully written lyrics.

Of those forty five, ultimately sixteen would come off the mountain alive, but it would not come to pass until they had spent approximately seventy horrific days and nights trapped in unforgiving and alien territory high in the Andes mountains.This book recounts for the reader the travails of those trapped in this remote and inaccessible place, as well as the faith that helped see them through their horrific ordeal. A few of the photographs in the book are a little shocking, as they show the remains of the survivors' anthropophagy. They did, however, what they had to do in order to survive. It is definitely an amazing story. It makes one ask of oneself, \\"What would I have done under the same circumstances?\\" Read the book to see if you can answer that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone who knows the artist","review":"This man is a total farse.

Background noise, poor audio and terrible mixing are evident. On top of this, this is fairly obviously a recording of an off-night. The live recording of I Ran (on the Listen CD rerelease and on the Transfer Affection single) is far superior and showcases what the band could do when they were \\"on.\\" On this CD it's clear they weren't.Get the studio recordings and keep looking for live material, but skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I like AFOS. Their first album was outstanding. But this was a major disappointment.For one thing, it's a LIVE recording. Nowhere on the packaging does it say that. I thought I was getting some hits and b-sides.Now, not only is it live, it's BAD LIVE. It sounds like it was recorded on a portable cassette recorder. In one song, it actually switches to mono (left speaker only) for a little while. The superfluous electronic drum things in the live vesion of Space Age Love Song are embarrassing - they remind me of the old Wheel of Fortune theme song.Just awful. A complete waste of money and time. Not a pleasant trip down memory lane. Their first three albums are worthwhile, though, so get them if you can find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming children's story","review":"The Secret of Nimh is a charming animated children's movie, loosely based on the book, 'Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh.' It's a favorite from my childhood. The animation is good and the story is a good one. The biggest problem I have with the film is that the filmmaker's copped out and used magic to solve all problems at the end. But up til then, it's a good story. There are discrepancies between the book and the movie, but it is an adaptation, and a good show in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically animated production","review":"This is a beautiful movie with wonderful animation and engaging characters. But under no circumstances watch it with the intention of comparing it to the book by Robert O'Brien. Book and movie are a far cry from each other, and you will only end up disappointed if you are a fan of the book.As a stand-alone movie, The Secret of NIMH is a wonderful production, one of the best products of Don Bluth's career (personally, I believe An American Tail comes in equal). There is just the right amount of action, adventure, romance and good old-fashioned courage. There is enough in this to entertain kids of all ages (I'm 26 and I still love it).This movie is a joy to watch, but not in conjunction with the book.

I was really excited to watch it. When I did, I ended up bewildered and disappointed.First, there were many things in the movie not even in the book. Also, I didn't understand why Nicodemus and the owl had spooky, yellow glowing eyes. They were very creepy. The movie was much more violent than the book ever was. The rats don't even look like rats.

Is this what we want to teach our children? NIMH stands for National Institute of Mental Health: There was research on rats, many years ago, to see if RNA from one rat could make an injected rat \\"smarter\\" (ie maze bright).

I loved it and it has been with me ever since, especially the part about what happened to the rats in NIMH. 25 years later, as a primary school teacher myself, I reread the book with my class. I finally got my hands on the DVD and watched it with them when we finished the book.What a disappointment! Never has Hollywood sugar coated a story more pitifully than in the Secret of NIMH. Its great if you are 5 years old and want to see goodies and baddies running around with magic stones and slap stick humour. You could liken it to a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The sequence about NIMH itself was glossed over in seconds - the crux of the book!The characterisation was ludicrous and the narrative boring. Id be happy to send this to anyone, for free! Just get in touchRegardJemstar"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!!!","review":"This movie was awful. I'm not criticizing the animation, which was above par, but the story is nothing like that of the book. After reading the \\"Secret of Nimh\\" I wanted my 5 year-old to see the movie. Big mistake. The book is much better. The movie plot was changed substantially and instead of \\"smart\\" rats we now have \\"magic\\" rats.

From an era when children's movies didn't have to be painful for adults to watch, this brilliantly animated gem shines beautifully along with director Don Bluth's other films (particularly the Land Before Time and All Dogs Go To Heaven).That said, don't buy this DVD. With no extras, no widescreen option, and no director's commentary (which I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting), this DVD is an insult to the high quality of the movie it contains. Until the publishers realize that the original fans of this movie are grown up now, they won't make much money at all. Don't waste your money on this, if you have to watch this movie, use the old VHS tape your parents bought you - the picture and sound quality is liable to be better anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, awful DVD","review":"This movie has intense sentimental value to me, since I grew up with it as a child. When I discovered is was available on DVD I lept for joy and quickly baught it. However my joy has quickly fallen to disapointment. This is a pathetic DVD, no better then the VHS, from which I think it was transfered. Pan & Scan with a stereo audio track. The film is extreemly grainy and full of scratches. MGM is notorious for making horrible DVDs, and this is a classic example. Secret of NIMH isn't that old of a movie, I find it hard to believe they couldn't find an original print to do a good transfer from, rather then just copying the VHS. I sincerely hope they reevaluate this release and give us a remastered widescreen version in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Bluth's Best Movie","review":"I saw this movie on HBO Back in the 80's and loved it since - Don Bluth has made many other animated films, but none of them have the class, humor and the fantastic animation of \\"The Secret of Nimh\\". This was Bluth's \\"Citizen Kane\\" and he hasnt topped it yet.This was the only time the former Disney animator beat his former bosses with a excellent story and near-perfect characterization. While his other films were far more successful they always seemed to be expensive advertisments for toys with predictable plotlines. Those movies were fun for the little kiddies but, but not much fun for animation fans who wanted Bluth to be the savior of this great art form.My only gripe about the DVD is that it should have been redone for widescreen and 5.1 sound, my copy looks exactly like the VHS print. I guess since MGM thought it was just a \\"kids movie\\" they didnt need to spend any extra money to remaster it from a better film source and give it a high class presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret of NIMH","review":"This is by far one of the Greatest childrens novels ever written in this time.

Jeremy the crow is just plain annoying. My 4 year old likes it, so I can't give it one star. But if you've actually read the book, this pales in comparison, and not simply in the way that most movies are not as good as the book. It could have been so much better, but it has so much nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluth Needs to Jazz it Up","review":"I'm in agreement with Tankexmortis below. The DVD provides you NOTHING more than the VHS except format convenience. Considering the effort/money Bluth put towards reviving Dragonslayer and Space Ace, I would've expected this work of art to be digitally remastered with commentary, extras, etc. Don't be fooled by the new cover art. Hopefully, one day, Bluth will remaster the film - it truly deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the book","review":"this based on the book Mis Frisby and the rats of Nimh. But ssome things have been alterd. This is very intense movie with lot of scary parts. I recomend that little kids 7 or younger do not watch this film.I saw this the first time on VHS in the second grade and it scrade the daily lights out of me. Still a good movie Jenier is the most sinter villian since Cluny the Scourage.This film was made shorly after the originaly return of King was made. A good movie lots of actions and suspense. If you like adventure. I recomend if you like this 1 irecomend seeing the Secren of Nimh 2 they second one is alot less tense than the first one is. If you have realy little kids like 5 the second onne would be find. But unleash the are 9 or older you should not let them watch the original.

If you like this I also can recomend the redwall series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad...Unless You Want To Watch It","review":"I only saw this once or twice when I was a kid. It's a bit dark, like I like, which will be a lot of fun. I know that I will watch this over and over and it will be a classic. The only extra that's on the blu-ray is a commentary. I like commentaries, but I really wish they would've have a trailer, at least. Or maybe the making of featurette that was on the 2 disc blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have read the book","review":"This is a terrible corruption of an incredible book. I read the book when I was in fourth grade and loved it. My wife uses it now in class and her fifth graders love it. But the movie is only loosely connected with the book. Science has been replaced with magic. The rats' struggles against nature and NIMH have been replaced with a struggle against an evil nemesis. The heartrending ending in the book has been replaced with an action sequence. And the believable storytelling that makes The Rats of NIMH such a good book has been replaced with utter and unbelievable fantasty. Save your money to buy the book and read it with your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the movie??","review":"The 1 star rating isn't about the movie, it's a great movie; it's about the fact that it wasn't released in the original theatrical format.

No guy panning and scanning the entire film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Don Bluth's first full length animated feature, an adaptation of the book \\"Mrs. Frisby & The Rats of NIMH\\" is an engaging and enchanting film filled with strong animation and good voice acting, not to mention a great score by the late Jerry Goldsmith. A must for any family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done and pertinent to the times.","review":"The story is for children but deals with subject matter that we should all concern ourselves with.

If you already have the dvd, skip this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Children's Movie","review":"A lot of the children's movies and shows that come out nowadays are so annoying and not something I can stand to watch. I like this movie a lot and my kids do as well. It doesn't follow very closely to the book though, and that is one thing that kept it from getting a 5 rating. The most annoying thing is that her name is Mrs. Frisby in the book and Mrs. Brisby in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret of NIMH","review":"I read the book when I was in 4th grade and recently read it with my 9 year old. We followed it up with the movie. It follows the book fairly well although there are some parts not in sync. My daughter loved it because it brought the story to life and she could see if the movie looked like the pictures that she had created in her head. It was good seeing the movie because it opened the floor to discussion about the book, comparison to the movie and I think helps with the reading comprehension skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting on a special edition","review":"I absolutely love this film, words do not suffice... it's a wonderfully acted, subtle, funny animation masterpiece. Which is why the DVD doesn't do it justice. The visual transfer is awful, very grainy/compressed, no real menu options. It would be better if the original widescreen presentation were also available. It's painful when every frame is so painstakingly drawn, to miss what's happening on the edges. This is a great film that has touched several generations. It's unfortunate that MGM doesn't recognize the potential it has to touch people of a broad range of ages. Work of this quality deserves better treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should watch it!","review":"Its a good movie since it was made and i recommend on watching for first time watchers plus since I loved it hopefully people of this time will watch it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodents with heart.","review":"The best of Don Bluth before he went all dumbed-down Disney on us, \\"Secret of NIMH\\" was dark, with a well written story at its core that translated nicely for this flick. Better than anything Disney or WB has done in the past few years, \\"SON\\" is magical at its core, with enough depth to woo audiences both under ten and over. There are few movies that such a statement can really be said about without causing chuckles or eyebrow raising from parents or guardians.The story of Mrs. Frisby in a fight to save her youngest son, is a strong lead character, and female at that! Nothing is too much for her and she never backs down from the opposition, daring to seek out the owl and the underground rats. Seeing this again, its still fresh and brilliantly told, a must see for the young and old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, but worth it!","review":"I remember watching this movie as a kid. I was scared, but it's worth a rewatch anytime.

This title seriously needs to be restored. I accept the fact that some grain is present in the print, but is the dirt on the print . Would disney release one of their classic animated film looking like this. Some care needs to be taken and a little money needs to spent to restore these films before they are released on Blu Ray and you expect people to repurchase them!!!!

It grows on you more with each viewing and has become one of my favorite films of all time. Lightning in a bottle here, it doesn't come around too often, so this is a film that should not be missed! The special edition DVD release has a very good transfer, 3 commentaries, deleted scenes and an original feature-ette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"My favorite movie. Can't believe how excellent D. Hoffman's performance is, as well as T. Cruise and all others. I saw this movie with my parents when I was 18,which was 17 years ago and to this day, we still talk about Rain Man as our fave movie. So many funny quotes and mannerisms of the characters. Beautiful soundtrack as well. Glad to have it on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Amazon has the wrong information. The Movie is 1:85 ratio and the Blu-Ray is terrible quality.

The film exasperates me, disabled also, by perpetuating the syrupy sentimentality that disability carries some compensating ability - here (as usual) mathematical genius. Nature's not like that, sorry to say. What you're good at, you're good at, disabled or not. I specialised in languages because I love language, not because I have epilepsy. Yet, more and more this nonsense is ground out. Cases of the idiot savant are certainly known, but they're extremely rare. Parents and family who believe films like this (and e.g. A Beautiful Mind) are almost certain to be disappointed. Disabiled people aren't somehow inspired. They/we are just doing what we could do anyway. Can we please be a bit more realistic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rain man","review":"Great movie!!

The story of a greedy, selfish yuppy, Cruise, whom discovers he has an autistic brother played by Dustin Hoffman. It just so happens this autistic brother has inherited the family fortune. Being institutionalized and not even understanding the concept of money, Cruise kidnaps him. Then trying to swindle the institution to give him half the money. Cruise then takes Hoffman on a cross country roadtrip, where he bonds and finds love for this special person. A movie with some hilarious situations and some to make even the stone hearted teary eyed. Hoffman deserved that oscar 100%. One of the best acting performances I have ever been privalaged to have seen. This an essential to any DVD collection. A true film of the soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy a good drama, you'll love this movie","review":"I saw this movie for the first time in about 1991. I have loved watching this movie again and again over the past twelve years. Dustin Hoffman is a genius in the film. I say that because good acting is only good if you don't notice that it is \\"acting\\". I truly believed Dustin Hoffman was Raymond Babbit throughout the movie. The realism of autism brought out by Hoffman and the writers is spot on. I have a cousin who is an autistic savant, and the similarities are incredible -- and my cousin wasn't even born when I first saw the movie so watching it again later in years brought out another meaning for me.If you are the least bit curious, feed your curiosity. This is honestly a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This tape was a copy of a copy. Picture quality was very poor. Even a top line VCR did not help.

Lots of twists, shocks, blood and comedy mixed together as in the original trilogy. I am a HUGE Scream fan and of course the original Scream in 1996 still ranks as the best with its creative take on horror with comedy and twists mixed in. Scream 2 was okay and Scream 3 was better than 2. Scream 4 has some unique takes on newer horror flicks and has much much more blood than any of the others. Scream 4 is definitely the best since the original....Scream is an awesome series and I am really happy there will be two more coming up hopefully soon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SCREAM for Part 4 ...","review":"Well over due squeal to the trilogy series.Will there be a part 5 ... but have Sydney make a cameo at the end of films to help catch the killer or killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"This movies sucks beyond belief.

Surprisingly, \\"king of scary\\" director Wes Craven, does a mediocre job revamping the final sequel. It plays on the original Scream, and pretty has the same story line, just a tad bit more gruesome. The movie starts of with a series of movies with a movie. Scream 4, plays on the whole android/ iPhone bit, using an \\"app\\" to prank call people using the scream voice. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns back to Woodsbro to finish promoting her book. Coincidently it's the 10th anniversary of Woodsbro slaughter. The killer is threatening to kill everyone close to her, especially her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). I wonder who the killer is now....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why but please stop","review":"I should have known this was going to be bad when the theater made us wait for the next viewing because the projector not working. Owning the first 3 in the series I was wanting to see how this would go. \\"Sid grows up but the killing are still happening idea\\" the idea was good but the way they went about it was bad. Being a fan of the first 3 I was immediately drawn into how gail, dewey and sid would get through the film, so when all of these \\"newbies\\" started to die I really did not care as I had no interest in seeing them. So when the reveal was made, sure it was someone unexpected but they made it come off as stupid with the self inflicting of injuries.Plus at the end the tradional attack on Dewey was so weak compared to the other movies. Again I can see why they did it from a story standpoint and yes I will more then likely buy the dvd just to complete the collection but please go no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GO!!!","review":"I REALLY LIKE THIS FILM, ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I WAS KIND IN THE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WAS IFFY THAT'S JUST MY VIEW FROM IT. NOW AS I BEGAN TO WATCH THE FIRST FEW MINUTES I'M LIKE OKAY THEY WENT GOOFY WITH THIS HA ONLY TO BE TAKEN FOR A RIDE OF YES THIS IS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL NOT SAYING IT IS CAUSE SCREAM IS A CLASSIC. I LIKED WHERE THE ACTION AND PLOTS COME IN THEN YOUR LIKE IT MUST BE ONE OF THE MAIN PROTAGONIST HMM OR SOME OTHER PLAN THAT THE WRITERS DECIDED TO CONCOCT OVERALL I TRULY LIKED THIS FILM NOT TO OVER THE TOP NOR SILLY I RECOMMEND THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A FAN OF THE SERIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing really new but still fun","review":"The original is still the best, but this is a nice homage not only to the other Scream films but to horror films in general, esp. the postmodern kind.

Scream 3 had a half decent ending but it was easily the worst in the series because it was too funny. scream 4 however is funny but it has some intense moments and a fantastic ending. The motive behind the killer is fantastic and realistic especially considering a girl got herself pregnant just so she could get on how to be a teen mom. Scream 4 is the weirdest in the series and most different i will definitely say but it is without any doubt just as good as the second scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Option!","review":"Everythings Already Been Done, Only Reason I Gave It 2 Stars Is Because Wes Craven Did Write It, and They Used The Beverly Hills Cop Theme As Dewys Ring Tone.

Lame Ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, Dumber, and the Dumbest","review":"This was a rip off and Im GLAD I waited until it got to dvd to rent it. Not once did I jump. It was a rip off updated version of all 3 screams. The only difference was they use Facebook, texting and webcam ect to make it look like it was happening in our time. The beggining was just like the first scream lol they didnt even attempt to make the stabbing look real. They used the same lines as in the first movie. The rest of the movie you could easily guess what was going to happen next. Boring and big yawn. Sorry Wes Craven but your movies just arent scary anymore. Nice try."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCREAM 4","review":"I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes the SCRERAM series; it kept ME on the edge of my seat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but pitiful UK edition","review":"I loved this film. OK I'm a die hard Scream fan but I thought it was an intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable addition to the series. The Scream movies are all about having fun so for me all the ingredients were there. As for the pitiful UK release, those wanting special features should check out the region 1 US edition which has Alternate Opening, Alternate Ending, Wes Craven Commentary for Feature and Deleted Scenes, Making Of Featurette, Over 15 Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scream 4","review":"This movie didn't even make me scream or jump just like the first, second or third one. Scream 4 was boring and it dragged in certain parts. I almost fell asleep. It was just plain disappointing and predictable. The franchise should of stopped at number three. What was Wes Craven thinking of? \\"Show Me The Money!\\" The movie brings back three of the original cast members from the trilogy . Neve Campbell(Sydney Prescott),Courtney Cox(Gale Weathers), and David Arquette(Officer Dewey Riley). Sydney is back in her home town of Westboro promoting her self help book.

I'm so happy I just rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to Scream again!!!","review":"This movie is just amazing! of course not oscar amazing but a movie that will have you on edge of your seat! Especially if your a fan of the series, Scream 4 delivers but does not come close to the first Scream. Scream 4 has a shocking twist compare to the past scream movies. The revelation of the killer(s) will leave you very shocked! Scream 4 has a lot of humor that will sometimes think your watching Scary Movie. This movie is worth the $ so you will not be dissapointed if you buy it on bluray or dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, seen that...nothing new here","review":"Based on the overall 4-star rating here, I expected something that would not put me to sleep but that's exactly what happened with this film - I thought it would never end.

Though this is not the best movie of the series, it was a decent movie. Once again a few of the original characters return, which I as a fan really enjoy and appreciate. I am not to sure about them wanting to make two more movies though (them are the rumors I have heard), that just seems like a lit bit of overkill to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCRE4M The Perfect reunion (Spoilers)","review":"I loved this Scream reunion I thought it was Scary Bloody & Funny everything I like about the Scream movies. Scream being my favorite movie ever i had to pre-order it combo pack. I just love the big twist with Jill being the Killer. I kinda had a feeling about Charlie but Jill I had no ideas I mean they left no clues for us to figure out it was her. I think (as always) Courtney,David,& Neve did a great job. I LOVE the performence of Hayden Panettiere I liked Emma Roberts and liked the roles of the girls in the beginnin so Anna Paquin,Kirsten Bell,Lucy Hale, and all the other girls great job.Im waiting for Scream 5 Wes!Fav Quote- \\"First about making a remake dont mess with the original\\" -Neve Campbell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating \\"meta\\" to a bloody pulp...","review":"A movie so obsessed with its own superficial cleverness - it delivers NOTHING: no characters worth caring about, no humor, no real suspense...

So many horror sequels (or remakes for that matter), have really been a yawn. Scre4M is the exception! With the movie franchise's 3 main characters back for this installment, it's like seeing family you haven't seen in awhile. Campbell, Arquette and (plastic surgery disaster) Cox are a welcome back to the horror genre.I love how the movie starts with mock STAB sequels. I also like how they uped this franchise with the use of today's technolgy contacting the victims by cell phone and text. This movie is non-stop fun. The movie kept you guessing who was the new Killer(s).I say if the producers can still get Campbel, Arquette and Cox to stay on with the franchise, then bring on Scream 5 & 6!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep midway through","review":"yes. I did fall asleep because i thought it was cheesy, and not scary whatsoever. and by saying I fall asleep I mean literally. I kinda woke up from loud sound effects when Anthony anderson was getting killed, then found myself to fall back to sleep because i didnt really care how many times he got stabbed. the movie just didnt have that scary factor of the first and second. it seemed better than third. but that doesnt say much does it? its also really distracting to stare at courtney cox's Botox ridden face, and Sidney character just cant carry this franchise anymore. I personally didnt feel the groove on this but maybe if I watched it one more time I might change my mind. at this moment i gave it 2 stars. would I recommend this? yeah maybe a 15 year old slasher fan would enjoy it to the end. and nothing's wrong with that. and seeing ghost face again was nostalgic enough. but i hoped a better movie after 10 years of absence."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, NO!!!!!!","review":"Why are you people giving this movie such good reviews?!?!? Seriously, \\"Scream 4\\" SUCKS!I am a huge fan of the original \\"Scream\\" trilogy. Admittedly, the first movie was much better than the second and third, but \\"Scream 4\\" makes 2 and 3 seem Oscar worthy. You would think that Wes Craven had enough time to come up with a good script, but he so DID NOT. Yes, it is fun to see all these characters again, and it's fun to see a couple of currently popular actresses that I hate get butchered on screen, but the enjoyment ends there. This movie is all over the place. I don't think enough time is devoted to the original three characters. I also think the overall plot is SUPER lame. All of the new characters are incredibly annoying, and there just isn't anything redeemable about this movie AT ALL. What a disappointment. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theatres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"You'd think that after ten years of gestation the writer and director would come up with something better than...this. While horror movies demand a suspension of disbelief, the showdown scene at the movie's end and the revelation of the killer is utterly ridiculous. Truly. (I mean, I know there have been budget cuts in hospital staffing but....) My friends and I sat in the theater staring gap-jawed at how ripped off we all felt. While Scream 3 wasn't on par with 1 or 2, Scream 4 is an insult to the franchise. And can we all admit that although she has Eric for a father and Julia for an aunt, Emma Roberts clearly missed the talented-actor gene and is riding on the coattails--not for very much longer hopefully--of her famous relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back?","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the ending. And by the ending, I mean the screen cutting to black and the credits coming on, thus signalling the end of this crapfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first Scream Movie","review":"I loved Scream 4. I'm glad they waited to long to produce Scream 4 because it turned out to be awesome since it wasn't a rushed project. They acting was great and the suspence was awesome. For me Scream 4 kept me guessing to the very end who the killer was which I loved. With this movie you get a great slasher film with a side of comedy. Scream 4 brought some new elements into the movie and kept some of the old elements as well which worked great. To me this is the best Scream movie since the first one. If you like the Scream Franchise then you will like this one as well. Also if you like slasher films that are unpredictable then you will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly what I wanted, but true to form","review":"It's impossible to duplicate the amazement and awe we all felt in the mid-nineties when the original came out, but this movie does stay true to the Scream form. I felt like I was watching a 90's movie that had been lost, found, and released now. It felt a little out of place in today's world, but it sparked a sense of nostalgia in me that I totally appreciated! It was exactly what it was supposed to be, not too flashy, not too heavy with the weight of its own history, and just plain fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostface is Back With a Vengeance!!!","review":"Eleven years ago, I had thought we'd seen the last of Ghostface. I was 10 years old when Scream 3 came out, and now that I'm 21, I'm glad to see that Ghostface has returned for a new generation. This sequel is just as bloody, epic, and awesome as the previous Scream movies. On the Anniversary that Billy Loomis and Stu Macher had the original killing spree, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new self-help book. She reunites with Gale, Dewey, and her cousin, Jill. Soon after, Ghostface shows up and begins killing Jill's friends.

But, Everytime... brought tears to my eyes. It was the song I was looking for to listen to. Who would have thought it would be Britney's? Of course, there are other songs that describe how I'm feeling, but this one is a keeper. Too bad more of Brit's work wasn't/isn't like this.As a footnote, I'd like to add, that Justin's \\"Cry Me a River\\" also fits the tone from the other party (my ex who left me) So if \\"Everytime\\" is her reply to \\"Cry Me a River\\" it adds a little bit of \\"humanity\\" to the two Heavy-Partying Media-Hungry Stars who we all love to hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everytime Remixes","review":"Dont buy this version just buy the U.K version since they are the same remixes and cover art... the only difference is that this one has chinese/japanese/etc. letters on the side... and you pay more...its still worth buying it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's \\"Everytime\\" shines","review":"The song \\"Everytime\\" is Britney's most beautiful ballad. Though it states another writer, from interviews you'll see that Miss Spears composed this tune all herself, from the haunting lyrics to the simple and complex melody; sure, the other woman may have helped on instruments used other than the piano for the CD track, but know this: BRITNEY IS THE SOLE COMPOSER OF THE SONG. It is her most personal song and one of her first that she sounds attached to on an emotional level (being that is about her ex Justin Timberlake). Not only does this song sound good but she does too, and her unique throatinesss is perfectly set to the background as she glides fragiley through it. The remixes are worthy, but the original -almost ethereal in effect- stands far superior to anything any other DJs or writers can add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everytime [UK CD]","review":"Britney shows on this single her amazing vocals and proves that she is one accomplished vocalist.

In my opinion, it should have been the last song on the cd. The remix of Me Against The Music really shatters the sad and haunting mood this song establishes.Ok enough. This song was partly written by Spears while she was in Germany. It is a haunting and tear-jerker ballad. Britney's delivery comes across strong and convincing.Now about the remixes. Both Hi-Bias and Above & Beyond (who has remixed Madonna) deserve mad props for their condsideration for the material they were remixing, as they kept the sad and haunting melodic elements of the song awhile making it dancable at the same time. The same can - to some degree - be said for the Scumfrog remix, which is a dub which only has the first verse. His mix still keeps the somberness of the song and uses a synthesized vocal for the chorus line about mid-point."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess I need you, baby","review":"This is the first Britney thing I've ever bought, aside from her hype. I always thought she had a little more juh nuh say kwah than the other blondes--Brit's hair toss is a thing of genius, her glazed doe eyed stare speaks volumes...but her music meant little to me. Until I heard Everytime's tinkly music box ballerina hook and her weakly adenoidal, suffering vocal performance. And then she faked death in the song's video. Very compelling. The whole single package--remixes included--is most worthy of your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!","review":"This song, which is the first one Britney has ever written. It reminds me of my heart will go on, by Celine. The remixers took a power ballad, and turned it into a fabulous dance floor/club hit! I love every Britney remix.

Sorry I waited this long. I think that TONE is average at best, but this is a great CD. Now I understand the fuss about ERIC JOHNSON. His tone is almost violin like on some tracks and the instrumental compositions are 1st class. His playing is brilliant and stays away from cliche's. That often means eccentric and hard to listen too tones and stylings. Not on this, it is different but always a joy to listen too. Inspirational if you play the guitar yourself. Besides your jaw hitting your chest any number of times, this is very accessible guitar virtuosity. I felt that on TONE he was clever for cleverness sake. This is free of ego boosting trickery and concentrates on composition and content. His singing still leaves me cold, but is far less intrusive than on TONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own for guitar fans","review":"Every guitar fan \\"must\\" own this album. Along with Electric Ladyland, Goodbye Cream, Derick and the Dominoes Layla recordings, Led Zep II and maybe Allman's Live at the Fillmore, this is one of the all time great guitar albums from probably the world's greatest living guitarist."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon, Eric Johnson is the man","review":"EJ is just about the only shred head I can listen to and love. Impressively clean and intriguing lyrics (although most of the songs are instrumental), smooth clean vocals by EJ himself, amazing guitar skills while maintaining a non kick-in-the-face style (for those of us who don't want 'in your face' type music), and a couple of oddball songs (genre wise) thrown in to spice things up even more, as Eric always does. A great album by a fantastic guitarist, and in my opinion it's well deserving of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised...","review":"that everyone here seems to love this album so much. I bought it, in part because of these reviews. I feel gayer after having listened to it, and it's 40 minutes I will never get back. I gave it two stars only because I'm giving it the benefit of sounding better the second time around. It's basically a bad pop album with great guitar playing. Think Mister Mister with some chops. I love great guitar work as much as anybody, but why wrap it up in this sap fest? Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash over substance","review":"Eric Johnson can do pretty much anything that you could possibly think of with a guitar. Everything but write an interesting song. There is nothing you can say about the man's technical wizardry that hasn't already been said. The man is an amazing guitar player. But all the flash and polish in the world doesn't cover the fact that these songs are worthless. They're the kind of songs that you used to see on Star Search. You know the ones I'm talking about. Whenever they would have \\"rock bands\\" on the show. They would come out in their puffy satin shirts and play \\"rock music\\". Except it didn't sound anything like real rock music. It sounded more like what would happen on Saved by the Bell when Zack and the gang would get together and jam. That's pretty much what you have here from a songwriting perspective. Eric sure has practiced a lot though. Too bad he didn't spend any of that time learning how to write real songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Souds of an amazing yet lifeless guitarist","review":"Yes, Eric Johnson plays fast and proficiently but what's lacking here is any degree of emotion or soul. Seemingly his signature tune- \\"Cliffs of Dover\\", sounds like a run through asweep picking, wide range chord focused guitar lesson with a backbeat stolen from the F-Zero video game. Seriously, everytime that I listen to this guy, Satriani or Vai, I feel like I'm 12 and racing futuristic cars at breakneck speeds while eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew. Sorry, but thats just not what I want to come to mind when I listen to music, especially guitar music.Again, I'm not saying that Eric Johnson is by any means a bad guitarist. I respect his ability and technique. But, give me Wes, Burrell, Benson, Green, Hendrix, Muddy Waters, the three Kings, anyone with some palpable SOUL over this dreck anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star","review":"I have listen to this one lately and feel it sounds the same as other attempts to record music. Very good guitar technique, but there is no feeling beyond the notes played. A few songs have hope, but in general this CD bores me. No excitiment mentally, no real feeling. While I was listening to this CD, I was expecting to hear growth, and mature expression. Not found here. The only thing found in this CD is guitar licks that are really good and that you can learn to impress your friends, but nothing to seperates it from other guitar artists at all. This CD is a waste of ear time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great stuff is really great--but forget the filler","review":"This is a guitarist's guitarist. I've been listenting to Cliffs of Dover for years on full blast and it never fails to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. This guy's a genius--I also have his instructional video.But please, program your CD player to skip the songs with vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few hot licks, but that's it.","review":"He is a great guitarist, but this recording is of a very mediocre quality. I remember it being much better 20 years ago when it was originally released. Maybe this was a lower grade pressing done with cheaper equipment. I don't know what the problem is, though it's obvious there is one. Also, the cd jewel case arrived broken in a few places. This doesn't matter much, but with the sound quality issues it kind of completes the whole dissapointing package. This is a shame because the guitar playing on this album deserves better treatment from the production side of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've finally figured out why I don't love this album","review":"I first heard 'Trademark' a few months back on the radio, and decided to buy the album. I like it, but I don't love it. Why?I own 3 electric guitars and try to play rock/blues. I listen to a lot of old stuff like Eric Clapton, Led Zepp, Pink Floyd, Wishbone Ash.This boy can play guitar - there's no argument there. I'd give my eye teeth to be able to play like him. Very articulate with his speed - not just dirty chopping. Cliffs of Dover and Trademark are my favorites, but they're almost the same piece - I have to refer to the album cover to remember which is which.I find myself listening to a couple of tracks and then getting bored - to the point that I have to load another CD. The reason being that it's just him playing the guitar. The rest of the band is just a backing track. No funky bass riffs, no cool drumming, no interesting breaks - it's just Mr Johnson having a good time while the band jams along to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Execution of a great Guitar Style","review":"Eric Johnson has a perfect knack at the guitar as everyone knows, and this is one of the most technically well done albums ever. I still prefer this CD to some of his more recent work like Venus Isle, simply because this CD is filled with more of the great classical rock style that I like. Of course \\"Cliffs of Dover\\" is a great song, but I even like some of the more country type stylings of \\"Desert Rose\\" and I don't even like country sound that much. Highly reccomended for anyone who loves to hear a perfect guitar player, this is as close as it gets. My only complaint is that he's almost too good, the technical proficiency almost seems to trade off a little with the emotions of the music, maybe its just me I find myself listening so closely to the guitar that I don't let myself get carried away by the overall sound. Overall though if you like great guitar rock this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An infinite # of stars","review":"The Tao of electric guitar. Protege of Steve Morse, Eric Johnson is a prodigy few people have seen or heard. His songs are rarely, if ever, played - even on the the most \\"progressive\\" FM radio stations. And yet, he is, technically, a consumate artist. This album is a testament to his virtuosity.This is a seminal electric-guitar driven album. For more Eric check out his \\"Live at Austin City Limits\\" DVD and marvel at his wizardry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Eric Johnson has a very unique style of guitar playing, mixing fingerpicking techniques with soft upwards plectrum strokes for a softer and mellow sound. I have seen countless live peformances of this guy and it still amazes me how flawless it is. Although sometimes pefection is a flaw in itself, the raw energy and emotion of someone like hendrix or Johnson's texas counterpart stevie ray vaughn will really get inside you. Johnson's playing is alot more pretty than any other guitarist ive ever heard, i really enjoy the use of delay and warm mellow distortion in his playing. I also like the fact that in a time when speed metal stacatto picking was popular he did something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance, poor sonics","review":"This is a great performance by Eric Johnson, unfortunately it's the typical compressed / brittle sound heard on many 1980's CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest","review":"This album is so good someone stole my original when it first came out. This is the finest mix of electric styles on one album, maybe not ever but darn close. Jonnson has one of the cleanest most pleasing styles for guitar of this speed and precision. Johnson is the perfect example of a musician letting his instrument do the talking and defines the reason guitar players should not sing! PS whoever has my cassette tape would you please return it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Johnson is the man","review":"Ever since I was little, my dad (who is an incredible guitarist) told me all about other guitar greats. He mentioned names like Vinnie Moore, Jeff Beck, Steve Morse, and Eric Johnson. Well I had heard each one of these guys and I thought they were all awesome. Still, the only E.J. song that I ever heard was Cliffs of Dover, and never all the way through. So finally, after about 6 years of wonder, I bought this album and was astonished. His wide variety of style and very open leads left me amazed and often hitting \\"rewind\\". I still trip out every time i hear his stuff. Something else i saw was his performance on Austin City Limits back in 1989 or 1990 (im not sure), but his performance has gone unmatched compared to any other guitarist. In my opinion this is his greatest album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says it all","review":"Read this book to get better understanding of finance. This book helped develop my business acumen.

I will not purchase any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This was a hard book for me to get interested in to begin with. But I kept reading and it really did get better and then I thought I was missing some of the book. I even went back a couple of pages on my Kindle thinking I hit the forward button by mistake. Here in what I would have thought was the middle of the book are all these character discriptions and some of the characters were not even in the book. Any series I have ever read had a beginning, middle and an end. The books could have stood alone, but made me want to continue reading the series to see how the story and the characters evolve. I felt with this book I really was missing part of the book. I doubt I'll finish this series unless the rest of the books are offered for free or the 99 cent special.

Even though it was free, I still feel short changed. Chapters about each character until you wondered what you were reading about.

All of a sudden the book was done; finished; over. It was like a sample book of the real book. What a nerve this author has selling this. I will never buy the sequels. Apparently, the author is only trying to introduce us to all of the characters so that we might know who they are in the upcoming books. A book for each character.

What a joke that thought was. There is no ending!! Seems as if I have to purchase another book to get that ending .. or will I have to buy a third one??? Not unless it also will be a Daily Deal. I love to read but this is the first time I have read a book with no ending. There are many, many authors who write series (Robin Carr, Debbie Macomber, Catherine Coulter to name a few) who finish each book with an ending and leave us wanting more of their work.

I kept waiting for something to happen, but the ending solved nothing. I felt like I'd been introduced to these various people and their stories, only to have it go nowhere.Entirely too much of the book was taken up with endless descriptions of getting a cup of tea, or glass of champagne, with entirely too little devoted to any kind of outcome.We were obviously supposed to get hooked on the characters, then purchase the upcoming books. I won't be doing that.A good example of various characters and subplots handled in a wonderful way is Robyn Carr's Virgin River Series. Each book (including the first) deals with a major plot, and other smaller ones. It draws the reader in (addictively, I might add) to learn more, to meet more of these people, to anxiously await the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel","review":"I kept waiting for a story to evolve, and was disappointed.

Great reviews so it can't be bad, right? Wrong. I rarely write a poor review. This book was TERRIBLE. It was super slow getting started. I felt like a pinball in a pinball game bouncing from character to character. NOTHING was resolved in the first book - no closure on any issue. There are more books in the series but none of them are available on Kindle. This was worse than a soap opera. Once the story got going a little, there was a glimmer of hope but it was shattered when the book finished and NOTHING was resolved. This is the first book I regretted paying 99 cents for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a book, it's a series of incomplete backstories","review":"There is no plot, there are too many characters, and nearly everyone is out for themselves. Personally I'm fine with books that have minor stories about people going about their lives, but there is no story here; no beginning and no end. There are lots of character introductions, nearly all with hidden pasts, greedy aspirations, and selfish goals. If I lived in a town like that I'd be gone in 5 minutes. No thanks, and no interest in any sequels because there aren't any characters I want to get to know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ending","review":"I wish I had read the customer reviews before ordering this book and not only wasting my money but also my time reading it.

The book ends with nothing resolved. I know I will not be buying any other books in this series. I hated to even give it one star.

Hands down, it has been the most disappointing book acquisition I have made, and has triggered this review, my first ever, as an attempt to warn others. The writing is average,and there are numerous misspellings and/or typos. The author employs the method of introducing her steroetypical characters one at a time, but never weaves their lives together to resolve any of the plot issues.I felt like the book was a pilot to a TV serial drama, so was not surprised to find the author had a background in soaps. But even daytime dramas typically have a storyline that is intelligible, and in which at least some subplots are resolved. This book had neither, and would be more appropriately called an introduction rather than a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read only if you like soap opera","review":"The 5-star reviews of this book swayed me into buying the book. Now I wonder how anyone could give it five stars. Toward the end of my reading, I thought the book was like a soap opera then read that the author was a soap opera actor. Okay, so that explains things. What a bunch of misfit characters. Do people really act like this? I don't think so. The characters were all caricatures -- either good or bad with no in between.

Al Pacino is one of the most attractive bad guys in the film world. This film, however, doesn't draw on his genius or the genius of the previous two films. The plot is thin and doesn't always make sense. The film's romance borders on immoral. The bloodshed seems overdone. Michael suddenly seeks redemption when his character is so much more effective when he doesn't apologize or explain any of his actions. The only reason this film gets two stars is because of Vincent, who is thoroughly entertaining, even if his character is entirely inconsistent and poorly developed. The film world would be a better place if this film had never come into existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it's the weakest one, but c'mon...","review":"After seeing the reviews for this i was sceptical to say the least.

I don't know why they bothered to make this film anyway. Part 2 was practically the end. Part 3 seemed like a non-significant extention. What was the real plot? Whatever it was, it didn't live up to the word \\"Godfather\\".

Masterpieces. But this one was a complete and total failure. Some have tried to review it \\"on its own terms.\\" I cannot do this; it is part of a series and it must be reviewed as the final installment of that series.The plot is absurd. Michael Corleone wants to go completely legit by buying some Vatican-owned company. Then, the pope and some corrupt bishops get thrown into the mess. Add to this his daughter (horrible actress playing her part), his son (what a puss), and his ex-wife trotting around (give me a break) Italy with him and you have a real loser on your hands.This movie has nothing of the magic that made the first 2 so great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. The first two Godfather movies suffice.As the climax of this trilogy, one would have expected much, much more.

Yet another case of nepotism at it's worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd best movie ever made!","review":"this movie only ranks 3rd to the Godfather I & II, cause this moive is amazing though not as good as the first and second by very little. still al pacino plays the role of micheal corleon so well and andy garcia is great also. anyone who liked the other two or any movie like these or any that depict italian american times like these movies certainly do will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie has all the elements of the first two Godfather movies - the long dramatic scenes, the gruesome mob hits, and the dark atmosphere. What really threw people off this movie is that it is set much later than the first two films. If you made a movie about the 1970's, then made one about the 1990's, would they be the same? No. Go into this movie expecting an original Godfather piece, and you will be dissapointed. Go into it with an open mind, and you will see the greatness in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK film, hardly stands up to legendary predecessors.","review":"The Godfather is the movie to watch when it comes to originality and sheer brilliance. The Godfather Part II is more than perfect if you wish to see a worthy sequel. However, it is Godfather Part III that made me want to buy the first two seperate and not all three in a box set. Part III is good in some parts, but I really didn't like it much at all. It wasn't as purely emotional, raw, as the others were so fine at, and it just didn't capture my attention very well. I say, if you feel you need to see this movie, rent it, see it once, just to say you've seen it. But I saw it once, I can say I'll not see it again, and thus, won't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy installment to a great trllogy","review":"Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for making this last installment to the Godfather Trilogy a worthy one. Although, in my opinion, it's not the equal of the first two, it can still boast of a good cast and a well developed story line. Of particular note are the performances of Eli Wallach and Andy Garcia. Wallach's portrayal of the Don Altobello charactor shows a transition from a wise but weary old man to a devious planner of murder. Even his voice becomes stronger. Garcia shows resolve in his depiction of the heir apparent Don."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slap in the face to the first two","review":"If you enjoyed the first two Godfather movies, you're not going to enjoy the third. Compared to the first two and other great Mafia movies, the Godfather 3 pails in comparision. Francis Ford Coppola should have stopped after the second and he shouldn't have casted his daughter to play Mary Corleone. Bottom line.....The movie sucked!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up","review":"This movie was a bomb. I rated it 2 stars only out of respect for Pacino and the rest of the family. Unfortunately the movies has to be seen if you are a fan of the godfather series, which most people are. However this movie was a huge mistake by Coppola, what was he thinking. Pacino made this movie shorly after Dick Tracy and in many scenes he looks and sounds like the character he played in that movie. The movie was very painful for me, as a huge fan of the first two movies. Pacino lived in some apartment like building, which I never figured out why. Connie (Shire) was left to call some of the shots on hits and other things, which was weak. The weakest however was the scene at the opera which draged on longer than any other scene in my memory, what a bore. What a shame this movie was, I think Coppola should come out and say he blew part three and has decided to redo it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"One of the greatest movies ever made. Something you will watch again and again. Also educational about the Mafia. Enough Said"},{"rating":"1","title":"why why why !","review":"What was the author thinking while writing the third book in this series? To compare this film alone I might have given it 3 or 4 stars, but after watching the first two movies I can't give it more then 2. Big mistake on the author part to change the scene from real bad mafia guy to a want to be good mafia guy, that ruined the whole movie. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't heard what they are saying. Is just like the first two","review":"Pacino in his best performance. Francis Ford Coppola's last great film (with \\"Dracula\\" of course). Don't miss it. Is just PERFECT as the pevious two where.

A wonderfull picture.And, like I said, J U S T ...PEEEEERRRRRFFFFFEEEECCTTTTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STAR!","review":"Reason #1: Coppola's daughter couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.

Yawnnn........"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad ending to an otherwise great series","review":"Compared to the first two movies, The Godfather III was a disappointment. The plot was difficult to follow, the acting was often poor, and the writing was tortured. Worst of all was the daughter, who had no chemistry with any other character, least of all her lover/cousin. When she died, my immediate reaction was, \\"That might actually save the movie.\\" Then the movie ended, and my thought was, \\"That's probably best - this movie wasn't worth saving.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good, but in a class by itself.","review":"This movie just doesn't add up to the prior two movies. However, you can't really compare the two classics with this version. I agree that the casting of Sofia Coppola was not very good. She seemed lost in the role as Don Michael's daughter. However, I enjoyed Andy Garcia portrayal as the heir apparent of the Corleone family. Al Pacino is great once again in the role Michael. I also enjoyed Coppola's direction and Gordon Willis' cinematography. This version is in a class by itself. A very good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A 'Godfather' like feel to it","review":"This movie is much different than the other two GF'S. This one has Michale wanting forgivness for being in the Mafia, while his life deteriorates before his eyes. Not a great movie, but I didn't think that Sofia Coppolo was a bad actress like everyone says. The best thing about the movie is the end. This way, there can be no more Godfather movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as parts 1&2","review":"Everyone must stop bashing this film, and Sofia Coppola. The Godfather 3 is just as good as parts 1&2. I personally am glad that Winona Ryder became ill, did not play Michael's daughter, because Winona isn't a good actress. Sofia Coppola is excellent in her role, and she and Pacino should have been nominated for a oscar. I must applaud both of the Coppola's, Francis and Sofia for his excellent directing, and her for her great acting. I recommend this film to evryone, because it is a superior film with a great ending, to the best film series ever made. Thank you Mr. Coppola for this great sequel. Great acting by Sofia Coppola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's wrap it up","review":"To be honest, I saw this one on television, a big fan on numbers 1 and 2. I wasnt too crazy about this one as it seemed rather drawn out and the cast not as \\"giant\\" as the others. However, owning 1 and 2 I wanted to \\"wrap it up\\" and have the complete set. This purchase is worth it for that reason but of itself alone, buy the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Disappointment.","review":"The worst things about this film are the inclusion of Sofia Coppola who seems to think that she is Rita Hayworth but looks and acts about as appropriate in the role as a puppet from Kukra, Fran and Ollie would... and... the exclusion of Robert Duvall whose presence could have saved this depressing mess. I gave it 2 stars for a couple of good action sequences but it does not measure up to the first 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":".Believe me here when I say I'm being objective. After putting off watching this movie for so many years because I was afraid it could not approach the genius of the first two movies, I bit the bullet. Unfortunately, my worst fears came true as I struggled to follow this movie.I will refrain from taking shots at individual performers and stick with the movie. It was agonizingly slow and hard to follow. At times, I found myself struggling to keep up with all of the different characters, who came and went, and came again, etc.I suppose that people should see this movie for the sake of \\"closure\\" but that's as far as I can go. I'm still reeling from the disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the trilogy","review":"I had to get this movie because I own Godfather I and II. I liked Godfather III, but I wasn't as thrilled as I was with the previous movies. I think that because it was so long between the second and third movies had a real negative effect on the third installment. I'm glad that I got it, to complete the trilogy, but it was out shined by the other two. But, it is a decent installment that brings these movies to a close."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that people love to hate.","review":"This movie has several downsides. First it falls prey to poor casting. Sophia Coppola, bless her soul, is a great director (see the Virgin Suicides) but is a dreadful actress. Andy Garcia is a great actor, but not a believable replacement to Vito and Michael Corleone.The saving grace for this movie is the scream. If you have seen this movie you know what I am talking about. Al Pacino can scream like no other actor alive or dead. The scream when Don Corleone's daughter is killed pierces your soul and makes this a 4 star movie after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francis Ford Coppola's \\"The Godfather, Part III\\"...","review":"THE GODFATHER, PART III: From The First Frame Of This Operatic, Shakespere Influenced Final Chapter In The Screen's Finest Gangster Epic, We Are Thrust Back Into The Larger Than Life World Of The Corleone Family...It Is Two Decades After The Modern Day Events In \\"Part II\\", And Don's Son Michael (A Brilliant Performance By Al Pacino) Has Managed To Move The Family Out Of Crime And Into Legitimate Enterprises...But Sinister Forces Lurking Within His Empire Compel Michael To Revert To His Old, Violent Ways - With Tragic Consequences...Starring Al Pacio, Diane Keaton, George Hamilton..."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a let-down for the excellent series","review":"the first two established the godfather series as one of the best series and movies ever made.showed epic proportions and brillant filmaking. this one however is quit a let-down. somewhat overdone, overlenghted and tight. but still its a must-see for fans of the first two classics. has great acting(except maybe sophia coppla) and suspense and good story. the violence is the films strengh. unfortunatley the drama isnt as effective but still remains strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downgraded due to expectations and nepotism","review":"This probably should be a 3 star in a vacuum, but its a sequel so it is fair to judge it in context. The first two Godfather movies are two of the greatest films ever. Therefore, expectations were this would be a very good movie at a minimum. When I go back to I & II, III pops up in my head from time to time making those less enjoyable. So I downgrade beause I was very disappointed and it impacts I & II it's so bad.Upside: Andy Garcia was very good in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak as hell","review":"I don't know what Bob Evans had to do with the first two Godfathers but his presence is surely missed here. Coppola has always taken credit for the first two Godfathers being masterpieces but part 3 shows that he clearly didn't do it on his own. As a matter of fact, the more I watch part 3 the more I think Bob Evans side of the story is more realistic. Wow, this movie sucks. Its horrible.Two good things about this movie, Pachino's performance and very beautiful cinematography. Everything else is pure garbage. The Godfather had three sons. Sonny, Michael, and Fredo. Part three is Fredo. Part three is dead to me. And I pray to GOD, that the rumors I hear about making Pt.4 are just that...rumors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT part of the Godfather saga, at least shouldnt be!","review":"Saw Godfather I & II 15 years ago. After that, read reviews about the III and wasnt really sure to watch it or not. Bought all 3 -then found out theres a 4th and a 5th- and sit down for a godfather weekend marathon.Really regret watching it. Its like having a great steak and a great wine and the worst desert youve ever tasted, washed the whole dinner.Really wonders what Pacino was thinking when taking the job. Bad dialogues, bad script, bad dialogues BAD MOVIE. Simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting book","review":"Reading this book has enabled me to look to choosing directions within my life that I had not thought of before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Doesn't the Lexus Complete You?","review":"If you've ever bought something to keep up with the \\"Joneses,\\" then this book is for you. Schwartz has a unique argument--that having more choice is making us less happy--and provides many examples to prove his points. Overall, it is an entertaining and enlightening read. Unlike authors who write on similar topics, Schwartz provides a clear and detailed set of solutions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it seemed a little repetitive to me at the beginning. If you read a lot of books on consumerism in America, you might feel the same way, but it is still worth a read all the way through for the unique ideas in the final half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and thought-provoking book","review":"This book aims to explain that Americans literally get too many options for their own good and it accomplishes that goal admirably well. The book is at its best, however, when it relates how the human mind operates before, during, and after making a decision.Schwartz spends about half the book laying out the ways in which each of us conciously or subconsciously compare ourselves to others, get accustomed to new levels of fortune or misfortune, and constantly seek to improve our lot even when it no longer behooves us to do so. The ideas he lays out are excellent for improving your own approach to life or to help you understand what drives other people.Highly recommended for people who enjoy social-sciences and the often irrational workings of the human mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"I only read 40% of the \\"Paradox of choice\\" but so far it's A GREAT BOOK. Very usefull for my job and for my life. Ironic and unconventional, well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thesis/point, poor presentation/evidence","review":"The evidence was as solid as a '1 out of 10 dentists' endorsement on a toothpaste commercial. I understand what he's getting at with his thesis but 56% of this book used 100% of its pages to use 95% out-of-the-air statistics. Not to mention, the opening just pretty much boiled down to a conversational tone akin to Andy Rooney where he was mad because he went to buy jeans and THERE WERE TOO MANY JEANS!!! There are other books by writers touching on this subject that do a better job addressing the topic. C. Ryan's review says it best with regards to the nitty gritty about why this book has issues and I couldn't have phrased it better. Buy this if you CHOOSE to but don't have a cow about having to choose a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no wonder I don't shop anymore","review":"Finally someone has analyzed with insight and humor how negatively the endless choices in our society have become...and I was thinking of seeing a therapist. Thank you, Dr. Schwartz, for putting the abundance of choice in perspective and creating an awareness for the average consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Less is More: Another Explanation","review":"A group of us (men and women) read THE PARADOX OF CHOICE for a book discussion group. We liked the book's thesis. Most of us have gray hairs on our head and felt that the conclusions drawn by the author were validated by our own experiences, insights, and conclusions. It was interesting, however, seeing some of the science behind the insights. At times the book is repetitous or goes on too long about the obvious, but all in all a worthwhile addition to literature about how much our subconscious and conditioned behavior control our actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile read","review":"i had to read it for class, but i enjoyed it and made me think about all of my purchases"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good albeit pretty obvious.","review":"I thought that although a lot of this was common sense it did in fact bring me to thinking about things a little differently. Worth reading for sure although it felt a bit like a sociology/communications type class haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Introductory Book","review":"If you are looking to get into the issues and pitfalls of decision making, this is a very good and fun book to test the waters. While it has way too many redundant examples of decisions we are all constantly faced with, it does a great job of identifying each of the components of most of the decisions we make. It is a quick read and very interesting. Perfect fodder for a cocktail party and you will learn something new. I am just not sure it really had to be quite as long as it was. It could have accomplished the same thing in 75% of the pages or included more discussion of the scientific research on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and pedantic","review":"The author's point is that having too many choices doesn't improve life; and, in fact, it can even be detrimental. It takes extra energy and thought to choose from among the dizzying array of choices that surround us; but that effort doesn't yield a corresponding increase in satisfaction with our choice and often yields _less_ satisfaction than if we had made a decision faster. That's it. That's the whole book. A person could read the first two chapters, the last two chapters, skip the (largely repetitive and very pedantic) middle of the book and still get the basic take-away message."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.","review":"Choosing can be hard, psychological transaction costs if you will. But the book concludes that these costs, because they can be high, means that more is less. As is all too common in these big idea books, there are some interesting ideas but the book fails to move satisfyingly beyond the main idea (say, to the unintended consequences of limiting choice). Hopefully all the readers that like the book and take its ideas to heart will focus on improving their own lives and not mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If your like me and want to understand why making choices are so difficult and what you really gain from deliberating for so long you should definitely read this book. It is very enlightening, easy to read, informative, and fairly concise with plenty to back it up. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"How we make choices.","review":"This is a great book about how we make choices and the possible drawbacks when we have too many before us. It's main emphasis is the psychology of choosing. Schwartz writes clearly and gives pleanty of examples to illustrate his arguments. I thought The Paradox of Choice was going to focus more on Marketing and how buisnesses decide what products to release. This said, it is still immensly helpful in understanding how we make decisions, which it seems the marketers are well aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book & helpful practical advice","review":"Schwartz' excellent book, \\"The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less\\", is fascinating to read. I saw him on the MacNeil News Hour & was really looking forward to this newly published book. The book exceeded my expectations. Practical advice within a tantalizing read. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"backwards logic","review":"This book is a poor excuse for academic thought. Instead of serious research, all he is doing is justifying his political beliefs. He starts with these beliefs and then tries to justify them over and over. For example, he pines for the days when there was one phone company and one phone. Well, in those days, long-distance phone calls cost $1/minute (the equivalent of $5/minute now), and hence only the wealthy could afford them. We all get frustrated when we have to book a plane, but would it be better to go back to the 1960's when again, only the wealthy could fly. The \\"choices\\" have made access to these products available to many more in our society.Another false tenet is that society should take away choice to \\"help\\" us. Who gets to decide this?? As if there is this intellectual body that \\"knows\\" what is better for you. Only a guilt-ridden person such as the author could actually think this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my...","review":"Anyone who's ever purchased a mobile phone plan knows large arrays of choices are aggravating and can create undue & unneccesary stress. It turns out that large arrays of examples supporting your thesis are also aggravating when they're nothing more than the exact same information wearing a different skin. Mr Schwartz had me from Chapter 1 in this (negative) respect.I found Paradox of Choice to be eminently skimmable, and - on the bright side - leaves the reader with little or no guilt (therefore no stress) when setting the book down with no intentions of picking it back up again.To be fair, Mr Schwartz' solutions to a less stressful life are straightforward enough. They basically amount to \\"moderation\\", which is something common sense tells us (whether we choose to listen is another matter), and does not require this book.That's one less choice you have to make - you're welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read!","review":"If there was a class on the sociology of shopping, this would be a required book. A fascinating read on the challenges fraught during a shopping experience and the evolution of choice during the 21st century.

I will contue to bellive my lying eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Don't bother reading these praising reviewers; they're being paid by advertisers. This book is nonsense. I would recommend it to grade school pupils writing their first social studies paper. It consists of 90% common sense knowledge that every American consumer already knows, which he redundantly spews out with tedious examples chapter after chapter, and the rest is elementary social and economic vocabulary juxtaposed with a few statistics which are openly available to the public. Just another personal journal from a charlatan who landed a publishing deal. I can't believe this guy calls himself a professor."},{"rating":"1","title":"paradox of surprise","review":"I was actually surprised at how boring this book was. No solid examples of what I thought was boring, but it was, as another reviewer wrote, pedantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words, too little detail","review":"Unfortunately, Barry Schwarz is a very smart man that isn't good with stating and backing up his ideas. There is some interesting stuff in here but could be a lot more interesting if it was backed up with more studies and research and even surveys or things like that. Most of the book is just the author talking about the subject and what he thinks about it and going on about it. It makes for easy reading, but it lacks in depth. The book could just as easily be 1/2 it's length and make itself just as useful but twice as efficient. There are better choices out there (pardon the irony), though this book isn't a complete waste of time and as I said, at least it's easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Business Leadership & Software Engineering MUST HAVE","review":"All business leaders and professional software engineers MUST read this book. There are many insights in this book that you all probably already know, but that it will help reinforce, identify and provide a foundation for taking the concepts into your everyday business practices and decisions.While this provides a general psychological/sociological overview of the issue, it also presents some wonder examples of how to deal with things that are related.A good read for all, but a must have for all the engineers and overall \\"thinkers\\" out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a good book, but not great. It has a great idea that with more choices, we bring more stress upon ourselves, but that seems obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less is not always more","review":"Schwartz has interesting insight and the book is easy to read. Though some readers may find that Schwartz's ideas are somewhat old fashioned, this is coming from a reader that appreciates the choices available to him. But still I must urge people to read this book because you will begin to look at the choices you make more criticaly than prior to reading The Paradox of Choice. I will admit even though I do not agree with all of Schwartz's theories his knowledge on the psychological point of view of choices are invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are too few real choices","review":"I do not debate the point that too many products and choices lead to confusion and confusion leads to unhappiness. I would like to suppose that what the book sites as too many choices, in fact amounts to very few ones. That most choices we are facing are not choices at all, but the same stuff in different packaging to create an illusion of choice. The examples are many and range from tires manufactured by the same company from the same materials on the same production lines under different brand names and sold for different prices, to political parties that pursue the same policies but differentiate by ideological rhetoric.The premise of this book is stupid or dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a satisficer, maximizer or a perfectionist?","review":"Are you a satisficer, maximizer or a perfectionist? I would have preferred that Schwartz not use the same examples thruoughout. I feel sorry for those who are paralyzed by too many choices.

Though it has lots of names, almost every name says \\"see this name\\" under the meaning. It gets very frustrating! So if you care what your child's name means, this book will drive you crazy! Pregnant hormones are enough right?If you just want a list, I wouldn't even recommend it, I love The Baby Name Wizard.

Why cant the author just insert the meaning again instead of writing only \\"variation of ....\\"? Also, the meanings of names in this book differ from other sources. Which source is correct?

I would also recommend The Best Of Peter Tosh CD which is totally militant from start to finish.I hope this review was helpfull.Let Jah be praised and the wicked mon schatter."},{"rating":"2","title":"it must be equal","review":"though gone, but not forgotton. we must strive to find peace on earth. peter has a place in history that still lives. JAH!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like it real this is it PETER TOSH at his best","review":"When it comes to roots nobody is as tough as TOSH, with possible exception being the late great BOB MARLEY. In this production TOSH hits the mark with great selections such as DOWNPRESSER, EQUAL RIGHTS and I AM. If you are looking to start or update a true reggae colection leave MAXI PRIEST and SHABBA RANKS to the FM radio stations and put your twelve dollars down on an investment in true classic reggae music. Comments to follow on JIMMY CLIFF, GREGORY ISSAACS, BURNING SPEAR, DENNIS BROWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dub?","review":"One of the great reggae albums ever. Peter was a wonderful artist. The problem here is the bonus material. Was very excited to listen to some Tosh given the dub treatment, however, this is not very \\"dubby\\" at all, but rather just a bit compressed and remixed. Some trax reach out a bit, but overall a \\"Legacy\\" edition could have taken us on the full ride to the outer reaches. Still, these songs are plain great and are a plesure to listen to...maybe that's why I'm seeking the 12 minute extended voyage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start a reggae collection","review":"I don't have an extensive reggae collection, so I may not be the best judge, but of the three Tosh albums I have (this, Legalize It, and Wanted), this is the clear winner. Start here. If you don't like this, you're probably not going to be a reggae fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tosh's Best Studio Album","review":"This album is Tosh's best studio offering. It is his first album with the legendary rhythm twins, Sly Dunbar (drums) and Robbie Shakespear (bass). You can't go wrong here if you want some great conscious reggae. There aren't any bad songs on this album. The best songs are \\"Downpressor Man,\\" \\"I Am That I Am\\" (my favorite), \\"Stepping Razor\\" (a song covered by Sublime), \\"Equal Rights,\\" and \\"Jah Guide.\\" While Tosh's best overall album is probably \\"Complete Captured Live,\\" this is right there with it. Don't hesitate to buy it if you like reggae at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Reggae Album Of All Time","review":"This is the recording that started my ongoing 17-year love of reggae, and although I like a wide variety this is hands down still the best. Incredible sound production - perfect lush quality, so clean and fresh. The songs are so well written they (like Bob Marley's best) transcend the genre and simply belong in any music fan's collection. Even people who aren't reggae fans appreciate having this on 'cause it's all SO GOOD. Thanks Peter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Particles of Truth is a must see!","review":"If you are a Gale Harold fan and want to see him be different from Brian Kinney I suggest you see this movie!!!! Even though the movie isn't all about him he is in it enough. Gale gives a great performance and so does Jennifer, very well directed. Gale is shy, adborable, and his relationship with Jennifer's character was real and something you could relate to. There isn't really that good of extras except that there is comentary from Gale and Jennifer and it is funny. The movie flows very well and it is one of Gale's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected","review":"Truthfully, I bought the movie because I am a fan of Gale Harold and I wanted to see his portrayal of the character. Not only was I pleased by his interpretation of Morrison, but in the end I was won over by the other characters as well. At some point in our lives, we allhave some of the same insecurities Lilli, Morrison, Flora and the others have, maybe not as pronounced, but they are there, and Jennifer's story lets us know it's OK. We are human, and we are all worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmmm . . . interesting.","review":"The most intriguing thing about this movie is Gale Harold.If you prefer mainstream movies then this is not the movie for you, if you are an indie connoisseur then you will want to see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a particle of amusement","review":"Truthfully, I kept hoping there would be a turning point. It was definitely not an amusing film. Other than watching the actors perform in isolated vignettes as one would watch a Thespian college classroom exercise, the film had nothing to acclaim. The editing was not stellar. Good try by Mr. Harold, but nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very itnteresting movie","review":"Basically it's a story of two people living in solitude and with their very own problems due to their personal history and you can watch them develop and grow somehow in such a short period of time - within 48 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Particles of Brilliance","review":"A uniquely pieced together story with appealling lead characters.

(So did several thousand other very bright people.) The author has a few valid points about the difficulties of managing a large hardware, software, and human, integration project. However, if the book had been presented as a fictionalized account or as his personal memoir I would have less difficulty with it. I think that it is misleading to present it as a book with technical merit or validity. It's just one person's view of what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"pompous joke","review":"This book is like the emperor's new clothes -- if you aren't carried away by the brilliantly obscure allusions, you must be poorly educated. Ok. I'll be the one stupid enough to say \\"uh, excuse me, but...\\". I bought this book believing the title was serious, and that the blurb (and forward) by Robert Glass had some meaning. I'm actually embarrassed by how far into the book I got before I finally realized I'd been totally \\"had\\". I thought the obscure references must have more meaning than I was literate enough to get. In fact, there is no real content to this book. There's nothing but tease. It flits around, goes off on silly tangents, but never actually gets to any meat about \\"the limits of software\\". I've bought a lot of computer science-related books from Addison Wesley over the last 30 years, and I'm very surprised, and disappointed, that they published this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably boring","review":"When I was in school (including college) history teachers considered it a sacred duty to convince us that history is boring and irrelevant and having to take it was our punishment for being kids. This book is right up their alley. It's the stuff of Alice Through the Looking Glass when characters who've fallen in the river dry off by reading history. It's all questions and answers without any explanation or discussion or hint of why anybody should care. I've been a history buff for a lot of years, but I couldn't find anything to like about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment - sorry.","review":"I'm a huge fan of David's, love his unbelievable creativity and most of all, his ability to blend music and sounds that sweep over you and draw you into his vision. But for me, this CD was a bust. It's really nothing but a collection of chiming, tingling, and (yes) mystical sound effects. No real music. It just drones on and on. Something you'd hear playing in the background of a fortune teller's shop, to be sure. Sorry to disagree with those 5 star ratings, but before you buy this CD, I suggest you listen to it completely to be sure it's what you think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Overall I thought it was a really good read. I finished it in two days. However, I felt the beginning of the book was the most enticing. I was kind of disappointed that there was not a very exciting climax. I also wish she would of elaborated more at the end. However, I think it was a very good and fun romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"This may be the second book in thirty years that hit my garbage can rather than book exchange or my library. Despite good plot, plenty of action, intriguing characters, and likable protagonists, I felt dirty when I finished. The good plotwork kept me going, but the explicit brutal sexual treatment (raping of mind-damaged teenagers as a cultural element) left me ashamed that I didn't throw away the book mid-read. Harlequin at its worst made me feel almost this disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad !!","review":"The storyline was great, it was riveting to say the least but I it was too short.

Ms Hooper is indeed a talented writer, however, in this book, she surpasses anything that she has ever produced before. In her inimable style she weaves a story so enthralling that the reader is actually desolate when the story ends.A wizard with years of training finds someone who has great power and decides to train this being - the only problem is that it is female, and females are not allowed to be wizards. Females are actively hated and distrusted by wizards, so the protagonists take it upon themselves to find out why - and end up in Atlantis just before it was destroyed. Need I say any more???When two powerful forces of come together, a wizard and a sorceress, there is only one outcome - magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Kay Hoopers best","review":"I looked at the book because I saw It was Kay Hooper already one of my favorite writers. The title screamed time-travel so I bought it when I started reading I could not put it down. From the first when the Orphan Serena knocks on Merlins door I was Captivated by them both.liked that they did the time-travel with a reason and together it was like a mystery, romance & sci-fi together Serena's spirit and Richards caring enough to risk everything on a chance to fix something made wrong a very long time before he was born. So they can stay together. I have reread it so much I had to get another copy. When I finished reading it I menttioned it to my friend he borrowed it and also liked it and loaned it to a friend who also really liked it. It took awhile to get it back. liked that they did the time travel on purpose and together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I really enjoyed this book when it first came out.

Boo hoo, I'm too sexy why doesn't he love me? Please!! This is an interesting read, but Serena is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student recommendation","review":"Being a student myself, i find this book very useful to navigate my way around the desktop browser.

The reason is not the sound quality (which is excellent) or the song choices (wisely focusing on earlier more solid albums) but the performances. By this time Jim Morrison had turned into a bloated, Charles Bukowski-ish parody of his former self. The songs meander and jam unwisely and Morrison mutters some lyrics here and there. This is not to say that the Doors were not good live (consider the official 1968 Roundhouse performance dvd- a solid concert right there) but that due to personal reasons as well as the band kind of running out of steam the live shows had declined into an impromptu poetry recital with musical back up.

Now I'll have my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic? Ultimately unsatisfying.","review":"I wanted to like How The Heather Looks, really i did. For all her alleged prowess as a story-teller though, Bodger was unable to fully engage my attention. Her writing style came between us, as did certain aspects of her story. On a trip to discover the landscape behind certain childrens classics, her family was curiously uninformed about where they were and what they were missing. One becomes tired of the phrase, \\"Later we found out...\\" or \\"If only we had known...\\". We are treated to a detailed explanation of how much her family knows about Gypsies, but we look in vain for that information when it would be appropriate; instead we are told of another castle passed by. I was sadly disappointed by the lack of information at the bottom of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Americana Arrangements","review":"First of all, since Amazon didn't bother listing the 16 tracks on this recording, here they are: 1.)Dixie; 2.)The Stars & Stripes Forever; 3.)My Old Kentucky Home; 4.)Home On The Range; 5.)Battle Hymn Of The Republic; 6.)The Wide Missouri; 7.)Nearer, My God, To Thee; 8.)Toyland; 9.)Aura Lee; 10.)Old Folks At Home; 11.)Turkey In The Straw; 12.)Hoe Down; 13.)Bless This House; 14.)Beautiful Dreamer; 15.)Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow; 16.)America The Beautiful. These orchestral arrangements by Carmen Dragon conducting the Capital Symphony Orchestra are very lush and beautiful.

A real sleeper that I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmen Dragon.......\\"A Genious\\"!","review":"The first two LP albums that I purchased as a boy were \\"Americana\\" and \\"Bless This House\\", by Carmen Dragon and the Capitol Symphony Orchestra.

It has a lot of action and killing, maybe too much for a mystery story. Who is the \\"Iceman\\", the person behind the illegal drug trade in the San Francisco area? The answer lies in uncovering his identity. The original seems to have more humor. This one seems to have too many cardboard characters. The final scenes have a lot of shooting, as if that alone would make a better movie.

This is a great example of the sickness of Hollywood. This film trashes everything that made the original unique and scary, and tacks on one of the most asinine, childish, unbelieveable happy endings I've ever seen.This film should be thrown out into the nearest incinerator, it's that bad. They added a girlfriend for Keifer's character (the original film just concentrated on the boyfriend's obsession with his missing girlfriend), they make the normally brilliant Jeff Bridges speak with a strange accent and look greasy, and the ending (which is so different from the original) is disgustingly conventional, cheap, and stupid. Despite the fact that George Sluzier directed both the original and this remake, this remake sucks. Don't see it. See only the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Ending....And Not A Surprise","review":"This American version of the movie too predictable.

If you enjoyed \\"The Big Lebowski\\" and want to see a different but equally potent side of Jeff Bridges' acting, buy this movie.

The only shortcoming in my opinion is that the ending is too abrupt."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the original","review":"I had seen the original before the release of this film. I think it would make an excellent case study on just how badly Hollywood can mangle real cinema. Plot is almost exactly like original except that it has a ridiculous, hoaky, happy ending that was added to the end. The other annoying change is that the eerily 'normal' family-man psycho has been substituted with an obvious greasey slime-ball 'bad guy.'

For the first hour or so the film was reminiscent of Hitchcock's work. Superb performances were on display particularly by Nancy Travis. Oddly, the worst performance on hand is by Jeff Bridges who previously I never thought capable of bad work. He affects some implacable accent that makes you scratch your head and not think him menacing. Pacific Northwest maybe?

Then I watched the 1988 Dutch/French version and was really sorry that I had even seen the 1993 version first. It totally ruins the interesting way the story weaves -- and the way the 1993 version ends is just so perfectly Hollywood, it makes me want to lose it. Whereas, the 1988 version ends perfectly cold.

I have been a big Elmore Leonard fan for a long time, but this one fell flat for me. I couldn't raise much of an interest in any of the secondary characters, and somehow the story seemed to draaaaaaaaaaaaag and draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag and draaaaaaaaaaaaaag from time to time.

And while most of Leonard's books have some of the same elements (his protagonists and damsels in distress all seem to be cut from the same cloth), \\"Be Cool\\" copies plot elements from \\"Get Shorty\\" without remorse.

It has, like Leonard's other books, some interesting characters, but they didn't hold my interest.I also grew tired of the idea that Chili Palmer was writing his movie as the story developed - that got old fast.This almost seemed like an idea for a film sequel that was jotted down and then fleshed out to fit a book.If you are a fan, as I am, you will enjoy this book enough, but it falls far below what I've come to expect from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Leonard is one of the most entertaining writers working today.

That's great if your teaching a novel with zero character development, zero story, hell, practically no plot. And I've enjoyed some of Leonard's other books. And the most embarassing part is Leonard's take on present day rock 'n roll. I can see him desperately picking the brains of people he thinks might be \\"hep\\" to the current scene.

This is a terrific vacation read.I notice many negative reviews here. Fortunately, I did not read these reviews before I read this book! These reviews really puzzle me- I have read all of Elmore Leonard's books and I would put Be Cool right in the top tier. Leonard used a sort of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" approach to telling this story, which is a little different from some of his other books.

It's an unusual setting for an attention-grabbing murder mystery, and there's enough violence and intrigue to keep you turning the pages. Not much sex, but what there is, is honest. I did think it just a bit longish, and the main character simply too capable and connected for belief. As for the music-world characters' believability -- how would I know? Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"what're you talking about? it's a good book","review":"I read Be Cool for a fiction assignment in my high school English class -- since I haven't read the rest of Leonard's novels I can't compare it to them, but my impressions were that it was really a funny and observant book that lived up to its cover blurbs & favorable reviews (of which I have read a lot).

Please! A volatile who-done-it back to the swinging 60s in London. Who could resist the young David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave caught in the intrigue and excitement of this incredible film. Michelangelo Antonioni is a master. The magic of the technology allowing the blowing-up a photograph to discover a murder. Of course, to us guitar freaks, the real treat is the inclusion of the Yardbirds, with Jimmy Page(before Led Zeppelin) and Jeff Beck trading licks in the club scene with \\"A Train Kept a Rollin.\\" A period piece, the music and a murder.

Although the article claims that this censorship (cropping of the image, use of digital blurring) is only found on the Region 1/4 disc, I discovered - when looking at my exclusive region 1 disc - that, while there is no digital masking, the shot of Vanessa Redgrave has been cropped to remove her [vital organs]. I'm not necessarily suggesting that this is a reason to avoid purchasing this disc - unless you only wanted it for this reason! - but I do find such censorship disturbing. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow-Up main audio is sadly very poor quality","review":"The film may look good - but you've got to be able to hear it to enjoy it.The main audio only comes from the center speaker (the only DVD I own that does this) and is incredibly low in volume. Even when you crank your amp up to near maximum to hear it, you'll find that sole center signal sounds suspiciously like it's meant to be part of at least a 2.1 soundtrack. It completely lacks bass and the music has no presence.I've seen Blow-Up on the big screen in recent years, I know it can sound as good as it looks. Someone at Warners has made a big blunder in mastering this DVD. In its present format it's not worth buying or owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"One thing to recommend it ...","review":"There is a scene where David Hemmings is in a club and the band on stage are the Yardbirds -- in that brief period where they had BOTH Jeff Beck AND Jimmy Page -- doing an altered version of \\"The Train Kept A Rollin'\\".

But upon second glance, this movie grew on me. Every time I watch this film, I pick out different aspects about the film. This is not a typical movie. There's hardly any dialogue and the music is not abundant. Too many movies in Hollywood has flash. This is a thinking person's movie. It gives the person the chance to figure it out for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real yawner","review":"This goes down in history as one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.

After seeing 4 star ratings at Amazon and reading good reviews I purchased the video.The movie was quickly boring but I kept waiting for something to happen, it had to since it was rated pretty good. I next found myself wanting to just turn it off and do something useful but again since the rating was good I had to continue to see the end.If you want to watch a guy run around just taking pictures all of the time then this is for you. This had to have been the worst 2 hours and $15 I have ever spent in my life......do not buy or watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"You can call me a Philistine, but this film bored me to tears. Many scenes are horribly dated. Now, that may not be a fair criticism, but I couldn't help but think of Austin Powers at times, which can be distracting when one is trying to watch such a terribly serious meditation on reality and illusion. The scenes involving the revelation of the mystery in the park via photograph were involving. I can also appreciate the fact that Antonioni wasn't interested in making a typical Hollywood-type thriller in which the hero learns all of the secrets and punishes the wrong-doers. There were glimpses of a good film here, but that's all.Besides, any film with a scene in which mimes are taken seriously loses me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funky 60s Look, Some Interesting Scenes, Not Much Else","review":"Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....?We were counting the minutes left in the film by the end (\\"Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives!\\") so that's not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the soundtrack, read the book, skip the film","review":"I watched this film recently after having enjoyed the soundtrack for years. I found the film to be weak on suspense, character development, and pacing. The plot was nearly absent. I suppose the style of photography and editing could be useful to a student of film history, but for the rest of us who actually want to see a movie that we can be pulled in by and enjoy, this is an utter waste of time. I don't know how Cortazar felt about this adaptation of his work, but I'm sure it wasn't a happy feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Up","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I was not impressed with this movie in the least.There are some people out there who are philosophical and theoretical. They are deep thinkers who spend time considering the issues both political and moral of the day.And then, there are people such as the writer or writers of this movie, who become existential about defecating but really aren't especially deep thinkers; they just like to think they are.Perhaps this movie was too artsy for my taste, but I thought that it left the viewer to have to decide for him or herself what was going on in each scene. There was far too much symbolism and meaning in this movie and not enough substance.This movie might have made a good point about life and reality had it not been written and produced by people that were too wrapped up in how cool they thought they were. While not a total waste of DVD (like DVD sets of the show 7th Heaven), \\"Blowup\\" is totally lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely a stinker!","review":"I saw this film in the 60's ...and it certainly hasn't improved with age; unless you view watching grass grow as a highlight of your daily existence. This film plods along at an excruciatingly, slow pace until you are ready to scream for it to end. It's nothing more than the film version of pop art: a simplistic story of a photographer who shot a murder on film; which is subsequently stolen. End of plot and movie, unless you enjoy watching mimes playing tennis at the end. Don't waste valuable time making sense of this film. You'd be better off watching clouds and interpreting what you see in them and what they mean, and probably get more out of that experience then you would watching this film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great Film, absolutely worthless commentary.","review":"It's tragic, not giving this disc 5 stars. The film deserves more then 5 stars. But the commentary, is so unbelievably poor, it's almost beyond belief. It's as if this person hasn't seen it in a while, and just gave some worthless criticisms as he watched it for the second time.I've had discussions with friends while watching this film that would be 100 times more interesting, and enlightening.Like someone else suggested, please Criterion, do a serious release of this phenomenal film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blow Up","review":"I saw this film when I was 16 as it was a recent release. That was around 1966 or so. It influenced me so much that I followed the career yearnings I gained from it and after two college degress in Photography ( B.F.A., M.A.) I opened my studio in 1971. I have had a great career traveling the world producing images for a whole range of clients.The mystery of the murder and the end of the movie really tell the story of photography. You can see it, but you must live the experience of involvement to understand. I will forever appreciate this film. It was a directional moment at first sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendously fun to watch","review":"Best viewed in a dark room on a large screen surrounded by 300 strangers eating popcorn.

When I bought this CD some years ago, the shop's host warned me that this was a great one but also a tough one.Since then, each time I listen to it I discover new sounds and I improve my ability to be impressed again and again. These pieces are always a mystery but at the same time are so primarily human that you can't avoid finding links on the intellectual and physical levels.The brilliant percussion leads you to a catharsis. The litany of the fantastic berimbau is overwhelming. The voice is tranformed into an instrument through emerging whispers and wild screaming. You can find a mix of the most rustic, almost tribal sounds blended with an academic chords section.One advice: Listen to this music alone on a peaceful atmosphere. Otherwise you are wasting time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product - Pelican branded DVD remote has extremely limited range (less than 4 ft)","review":"The DVD remote in this package (manufactured by Pelican) is defective by design. It only works if you are sitting 4 feet or closer to your XBOX 360. I am certain that this is because of the cheapness of the product but why would Pelican even bother selling a DVD remote at all if the user must stand so close to their XBOX 360 that they could actually push the buttons on the console instead? This kind of defeats the whole purpose of a \\"remote control\\" in my opinion. I contacted Pelican to see if they would give me a better product, however, their customer response was completely unsatisfying. Basically, Pelican customer service told me to pay to ship it back to them and include $4 to cover the cost of return shipping - then they would send me another of the exact same remote.

Almost anyone with dog experience and an 8th grade education could do a better job. The author states in his foreword that he makes no apologies for spelling or grammar mistakes. No excuse! There are errors of punctuation, grammar, and spelling throughout. This might be excusable if the information were of any help, but it's not. About 80% of the information is self-evident, 19% is speculative personal opinion, and only 1% is anything I was unaware of (and I'm not exactly a dog expert). The number of pages is misleading, as there are many blank pages or pages with almost no text, silly cartoons, or big type.

As far as quality, the base is heavy enough for small circuits, but i never understood why they don't make the base wider so it has more support. It slides around on hard smooth surface, so you might want to put something below or put a tape of some sort on the base. The clips are large enough and can hold a circuit board. The metal is not cheap aluminum and the magnifying glass is reasonably large and heavy. However, the quality of the glass is really cheap, cuz you can see distortion half way out from the center, which is typical of cheap glass or poor manufacturing. Other then that, it's well worth the money. If I paid more, it would get 4 stars, but for the money, it's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping Hand","review":"This is a wonderful device.

This one is pretty cheaply made, but it has a very heavy metal base which I like. I think the other's might have a light plastic base. Anyways, this will hold my wires and everything else very nicely. The magnifying glass works good enough, but doesn't magnify as good as I hoped. Hardly a con worth docking a star for since it does work good enough. I highly recommend this one over the others because it does the job and very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool tool","review":"I bought this device mostly to help me place specimens for macro photography. I didn't even care about the magnifying glass, all I was interested in was the stand and the clips.The device came fully assembled, all I had to do was unwrap it and tighten some of the screws. I am annoyed that the screws used to fix mounting points along the rod use a much smaller wing and are almost impossible to turn by hand. Except for those two, all other nuts have wings, which is much easier when you need to re-position the arms a lot.Except for that tiny annoyance, I am really happy. It is very handy, and every now and then I reach for it just to use the magnifying glass to read some tiny print.The weirdest use so far: my son's Kindle Fire has a loose USB port, so you have to keep the cable at an odd angle in order for it to make the proper contact. My son uses one of the clips to hold the cable in the right position."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a helpful helping hand","review":"I am actually returning this item because it is not at all sturdy. If the magnifier is not positioned exactly correctly it will tip over. There are much better helping hands out there for the same price or less.

Poor acting, bad script, bad optical effects (note that when Ramirez is on the airplane, in the first shot is shown that the sky is totally red, but when the camera turns inside of the airplane, you can see the sun out of the window!!!!), poor dialogues, and the idea of putting Ramirez inside the plot again was not taken in the sense of giving him an important role in the movie.

Then it tosses u a completely different story then from the first one. It says that Connor MacLeod and Juan Ramirez(Sean Connery) are punished by becoming immortal and being sent to the future as in the renegade version and to earth from the planet Zeist in the original. And it claims that there are more immortals form the Planet Zeist or from the past that can challenge MacLeod thus making him immortal again.

But the airplane ride, the Back to the Future 2 flying skateboards and the fact that Chris Lambert can't play an old man really hurt this \\"film\\".

By now everyone remotely interested in seeing this has already seen it and formed their own opinion. I'm going to review the video quality of this film briefly: it sucks! The video transfer has some decent blacks but it otherwise is just awful. There is ringing, haloing, and uneven video quality even within the film itself! Aliasing is almost constant (the jaggies) and there is lots of video noise throughout. The audio is actually pretty decent, but seriously if you DO like this film and want to own it, try getting the DVD version instead, or at least RENT the Bluray before buying.

This movie is without a doubt the worst sequel ever made. It adds nothing to the storyline of the first Highlander movie. It only contrtadicts everything that was established in the first movie and ends up being nothing but an incomprehensible mess.

But after a few decades, the Earth has become a very ugly place and the highlander (who is no longer immortal) and a resurrected Sean Connery are on a mission to destroy the sheild which will supposedly bring life back to Earth. That appears to story line. But this film is so incredibly boring that its very easy to lose track of its tedious, hopeless, confussing plot. This movie is so bad that its almost worth watching just to see how bad a movie really can be. Its full of many elements that totally contadict the original and make it all the more confussing. Not even Sean Connery's performance was able to save it. You really have to wonder what brand of cigarettes the producers were smoking when they approved this script. The Director's Cut is also available and is reportedly much easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame! Shame!

I am a huge Highlander fan, both the movie and tv series, and this almost killed it for me. It didn't follow the story line, it tried to fill in the holes and failed miserably. This movie should be removed from the trilogy, renamed with no mention of the word Highlander, and they should repackage the series as a two movie set.On the movies defense, it would make an ok movie by itself. If as I said renamed with no mention of the word Highlander, and released as a separate movie.

The story itself is stupid, and to make it even worse, it totally contradicts the first movie.

I was a huge fan of the first Highlander film so I was eagerly anticipating the sequel which was helmed by the same director (Russel Mulcahey). After about 5 minutes, it was obvious this film was going to be an utter waste of time. About 20 minutes into it, it's getting even worse. A guy in front of me in the theatre is joined by his friend who arrives late. \\"What'd I miss?\\" asks the friend.

After seeing the first film I thought I would check out the sequels and I was just like...wtf? For a while there I had trouble watching the original Highlander because I kept thinking about all of the so-called \\"back story\\" that we were shown in the second one.

It contradicts the first movie, the acting is bad, the directing is bad, the camerawork is bad, and the effects are the worst.

I sat through the whole thing once and that was it. For some reason, the immortals are aliens in this version, and they come to Earth to find Connor MacLeod and kill him.

I was a bit confused by the description and the price since there seem to have been another listing that did mention the rotating table, when this one didn't and it was a lower price. Well, it does come with a wonderful rotating table and base, so you can rotate around as each person comes to their turn. The board also has some divider lines along each row and column, so each letter stays nicely in place. Comes with a nice pad to keep score, a cute bag with the durable plastic letters, as well as 4 tiles stands and some cute stickers to go on each. A classic with a twist, literally. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Scrabble deluxe","review":"This is a large Scrabble board which rotates. This feature is quite convenient.

I have the old deluxe edition, but the turntable doesn't turn freely anymore, so I wanted a new one. I love playing scrabble and have been playing for more than 40 years! When I opened the box I couldn't believe the poor quality of this game. I can't imagine this holding up for more than a few games. The board is flimsy cardboard mounted on a cheap plastic grid, and the letter trays are the poorest quality plastic I've ever seen in a game! What happened to you MB to produce this horrible quality product and then sell for such an exorbitant price? You get what you pay for certainly does not apply to this item.

The cardboard board with its raised edges is also pretty poor.If you want a better quality version of this, look on ebay for an older version made from bakelite, it will probably cost the same anyway.For all it's faults, it is just Scrabble and as I said, not designed to take a beating.

It is a game that is different every time. It is challenging and highly entertaining.Unfortunately, Hasbro has decided to go cheap in the quality department. I have an older version of the deluxe game that is very high quality. The newer version is poorly made. It is flimsy and the tile slots are shallow.Anyone who ever played on one of the original flat boards knows what a huge improvement the recessed tile slots were in the original deluxe game.

The slots for the letters are too shallow, so you will still spend time adjusting letters.The stand does split in half, so you don't have to have the board 1 1/2 inches off of the table.

The former sturdy board with recessed squares has been replaced by a thin vinyl sheet that buckles, and the squares have very shallow depressions that do not keep the tiles from slipping out of place.

Very light and flimsy plastic board, where the price and the picture on the box make it look like wood! The letter grid could come in handy with kids or something, but overall this is very chintzy = especially for the price!

When I opened my Parker Brother's version of the board and played on it, I was disappointed. The board is made cheapley and the grid that the tiles fit on is now made of a flimsy plastic instead of the rigid deep grooves that it used to be. We had trouble with the tiles sliding out of the grid when the board was turned on the turntable. While it is slightly better than the gridless original version it is a big disappointment to find that they raised the prices and decreased the value of the deluxe board. Overall it is not worth it -- find a used deluxe board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same good game, crappy modern manufacturing","review":"[...]Milton Bradley and Hasbro are out to reduce the quality of their product, just to make a fast nickel.

I would advise finding a pre 1990's deluxe edition used on Ebay where it will be less costly and far more well-built. The 'fancy' wood tiles have no weight to them and the laminate causes them to easily slip out of your hands. It includes equally as shoddy plastic trays which for some reason make it harder to move your letters around than the old wooden ones. Finally, the board is simply atrocious.

As I set the board down, the playing surface was very thin and wasn't really attached completely to the base. It was very thin cardboard and moved up and down when you touched it. On the box, it appears that the tile holders have the information about the number of letter tiles molded into them. But, they are just stickers. I packed it all up and returned it the same day.

An additional caveat: all the people who post complaints at the various sites about the shoddiness of this version, when compared to the older deluxe version, are unfortunately quite correct in complaining--very poor materials. It *feels* cheap. The original Scrabble base edition I remember so fondly from my distant childhood was of higher quality than this disappointing modern edition.

The surface is only scratched at letting you get to know what drives these characters and this book will only leave you wanting to know more. At the end of the book, there is also a very big bombshell dropped regarding Jarlaxle, that will leave you wondering even more about his character.This book is a MUST read in this series. Do yourself a favor and check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic is back","review":"Once again, Salvatore has achieved greatness. As with many authors involved in multiple projects, Salvatore's Forgotten Realms works have been declining in quality as he must be spread too thin. This is very evident considering what we have come to expect after the Icewind Dale and Dark Elf Trilogies. Every book since those six has been worse than the previous. This newest effort continues his work at fleshing out the other characters of the series, reversing the downward trend, and being of high quality again. Here we see Jarlaxle and Entreri struggling against the machinations of the Drow and the Crystal Shard, with new incites provided into their pasts and motivations. This book was a vast improvement over the last few novels, and I recommend it highly. However, as you might read in all the other reviews, Drizzt is once again absent, but it's still an excellent read. No one can bring to life a combat scene as well as Salvatore, and he shows it many times here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from Salvatore","review":"Excellent novel on the drow world and the villain we love to hate, Artemis Entreri. Entreri's matchup with Bregan D'aerthe is appropriate and entertaining and can't wait for another installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Servant of Salvatore","review":"Well, it took two days but I finished it, in fact I couldnt put it down. A whole book dedicated to Artemis!!! It's almost too good to be true. I loved the focus on the dark assasin, he is a compelling character. I did miss the elf ranger Drizzit a bit, but to watch Artemis and Jarlaxle fight side by side was worth it.Salvatore started a bit slowly in this one but eventually got underway in fine form. I hope we get to see another title in which Artemis and Jarlaxle adventure around together getting into trouble. At the end the two mysterious characters even consider getting into the bounty hunting business.All in all, if your a fan of Artemis Entreri your going to love this episode. If your looking for something starring the hero's from Icewind Dale, best look elsewhere you wont be seeing any of them here.Off to my find Salvatore's latest. Afterall im a servant of Salvatore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Climax Like No Other!","review":"The last battle in this book is PHENOMENAL. One of the best written fantasy climaxes I've ever read; I'm comparing it favorably to the climax of Dragonlance:Dragons of Spring Dawning in intensity and visceral impact. The characters are fascinating. I was leery about following the plots which leave Drizzt out of the picture (Spine of the World, this book) but this book, whew! Highly recommended. Much, much better than Spine of the World (but I'm a little biased- I never cared for Wulfgar's return)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about redemption","review":"This is a Story about redemption... the redemption of a good writer after writing such a bad book as spine of the world.Servant of the shard is a really great book, with an inteligent plot and well shaped characters.It makes you wander if Spine of the world was written by R.A.

But after I got fifty pages into it, and I was wrapped up in all the intringue, lies, and deceit, I could not put the book down. It definately lives up to the series standards, and is just another reason why a producer should pick up this series to make movies out of. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down.","review":"I am an absolute fan of the whole Drizzt series. However, after the Legacy of the Drow series, The Silent Blade began to dull Drizzt's luster a bit. It was good, but was missing something that had come to expect from what I have been reading so far. I have been reading the series non-stop since my friend lent me The Dark Elf Trilogy. The Spine of the World was a little less exciting. I found the side plot with Meralda and Jaka quite boring until it all came together. I would say that the first half of the book was blah and the second half was really good. Then I got Servant of the Shard. What a fun to read book. What makes Servant of the Shard so good is that it is constantly moving and there is always something exciting happening. The combination of Artemis and Jarlaxle is also very entertaining. If you are dredging through Spine of the World now, don't worry, a really good read awaits you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Servant of the Shard","review":"If you want Drizzt, Wulfgar, Regis, or any of the others from the series do not buy this book.I was hoping and expecting Drizzt would appear in this book for more than just notes at the beginning of chapters, but alas he did not.This book however is an excellent read. Once you get passed the initial anger of another Dark Elf book without Drizzt. The story is well written with many swerves in its pages. We get more of the background players to the forefront in this story.Artemis and Jarlaxle are interesting characters that could carry their own series of books easily.Salvatore expands on their relationship and the making of the Shard extensively, and introduces us to another side of the assassin.Read it, it's well worth the time.One can only hope we get the original lineup back in the next book!Dr. B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from a great author","review":"I can't seem to get enough out of the R.A.

I don't do it that often, so I'll get out the attachment, try to use it, fiddle with the \\"one dot\\"/\\"two dots\\" switch, wonder if I have it hooked up wrong because there's a \\"press to release\\" button that doesn't do anything, then give up and just vacuum the steps by using the \\"regular\\" beater of the vacuum on the step and follow up with the crevasse attachment.

She conveys the emotion of the arias she sings so beautifully; she really tells the story of the operas when she sings.

William Logan (in The New Criterion) once wrote that reading a poem by CK Williams is like watching a dog devour its own vomit; Logan is wrong only in attributing something so fascinating to Williams's poetry: reading the poems in Repair is like watching a dog sleep.

However, here are all the episodes uncut and (as far and I can tell) unedited and since it is almost impossible to find this show on TV anymore I will take it and be very happy with it.

I would describe it as primarily \\"spiritual\\" or athmospheric, with an essence of Morocco.

Being a pretty big Costello fan, I decided to give this one another shot. However, nothing on this album is appealing at all. I finished listening to the cd about 20 minutes ago, and I don't really recall 1 song of the album. This cd just seemed very forced. The writing is overdone as is the production which is quite poor. I feel that Costello was going backwards at this point trying to recreate his old sound which almost never works. Fortunately, he made up for this one big time with Painted From Memory.Brutal Youth, Mighty Like a Rose, and that one before King of America (Goodbye Cruel World) are easily Costello's 3 worst.If you are new to Costello and have heard all the \\"famous\\" cds, try Trust or King of America to get a better feel where the lyrics and music aren't so forced as on this flat out bad album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this record.","review":"This is a GREAT record.

I have to agree with them. I don't think Zeppelin falls under the metal genre, but they are pretty heavy. I'd say just hard rock, in general.Anyhow, the 1973 classic sounds just as good today as it did all those years ago. John Bonham's drumming in 'The Ocean' is worth the price of the album alone, and Plant's timeless voice on 'The Rain Song' followed by peaceful guitar from Jimmy is essential.The whole record is a masterpiece. 'The Song Remains The Same' is arguably the heaviest song the group ever recorded, and 'D'yer M'aker' samples a more reggae sound. Bonham's drumming is slower on this one than usual, but it's still timeless.Overall, if you don't have this record already, you are missing out. Highly recommended for any Zep fan. A masterpiece.ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart","review":"Another awesome album by Led Zeppelin. \\"The Crunge\\" is a bit weak (by their standards), but the other songs are all great.

Their best album it's not, that would be Zoso, but it's easily better than Physical Graffiti and any other album made in their latter days after Zoso. Led Zeppelin can best be described as heavy European folk music who got a large following with the emergence of rock and roll as a popular artform in the 50s to the year 2000. The band's success was a freak of nature, rock and roll was big business and they became the number 1 or 2 all time standard bearer for rock music. It's good, but too much boring filler in between the hits. The band has opened most tours since this album with The Song Remains the Same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Zeppelins best work","review":"Truly, not a bad song on the whole album. One classic rif after another. From the slow starting and melodic Rain song and Over the hills... to the James Brown tribute smash jamfest, the Crunge.

A few years later though,he said to me in a quiet voice, like someone waking up from a dream \\"If you think about it, Led Zeppelin- not terribly good,are they?\\" Just leave their records where they belong, on the music store shelf ( or preferably in the garbage can) , not in your home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful(And Better) Extension Of \\"IV\\"","review":"This record is,in my opinion,a much better example of the sweeping,epic,and evocative prog-metal sound the band was going for on thier previous record.The ringing Jimmy Page note-cluster that opens \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" signals a much better realized vision.The gently pastoral \\"Rain Song\\" is gorgeously ruminitive and meloncholic,and the dense,forboding \\"No Quarter\\" will get under your skin and stay there.Overall the album is the most varied and eclectic thing they ever did:James Brown funk(\\"The Crunge\\") collides with quasi-Reggae(\\"D'Yer Mak'r\\"),along with the usual riff-slinging(\\"Dancing Days\\",and \\"The Ocean\\") to set the stage for Led Zep's pinnacle,coming a couple of years after this.But,this is essential because the bracing exploration of this record made it possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always good","review":"In my opinion there is not a bad Led Zeppelin album.This is the vinyl version (I own the cd) and sound quality is as expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album - a special album to my heart","review":"I was in the music business (hereby to be referred to simply as The Biz) some years ago. I managed a mid-level rock band of some repute. We covered \\"D'Yer M'Ker\\" - at my insistance. Yes, there were some 'divas' in the band. And yes, those individuals were also like, \\"Oh we just can't dare cover Zepplin, it just isn't right!\\"My foot.The truth is, a killer song is a killer song. And every night my boys cranked that one out, it brought the house down. Ahhh, to be young and shapely again.I claim that Lead Zepplin's best album overall is \\"Houses of the Holy\\" because every single song is truly killer. Even \\"The Crunge\\" - or I might go so far as to say ESPECIALLY \\"The Crunge\\" - because it grooves and rocks at the same time and proved that Page, Plant, Jones, and Bonzo had a sense of humor after all. Some say they were nerdy but I poo-poo that every time. Unite ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outgrown It","review":"I guess that as I get older, this kind of music means less to me.

This was my first Zeppelin album, and I must compliment myself on picking a great one to intro me to the band. The album is quite short, but the time put into the songs shows-- especially in \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\", where musically speaking, Zeppelin are at a career best. You may recognize \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", both from the documentary and radio. Either way, if you've heard it and liked it, chances are you'd love the rest of what \\"Houses of the Holy\\" has to offer.

It doesn't have the power and grandeur that some albums have. It is just lovely, track after track.Back in the early 90's I used to break this album out for friends of mine late at night when things were winding down. The reaction was always the same; they all wanted to marry Harriet Wheeler. Mind you, none of them had actually seen her(although she was quite lovely). All they knew was her voice and they were ready to marry her sight unseen, if only she would sing to them the way she did on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their best...","review":"This is perhaps the most inspiring and thought provoking album I have ever purchased, and it is certainly the strongest one produced by the Sundays. A must have for anyone who likes to listen to music and take long summer drives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their first, their best.","review":"I never tire of listening to this CD. I really don't think \\"Blind\\" or \\"Static and Silence\\" could quite match the quality of \\"Reading, Writing and Arithmetic\\".Harriet's voice is well, one of those \\"that voice\\" descriptions. She could make polka music interesting. This CD gets it right, chiming guitars, laid back bass, complimentary drums, and did I mention \\"that voice\\"?\\"Here's Where The Story Ends\\" is absolutely top notch. Probably the best Sundays song, and for that matter one of my favorite songs ever, all these years later. \\"I Kicked a Boy\\", \\"My Finest Hour\\" and \\"Skin and Bones\\" are great too.I remember seeing them live back in the early 90s. They sounded just as wonderful on stage.If you buy one Sundays CD, get this one. Better yet get them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make this album the soundtrack of your life","review":"An absolutely cathartic experience! Your whole emotional palet will be challenged, from fleeting happiness to dark sorrow. Some of the songs, especially \\"Skin and Bones\\" and \\"I Won\\" require a few listenings because of the wonderfully placed dissonance. Harriet Wheeler's vocals are matched only by the beautiful songwriting. My dying wish would be for her to sing me to sleep. Experience this amazing collection for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite CD!","review":"I rarely give an album 5 stars, but this one deserves it! This is the band and the CD that paved the way for other great groups such as The Cranberries and The Cardigans. The airy vocals and guitar express a surprising range of emotions when coupled with the intelligent and thought-provoking lyrics. Highlights include \\"Here's Where The Story Ends\\", the fast-paced \\"Hideous Towns\\", the different vocal styles and rocking riffs on \\"A Certain Someone\\", and the surreal but beautiful \\"Joy\\". A must for any collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Simply gorgeous album with amazing guitar.I had the pleasure of seeing them twice in Japan (1992) and San Diego (1995).Love this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It !","review":"I love the Sundays, and this CD is one that you will listen to over & over.

The book was used a little tattered but useful just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and unexpected","review":"Hartley manages to combine the clear-sighted, relentless gaze of the journalist who will not accept the official version of anything with the emotionally searing honesty of a talented and courageous writer. His insights into the emotional damage that correspondents in the field inflict upon themselves through repression are both moving and disturbing. The book is compassionate and humane, and this is what surprises most of all. Many journalists protect themselves from personal suffering with a mantle of cynicism and irony, and Hartley seems to refuse this with a stubbornness and integrity that is breathtaking. I am filled with admiration at his honesty and willingness to lay himself bare. In doing so he has bequeathed a gift to his readers, to those of us would never dare to tread where he has gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving","review":"I picked the book up based on the reviews on the cover and the back. I thought it will be an adventure book on Africa but it turned out to be an account of experiences of a war correspondent in africa. This is the first book of its kind that I read and has been a great experience. The author has an uncanny ability of recreating scenes of war, pain and hunger in front of your eyes.Deeply disturbing and all in all a book that will haunt you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wont soon forget this book","review":"The author delivers a book that will stay with me long after the last page is turned. One quarter travelogue, another family history and the other half memoirs the author shows us Africa in all it's brutality and sadness. Not what I was expecting but an essential read to remind us what we should not forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big a subject for the author","review":"I got to page 50. Why I quit? I still couldn't tell by that page what the book was about. I could very well guess that the author wanted to talk about his family history, his father in particular, but also about Africa, Arabia, and -it seems- it could encompass the whole wide world.A lot of passion, though. I believe this is what most readers detect in the reviews. And that is good. A writer has to put his heart into his story. But if you don't have your ideas clear on how to organize all that material, and if you're not a really good story-teller you're in for trouble.A pity. I am sure there are plenty of good stories to tell here. But I didn't want to break my brains tracking all the locations, times, and characters that mingle chaotically in this narrative. Too much too tell and not enough know-how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Got this reel for my four year old son.

Thompson is an a$$hole.","review":"This guy is a self-inflating ballon. No one and nothing is as important in his eyes as he is. His opinion of himself and the world around him is all that really matters. His ability to cunningly insinuate himself into the minds of others dramatically increases the danger he poses. If you have the misfortune to be assigned one of his books in a college class, lament that no one has made \\"Cliff Notes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Growl of Old Uncle Harvey","review":"How the great Hunter Thompson survived the numerous tribal romps detailed in this novel is an astounding attestment to the author's adaptability despite his masculine and gonzo-eyed presence. While there is sure to be a hint of exagerration due to Thompson's Dali-like warped view of the content in front of his eyes, what he captures is sure entertaining and really transports the reader to that moment in time.While not as saucy and subserviently humorous as some of his better tales, this two year existence on the road with one of the most dangerous sub-cultures to existent in 20th century Western Culture, is a delightful study. The character's images, personality, excursions, and lifestyle are greatly conveyed through the colorful descriptions of Thompson. In addition, the confusing disorganization and initial fragementation of each Angels group is described, with future recklessness and dissolution portended (i.e. Altamount).

I can't \\"get into\\" his style of writing. I purchased this book and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and was unable to finish either book. The first time I have ever broken my \\"always finish the book\\" rule. I felt, in some cases, he was too wordy and that it didn't add to the mental picture I was creating in my head as I read.

Worse yet, the author brags about his exploits with the Angels. There is simply nothing worse than a wanabe living vicariously through the experiences of another. Avoid this stinker at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all interesting","review":"This book fears to go where it should: straight at the Hell's Angels. The author seems scared of them, and he seems to believe that he'll get hunted down and beaten if he says anything bad about them. Violence is glorified. Scumbags who have such nicknames as Gut and Drive-by are glorified as modern-day heros. They are not heros, and this book is a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash from a Kentucky Fool","review":"Hunter S. Thompson has lived his life as if he wishes to actively alter his legacy. From exagerated experiences which he contrived strictly for the purpose of adding to his legend, to the outright falsification of simple facts, Thompson represents what you get when you cross-breed a toothless Kentucky derelict with a bipolar neurotic. In this particular book, Thompson takes great pleasure in representing that he was present during several Hell's Angels criminal episodes. The simple fact of the matter is that he was never present for so much as a peaceable pow-wow. The Angels do not let sycophants like Thompson in on their innermost secrets. Hell's Angels is fictional ---- just like Ken Kesey's review below pointed out. This is nothing more than a talentless wanabe \\"breaking through\\" as a writer by means foul. Avoid this stinker at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Hunter, but come on!","review":"I cannot believe all of the positive hype about this book. This is the least effective of Hunter Thompson's books. We are treated to the same thing over and over again: bikers tearing through the streets, spreading mayhem everywhere they go. Nothing personal, Hunter, but why'd the heck you write this stinker?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a real book!!!","review":"Hunter S. Thompson is a putz! And thats putting it lightly. HST was a hang-around with the Angels for a short time and decided he would cast a light on the underground world of the HAMC. If you want to read something you'll actually get your money out of try \\"The life and times of a Hells Angel\\" by the Godfather of motorcycles himself Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger!!! At least in Sonny's book you don't get just a taste, but a mouth-full of what the HAMC is all about. I am personally begging you all not to waste your money on this book that's not even worthy of wiping your backside with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell's Angels","review":"Hell's Angels is boring, boring, boring unless you enjoy reading lots of statistics. If you're really curious about how many motorcycles were registered in the U.S. in 1965, this might be the book for you. On occasion there is a paragraph or page that has some meat in it and then it's back to numbers. After all the hype I'd read about Hunter S. Thompson, I expected to read the 1970's version of \\"On the Road.\\" One thing for sure Thompson is no Kerouac."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BLUFF","review":"If you're expecting an introspective study of a complete infiltrate on the Hell's Angels day to day, forget about it, this is basicly the report of two big reunions of the Angels in the early 60's, with some articles of the time. And ONLY till that date, no further. TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING. Tedious, boring, in fact didn't finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and funny look back at a different time","review":"Hell's Angels is a Thompson classic. It is a tale that not only covers the Hell's Angels from the inside, but also an expose on irresponsible reporting that drove America into a frenzy over the outlaw motorcycle group. While the book is dated as a whole, I feel that Thompson's depiction of the American response to the Hell's Angels is very relevant today. It showed me that our society that is seemingly ruled by fear, uncertainty and doubt has indeed been present for quite some time now.Overall, Hell's Angels is an amusing, funny and at times shocking read. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELL'S ANGELS IS A BOOK MADE IN HEAVEN","review":"This is a great book. It maybe paints the Angels in an excessively positive light, yet to condemn the book for this is harsh.The whole piece is fascinating, giving a rare insight into a culture we would all probably like to give a bash (for a few hours at least). Hells Angels is the emergence of a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of underground journalism","review":"Written before Thompson freaked out on drugs and went truly Gonzo, \\"Hell's Angels\\" is instead a great piece of reporting. The Angels were a fairly new phenomenon in the public mind when Thompson went riding with them and recorded all that he saw. It is a fascinating account of what has become one of America's most notorious criminal enterprizes. Thompson's description of an LSD rush (taken when the drug was still legal) is worth the price alone. For all his troubles, the Angels beat him half to death. This is a must read for anyone ineterested in criminology."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you feel like you're right there","review":"Hunter gets inside the mind set of not only a biker gang mentality, but the mentality of the rabid news media and the hyped up public it panders to. Great documentary on the country shortly before Hollywood got addicted to the biker craze (when Easy Rider would hit the big time.) More straightforward and less deranged than Thompson's later classix, this is a nice place to begin before he went truly gonzo insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject","review":"I've read the other reviews and it seems like everyone is comparing this book to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is a mistake. They are 2 very different books, but still contain Thompson's wit and style. If you aren't intrested in reading about the more turbulent parts of the 60's, or seeing an inside look at one of the more mysterious and persecuted sect's or our society you are better off not reading this book. Hardly any other journalist could have written this book. Thompson and the Angels both share common intrest's and I'm amazed at how well they get along in the book, and even in the end the parting ,for the most part, is one of mutual respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gonzo Boingo Baddo Booko","review":"Everyone else can applaud this Hunter Thompson if they want. I read this book with no preconceived notion regarding its author, and I can state with no hesitancy that it reads as little more than a star-struck tribute. Mr. Thompson takes great pains to show how misunderstood these fellows are, and how a few random rapes and assaults are misportrayed by the multitudes of journalists who are less insightful than he. Although the Hell's Angels are outdated and tame by today's Crip and Blood standards, there remains a chilling message: bad people exist and bad sycophantic writers exist to worship them."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"quick and fantastic. amazing book and got to me so very quickly! my husband is also a giant fan of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"while a good book, it lacked the Gonzo style of journalism I expected from HST.

The story is very interesting and at times quite hilarious. I love the picture he paints about these bad ass dudes in our country's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"King-hell required reading for every American.","review":"This is a profound, incisive tome, bound to chain-whip some serious insight across the face of mainstream stupor. Thompson cogently observes, in perhaps the finest capsule summary ever of our festering existential miasma, that America has been breeding mass anomie since the end of World War II. Dead on the money, Doc. Pun intended. Also contains the best short exposition on Linkhorn evolution ever written, and the quintessential explanation for the decline and fall of Lenny Bruce. Oh, and there's no one on the planet who could have captured the Angel ethos as well as the Duke. Read it or lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I read Hell's Angel by Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger before reading this one. Mr. Barger had a very low opinion of H.S. Thompson as a person from what he observed of him from hanging out with his motorcycle chapter and what he had to say about this book was, \\"it was junk, there was a lot of writers exaggeration along with a writer's dream-and-drug-induced commentary.\\"I was almost put off from reading Mr. Thompson's book, but I'm glad I did. It's not so much of a documentary of the HAMC, which he used as backdrop to display his intelligence style of humor. He reminds me a lot of the writings of Thomas Carlyle. It's a very witty book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flip Side of Americana","review":"The Hell's Angels and the outlaw biker gang phenomenon have always made for interesting discussion. One needs only to recall some of those B movies made in the 1960's about the Hells Angels and how many \\"ordinary\\" folks fantasized about living the life of a biker gang memeber. This book was written as sort of an expose'into the lives of \\"typical\\" biker gang members. It follows the history of the group from the end of World War II up to about 1966. I found it an enjoyable, easy read when I first read it 20-some odd years ago. I think the reader will come away with the understanding of why some individuals find the biker lifestyle an expression of total freedom, albeit within the seedier side of society. Anyone with an interest in the subject matter would find this a good book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I like H.S.T, but it is sometimes hard to follow him.

That's fine and all, but I simply cannot get it out of my head that this writer practically worships the ground these cretins walk on. Episode after episode of criminal behavior is explained away as if it's just a \\"boys will be boys\\" kind of deal. You get the idea that the writer has some repressed fantasy that he is living out when he is among these motorcycle toughs. I bet the writer thinks the current gangs and the Mafia are also cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately entertaining at times, but always UNTRUE!","review":"Having spent a considerable amount of time with several of the Hell's Angels written about in this book, I can say without any hesitation that Mr. Thompson has misrepresented some basic facts. While it is often expedient for the sake of the story to have these Hell's Angels consistently dull, boorish and intimidating, the journalist must -- repeat must -- remain true to the facts. The Hell's Angels of this era also had a sentimental and altruistic side that Mr. Thompson chose to overlook. Now, having said that, I concede that Mr. Thompson has created a mildly interesting world of good guys and bad guys. This book should be classified as a work of fiction, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring","review":"Reads like a boring book report that is full of propoganda. Waste of time.

Surely, they aren't serious in this 'Airport' spoof disaster film but they do know how to plan a flight.

I've never seen it look so good. Since I'm use to crummy TV versions that didn't include the jive talkers' subtitles, I was far from disappointed with this DVD. The 5.1 is excellent for the film's age and the commentary is interesting; although the film makers do spend most of the time laughing at their own jokes (fair enough).They also make mention of some deleted scenes, SO WHERE ARE THEY ON THIS DVD!!! ..., this is still a must for the collection. I wonder if that guy's still in the cab; I guess we'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spoof Movie That Spawned An Entire Genre","review":"Airplane! was the first in a long line of Abrahams, Zucker & Zucker spoofs. The one that started it all, you might say. Based on the Airport disaster movies, this was the first real attempt at straight out stupidity through sheer lunacy. One of my all-time favorites. I've seen it no less that thrity times. Julie Hagerty and Robert Hays, two normally non-comedic actors, are completely hysterical. Lloyd Bridges is a total lunatic (...looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue). Leslie Nielsen. Peter Graves. Kent McCord. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Barbara \\"Excuse Me Stewardess, I Speak Jive\\" Billingsly. So many others. Funny in ways most people will find annoying.

When I ordered it, I was really looking forward to watching since it features many known comedians. But I was not that much amused... In fact, nowadays I can't get the reason why I ordered it in the first place.My impression may be explained by the following : There is thekind of movie that is only funny the first time you watch it.Then there is the kind which makes you laugh more than once(in most cases, you will watch it again and again). Well, Airplane seems to be in between those two categories. The film is bizarre on first sight (and partially funny). So you want to take a second look because you think you didn't get the point the first time. After all, your friends told you about how great it is.

There's a feature on this disc that allows you to view the video with actor interviews actually inserted into the movie. The problem comes when watching the movie like normal people do... without all that garbage. Everytime the movie would ordinarily cut away to an interview there's approximately a 1 second pause in the playback. Thinking this was just a bad disc I sent it back to Amazon and received prompt customer support. Those folks really go above and beyond. But when they sent the replacement disc I had the same problem. It wasn't until I played both the short (normal) and \\"long haul\\" (with interviews) versions that I noticed all the skips were in exactly the same place as the inserts.

Indeed,whole chunks of this are taken from 'Zero Hour almost verbatim, but just playedwith the right warped sensibility to make you realize how funny all those allcliches can be.Full of amazing comic performances, including many by actors who had always beenthought of much more as serious dramatic actors (Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nielsen)clearly having the time of their lives.So many memorable bits and moments it's hard to even start counting them all.If you haven't seen this yet you really, really owe it to yourself to finally get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"slapstick comedy at its best!","review":"i've always loved watching this movie. a true classic comedy that leaves your sides hurting. while at just a glance, it may look like they are contriving the comedic scenes, that is what is actually funny about them, such as the pinnochio nose scene. i recommend this film for everyone.one thing though....was anyone else bothered by the lady jumping in front of the screen with bare breasts and letting them shake around like that? that just seemed a bit inappropriate for me. it may be funny to some sex crazed fools out there, but it seemed out of touch with the rest of the comedy. but that's just my own view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"Great movie, interesting commentary.

Reminiscent of Tolkien and Dungeons and Dragons. It can be great adventure for those wanting to see good defeat evil. But game also allows player to play evil characters such as Daeman, Undead, Dark Dwarf, Dark Elf, Orcs, etc. Which might be harmful to young inpressionable pre-teen or immature young teen.

I would have bought the Jenga game in the regular packaging if I had known that, but ultimately, Jenga is a great game so it doesn't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is terrible quality!","review":"I had this game as a kid and LOVED it. So I was excited to buy it for my boys. However - right away we realized that the stacking sleeve is just a piece of thin cardboard. It used to be a nice thick plastic stacking sleeve. It's almost impossible to stack the pieces. Also, my husband and I are convinced that they now use a much lighter wood - the pieces just don't feel like they used to - overall, this game is USELESS. I don't even think we played it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Kids","review":"I always made fun of the Jenga commercials, but at holiday time we purchased this for our girls and they absolutely love it.

Jenga is a necessity for anyone's game closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but lacking weight","review":"This review is specifically to Model #53557. The hardwood blocks are cheap quality and lack any solid weight. Jenga is a fun game for the entire family. The game is meant to be played with solid dense hardwood not featherlight balsa-type wood.

I've had the LP and early-pressed CD of their Greatest Hits release. One day, I heard a new mix of \\"Thank You\\", and found out it was on this CD, so I picked it up. It's the same length as on the Greatest Hits disc, but there are extra horn parts, and it sounds like some of the vocal parts are there in full, where as on the commonly known \\"hit\\" version, it sounds like they mixed it so the vocals were faded in. It's an interesting version, but there are no liner notes that provide info on this mix, so you're left wondering where it's from. I'm thinking this may be similar to the mix from the QUAD LP, but have no way of knowing, since I've never owned that record. I'm wondering if anyone can clarify this....?All the tracks on this CD sound crystal-clear. It's the lack of information on the tracks that I find a drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great handbook for network cryptography","review":"I've had this book for a couple years, and find myself going back to it consistently (and recommending it to others on a regular basis). It covers all of the crypto concepts & protocols in an easily readable, thorough fashion. For understanding IPsec, digital signatures, hardware crypto devices, and much more it's a great read. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the SSL connection isn't as complete as I'd like... and for that, I'd get Eric Rescorla's \\"SSL and TLS\\".Of the 100 or so security books on my shelf, this is one of the handful that I refer to on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd, but too hard to compare to the first four","review":"I really hate In through the out door and all that cr*p with synth and fake sounding instruments.

Originally released in 1976, this was their follow-up to their double-album landmark 'Physical Graffiti' (see my review). I've always liked this album. Just always thought the cover was pretty lame. Immaterial,no? Zeppelin's seventh 'proper' lp. Tracks that make this CD reissue a should-have are the ten-minute opening masterpiece (as far as I'm concerned) \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", the total blues rocking \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", the rockabilly-like \\"Candy Store Rock\\" and the somewhat funky \\"Hots On To Nowhere\\". Long live ZEPPELIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-essential","review":"Coming on the heels of their finest work, Physical Graffiti, this is a largely phoned-in disappointment. Nothing stands out save Nobody's Fault But Mine, and even that is probably two or three minutes too long. With only seven songs, four of them six minutes or more, this is a clear example of the self-indulgence that dogged this band, or Jimmy Page to be more exact. Is there really a need for the nine plus minutes of half-hearted bluesy meandering we get in Tea For One? Additionally, several of the songs sound similar to each other and none of them, not even the opening opus (again, far too long) can compare to the best this band has delivered. Even the circumstances surrounding the recording of the album are no excuse for the uninspired songwriting. Zeppelin heads already own it, but the curious have a half dozen other much better places to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to code.","review":"Really a disappointment.

But in no way a surprise seeing the zeppelin of Robert, Jimi, John and John Paul began its falling with the 1975 Physical graffiti.

Neither assessment is correct. What is true is that \\"Presence\\" is the most underrated Zep album. It follows closely behind Zep's finest album \\"Physical Graffitti\\" which tends to overshadow all of Led Zep's work. The fact is that no rock fan should be without \\"Presence\\". \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is probably the group's hardest sounding song & stands up nicely with other faves like \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" & \\"Kashmir\\". \\"For Your Life\\" displays awesome work from all 4 band members & so does \\"Hots On For Nowhere\\". My personal favorite from \\"Presence\\" is \\"Tea For One\\". Led Zep does the blues so well & this is actually among my top 3 Zep tunes.You can never go wrong with Led Zeppelin & \\"Presence\\" will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achilles Last Stand","review":"The cd does not show the subtle side of the boys, but it started to show where they would have gone if Bonham did not go to the great gig in the sky. It's rich textures show the complexity of where their music was heading. Achilles Last Stand is their best \\"unknown\\" song. Anyone who enjoys listening to the guitar, NEEDS to listen to this song, preferably with headphones. It shows Jimmy's pure genious as a producer and player. The rest of the album rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"This cd is always overlooked. This cd starts out with an amazing song, Achille's Last Stand. Now the middle tracks are good, don't get me wrong, but they don't blow me away. Now you are probably wondering why I gave this cd 5 stars. Simply for the last song on the cd, Tea For One. This song is dirty bar blues at it's finest. By far my favorite Zeppelin song out there. Right behind it is Going to California and No Quarter for my other favorite Zeppelin songs. But Achille's last stand is up there on my list and like I said before, this album is worth the purchase just for Tea For One alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Zeppelin","review":"I was online and i downloaded Achilles last stand and i think its one of the best songs ever. So i wanted the album. I bought it and discovered that tea for one is so lovely and sad and has a great beat and then there is nobodys fault but mine which is a wonderful song. As for the rest i feel they are all amazing songs. But my favorites would be the three i mentioned above!!! LED ZEPPELIN RULES"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Presence","review":"This album has to be one of the worst from Led Zeppelin. Only Achilles Last Stand, Nobody's Fault but Mine, Tea For One are good, but the rest is major filler. Simply put, this sounds like a band trying, to \\"sound\\" like Zeppelin, but falling way short. The writing is very uninspired and since an injured Robert Plant was basically phoning in his performance from bed, the results were less than satisfactory. Music fans seeking the same dynamic Zeppelin experience as the 1969-1973 period, should really look elsewhere.If you thought Physical Graffiti was shabby, well, stay away from Presence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline sets in","review":"Any of Led Zeppelin's albums recorded before \\"Presence\\" would be a better purchase than this one. The problem isn't the band getting older, its in the songwriting, which is mediocre compared to the high standards they had set for thelselves. Only the great \\"Nobody's Fault but Mine,\\" measures up to the early days. Maybe Neil Young was right when he sang that its better to burn out than to fade away."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one mentions the album was done in 9 days","review":"This album is as close as you can get to a 'Live' studio album. They had wrote, rehearsed & arranged in LA. Then went to Switzerland (as they were avoiding heavy taxes in the UK) and Jimmy Page asked Keith Richards & Mick Jagger if they could have an extra 3 days to record their music. Keith & mick would later record 'Some Girls' in the exact same studio. When Jimmy Page was done he asked Keith & Mick what they thought...\\"oh you needed an extra 3 days to do this song?\\"\\"No\\" said Jimmy.\\"We did the WHOLE Album\\"They were both stunned, as it normally took weeks to produce just ONE song.The Album 'Presence' is EPIC.On a scale of 1 to 10 a definite 8.-Domo J.

Achilles, Nobody's Fault, and Tea For One are classics of the mighty Zep as good as anything they've ever done. The remaining tracks range from good to average."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best (together with \`\`Physical Graffiti'')","review":"I met this album in 1978. It was a shock. Until today, I bought and enjoyed many excellent rock albums/musics but none of them gave me greater impression. Like \`\`exile on main street'' or \`\`Sgt. Peppers'..'', this is a classic.I believe this album is underrated. It is true, this album is not rich in variety nor well balanced compared to preceding albums. Robert was not in his best condition and contributions of JPJ were restricted to his bass guitar part. But the energy and tension which we can feel from this album are extra-ordinary level and you can find funky grooves everywhere in this album. This funky beat is one of secrets of Led Zeppelin that distinguish the band from other many \`\`hard rock/heavy metal'' bands at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I were stranded on a desert island....................","review":"And I could have only one album, well you guessed it, I'd take this one. Physical G. would be a close second. This album has heart, soul and intensity. I have enjoyed this album for about 18 years now and I still can't get enough. It is unlike anything I have ever heard. Masterful in every way.

It contains some of bonhams best drumming. Achilles last stand is one of the best zeppelin songs ever. the weak songs are candy store rock and Tea for one [probably the worst song they ever did, its a poor mans \\"since ive been lovin you\\"]. Plants vocals arent his best and you cant really understand his lyrics at all on most songs. Overall though it is still Zeppelin and you cant beat Hots on for nowhere, royal orleans and Nobodys fault but mine. this is a straight ahead rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent album, but nothing spectacular","review":"Led Zeppelin's put out better material than 'Presence'.The only real stand out tracks on this album are \\"Achille's last stand\\" and \\"Nobody's fault but mine\\". There are no bad songs on this album though, it's just that the whole thing has a 'rushed' feel to it.If only Zeppelin had more time to work out the kinks in the album, then it probably would have been excellent.Most of my complaints lie in Robert Plant's vocals. He has an amazing voice, but on this album he sounds held back, which almost certainly has to do with his leg being in plaster at the time, and his not being able to stand up.'Presence' is sloppy in places too, which isn't all that bad, but things just could have been done a little cleaner with some additional time.This album is only for Zeppelin fans, or anyone interested in hearing early heavy metal, since this album has no keyboards or acousic guitars in it, and is generally heavy in grooves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess obligation to the record label","review":"Ok, based on Coda and this album, I am worried about completing the rest of my Zep LP listening, this must have been an obligation to the studios."},{"rating":"2","title":"achilles heel","review":"I would have to say that this is one very enjoyable album for any fan of Zep. It gets ignored because there were so many bigger albums and songs. That's the beauty of this one. Presence has kind of a fun, jam like quality to it. The only epic piece being achilles last stand which personally find boring. The influences are a lot more obvious on this album, you can hear the elvis, the james brown etc. The playing is very tight and it's not overproduced. More of a musician's album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achilles Last Stand","review":"Immediately I would like to say that I am giving this album 5 stars only and ONLY for one song Achilles Last stand, which is one of the greatest songs definitely Led Zeppelin has ever written... it's just brilliant, defintely listen to it by all means... it stands near these masterpieces as Kashmir and Stairway To Heaven... the rest of the album though is honestly not worth listening... probably Candy Store Rock and Tea for One are presenting something worth your attention... but the rest is just boring, though probably it's necessary to listen for those people who have never heard of the album, so they could decide for themselves whether it is worth spending time on the rest of the album... I bought Presence only for Achilles Last Stand... not for its whole content!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin doesn't miss (again)","review":"Presence is a more grown-up, if that is the word, sound from these fellows.

It's amazing, simply put. I won't rehash the details, but it's one of my favorite Zep albums and very upbeat, other than the lone blues track, which is classic Zep and amazing Jimmy guitars everywhere.When you hear this album, you just wonder where the band could have gone had Bonham not died so young."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underappreciated masterpiece!","review":"Presence has an unusual quality to it - no other Zeppelin album is quite like it. Rhythmically it's their best album of all. It was recorded rather quickly, giving it a frenetic vibe with a sense of urgency that just ropes the listener in. Jimmy Page and John Bonham find every little pocket of rhythm on this album and fill it perfectly. Songs like \\"Hots On For Nowhere\\" and \\"Royal Orleans\\" are among their most underrated. Page is masterful in his guitar overdubs on this album and Bonham's drumming is all over the place. A perfect example of their interplay is on \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" - this is Bonham's finest hour on the kit in my opinion. He was legendary for playing slightly behind the beat like no one else, and it shows on this album. This is straight-ahead hard, funky rock with elements of blues and country. It's got an aura all its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"kicks a**","review":"One star rating... are you serious?

This would account for the major level of disappointment I felt upon obtaining and reading this book. It was horribly proofed and had the appearance of being hurridly put together. I was suprised more information about the manner in which the team came to New York from Troy, NY was not presented. I found the statistical data to be relatively useless and often contradictory to data found in the 3 major references of baseball statistics. Overall, this is not a very good reference and certainly beneath the work Mr. Peters has previously published about the Giants.

It is limited to Rick Steve's personal choices of what he thinks a visitor should see--which is the regular \\"tourist stops\\", and the museums. There is only one small overview chapter I found helpful.There is not enough here for the traveler interested in other parts of the city.Fans of Rick Steve's who wish they could have him as a personal guide may like this book. Each chapter is either a walking tourof the typical \\"tourist route\\" or an INDEPTH tour of one of London's premier museums/cathedrals.Which is fine if you want to be \\"lead by the hand\\" so to speak, but with your nose in a book.This combined with another, like the Eyewitness Guide will give a better coverage.I prefer books that give me a broader overview, with some detailed guidance.

Instead, Steves gives great detail on the few items he thinks you should see in the major museums of London. Well, thanks, but my taste in art differs from his. In something the size of the British Museum, putting together a sort of \\"Greatest Hits\\" list is ridulous; there's too many fabulous pieces in too many categories for a small section of guidebook to do the reader anything but a disservice. Much better to use the Museum's extensive resources on site to find your personal favorites.Steves would far better serve his readers by giving some SPECIFIC info on restaurants, not just broad categories of places to seek out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best travel books","review":"Rick Steve's always delivers!

These are a real pain because you have to split them to mount the scope.When you lap these (you always lap your rings, don't you?) you also have to pay attention to not go too far. They are not very truly round, and where they meet at the top they don't have much clearance to tighten. Given the AR doesn't have much recoil I think they'll hold just fine, but I could not achieve a 70-80% lapped surface--more like 20-30%. I suppose you could always remove some material where they meet at the top.In summary, if you can use another system, look into that.

The presentation is simply relentless, and seems more focused on launching an all-out assault on the senses of the hapless movie viewer. Lost in all the hubbub & spectacle is a coherent plot. Apparently, the surface details are more important than a storyline, decent performances, etc. I doubt our son will be watching this anymore, and for this I am grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!!!!!","review":"Ok!

I could watch this over and over just to watch Dustin Hoffman completely portray Captain Hook, an astounding performance. And I can't imagine anyone who could take the place of Robin Williams in this film, being able to portray the up-tight jerk who's the adult Peter Pan, and capture the essential child when he regains his old self.The storyline is wonderful, every bit deserving of a spot as a \\"sequel\\" to the classic book/movie(and also has a lot of in-jokes based on the original).Unfortunately, the movie loses 1 star due to some uneveness in the writing and the pacing of the film.

I am also a big Peter Pan fan, eversince the television adaptation of Peter Pan with Mary Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"Sure Hook isn't Steven Spielberg's best but it's still a good movie. I think Peter Pan growing up and forgetting his past was a clever idea. If anything is bad about the movie it's the set pieces. The lost boys hide-out and the pirates village all seem like they are obviously a movie set. I think everything looks better in the new Peter Pan. I also didn't think it was necessary for one of the lost boys to get killed by Captain Hook. Critics were still too hard on it though. It's still fun and imaginative and the actors are great. Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell is surprisingly the best casting in the movie though. Bob Hoskins makes a good Smee as well. Dustin Hoffman is really good as Hook but he's not very scary. I think Jason Isaacs made a better one in the new version of Peter Pan. Hook, I just think has minor flaws but not enough to call it a bad movie. It still deserves a fair chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enjoying this movie many years later.......","review":"Still enjoying this movie many years later.......Hook is just a great movie with a wonderful story with good actors like Robin williams....My favorite scene is when the food changes and also when the son imitates Dustin Hoffman Captain Hook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"I love this movie.

But with a new twist, Stephen Spielberg yet again proves that he is the master of them all. Robin Willams, who plays Peter, is all grown up in this movie. He has a wife and two children. When Peter's grandmother starts to show him the past of life, Peter soon starts to relaize who he really was. He doesn't believe any of this nonsence, but soon goes into another world of fantasy. This movie, I thought was great. Every child has a fear of growing up, that they don't want to belong in the grown-up world. With Peter Pan by their sides, he can take them to Never Never Land where there, they won't have to worry about nothing at all.

One of my joys with my kids is revisiting things that I loved at their age as well as discovering new things. Unfortunately, though the incomparable Spielberg was involved, this film is wholly lacking in that indefinable magic that makes for greatness. I found the whole thing flat, the acting poor to fair even with Robin Williams, and the attempt to add on to an wholly contained work of art a dimsal failure. You shouldn't try to make a knockoff of something that stands perfectly on its own. This is the worst that I ever saw in a Spielberg film. The only things going for it are special effects and rollicking violence.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven Spielberg is one of my all-time favorite directors, BUT...","review":"...when you propose the ultimately silly story idea of \\"what would happen if Peter Pan grew up?\\", even the legendary director cannot save the inevitable answer from being...WHO CARES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great","review":"I can still remember the day before New Year's Eve when I was in fourth grade. One of my friends wanted to take me to see a movie and I desperately wanted to see Hook. Those two and a half hours were magic for me way back then, and they still are. The acting is brilliant, the direction wonderful, and the music surprisingly powerful for a fairy tale. When I first saw Peter gain his happy thought and fly out of that tree, I wanted to jump up and scream, \\"I knew you could do it!\\" And you know what? I'm 18 now, and I still feel like doing that."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with Hook?","review":"The answer- not too much, really. Sure, it's not as great as Peter Pan, but the movie still retains a bit of magic in it, even if it gets oversappy. Robin Williams makes a pretty cool Peter Pan, and Julia Roberts is, well, adorable as Tinkerbell. But it's Dustin Hoffman who steals the show as the overgrown Hook, who's eager to fight Peter Pan once again after so many years of hunting lost boys. Is it Spielberg's best? No, but it's not one of Spielberg's worst either.

Steven Spielberg has done a pretty good job doing it. In this movie, he captures the spirit of Peter Pan quite nicely, with breathtaking visual effects and wonderful scenery. Robin Williams did an OK job in this movie, but not one of his better performances. As for Julia Roberts, I would have to say that her as Tinkerbell was the low point of her acting career.Whoever says this movie is \\"for the entire family\\" is wrong. This is not one of Spielberg's greatest works which is probably why it is not popular. This is no E.T. Most adults won't enjoy this mind fluff.

I've already educated myself with works on Biblical scholarship and archeology. Needless to say I was disappointed with what is offered in this book. McDowell states that Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible as if it were accepted fact--which it is not--and doesn't offer any evidence to the contrary. All the archeological evidence is pre-1970 and there have been significant discoveries in the last 30 years!There is nothing in here that made me reconsider my position on the reliability of the contradicting Gospels, or that Jesus was a man and not a god.Needless to say, this book turned me even farther away from considering Christianity as a religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite reverse two hundred years of scholarship","review":"This book would be very impressive to someone with very little education in biblical criticism and scholarship. Many fundementalists like to carry it around and quote it as evidence of the Bible as the literal, inerant Word of God because it does give the impression of being very learned to someone who doesn't know any better. If you do know better, you will be irritated and frustrated by his simplistic and dogmatic scholarship. Still, it's not breathtakingly bad like most conservative Bible books, just very limited and one sided in its approach. There are any number of writers, such as Crossan, Paigels, Borg, Spong, and many, many more that present a far more comprehensive and intelligent analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stands in my mind as one of the best I have read.","review":"I read this book my freshman year in college.

It basically says that non-Christians who read this book and afterwards do not believe in Jesus are \\"unwilling to believe.\\" It says that such people most often are unwilling because of the moral changes they would have to make in their lives! What a way to dismiss all critics! He might as well say there's no reason to listen to any critics of my book, because they know that Jesus is God, they just reject him anyway.

It reads like a set of footnotes used to make an argument, which is admittedly, the author's intention. For this it gets 2 stars instead of 1. However, the selected notes are still one-sided and simply reading them will not demonstrate to anyone with training in philosophy, history, or theology that Christianity is true. What one will get is a collection of opinions stated by various persons.The book shows no real appreciation for the advances in biblical scholarship and does not even really present arguments in outline form (as I mentioned, it just gives lists of opinions under each topic). Many of the quotes, though interesting, are not very helpful for constructing an argument and there seems to be an overreliance on secondary literature. A better, though not perfect, source would be Kreeft's \\"Handbook of Apologetics.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Proof of Authenticity of the Bible","review":"Documentation is extensive in the book, and arguments are clearly stated and easy to understand. There is a useful index, and sections are labeled and can be used to find specific topics. If there is a weakness in the book it is that McDowell tries to cover too much ground. I found the treatment of religions outside of Christianity to be so general as to not be too useful. The book is very useful, however, to answer a great deal of criticism of the Bible and Christianity, and I recommend it highly for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still operating from faith first, facts second point of view","review":"McDowell's first section in this book, \\"The Bible - I trust it\\" should tell you all you need to know about his \\"evidence\\". His argument is that the Bible is unimpeachable and therefore is acceptable as 100% truth. So, inevitably, he uses the age-old circular argument: Christianity must be true because the Bible says it is. I expected OH SO MUCH more.And this, after the book jacket claims to provide \\"Answers which will satisfy anyone who is willing to honestly weigh the evidence.\\" Too bad the author wasn't willing to offer up any non-tainted evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly researched","review":"This and the companion volume that McDowell has made constitute a thoroughly researched and well packaged presentation of the claims for the truths and beliefs of Christianity.

Hardly any of the book is even written by McDowell.Even to the Christian, I would suggest reading a book that actually puts forth an argument - such as a theology book.To anticipate the reader who will think I did not read this book, I did read this book from front to back - every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"a book is a book so how can you rate it bad, but this was not the book that i was looking for... same title and author, not same book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick and choose method counterproductive","review":"In the hope of finding useful information in this book, I was sorely disappointed. The author uses a \\"pick and choose\\" technique, only supplying the reader with information which will back the cause of the author. He uses some teachings of the Early Fathers, councils, etc. to back the his cause. But when those same people or councils contradict what the author was trying to sell you into believing, they were obviously not given any credibility. How can a council be credible in one area, and ignored in another? As a Christian, I find this \\"pick and choose\\" method counterproductive for the person who is searching for the truth. There are better books on the market for those who are truly searching. I have also read briefly Jeff Lowder's page (address is given in a previous review) and there are some good points there.

It's shallow arguments based on nonexistent or little supported facts are clearly designed for those who want \\"good\\" reasons to believe but who aren't looking for crticism.That McDowell was an atheist as most would understand it is debatable; and that he was going to find answers to prove Christianity wrong at the library of the religious school he attended is unlikely.Any book that quotes Napoleon's belief in Jesus as a proof of Christianity (by way of \\"intelligent people sure believe it so it must be true\\") is suspect.If anyone is interested in more thorough arguments, search the web for \\"A Verdict that Demands some Evidence.\\" This is a point-by-point refutation of volume 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ill-concieved joke on Christianity and truth.","review":"When i first picked up this book (at the urging of one of my Christian acquaintances) I thought for sure that my question about the objective truth of Christianity would be answered.

Unfortunately, too many people want the quick-fix and something easy to look at. This is not to say that all of McDowell's \\"verdicts\\" are wrong, but some are. People should think twice when a person is defending this book instead of defending from the Bible itself. Unfortunately, of the readers that I know, many of them do not have a strong biblical background. This is an easy way out for them. As a result, it has often led to disputes within churches that should not have occurred (our denomination is very scholarly and clear on most positions). For that, I would have given zero stars, but there are some points that it may benefit new Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and unconvincing to anyone well read","review":"This book will convince only those who are already Christians who would never question their faith- no matter what, or those who are intellectual lightweights.

However, the practice exam on the CD-ROM does not accurately reflect the types of questions that are presented to the test taker when sitting for the actual Security+ exam. I would recommend buying Mike Meyer's Security+ Passport as kind of an introduction or a way to ease yourself into this book, and also utilize the practice tests that come on the Meyer's CD-ROM instead of the one included with this Microsoft Kit.

This CD is not a tribute to Keith Green, and certainly falls short of being true to his wonderful spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmony society Expose","review":"I read this book only for the content about George Rapp's Harmony Society. I found the style tedious and sarcastic. Young portrays George Rapp as a mystical despot and members of the society as under his thrall. However,she presented several points which interested me, especially regarding Rapp's views on celibacy. She implies that he emasculated his son (who subsequently died) when that son and his wife conceived a child. This may be true, but there are no bibliographic references in the book. I can't tell if this is an exageration for literary emphasis or fact. This book seems to belittle the dignity of the Harmony Society members. As someone with ties to the original Harmony Society, I found this unsettling."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite head bobber","review":"All i gotta say is that this album is straight butter.

Which makes it sound unique, and much better than \\"Never You Mind\\". Stand out tracks would be \\"My Old Man Had a Pistol\\", \\"Four More Years\\" and \\"Son of a Prophet\\". They also incorporate the harminoca in some of their songs. The rest of the songs on this score are MUCH better than any on their last CD. Though they have developed a much more unique and better sound than some bands like \\"Dashboard Confessional\\" their lyrics arn't as meaningful or heartfelt(Which can be a relief). This band has developed greatly since their previous release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened...","review":"I am also saddened to see the blatant mis-use and commercialization of the Reiki symbols.

For Christmas she asked for a red motorcycle, red being her favorite color. I had seen this toy in Target before and instantly recognized its potential to fill her Christmas wish as it satisfies her color choice, the type of vehicle, and my wallet. Electronic motorcycles are very expensive, and at the young age of 4 she did not need such an elaborate and expensive toy. After she opened it, with great excitement, it was very simple to put together; all that was needed was a hammer and screwdriver. It looks real enough to a motorcycle to make a child happy, and with wide wheels balance is not an issue. Ever since it was put together my daughter has been riding it almost non-stop from room to room as she goes about her days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I went with all of the positive reviews on Amazon about this toy & I should not have.

Great toy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy","review":"I bought this Motorcycle for my cousin's little guy for his second birthday. Him and his older brother, 5, absolutely love it.

You may want more than one Motorcycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"I bought this for my 17 month old daughter after seeing it on the Today Show as a best buy for toddlers. Well I was so excited to get it and when we got it it was a total flop! My daughter is very tall for her age (33 inches) and it still did not work well for her, it also TIPS very easily. The description says \\"sturdy\\" it was anything but that. She did not even get to go outside with it because she kept falling on the tile inside. We took it back and got a 4 wheeled scooter..much more stable.

It seems to be durable and well made, what you expect from Step 2. It was easy to put together, but I will give one hint that helped me a lot. I was having a lot of trouble getting the black rubber grips over the plastic handlebar piece. It was near impossible, then I thought to put a little olive oil on the inside of the grip and on the plastic handlebar piece and it went on easily. My son does like it, but doesn't use it as much as I'd hoped...YET. Even though he's over 2 years old he would still rather push a toy than ride it. But even my 6 and 8 year old daughters will take a ride with there legs scrunched up. So I know it's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this thing!","review":"I don't know what it is about this toy but my 16 month old loves it.

Definitely recommend this as it kept my little guy quite entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and sturdy","review":"This is a very sturdy little ride-on toy and colorful as well.

For one thing when i received this toy it was incredibly hard to put together. Actually let me correct that the tires were hard to put together. It looked incredibly small also. The age range for it said 2-4 so she was 3 i thought perfect. When she sat on it she looked like a big kid on a little kids toy. It didnt make noise, it actually didnt do anything and she ended up bending it by standing on it cause its made of plastic. Now there is this HUGE white crease in the middle of the bike from where it bent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step 2 Motorcyle","review":"Don't waste your money on this toy.

The 2-year-old couldn't get her legs over it, nor did they reach the ground once she was one it (and she's a TALL 2-year-old.) However, now that both kids are older, they love the motorcycles. If you are buying this for any child under age 2 - reconsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Inside or Out","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year old. It is the most played with gift he received this year. It is small enough he can zoom around the house on it without banging up the walls! He rides it all day long and takes his teddy bears for rides on it too. The very first time he got on it and gave a push, he relized that it would take some balancing, but since then, he's had no real problems with it tipping over. It was easy to put together and seems very durable. I am so glad we got this for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"My son loves this product (his little momo). It's extreamely stable also. It doesn't get caught and flip over like his other spiderman cars etc. One of the wheels was hard to get on and you really needed to pound the one peg in but other than that it was easy to assemble and stands up well. The only downside of this product is that the prices vary significantly from place to place. Green Red & Pink should be available but can be hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed, you get what you pay for","review":"I was wondering why this was so cheap, it looked really nice online, now I know!. It's very small and the front wheel is horrible, it won't turn, and my son falls off it all the time. I read the customer reviews after we bought it and saw that lots of people have that problem. Next time I'll check first. He likes it, but he's always talking about how the wheel is broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES this MOTORCYCLE","review":"I bought this for my son who is 2 1/2. He loves it. He had to show \\"peepaw\\", his grandfather who has a real one. Anytime he's outside he gets it out to ride on. He has several other \\"ride-on\\" toys and prefers this one over most of them. He has the Little Tikes Police Car Coupe, and Step 2 Tricycle, the Zip N' zoom car, a radio flyer tricycle and a fisher price quad. The only thing I found is if he leans too much to one side it will tip over. It's pretty sturdy otherwise. Put a little helmet on for safety (just like the adults do on our motorcycycles) and you little one will be just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Small","review":"Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son as it states from step2 age is recommended for 2 1/2 and up, here it says 12 months and up. Anyways, it was very SMALL for him and he is not a big kid BUT he loved it and rode it back and forth, back and forth. The wheels did not hold up well at all though and is impossible for me to get replacement wheels for it. We only used this for about 2 months due to size issues. I think a 12 month old would have a tough time balancing it as it is not wide and stable like most ride ons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I bought this motorcycle for my son this summer. He was 16 months old at the time and had no problem riding it. He is average sizefor his age and his feet were able to reach the ground.

This is the perfect motorcycle for a little one who wants a motorcycle like Mommy and Daddy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy - but not a first ride on","review":"I bought this toy for my son's first birthday. I was anxious to give him a ride on. Even though this is rated for a 12 month old, his feet were inches from touching the ground and he's average height. Even at 18 months, he's still not able to reach the ground. The seat's too wide. In another 6 months or so, I expect him to be using this toy. It's a great value, and has been a big hit, just too big for a 12 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"it was bent when i got it i am not to happy about it i could not even put the stickers on it because they where all f up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible oversight in the instructions","review":"I couldn't agree more with the review on August 6. If you don't assemble correct the first time (which I didn't) you will ruin the bike. The problem is there are 4 small inserts that are designed to go in the wheel wells. Inexplicably the instructions fail to call this out in an obvious way. If you overlook the inserts (which are suppose to go in at the very beginning of assembly) you will ruin the bike upon completion of the very next steps. I'm sure I'm not the only one that had this problem and unfortunately won't be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed and poorly made","review":"I regretted this thing before I even finished putting it together. The assembly is somewhat intensive, requiring tools and muscles, and if you don't follow the minimal, ambiguous, visual directions exactly right the first time, you will ruin it. This toy is cheaply made and badly designed. I bought it for my 18-month-old who is jealous of his older sister's bike, but the wheels are too cheaply made to be useful outside. Although this bike fits him, he does not ride it, perhaps because the front wheel does not turn and the wheels do not roll easily and smoothly. His four-year-old sister, on the other hand, enjoys scooting it around the house. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: NOT a typical ride-on toy","review":"I wish I hadn't purchased this toy. IT IS A 2-WHEEL CONFIGURATION-NOT A TRICYCLE OR 4-WHEELER. It tips over very easily when they pick up their feet to push. My daughter fell over and hit her head on the wall. Right now it resides in a closet.It says for 1-3 yr olds. My daughter is average height. At 20 months she can still just barely reach the floor. I called Step-2 and they told me this is intended as a \\"walker\\" toy-not a ride-on!! I don't know what value this toy could possibly have in teaching a child to walk. Besides, most 1-3 yr olds can already walk.This toy is really cute and maybe if your child has NEVER been on another ride-on toy then maybe you could teach him to use this one--well supervised.

In the meantime, I would look elsewhere (on Amazon!) for a database reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"This book is in no way an \\"Introduction\\" to databases. Date goes into incredible detail using extremely complex terminology and syntax. Throughout the book, he refers you to previous chapter's examples so that you may follow his current logic. His book is mathematically based, and this is painfully apparent from all his explanations, not just the chapters on relational algebra and relational calculus. To get an idea of this book's complexity, I have a BS in comp. Sci, and took high level mathematics, and I found this book EXTREMELY difficult & boring to read. Difficult mostly because I kept falling to sleep. I personally got nothing out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Not the easiest book out there to read.

The songs are full and bright with humor, irony, realism, and imagination. Her voice isn't shaded by too many background instruments and complicated imagery; often sweet and angelic, but also raw and real, her songs are poetic and pure. I'd highly recommend this album. In her songs...like \\"One Once More\\" a beautiful, somewhat eerie, lullaby type of tune...she uses some of the best vocabulary references I've EVER heard in a song. Christine has a beautiful way of using words to nuture and support a song. Such a gift is rare and often misused.

Pieper's tome on the cardinal virtues is an exquisite, carefully thought out exposition of nuances of prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance that not only explains them, but elucidates their relationship to each other and to the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity.Pieper is a superb moral thinker, but one firmly grounded in the Gospel. He says \\"Growth in love is the legitimate avenue and the one and only justification for 'contempt for the world.'\\" The Unibomber should have read that line first.This is a book to read every six months profitably, to make marginal notes in and underline.

Often funny and always intriguing, Dewan sings his narrative tales in a distinctive baritone over light accompaniment from his own homemade instruments. The music itself is unlike anything I've heard before, yet is still somehow inherantly catchy. Personal favorites are \\"The Cowboy Outlaw,\\" \\"The Creatures,\\" and \\"Drinking Bird,\\" although every song is truly a fine creation on its own. Too bad his later releases aren't avaliable through mainstream dealers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nearly perfect record, but skip the first track.","review":"This is an almost completely cohesive recording -- listening to the CD is being invited into his world, which may (or may not!) be a different affair than consensual reality! This is not a record that can be used as background music -- the way he combines and plays with Puritan earnestness, a nearly musicological approach, unusual instruments, and poker-faced humor demand strict attention!The only exception is the first track. \\"99 Cops\\" has little to do with the rest of the record -- it's as if someone decided that the subtle sense of humor of the rest of the record would be incomprehensible to listeners and this heavy handed, barely humorous, borderline offensive song had to be included to make the record \\"relevant\\" and/or a \\"hit\\".It's a great record -- his second record, \\"The Operating Table\\", is also WELL worth seeking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TMBG fans, you'd like this guy.","review":"In fact, I heard him live when he opened for the Giants at the Showbox in Seattle. This music is simple--Electric zither and autoharp accompanied by Brian's somewhat eerie vocals. I can only describe these songs as ballads. He tells stories ranging from how he lost an eye to a tragic afternoon in the office when someone started a fire in the office trash can. Particularly noteworthy is \\"The Cowboy Outlaw.\\" This is a very cool CD, with a good sense of humor and a sound that is simply unlike anything you are likely to hear again. No big studio production, just Brian, his homemade instruments, and his songs. He remarked at the end of his opening set that he had another CD coming along, and that we all ought to search for it \\"Forever and ever, until you find it.\\" Sadly, I never have.

This American sailor telling the story of his live going from bad to worse and still keeping his humor helped me to go through tough times myself. The book was written in the 1920ies. Unfortunately the bureaucracy and the greed of companies are even worse in our days and make this book as up-to-date as it was when published for the first time. The English edition is missing some allusion of the German text, but has more sarcasm objecting American politics.

These actors took a desent script and turn it into a hilarious comedy. Chevy really did not have a funny part, he probably had the most serious character in the movie. Rodney helped out with his wise cracks and extremely rude antics that no golfer would ever do, but if you had as much money as he did you would not care either. Bill Murray and the Gopher were the best characters in the movie. They made the whole man vs. animal scenes work really well. Bill played an extemely crazy man who was trying to get rid of the gopher. He wanted to become head greens keeper, but caused mass destruction instead. The gopher made me laugh more than any other animal in a movie and was really a big part of this movie. This is the best comedy I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic comedy!","review":"Great classic, must own for those who love the 80's comedies.... some great actors that are going to be hard to replace as they fade away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have it!","review":"My husband loves this movie and we were very pleased to see it was on DVD!

Overall, it depicts teens as slackers, scammers, or sluts. The \\"PG\\" tv version of the movie thankfully eliminated a lot of the trash.

Quite frankly, the reverence bestowed upon this flick is just totally beyond my level of comprehension - it's essentially a b-grade drive-in movie, nothing more, nothing less. The best thing going for Caddyshack is the presence of Rodney Dangerfield. As for Bill Murray, has he ever really been funny throughout his career as a comedic actor? His fan base must be teenagers high on drugs, because I've never been able to see the hilarity in his deadpan smugness.

In the one part when Bill Murray is telling the young caddy about his travels to Tibet, the way he (incredibly) ad-libs that whole story about the Dalai-Lama is utterly genius. Please, I do admit I strongly enjoy many different movies but theres something about Caddyshack that stands out above other movies. The point that amazes me is that twenty years after it's relese it's still a cult favorite. Now that's got to be a pretty funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Classic","review":"Although I agree with some of the other reviews that Rodney was very funny, I think that the late Ted Knight sole the movie.

Of all the characters, I hated Danny Noonan and Bill Murray's equally. I couldn't believe that Caddyshack is frequently voted as a great sport movie, let alone a comedy. Really, what's so appealing about Caddyshack besides dimwits and bad jokes? You got a guy who sleeps around, a preppie who prostitutes around, a loudmouth who creates loudness, a big-eyed judge who seems to believe all of it, and a Chevy Chase who can't act natural.

I didn't get a single laugh out of this. The entire thing was moronic.I've got no problem with teen flicks and even potty humor, but this movie had no real plot or message, just a series of anecdotes connected by nothing more than that they all took place at a golf resort.I wish I could travel back in time to 1980, when this was released.

The lettering and colours are washed out, the film is littered with scratches, specks of dirt and blotches that haven't been cleaned up, and it lacks 5.1 Dolby Digital.

The composer has put together a presentation of history/Biblical revelation/present-day space knowledge via the Hubble telescope to enable the viewer to appreciate what the Star really was and what was its significance to us.

Very well researched yet entertaining and \\"watchable\\". This is amazing for many reasons, but I like it because right now, this information is not well known. Mr. Larson has put all of the pieces of the puzzle in-place. I've purchased more than 20 of the previous version and have given nearly all of them away. When I loan them out, I never seem to get them back because everyone wants to share the DVD with all their friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding presentation","review":"I bought this after watching a trailer. Incredibly well researched. It would be very hard to argue with his findings, since they can be verified. This is one of the most moving documentary style films I can remember seeing, and it is powerful every time I watch it. It is great to see so many films lately that verify what the Bible says. The order of the universe is a great confirmation of intelligent design. There is a purpose and a plan to all that God created. The universe and life on earth are not accidents. This truth is a great comfort compared with the depressing lie by secular scientists that life has no meaning or purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"execellent","review":"This was a really good presentation of history, putting all the facts together, watched it 3x's Highly recommended, I could easily watch it again.

What was it? Using a software program that is popular with astronomers he shows the night skies at the time of Christ. His arguments for his discoveries are well supported in this video. The first 15 minutes are a little slow, but once he is into his findings I found it fascinating. There is music and illustrations that are well done.

He had several flaws in this film, too! Jesus was not crucified on good friday! How do I know this? Because the Bible says He was in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. He rose early the first day of the week (Sunday). So you only have two nights and two days in the grave, not three! Any serious biblical student of the Bible will tell you that! He is over the top dramatic too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Admittedly, the material presented in the video was fascinating; however, I'm more confused now than before I viewed it. The author/narrator lost me in three places:1. Job is the oldest book in the Bible?2. Christ was born in June?3.

HIS FREQUENT QUOTES FROM THE BIBLE ARE PERTINENT AND HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US NON-EVAGELICAL CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOT WELL-VERSED WITH THE BIBLE. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENDED AUDIENCE IS EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. THE EVANGELICAL EMPHASIS LIMITS HOW FAR HE TAKES THE SUBJECT OF THE STAR AS WELL AS HIS THEORIES.

The lecturer spends the first 10-15 minutes of the program talking about why he did the research. As I watched this, my thought was, \\"So?\\" As the program continues, Mr. Larson talks about his worry that he was studying astrology. He did not know the difference between astrology and astromomy? He finally came to the obvious conclusion that a study of astronomy was ok. I had hoped to use this program with my Sunday School class, but it is just not interesting enough. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking","review":"I watched this DVD at someone's home, and it reminds me of the pastor in Florida many years ago who peddled his \\"Gospel in the Stars\\" merchandise. The constellations were not created by God to be interpreted by us. Where in the Bible does it say that these zodiac signs of Virgo, Leo, etc. prove Christ? Why can't people accept that God used a star to guide the Magi as part of His plan, and leave it at that? I'm shocked that a major Lutheran publishing house now carries this DVD as bonafide truth. This lawyer went overboard in his research, and used Scripture out of context to fit his research. I've found comments by seminary professors who state that this DVD's presentation builds upon a shaky foundation. I'll be the first one on Amazon to give this DVD a \\"1\\" star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in DVD!!","review":"I am very disappointed in the DVD. Not well made.

I have heard pastoral staff reference some of the verses differently, but the overall message and astronomy is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Star of Bethlehem","review":"Wow! Intriguing! Every Christian with a mind for science or a curiosity about the stars MUST own this video.This documentary is done by a Christian lawyer, not a scientist or astrologist. But the things he discovered in the sky about Christmas and Easter using secular, scientific research techniques leave little room for doubt that the universe was flung into space in a careful, calculated plan by the Almighty Creator. Larson's exploration of the Scripture is thorough, backing up everything the computer model demonstrates in the sky. This astronomical finding may be even stronger scientific proof of God's existence than the archaeological evidence. A little over the heads of young kids, but my 12 and 16 year olds loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story written in the heavens","review":"Fascinating video. The premise is based on Psalm 19 that describes how the heavens declare the handiwork of God. This DVD specifically explores the star the Magi (referred to in the Gospel accounts) followed to find the young child Jesus. Larson describes for us his near obsession with the description of the star, and his struggle with what he was finding. He makes a sharp (and valid) distinction between astrology, which claims that the stars/constellations dictate our future) and astronomy, which describes the stars and constellations - sometimes discussing the story they're telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is a wonderful DVD on the Star of Bethlehem.

I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch and fully understand the content that the \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" covers; just a few years to go!

This means it is dictionary of sorts but arranged thematically. I, for example, had no idea I was guilty of the crime of altiloquence or that sometimes I commit the sin of heterophemy. That little jewel has two meanings: (1) The incorrect use of a word similar in spelling or pronunciation to another... cinammon for synomym\\" or (2) the use of euphemism with a pregnant pause.The sections are joys to peruse - architecture, divided into such categories as Native American, windmills, etc. Police, sailing, sports, religion, sports, biology, cosmology - you name it and there is a list of related words and definitions.

Dr. John adds his playful virtuosity to \\"More and More\\" and Carly does the same throughout with her suggestive lyrics and delicious cover photo. It's her best and one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAYING POSSUM MISSES THE MARK","review":"I have always been a fan of Carly Simon, With her seductive voice and a wry sense of a woman's psyche, Simon gave us some great albums from the 70s into the early nineties, especially with BOYS IN THE ATTIC and COMIN AROUND AGAIN.I initially didn't care much for 1975's PLAYIN POSSUM and now after four decades, I still consider this to be a misfire in Carly's catalogue of material. While there are some flashes of her musical genius, only the spritely addictive ATTITUDE DANCING is truly effective. Perhaps the lyrical content is subpar or maybe Richard Perry's production is too predictable or unimaginative. As noted in fellow reviewers comments, the album's cover is highly erotic and provocative, especially for the 70's....but probably sold lots of albums!Fortunately, Carly would regain her status as one of our finest singer/composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIGRAINE IN A BOX","review":"There are very few toys that I absolutely hate, but this is one of them. ...the game has its good points (such as teaching sharing and taking turns), but they aren't good enough to justify buying this game.

Although this game is kind of fun, I highly recommend staying away from it until they come up with a volume control. It is the loudest toy I've ever heard, and believe me, I've heard a lot of them. You can clearly hear the game in our home if you are in the basement with the door closed and the game is on the second floor of our two-story home. Even with tape over the speakers on the bottom. And it plays the same \\"Quack Quack\\" sound over and over. There is no variation or music. It gives everyone a headache, including my 4 year old son, whom it was bought for. And if you take the batteries out to get rid of the sound, then the game doesn't work.

I must say it was a wise decision. I searched and searched for a game that they could not mutilate and this one has passed the test. They love the action watching the ducks swim around the pond, and they also love the quacking sounds. Our parlor where they play this game is carpeted, so I have no problem with the noise level at all. I knew my 3 1/2 year old would understand the concept of choosing the colors, but I am VERY pleased that my 2 year old is just as enthusiastic about finding her LUCKY colored DUCK!! The manufacturer lists the ages as 3-6 years, but I would put it as 2-6. There are no parts they can choke on, and it's just too cute not to let the little ones play with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS what it's quacked up to be!","review":"I bought this for my three year old, because she loves anything to do with rubber duckies. After a few tries she got the concept. It is one of the few games she sits down and plays. It teaches her colors, taking tuns, memory skills, and winning or losing. I highly reccommend this for kids who aren't quite into complex board games. Yes, it is loud, but the sound does not bother me at all. My daughter has fun with this game, and I enjoy playing it with her. I like that she can even play this alone if she wants since it is a spin-off of a memory game. I would reccomend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler Fun!","review":"My kids, 2 and 4, LOVE this game. It's noisy, but that hasn't bothered us.

Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was entertaining for awhile but then it wasn't anymore.","review":"The game had different levels, but there wasn't much difference. Some of the words were very easy to figure out at first.

Mr. Monath uses very clear terms to describe how to play on the piano basic chords found in most fake books. I have too often found that the pianist who learns by using a traditional piano course method, can't play basic chords or play by ear. This book gives examples of songs to try to play using the right hand melody line and chords. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who doesn't read music at all, but for anyone who's had traditional piano lessons and can play basic right hand melodies, it's a great way to learn to play chords and fill in from fake books or praise music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Play","review":"I feel that though the book makes learning seem easy, there is still a lot of work to be done by the individual to learn the piano. It does however break learning into easy steps, and is a great tool for the person who would like to take a more laissez faire attitude to learning, or who cant afford a teacher just yet.It has also helped me rekindle my interest in playing. Nice idea indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... if you only have one hand.","review":"Okay so granted, this book got me started playing piano that sounds a little bit sexier than Baba Black Sheep: Baba Black Sheep with a lot of chords jammed in.

Maybe I was supposed to use the left hand to play some of the chords in Baba Black Sheep, but that thought only occured to me a year later - after starting on some DIY Jazz for Dummies type books. Wanna play sexy piano? Try Jazz. I suggest \\"How to Play Piano Despite Years of Lessons: What Music Is and How to Make It at Home\\" by Cannel and Marx (and no you don't need years of lessons, only to know where middle C is and what notes are represented by those line thingies that piano music is written on, which is something you could probably Google), it actually explains to you WHY you are doing x, y and z on the piano... which is of incredible value to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to play popular piano i 10 easy lessons","review":"a good introduction to playing a piano.easy to follow but got a bit to techinal at the end as if the writer wanted to finish the book ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy for true beginners","review":"After reading the reviews of this book I thought this book could be used by beginners such as myself, I was disappointed!

While the ultimate plot of this book is okay, I feel that classic Lowell characterization is lacking. Ms. Lowell is generally very good at drawing readers into a story but, once drawn in, there is nothing to hold your attention to this story. I greatly missed her usual in-depth approach to writing about characters. I felt that in this story she was merely telling a story. Using the characters as simple vessels instead of attempting to bring them to life. For example, I would have liked to learn more about what made Shane and Risa unique as individuals. That more indepth characterization combined with the over all plot would have made a much better novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more author going mainstream","review":"\\"Running scared\\" is another manifestation of a trend I seem to see more and more : an author going \\"mainstream\\" and loosing the \\"thing\\" that made me fall in love with their writing.Ms. Lowell wrote some of my all time favorite romances. But in \\"Running Scared\\" we are getting to know even the unsavory secondary characters (and believe me, they do have no redeeming qualities) better than the leading couple. Scenes between the hero and heroine are scarce and the nature of their attraction remains a mystery. This book neither works as a romance nor as a suspense story. I was not overly enchanted with the first book of the \\"Rarities\\" series and with this new entry I can only hope that it soon comes to an end.

The sordid characters were stock, without any redeeming or quirky qualities that fleshed them out into human beings. The main characters were also stock - yet another brilliant and beautiful heroine, yet another brilliant and handsome hero. There was no real passion in this book, no in depth relationship between them. Lowell comes across as burned out and bored. I found that I was burned out and bored as I read this. I know this is a rather scathing review, but part of the reason I feel this strongly is that I think Lowell can do much better and has.

The cons to this book are that it has few restaurant and accomodation listings(hence the thinness), and often the listings don't actually have the written down addresses, just walking directions from the Métro.

Adults will enjoy as much as children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Peter Pan with a different reader","review":"Tim Curry is a great actor, but he does not shine in this audiobook. He is never lively or fun in this, but instead intones each word ominously.

Because the superficial plot is quite easy to understand and so it should be, it is afterall a childrens book. Nevertheless, the characters (not to mention the dreamlike images this book gives) are far from superficial. They are on the contrary extremely well developed. Even the minor characters, like the lost boys, will draw the reader deep into the Neverland, not to let him/her go till the last word is digested.In short this book is funny, intelligent and beautiful. A true farietale."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVELY BOOK","review":"I recently bought this book for the child of a friend and I am not dissapointed! It is a beautiful book with excellent pictures...a book which I hope will instill a respect for books in this childs life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan appeals to both the young as well as the young at heart. A story about a boy who will never grow up, it addresses the fleeting and \\"heartless\\" quality of youth as well as the loss of innocence and imagination that comes with growing up. There is a fair amount of symbolism here, mostly self-explanatory: Peter represents youth and innocence, Wendy is the mother figure, Hook represents growing up and becoming corrupted, and the fairy Tinkerbell represents jealousy. Though occasionally dark and sinister, Peter Pan allows people of all ages to catch a glimpse of the magical world of Neverland, which exists in the minds of all children but may never be revisited by grown-ups. The magical quality of this book is timeless, and it reminds us all of a time in our lives when the Neverland was all that mattered. Peter Pan allows us to go back any time we want, \\"because the island is out looking for us...it is only thus that anyone may sight those magic shores.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful characters, can't imagine why it was such a hit","review":"eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Three children disappear from their odd English home, so little Wendy can mother the Lost Boys of Neverland.I had never read this childhood classic and was surprised to learn that Peter was manipulative and selfish and Tinker Bell was obsessively jealous of Peter. This Gutenberg file includes definitions of words children may not know. The problem is that not all the definitions are correct. Sanguinary, for instance, was mis-defined as happy rather than bloody. Nor is the story focused, but rather wanders from one event to another. Although I have enjoyed many children's classics as an adult, I was not impressed with the plot or characters in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved story, with a compilation of illustrations that makes it even more enjoyable","review":"This edition is by Chronicle Books, San Francisco, and was compiled by Cooper Edens.

What is known for its slouch and walk?-The question of fairies that are unsure of their sex? Androgynous like angels?-Forget fairies and you kill them the power of naming or unnamingA great read for children of all ages, and if you like Peter Pan then check outCapt.

I haven't really tested the range but, my daughter did walk to a little neighborhood store about 4 blocks away and we had no problems at all understanding each other, or interference. Another great feature is the keypad lock. This prevents the channels from accidently getting changed while being in a pocket, bumped, etc. If you're looking to buy FRS 2-way radios to keep in contact with your children while they're playing out in the neighborhood, the Motorola Talkabout 5420 would be an excellent choice, and I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for road trips....","review":"Took these on a little road trip from New York to Florida..they worked great and allowed us to communicate from a decent distance between the two cars.The only downside is that these are popular and often times you will pick up other people.

Repeated calls back and forth to the other party, while they walked this 4 blocks, gave extremely disappointing results.Maybe its because traffic is really heavy, but I still find this unacceptable. It really only worked well up to about 2 blocks away.The radio automatically comes on with channel 1, subchannel 1 selected. There were no others on that channel. I manually scanned all 14 channels and found almost no one else on these frequencies. Maybe these radios just aren't for city use. I think they stink. I avoided giving a worse rating only because I don't want to scare people away. One woman says she uses it to call her husband working in the yard. I'm pretty sure it can handle that task.

It is almost impossible to put Pedar O'Rida's work in a category. It contains accidental sounds layered over old Irish tunes played in places in Ireland that lend their own part to the music that ends up on the recording. You won't tap your foot to it, whistle with it or sing along, and its not really good for playing in the car while driving, except perhaps if you were driving in a soft rain to a funeral.It is complex, requires you to really listen, gives you a sensibility and sense of having explored something very special.

It wasn't long before I realized that the book had a lot of \\"air\\" in it -- the author kept saying the same thing over & over, trying to create excitement, trying to stretch the manuscript. I became annoyed, but I finished the book because I wanted to know what they found in Beethoven's hair. The results were mildly interesting, but certainly not worth hours of my time. My boyfriend summed it up perfectly: \\"It should have been a magazine article, not a book.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I received this as a gift several years ago. It was just a fascinating read and an incredible story at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too verbose","review":"Should've been 30 pages, not 300, as someone else pointed out. Too much fluff, too little about either Beethoven or forensic science, too much rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Story about Beethoven and his deafness","review":"This book was fascinating from the start. A mixture of World War II intrigue and Classical Music history. The book was well written and kept me involved to the end. I have used what I learned from it to help with my teaching in Music Connections in Middle School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Content, With One Stylistic Problem","review":"Let me say first - and I say it with enthusiasm - that I enjoyed the content and - unlike some - the layout of the book. However, there was one - and only one as far as I can figure - drawback to the book. It seemed at times like it happened on almost every page - this drawback - that Martin used extremely long hypenated sentences - like these, which, after a while could cause you to lose track of what the sentence started out to say - that caused me to have to read them three times to make sense of them. Okay, the point is made. That problem aside, I found the content of the book very riveting and exciting. I thought it was a nice creative touch to alternate between the history of Beethoven's lock of hair and the modern-day events surrounding its acquisition and scientific evaluation. The book even suggests a possible cause of Beethoven's deafness based on the study. I recommend the book. And now that it is in paperback, the price is right, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Account","review":"'Beethoven's Hair' was truly a 'good read'. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed reading how the lock of hair found its way to the auction, and then into the hands of the two researchers. The structure of the book is rather humorous and relates to a musical form, tossing and turning between two different time periods: Beethoven's chronological life, and the modern (including W.W.II) time of research. Indeed, the book gives you plenty of spice and reveals much about Nazism and scientology, specific to the findings in the lock of hair, but be warned... if you expect a biography of Beethoven, the one you'll get is very weak, especially in terms of his compositions. I think, though, that this would suit any reader: teachers, music-listeners, doctors, miners, and literate persons alike that can take an interest in the history of such a great genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"transfixed","review":"Russell Martin does an amazing job of transporting the reader back and forth across two centuries of not only music history but world history. Only a skillful storyteller could have woven so many disparate historical threads together in such a cohesive and fascinating way. The book enriched my understanding of Beethoven the man and consequently my appreciation for his art, which, given the extent of his physical infirmities, is even more miraculous than I ever realized. I read the book in one sitting, skipping lunch because I simply couldn't put it down, and I NEVER skip a meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"Anything of value that, this book has to say, could have been put into ten pages. The writer sucks one in, hoping that the highly touted scientific evidence will reveal something about Beethoven; it doesn't. Ludwig may have suffered from lead poisoning and did not use opiates at the end. That's it.The author inadvertently presents some important issues, having nothing to do about Beethoven, but showing us how 9/11/02 was and is nearly identical to Germany in January and February of 1934 and that there were some decent people in Denmark and Sweden during WWII. The rest is mostly irrelevant minutiae of the most boring sort, an insult to both Beethoven and the writing of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ode to Boredom","review":"As a Beethoven enthusiast and musician, I eagerly bought this book and thought that I wouldn't be able to put it down. Unfortunately, I put it down many times...and put it down about 3/4 of the way through and haven't picked it back up since. Its not as much about Beethoven as it is a flowery excursion into what might have happened with people who might have come into contact with the lock of his hair. It is all speculation and lots of back story, which drowns any seed of interest I had in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For newborns more than toddlers","review":"Everytime my 2 year old falls asleep in his carseat his head tilts to the side in a very uncomfortable looking position. We were looking for some kind of a neck pillow and tried this to keep his head situated up. When attached to the seatbelts, this will keep his from rolling from side to side but his head still slides forward. He ends up with his chin on his chest. I tried to take it off of the belts and place it so it holds his chin up, and it didn't really offer much support for his head. It would probably work great with smaller children though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as it appears","review":"The theory behind this product is great. The reality, however, is a different story. My son did not like this at all.

They do not stay in place unless your child doesn't move very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These didn't work well and my little girls head still fell forward.

However, it was a little uncomfortable for the baby, because he couldn't turn his head easily. I don't think there is another way to stabilise his head for safety though. Overall good product - durable to washing also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This product does not work at all for keeping baby's head from slumping forward when installed by the instructions. However, for my nine month old, if you attach the velcro together under the car seat straps on baby's chest, then the cushions somewhat cradle his chin and keep his head leaning to the side as long as you are not stopping and starting the car. In other words, it halfway works installed underneath the chin instead of behind the head and only if you are just coasting down the highway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushed head forward when sleeping","review":"We bought this product when my 6-month-old son moved up to a convertible car seat from his infant car seat. Because the car seat is more upright, his head was dropping forward when he fell asleep in the car. We installed the product as shown, but the first time he fell asleep, his head was pushed so far forward he snored loudly and then started wheezing. I pulled over, woke him up, and removed the pillows. We threw them away after one use. We got cushioned strap covers intead, and they seem to work better because nothing goes behind his head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positives and Negatives","review":"My daughter has torticollis so I needed something in her carseat to keep her head straight. The cradler helps keep her head straight, but I think it is uncomfortable for her. I think when she is a little bit bigger it will be more comfortable for her.

It also rubs the hair off on the back of her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Work for Certain Car Seats","review":"DO NOT purchase this item if your child has a Britax Boulevard car seat (Britax Boulevard Click and Safe Convertible Car Seat - Cowmooflage).

DON'T use this product or any like it! The strap covers can be a danger in an accident and if the car seat didn't come with them then you are not supposed to use it. There is no way to know what these would do to the straps in a collision. To use products like these is to risk your child's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushed head forward..","review":"This was a waste of money. I got it so that my daughters head would not fall forward while she was sleeping in her car seat but the part that goes behind her head is so bulky that it actually pushes her head forward. It also limits their head movement when they are awake, so I had to take it off anyway. It did not hug her head like it is shown in the picture. I think you would be better off with one of those small boppy like pillows they make for this same purpose and just put it under their chin when they fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for when you move your infant to the bigger car seat!","review":"If your son is anything like mine (growing like a weed) and you need to move to the bigger car seat before 9-12 months then this product is really great. At 5 months my son was getting really cramped in the infant carrier car seat, so we went out and got him the infant to toddler car seat. However, he is still to short for his head to be in pillow it came with. Therefore, when we would be driving his head would slump over. So, we decided to try the Kiddopotamus Cradler Adjustable Head Support and it has worked great. No more slumping head and it works great on those long car rides too. Now I don't have to worry that his head isn't in a stable position if we were to get into an accident or just in an uncomfortable position. Therefore, I would highly recommend this product if you have the same problem we did :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with our convertable carseat","review":"I've tried to position this thing several different ways with very little success. My son is 7 months and when he falls asleep in his carseat his head ends up straight forward chin to chest. I'll give it one more try then it's gonna be returned. Disappointing! Another reason I rated this so low, is the Velcro strap that attaches behind the head was to short. With the strap connected the pillow forces my sons head forward. This product would probably work better in an infant carrier/car seat because it is reclined more. But as for preventing \\"floppy head\\" in a proper carseat it gets a BIG ZERO!! ALSO I DON\\"T see how this thing could fit a toddler's head (as seen on packaging). I guess you wouldn't use the strap but then were does the strap go? The Velcro is rough; I'm sure it would end up caught in the kids hair. Whatever, as I said ZERO stars if I was able to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not live up to expectations","review":"This item does not stay in place. If my baby leans forward the sides fall inward, then she cannot put her head back because they are in her way. They are also pretty restrictive when they cradle her head, but do not prevent her head from slumping forward when she sleeps. We used it for a weekend and it bothered her so much she began crying each time we put her in the car. I asked around and was told by a number of parents that the u-shaped neck pillows are more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradler doesn't work for older kids","review":"My son is 8 months old. He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing. I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat. It does not help in this regard at all. In fact, it just annoys him. I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.Very disappointed in California"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"This product seems to fall down easily and is not comfortable for my kids.

Seems to do the trick so he doesn't strain his neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Our 6-month old son has torticollis on his right side and his physical therapist recommended this to help him keep his head straight while sleeping in his car seat, high chair, or swing...it works very well and is comfortable for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent head support for small infants","review":"I used this head cradler for my son from birth until 8 weeks old. It was a wonderful product for the carseat, swing, or any other seat we put him in.However, once he started getting bigger I needed to expand the pads a bit. The two pads are connected by velcro behind the babies head. Unfortunately, the \\"prickly\\" side of the velcro faces towards the babies head. Therefore, when it is expanded, some of the prickles are uncovered. My son hated the feel against the back of his head, and we had to discontinue using the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for air travel","review":"I used this in conjunction with the CARES harness for my 3 year old to be able to sleep in comfort on a flight from the US to Asia. It worked wonders; with the head support, he was able to take multiple naps on the 18+ hour journey each way, and my husband and I got some rest. Unlike most head/neck pillows, this one has no bulk behind the neck, so the head isn't pushed forward in an uncomfortable way. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaw","review":"I bought these when my son was a month old to keep his head straight while in the car seat to help with an issue with his neck muscles. It worked until his head grew large enough that we had to spread the Velcro. When we did that he started getting an irritation on the back of his head. I saved them for when he is older. he is now 8 month old and I can not find the proper configuration for them to be comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and Bad Customer Service","review":"I thought product would support head from falling forward while the baby slept. IT DOES NOT! All car seats support head on each side so I did not need item for that reason. Not only does it not support the head, it increases the possibility of the head falling forward.I contacted the seller to return product and was told I would have to pay a variety of fees to return the product. I replied back that it was not fair that I had to pay fees if the product is not working as advertised and the seller wrote back that if I have a problem I should call the manufacturer. This is the worst customer service I have experienced. If a product is not working as advertised, the seller provides the refund.

I kind of just slip them in on either side of head and they usually stay there on own. I must admit that I don't have them on all the time because it seems that they would make her hot.

Discovered an unpleasant smell emanating from the master closet. Thought I would try this product in lieu of the carpet cleaner truck. Didn't see much of an improvement after using this. Honestly, I couldn't really say that it did much if anything to alleviate the problem I was trying to correct. Threw out anything that looked old or dusty from the master closet area (walk-in closet with mirrored door on a hinge) and put a couple of Febreeze air fresheners on the shelf. The Febreeze units did far more than this product did. In my opinion, if you need your carpet cleaned, break out your checkbook and call one of those steamer vans. The rental do-it-yourself steam units are a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells awful, did not clean carpet","review":"So I was very excited to try this product, but my excitement faded as soon as I opened the bag. The smell was so strong it made my eyes water, nose run and throat hurt. Not only is it a strong smell, it is a BAD smell...chemically and sour. I held my breath and tried it in a small area. It took about an hour to dry and after vacuuming I saw no change in the carpet. The smell took days to fade, had to open window in 95+ degree weather. Could not use the rest of bag.

This needs to be corrected. John Sack's book is about Germans living in Germany, in Silesia or Schlesien, which in the 20th century was turned into Poland. The majority of Silesians where imprisoned and/or killed during the expulsions of Germans (and ethnic Germans from other eastern European countries). The communist take-over of Eastern Germany and establishment of the Oder-Neisse line was done over several years (1945-1949) and repeatedly by military, para-military troops, thiefs and plunderers and nationalistic fanatics. This Oder-Neisse Line is the military conquest line, which put all German Land east of these rivers into Communist Soviet Union and Polish administration with the Potsdam Agreement. Faced with this fait acompli and wanting to gain Stalin at any price for the war in the Pacific, the Western Allies went along. Decades later this act of expulsions and take-over of lands would be repeated in the Balkans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horrifying Historical Account","review":"Horrifying account of atrocities committed against German civilians by Jews in the aftermath of World War II.

I want to leave this exciting reading to my children and I also know about scores of my Polish compatriotes as well as Germans and Czechs in Australia, who are truth hangry and who would buy this book immediately if available. As a Pole of origin I am glad, that someone from the Jewish community took up the challenge, since the tragedy of many Polish officers and soldiers from the Home Underground Army was, that they have fought Germans during the war (having among other goals to protect also Jews), yet after the war they found themselves in the same prisons run by Jews as German criminals. I suppose Mr John Sack suffered much himself first facing the truth, secondly probably he was isolated from his Jewish friends and singled out as a black sheep.

Do they think this happened in some kind of vacuum?Place responsibility where responsibility lies. One caused the other. Also, German atrocities were perpetrated by Germans wearing the uniform of Germany, these Jews who worked the Soviets weren't representing the Jewish people...they were only representing their individual grudges (i.e. seeing their whole family murdered).

They obviously know nothing about music, as this album contains amazing versions of 9 classic zep tunes. The versions of Celebration Day and the Song Remains the Same on this album are much better than the studio takes, and Whole Lotta Love alone is well worth the selling price.

These recordings feature some of the finest improvizations, vocal and instrumental, that are available by this great band, and showcase their mastery.

These songs should not be compared to their studio versions because comparing live Zeppelin to studio Zeppelin is like comparing apples to oranges. They are two different things. Having said that, I can tell you that this album captures Jimmy at his peak. His playing is electrifying, emotional, and sinister. His solos in No Quarter and Stairway To Heaven are unbelievable. No Quarter and Celebration Day alone are worth the price of the album. Sure, Dazed and Confused and Moby Dick are overdone, but bands tended to do that in those days. The only complaint I have is that Since I've Been Loving You and Black Dog were left off the album. Jimmy really nails those two songs also.

With so many outstanding shows under their belt, why choose these dates when the band resembles Night Of the Living Dead? If your answer is MONEY, well then you go to the bonus round!

The album starts off great with the shorter songs like Rock and Roll, then after about 4 or 5 songs it breaks into the more long winded tracks like Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love. Zeppelin is one of the greatest rock bands ever, but that can't save the Song Remains the Same from being a total bore. I love roughly half the hate, but I despise the other half, hence the two star rating. For die hards only, I'd advise you to purchase all of Zeppelin's studio albums, but avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bloated crappola.","review":"Unfortunately I feel the same way about this album as I do the movie. Except for \\"Celebration Day,\\" (which rocks) the rest of this album kind of, well, sucks. \\"The Song Reamins the Same\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\" are passable, but the rest... ugh. \\"Moby Dick\\" goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on... and fails to impress. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" (a song I never liked) is almost half an hour and it's sooo boring. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is weak. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is played differently, in a funky, dance-like manner, but the melody thing is stupid. Why did they do that all the time? On \\"No Quarter\\" John-Paul Jones plays about three notes in 5 minutes on the keyboard, it's soo slow. \\"Rock N' Roll\\" is performed so lethargic, it sounds like a Zeppelin cover band (Kingdom Come?) rather than the real thing. And I know they were better live than this record shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing live performance from a dismal film","review":"This was Led Zeppelin's only official (non-bootleg) \\"live\\" release for many years. The performance captured here was lackluster and uninspired, and the concert film for which it is the soundtrack, with its extended \\"fantasy\\" sequences, is downright embarrassing to watch. Getting through \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" at 25 minutes in length, is a true ordeal for the listener. Still, there are a few high points, like \\"Celebration Day\\" and the oldies medley at the end. If you're looking for a recording that captures the true spirit of Zeppelin in concert, opt for the superior \\"BBC Sessions.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains many of the BEST live versions","review":"IMO this album has *outstanding* renditions of Dazed & Confused, The Song Remains The Same, Celebration Day, No Quarter, and Whole Lotta Love. The Dazed & Confused mid-section was the fountainhead of many other Zeppelin riffs and here you can witness the a couple more being born. Give the album a good listen and you'll agree this is Zeppelin at it's peak. Stairway to Heaven, though, sounds better on How The West Was Won.The video with practically no full songs and terrible cinematography is bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick No Quarter","review":"If you're looking for 21st century soundboard Quality and note for note song tracks, this is not your cd. But Jimmy's jams along with Bonzo's thundering percussion are unreal.Plant's voice sounds better live than in the studio I believe. I've probably made over a 100 mixed mp3 cd's and Song Remains the Same -> Rain Song or No Quarter from this album are probably on over half of them.

Eventhough you get the hang of things very quick, and it becomes hard to lose a race, there is still great fun in trying different vehicles and changing the way you go through the courses. This game is not for those who want an in-depth thinking experience, but rather for those who like fast-paced thrills. Big thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is too overrated..","review":"I though this game wasn't very good. The music is terrible (Icould go to an opera for better) and it's not realistic.

Had the author written only about the US divisions, the book might have been better. However, he makes several comparisons with the German units and also occasionally with British units. These sections display poor analysis, exhibit sweeping but unsubstantiated statements and faulty use of sources. Had he refrained from this and dealt only with the US divisions, the book might have deserved a higher rating, but these errors display poor scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taming Private Ryan","review":"Tom Hanks' movie will seem tame after you've digested Colonel Mansoor's detailed illustration of how normal everyday young men advanced across the ETO in the early 1940's against what most thought was a far better trained army under NAZI control. Read this book and dispel many of the myths you've probably grown used to from watching the screen - that German soldiers were unreliable; American GI's had an unlimited supply of material and replacements; and finally, that the Allied general staff were frequently on the same page in their estimation on how the war should be conducted."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRESH SCENT","review":"I am one of those individuals who cannot wear any scent I may be drawn to because most give me headaches. Of the few I can wear this is one of my favorite! It is light and subtle, not powdery, and not overbearing so that someone needs to be right next to you to beaware of your fragrance. There is nothing worse, in my opinion, than to be overwhelmed by someone else's scent. I even wear this when I'm staying-in because I enjoy the fragrance that much. My only criticism and reason for 4*'s vs. 5, is that the scent does not stick around long enough. I find myself reapplying once (at least) a day. They need a body oil or lotion. I haven't tried the gel yet but maybe layering it with that would help it last."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased!","review":"I received this item in 8 days from date purchased.

She just now (Sept 2nd) informed me that this product was a counterfeit. She said it started to lose it's fragrance after a month. She wrote to Ralph Lauren and was told to return it. Of course, since it was a gift, she couldn't do that. She then talked to a local merchant that carried the product and was told to bring it in. It was at that local merchant that she was informed the product was a counterfeit. So, I'm out the money and she's out the gift. She was also informed that counterfeit fragrances can have dangerous chemicals. I would not have expected this from Amazon.

I emailed 3 times and still nothing.I finally got an email from Amazon. Not the seller but Amazon saying that my account had been credited the full amount. Fine, but I really would have appreciated the seller contacting me and apologizing for the mistake or just letting me know what was happening. I didn't even want a refund.

I like clean fragrances and I have to be careful with what I wear since my coworker is very sensitive to perfumes. AT first I was a bit disappointed because I could not smell the fragrance very much on myself, so I wondered if this fragrance would go unnoticed. I hung in there with it because I remember one time a perfume enthusiast said to me that when you have a difficult time smelling a fragrance on yourself it is a good thing because it can mean that it blends very well with your body chemistry. Well in this situation this just might be true because the first day I wore it my husband told me how beautiful I smelled and he doesn't always comment.

I decided to purchase the book.I started reading it and was immediately wrapped up in the story in which Mr. Farrington was telling. His attention to detail and inner struggle amongst the four roomates was captivating. He winds you through these lives as if you were living them yourself.

This book, however, does not lend itself to practical use. There are flowery, artistic portraits in the long introduction. Then the author discusses choosing patterns, stitch techniques and offers one alphabet. Then he launches into the 4 seasons with a number of designs each. They are all simple-minded and 2-dimensional.

Of course I jumped at the price point which reveals it's quality upon receipt of the product. Bottom line, it works well and functions as prescribed for light-duty uses.It is clearly not a heavy-duty product so to intended to use this in an everyday (say) construction project would not work. It would bend and flex too much for anything substantial.But it is perfect for a simple home project that will stay in one spot with not a lot of stress. My 2 x 4's connected perfectly with no issues. I'm using my set of brackets for my small outboard motor for fresh water flushing and it's perfect.

The resulting saw horses are unstable because they will fall apart with little force.The 2x4's slip into the brackets and are secured by penny nails. You then lay a 2x4 on top and spread the legs... This is all secured by a few penny-nails.Nice a idea, but the nails don't hold the wood that well. Also, the tolerances on the metal brackets is very poor--some 2x4's requier a lot of hammering to get in, others have at least 1/8 inch of play.Take a look at these at your local hardware store (my local home depot stocks them)... it'll become obvious how it won't hold together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply nauseating.","review":"The French have a word for it.

There has to be a moral in here, in the endless scenes of gluttony and demeaning sex, and (if I were feeling generous enough to care) it probably has something to do with the Western world's heedless pursuit of pleasure, regardless of the consequences. But there is no explanation of why these four characters are literally eating themselves to death, why their four names are the same names as the actors who play them, or why those four superb actors would agree to lend their names and talents to such a piffling project.

The lamp is folded over and covered in a plastic bag. The plastic bag is not sufficient enough as a buffer and the lamp shade comes in contact with the lamp arm. This can cause the dings.

Unfortunately, the book is redeemed only by the lyricism of Kincaid's prose. In simplistic fashion, Kincaid explores the legacy of British colonialism and the corruption of Antigua's native leaders. Kincaid acknowledges the splenetic nature of her endeavor, telling the reader to \\"look at this prolonged visit to the bile duct I am making, look at how bitter, how dyspeptic just to sit and think about these things makes me.\\" The book is certainly bilious, a sort of juvenile screed from an author demonstrably capable of more subtle analysis.

To my delight, we brought with us our older binoculars (another well known brand)and we were able to compare the two. With our well known American brand, we could see the shore when steaming along and see trees, etc. But with Nikon Monarch, we could not only see the trees, but the limbs, the birds in the trees, and the bears coming down to the water. In Glacier Bay, we could see inside the crags of the glaciers and spot glaciers high up mountains with detail. My wife and I have decided it's time to sell our older (only a few years) binoculars at our next garage sale. I don't have equal eye sight in each eye. With the Nikon Monarch I can see clearer than wearing glasses and much farther. I highly recommend these binoculars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binoculars","review":"I wanted a good pair of binoculars but didn't want to spend big bucks for them; the Nikon 7430 turned out to be a great pair.

It is unbelievably NOISY, and I think that's what they like, plus it's very fast paced. I would never play it with a very competitive child, they would drive you nuts complaining about how their hippo wasn't working right or whatever.

The instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage. They have a picture of how to arrange it, but it doesn't fit in the box that way. You can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge. So you have to take at least one hippo head off to make it all fit. Putting it together isn't too much trouble but the pieces are evetually going to wear out and not snap together. I don't expect this toy to make it until next Christmas unless we find a place to store it out of the box.The game is really fun, parents will even enjoy playing it with the kids. Just don't expect it last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but NOISY!","review":"This is one fun game from my childhood, but noisy as can be! If you don't mind the noise from the marbles, hippo heads slamming up & down & the giggles/laughs from your children- buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milton Bradley Does It AGAIN!","review":"After the fantastic game that was \\"Connect Four\\" (a timeless classic, on par with chess), the experts in board game fun bring us Hungry Hungry Hippos.The idea is beautifully simple, so simple its the kind of thing you wish you'd have though of yourself. You see, in this game you take the role of a HIPPO. And you are HUNGRY. In fact, not just HUNGRY but HUNGRY HUNGRY. This makes them quite peckish.Anyway, upon assuming this hard-to-give convincingly role, your mission is to begin the rapid consumption of MARBLES.Now, it isn't fully explained in the literature why the hippos are eating marbles, but anyway there we go.You and three of your friends, or colleagues, family members, even that special someone you want to impress with your gaming prowess, gobble up as many marbles as you can.Sheer entertainment, a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the classic, this one is pathetic","review":"I thought my son would have fun with this game and he did manage to despite it's overwhelming flaws. The game is horribly cheap and it doesn't fit into the box once assembled so in order to put the game away you either have to take all the hippos off (and they really aren't made well enough for that kind of repeated on and off) or buy something else to store it in. How hard is it to make a box that the finished game fits in? Very flimsy didn't last long before breaking. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it's made in China!","review":"Remember when us Americans used to be upset and would complain about the things that were made in Taiwan? Bet you never thought you'd see the day when you would wish things were made in Taiwan again? This is a very poor attempt to resurrect a classic fun game that gave me, my siblings and friends hours of entertainment. First, the hippos and the board are no longer one piece. so in the heat of \\"eating\\" a hippo might pop off, play has to stop so that the player can reattach the hippo and start up again. That would be fine if it happens once a game. But after the 3rd or 4th time, kids lose interest and will just stop playing it. Try to find an original game board with the hippos fixed in place. It was more sturdy and you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This for Your Child","review":"I just bought this game for my daughter, because I remembered it from my childhood. What a mistake! The pieces that form the hippos do not snap in tightly. The necks and mouths of the hippos get jammed so the game is hardly fair. I wish I had my money back. I would recommend trying one of the fine games for preschoolers made by eeboo (Ex: Picnic game, the Paper Doll game, or the Make a Pie game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This piece of junk should come with a free garbage bag!","review":"1. Plastic \\"marbles\\" are too light. They fly way too high and sometimes off the playing field. They also get stuck inside the hippos at times.2. The hippos frequently get stuck in \\"locked\\" position during play rendering them useless. Since they're the key to the game, that's kind of a big deal.3. Sometimes the hippos fall apart while playing. Not really what you want to happen.I loved this game as a child. The current version is worthless. Don't get this unless you love frustration and children crying \\"it's stuck! it's stuck again!\\" over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I have to agree with most other reviewers in how cheaply this toy was made. Big disappointment! The biggest gripe is that you have to take the darned thing apart to store it each time. Are they kidding me? With the money they saved on the cheap plastic, they could have spent on making the cardboard box a little bigger to throw the thing into after the kids are done playing it. Like another reviewer wrote, get an older model on eBay or at a thrift store, you'll save a lot on all the aggrivation you'd get from this new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"My 3 year old got this for Christmas and every time we play, we have to unstick the necks, reattach the hippos, or unjam the marbles. She gets very frustrated and wants me to fix it. How can I fix a shoddy design? I'm very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit back into the box!","review":"it's just as fun as you remember, and it's fun to introduce your child to this game.But once you assemble the game it does not fit back into the box. So you are left with this cumbersome game and tons of loose marbles. Good luck keeping your game room tidy with this game.Also, the heads and necks get stuck. You're trying to gobble gobble gobble but your hippo gets paralyzed. It's very frustrating.The kids will have fun with it, but you might want to think about gobbling up a different game.And finally, our game arrived with the yellow hippos head! Uggh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but noisy","review":"We got this game for Christmas, both my daughters love it, they are 5 1/2 and 3. It tends to be a loud, very exciting game to play. Not the best if trying to have a nice quiet \\"game-nite\\" time. But very fun for all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy has gotten cheap","review":"I used to have this game as a kid and my brother and I played with it all the time. I just bought one for my 3 1/2 yr. old son and it is awful. The plastic is cheap and we always have to stop playing because the hippo's \\"tail\\" sticks or the head does not go all the way down to catch the balls. I have taken every piece apart and put it back together again following the directions exactly and we still have the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"My son received this gift for Christmas two years ago. I was very excited as I remember playing this game as a child. I was soooo disappointed!! It is definitely NOT the sturdy game I remember from my childhood days. The hippos tend to get stuck w/the handles down. For the adults...not a problem...but very frustrating for little ones. And the \\"marbles\\" don't roll around very well. Overall...not a good buy in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by Hungry Hungry Hippos","review":"I was very excited to give this game to my daughter on her 5th birthday, since I played with one as a child. I was quickly disappointed. Hungry Hippos is not the same as it was originally. The original had real marbles which worked much better than the new light weight plastic ones. It also was a lot sturdier. About five times in our first game the lever that operates the hippos got stuck. This was very disappointing to my daughter who has no interest in playing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality","review":"I was excited to buy this for my kids since I enjoyed it as a kid, but they sure don't make 'em like they used to. This really is the most flimsy, cheap plastic game I have ever seen; and the hippos stick frequently. If I would have tried it first, I never would have purchaed this and I'll keep this in mind for future purchases.I'm not a frequent reviewer so something has to be really great or really crappy. I didn't even buy it at Amazon, I was browsing other games and saw it here and had to review it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not the original!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers:1) Why make a toy that doesn't fit in the box. This is a game children should be able to play by themselves but they need their parents to assemble the game every time. And, its not easy to assemble because the parts are so cheap which brings me to point two.2) This game is made incredibly cheaply. Of course, I'm comparing this to the original but the balls are so lightweight they float in and out of the hippos mouths.3) My game came missing a part.If you can't get the original, its not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"Very cheaply made, hippos don't stay attached.This was a christmas gift for my kids (4 & 5)and even though they play with it (rarely), it getsfrustrating when the hippos constantly fall off. Andwhen you wack the hippo a few times, it gets stuck andwon't open to accept the marbles. Definatly not worththe money. Too bad they don't make it like they did ageneration ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother with it.","review":"I loved this game as a child and wanted to buy it for my 3 year old son. Great game, now made into a piece of PLASTIC GARBAGE!. The light weight marbles are terrible and the heads of my hippos don't even lift up most of the time.It's truly a shame they have to ruin these type of games with cheap materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Hippos?","review":"We recently purchased this game for our five year old's birthday. I remembered the game from my childhood and knew he would love it, too. It turns out that Milton Bradley has gone el cheapo on making this game. The game itself is very ugly and cheap looking, the balls are all white (the used to be orange or multi-colored), the pieces barely fit together enough to even play, the marbles get stuck in the hippos throat (which requires that you stop play to clear the hippo out), the hippos mouths don't open very wide, and they push-pedals constantly stick in the middle of game play. The box that the game comes in is also very, very thin and flimsy - which is a real problem with a game that is comparatively heavy. We had to duct-tape the box before putting it away after the very first play!I would never, ever recommend this game to be purchased by anyone. I just don't understand it. What happened to the Hippos?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Fun!","review":"Parents, don't try to play this game with your child if you have a headache! It's noisy--but so much fun! Even my 2 year old loves this game.I'm not sure how much educational value is in this game, but it's full of laughs and action. If you have active children, they'll love it. Parents--be forewarned--it's loud and pounding and bound to produce hearty laughter and squeals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy but fun!","review":"Although noisy, this game is great fun for preschoolers. There is not a lot of skill involved, but my kids are learning to count and estimate by guessing who has more marbles. It is also easy to change the rules to make the game a little interesting, and still keep it fun. As for durabilty, my kids are really rough with it, and it seems to take the beating! There is no great place to store the marbles, so I hope they don't all get lost over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make things like they used to!","review":"I remember playing this game when I was a kid, but I don't remember having to stop the game to put it back together every five minutes. Although the kids have a great time pounding away at the hippos, it gets a bit annoying that the game is so poorly (re)designed that it doesn't stay together for the duration of even one round! I think I'll sell this one and start searching for a \\"vintage\\" edition of this game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hungry Hungry Hippos","review":"This game is not as well made as we older people remember it. One of the heads on the hippos will not even lift up when the lever is pushed and one of them will not retract after the lever is pushed. My daughter likes it if we are the only ones playing because two of them do work. But it does not work like I remember it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for youngest toddlers, but gets stuck a lot","review":"I agree with the others about the hippos getting stuck, not lifting their heads, etc. Only the youngest toddlers get some fun out of this, basically making noise, and eventually getting the plastic marbles. Since the hippos are not all working the same way, older kids who are more competitive will argue and fight for the better hippos and this takes away from the fun. I usually just settle for the worse hippo, the one that gets stuck and rarely lifts his head, just to let my toddler win. I tried filing the hippos' jaws to make them more rounded and more likely to open, but it seems to only help a little. There is a small educational value in learning to count. But any child that is old enough to count will quickly get frustrated by the uneven performance of the hippos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very durable","review":"My daughter always wants to play with it, but the levers stick, the hippos fall off, etc... You also have to take the hippos off in order for it to fit back into the box. They are very easy to take on and off, but because of that, they also seem to slip off during play sometimes. Maybe it's our carpet, but it's the only place she has to play. As for marbles, they only give you 1 extra. My daughter is very anal about storing things back, and even with that, we constantly lose the marbles. The last thing is that she loves to play with it for a couple of rounds, and then it bores her. I do like the game, but lately I am much more into quality and durability of games.I'm trying to minimize the amount of junk we have, and I ended up getting rid of this game. It just constantly needed attention when she played."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"This game is the worst. The hippos get stuck if you push with any kind of force, the game is a piece of plastic junk, and I wouldn't recommend this if I was being paid to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This game is manufactured differently now then when I was a kid. The hippos have to be removed to pack it into the box, if you can even get them to fit. The plastic is cheap and one of the hippos wouldn't even work when we first took it out of the box. Definitely don't understand how it's supposed to last over time, especially considering the object of the game. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical, quiet board game","review":"Hungry, Hungry Hippos has been around for many years and you can't go wrong with a fast paced marble eating hippo game. 4 players each pick a brightly colored hippo and a bunch of marbles is then dropped in the middle. The fastest moving hippo who eats the most marbles wins. It's as simple as that. It can be educational for kids because the kids will have to count their marbles at the end of the game. A minus to this game is that the hippos can become jammed in the heat of the game. Very frustrating when your hippo needs the Heimlich. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deb is back","review":"If you are a Deborah Allen fan, and specifically, her 80's Prince produced Telepathy LP, you will love this CD.

And while there's no arguing the brilliance of that long-play release, may I make a case for A NEW WORLD RECORD? \\"Tightrope\\" is sheer brilliance; a seemless melding of orchestral grandeur with driving rock and roll. \\"Rockaria!\\" is a thrill a second, over-the-top romp. Both \\"Shangri-La\\" and \\"Mission (A World Record)\\" are sad and profound, and oh so lovely. Perhaps you've heard of \\"Telephone Line,\\" one of ELO's biggest singles, which wraps bitter loneliness in a sweet candy coating. The classic \\"Livin' Thing,\\" another huge hit, is the textbook definition of pure pop, and \\"Do Ya\\" is one of the great rockers of the 1970s. There's not a weak moment on A NEW WORLD RECORD.

I mean people already own half the songs on Princess Favorites and can buy them on the film soundtracks or the Disney princess collection cd. Why I think this cd was released is that Disney was trying to promote the movie Cinderella II Dreams Come True as the songs from that movie are on this cd.

The base and handles are one piece and they just don't stay together with the cup. My local store will not let me return them and I have not been able to get in touch with anyone at Luv 'n Care.

However, since my son was teething he loved biting down on the silicone nipple and ended up tearing it up with his teeth. As a result, the liquid would spill everywhere! I thought it was just a flaw with the first cup I bought, but the same thing happened with the second one. I contacted the manufacturer and they offered to replace the valve, but they in no way seemed concerned because they claim the silicone is not hazardous. However, my main issue is that if he was able to tear the silicone so easily then he could have possibly torn a piece off and choked.We ended up using the Gerber Fun Grips Soft Starter Spill-proof Cup.

Yet, now at 18 months, she still only wants these cups and they leak horribly and are time consuming to prepare. Even after the tedious job of lining up the notches perfectly (and the silicone spout often slips when you screw it onto the cup, so you often have to take it out and line it up all over again), we often get leaks from some other minor problem in the lid. I have to triple check every aspect of the lid to ensure no major leaks.Also, the spouts break very easily (which causes major leakage), and I have had to keep replacing them.

And it did. However, this cup is so poorly designed, it is not worth buying for a baby who will be using it on his/her own. If you are holding it and doing the feeding, I'm sure it would be fine. But the inside silicone insert twists along with the flimsy, impossible to line-up twist cap, so that when you're done, the spout is never where it's supposed to be. Therefore if the child holds it by the handles, he/she has to be a contortionist to get the liquid out. And even worse, the entire top is silicone so it can be easily pushed in by little fingers,so that it becomes unattached to the rim of the cup, creating huge spills.

My 10 month old took to it right away. As most all children of this age do, he would chew on it but he had no teeth and it didn't harm the cup. However, in seconds of his using the cup he was completely soaked all down the front of his shirt because the entire silicone lid caved in causing all the liquid to escape. This cup is not leak proof and a very bad design. So, a couple of months later I decided to try the Nuby \\"Flip n' Sip\\" also a \\"no spill design.\\" It has a straw; which I am told by dentists is better for the child's teeth and mouth in the long run. It too leaks when the cup tilted back... which is natural for anyone to do while drinking.

We lost 1, and broke 1. So I went to buy some more. The only ones available were the Luv n Care cups. I liked the Nuby cups and just figured they had redesigned them, which was a bit disappointing. These cups suck. The handles come off pretty easily, especially if dropped. If dropped too many times, the handles break and then they won't stay on at all. The lids are difficult to get on correctly, so they don't leak, and the actual plastic the cups are made out of is thinner...looks cheap. Don't buy this sippy cup if you have other options.

If I was taking hundreds of pictures, and only importing them to the computer once a week the design would be good. For me, unless I'm on vacation, I tend to import the pictures every 50 snaps or so.

There is only 1 scene of \\"action\\": (spoilers) Snake gets chased by some crazy people (?) ,runs into a building and covers up the window he jumped in, than he takes out his Mac11 (with scope on thesupresor -_-) and shoots one guys Hand of wich leaves a bloody mess.Im sorry to say but if you have seen Escape from LA first than dont watch this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I just saw this film for the first time. I have heard it was pretty good, but certainly don\`t agree with that. Too littleaction. I think the film also was too slow. Carpenter could have trimmed 5-10 minutes of scenes. I didn\`t care forthe story either. I will not see this again. I regret i bought it. The sequel that i also bought, is probably also lousy.Very disappointing.Picture Quality: 3.5/5This was a very dark film, so not very many scenes that looks detailed and sharp. It could have been restoredbetter. I think they should have turned up the brightness a bit, so we could see things clearer. It\`s too dark.Audio Quality: 3.5/5I was not so impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. I think most of the gunfire effects could have had moreclarity and bass. I think this audio track could have been remixed better.Film: 1/5Overall: 1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Official!!!","review":"Finally one of the greatest movies of all time is getting the treatment it deserves.It's official.

I have no real complaints, considering the price, about the DVD itself.For the average DVD owner/watcher Carpenter's \\"Escape From New York\\" is a classic dark, sci-fi action adventure story starring Kurt Russell before he went soft, co-starring in bad Goldie Hawn movies.Besides some of the cheesiness which is obvious, (\\"Snake\\" is Russell's character name) the story is very compelling and the suspense is believeable and effective.The dark, corrupt, sinister overtone of the film is delivered brilliantly for it's time, and on a grand scale involving Manhattan Island and a post-apocalyptic New York City.For half the price of most DVD's, this one is worth buying and watching more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks absolutely dreadful","review":"Read the reviews at amazon.co.uk.

Don't waste your money, just wait for the official US release which will hopefully be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another John Carpenter Gem!","review":"Snake Plisken, one of the definitive choatic heroes of the action drama. Once again, John Carpener surpassed himself with this dark classic! From begiinning to end this film is one wild ride! Regretably, the sequel Escape From LA, was a disappointing follow-up to this 80's masterpiece. I highly recommend this DVD, and give it a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape to New York","review":"Yet another gem from Carpenter. Donald Pleasance is the President in this film! Kurt Russel, a.k.a. Snake Plitskin, will blow your mind, and some scumbags away! The storyline is ingenious, the acting fine, and the soundtrack is great too. But there's a Debussy song in here! What the hell is there a Debussy song doing in this film? Well, it happens to be a great song and it works well with the scene when Snake is flying in the glider. ....Escape From New York is a great modern science-fiction film that was way ahead of its time when it came out in the early eighties. Check it out! One tip is to watch the film at night with the lights off- many of the scenes are lit very darkly, and that's the best way to see into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FRILLS BLU-RAY OF OK CULT FILM","review":"Snake Plissken is still in business in this cult fave from 1981. Kurt Russell's over-the-top turn as outlaw and former Special Forces war hero sent him into the brutal, converted prison of Manhattan to rescue the President from a plane crash. Oh, and Plissken has a bomb in his gut set to go off in 24 hours if his mission fails. You know the drill by now. By the numbers and from the mind of John Carpenter. A no frills Blu-ray edition. Where are the extras? How come no commentary from Carpenter and Russell? Not enough bucks to make 'em talk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Features = PAL format = BUMMER!...","review":"This bluray has been hard to track down for a while, so I ordered this import thinking I'd be able to injoy all of the Rad Special Features, not the case with this purchase.

Well thats exactly what your cash should be doing right now! It's taken so long for die hard fans to finaly get to see the Bank Robbery sequence that is included on this disc. I already owned the first DVD release of this title and when you compare the two together the transfer is so much better and the sound is great. There is a comic included which is roughly the same size as the one included in the special edition of spider man. If you have also played the first Metal Gear Solid on the PS one you will notice that the start of the first game has the same elevator squence has the bank robbery. This film deserves all the attention it gets.Get it Snake Bites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Name's Plisskin!\\"","review":"This film is the main reason I bought a DVD player in the first place. It ranks up in my huge collection of movies as one of my favourites because of It's timeless appeal, pulse pounding action, beautiful cinematoraphy (courtesy of Dean Cundey), toe clasping suspense, and that Snake is just so fuckin cool. I heard MGM is goin light on the supplements, so all I gotta say is that in my book, that's a crime and you guys need a blunt object bashed into the side of your head by a eyepatch wearing snake tatooed avenger, because no one wrongs Snake and lives a happy life. So as for the movie, I respect it with every fiber of my being, and Carpenter has ended up consuming at least half of my all time favourite films top ten list. So go do yourself a favor and watch this movie, show it too your children, show it to your friends 'cause this is where it's at when you love badass gun totin anti heroes that bleed fools for a living!"},{"rating":"2","title":"supercool","review":"It was great on the big screen and I love owning my own copy now.

Ok it's not a prog album...","review":"Well what's all the fuss about it? Ok it's not a prog album, but rather better labelled as AOR music or mainstream, sometimes in the vein of B. Adams. The unique exception could have been represented by the track#9 \\"Loyal\\" or a few melodic moments, but the singer is not able to emulate this kind of \\"Gabrielesque\\" vocalism; or you could have also appreciated a different style, emulating the modern Yes band of the \\"Modern Rabin Era\\" within the first two tracks, but then you can stay listening to it and you are disappointed at the end...the good intoduction inside \\"Waterhole\\" is not enough to recommend the present album, as the role of G. Downes at the keyboards is not remarkable here and the approach by the veteran drummer A. White is not equal to his performance with the old Yes!!So I'm not enthusiastic about it, but make your own choice as usual!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, This Is A Solid Project","review":"The 2006 release is a collaborative project by drummer Alan White, who enlists Geoff Downes (key), Steve Boyce (b), Karl Haug (g) and Kevin Currie (v).Currie has a similar lyrical presentation as Peter Gabriel, but his personal style shines on the majestic Dream Away, reaching out in Loyal and the rolling of the dice in the oftentimes vicious game of life that is found in Waterhole. New Day is a solid musical piece, with the powerful Once And For All a foundation to the album. The cover art is a classic landscape from Roger Dean.The majority of the 10 songs were written for several projects that featured the band members - minus Downes - and other musicians; including the group, Merkaba, and an abandoned album project entitled, Loyal. While the numbers have textures of progressive rock, there are plenty of punchy guitar riffs that gives the album a classic feel of FM radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting piece of history","review":"This is an interesting read on the history of Point Roberts.

Until recently I don't think I understood the second piece, and every time I read it again there are gems of insight, undiscovered before.Read it with friends, preferably. If you are the skeptic or cynic, Pieper has an antitode. He did at least for me.One note: I have the original translation by Alexander Dru with introduction by T.S. Eliot.

Filming this was a valuable experience for me.....although to a 10 year-old it was a bit slow and boring. It made me realise that although I wished to carry on with my acting career I would far rather do it on stage than on screen! In my opinion, the film has managed to portrey very accurately the atmosphere of the area but however failed to illustrate Hedd Wyn's true character.

And it's natural based ingredients means it doesn't sting my eyes and it's safe. I slather it on my face, eye area, neck and shoulders and it lasts all day unless the weather is particularly dry (like in winter with all the indoor heating).The purists out there will disagree--Ceramide Vital is definitely not the most natural but unlike a lot of the organic moisturizers it's effective. No, it's not perfect, just the best I've found.Much better than their other products which sometimes have that old fashioned perfume-y smell or are better for super dry skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"More D-Link Problems","review":"I decided to get the DWL-AG530 a couple of months ago to work with the DI-784 AP.

The author strays from the science fiction portions of the novel with uninteresting side-trips and distractions that subtract from the momentum of the story.I bought this book thinking it would be a sci-fi adventure, however, it spends too much time on the philosophical questions that plague the protagonist, and the author seems to enjoy writing as if the characters were experiencing everything in a disconnected dream-sequence like manner... very annoying for the reader.

This anthology offers nothing new. It's time for some new material and new album!Clannad is an incredibly talented band with powerful tracks but all these collections and samplers is becoming extremely redundant plus it diminishes the power of their songs too(in my opinion).This anthology is everything I already have!

This lame sequel doesn't have Sholder, McLachlan and Nouri. Instead we get Raphael Sbarge as the alien cop, Kate Hodge as Nouri's daughter and inept direction from writer/director Seth Pinsker. Pinsker keeps most of the movie so poorly lit, it's hard to tell at times what is going on, and after the exciting finale of the original, Pinsker's climax is boring and unexciting.

Here is how you play this game, you and another person drop pieces in the thing you see above, and the person who is Connect Four (in any way) is the winner. The game's pieces are red and black.

I keep my Palm in a wallet organzier and I could barely close the wallet with the M130 in it. Therefore, I returned it and I am awaiting my refund. In its place, I purchased the M515 instead. SO far, I am very happy with the 515, especially its width. The only annoying thing about the product is that they have an attractive slip on leather cover but the cover will not stay on the Palm. Otherwise, the software was very easy to install and the Palm is meeting all of my needs. The color screen is nice and the battery has not worn out yet after one week of use.

The result is that if you carry the m515 in your purse, briefcase, or pocket, the inevitable jostling will cause the unit to turn on, and the batteries will deplete within a day. This is a disaster if you travel alot, and annoying even if you don't, since if you ever forget to charge it one evening, it will be dead when you try to use it the next.Those who attribute the short battery life to the color screen, overuse, etc. are mistaken, and probably don't realize that their Palm is actually turned on for large portions of the day.

They refuse to refund my money or send me a \\"New\\" one that I know is readily available.

However; when investing this much money on a PDA you would think that they would improve upon their product not come up with new bugs. Keeping this palm in my breast pocket turns the unit on constantly. My oldr palms had never turned themselves on. The batteries drain when using the palm for long periods of time and when connecting to my desktop the unit freezes during data transfer each time. Getting tech support from palm has also been a challenge. After three months with the above issues I am still waiting for solutions to my problems.

I only knew that the cover art was interesting (vaguely Matisse-like café scenes) and that I thought the title was great (I love the word \\"Brazen\\" - so evocative and sadly underused!). The opening scenes - an accident involving an explosion, flying shrapnel, and a wounded artist - suggested faint hints of The Gargoyle, which I loved. And then I kept reading. And realized I was WAY off. And then I looked the book up online and realized it was French erotic fiction - and then it all made a little more sense. It is a tale of obsession, but falls somewhat flat in both the erotic and the fictional aspects. After a somewhat enjoyable beginning, I rapidly found myself utterly indifferent to the fate of all of the characters and utterly disinterested in their sexcapades.

Back about 3 years ago, when they were called Riverfenix, they were okay for a new band, i thought maybe some day they would develop a sound of their own and get better. but they NEVER changed at all.. they sound the same now as they once did, or worse. Their only acceptably tolerable song is 'All my Fault'.. go download that song and you've got the only worthwhile thing off the cd.

I use it morning and night and by the time between my applications, I can tell it's stopped working. So unlike a lot of other eye creams, I didn't think my eyes looked better and better with repeated use.Third: it's thick but it still seeps into my eyes and it irritates them a bit. I have to be careful not to get it too close.Fourth: Good value.

It screws on easily and given the collar itself turns, you don't need to worry about clearing the stem of the product. Once on you can connect it to your pump of choice and inflate. Removing the device does not yield any loss in pressure.The only issue is that you cannot connect a tire gauge to this device to check pressure. You will need to use the gauge on the pump since it takes pressure to open the valve. I cannot, however, fault the device since that it what it's made to do.

I got a confirmation from the publisher that the first issue of my subscription would be delivered in MARCH 2010. That is 1 month before I am due. I suppose they wanted me to feel good about my purchase by reassuring me that the subscription would be active until September 2010.

If or when it happens, I'll definitely get a subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about fitness","review":"As an avid exceriser and former fitness instructor hungry for real information about mainitaining fitness during pregnancy, I was very hopeful about this magazine. Unfortunately, it is as vague and basic in its fitness advice as most other parenting/baby magazines, and focuses mainly on fashion, baby gear, and pregnant celebrities. I have found it very frustrating that there is so little concrete advice for future mothers out there - you would expect a magazine with this title to have more than the occasional short blurb on walking for fitness or two-paragraph article on the benefits of prenatal yoga (with no specifics, of course). I'm about to deliver, and have had to figure out the fitness thing on my own...this magazine was no help."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer who ordered","review":"I would not order this magazine from this site.

What also amazes me is that the subscription is for 12 months but a pregnancy only lasts 9 months and by the time I get my first issue - I will only be pregnant for another 4 months.

Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string. Have 2 problems with the strings. First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up. Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir). I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself. Second, the high D (8th string) seems \\"dead\\"; it does not \\"ring\\" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used). Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.

Also they say they last 3 to 5 times longer that other brands...ahh...maybe more than SOME other brands (Epiphone strings, for example...HA!) but I found that some brands (like Ernie Ball) last just as long.

Recently I purchased a set of Elixir Nanoweb Light strings. Afterwards, it sounded so great that I won't change it for a thousand dollar worth Martin.

They sound wonderful - right out of the box!

As for the longevity of the strings, maybe I just got a defective string, but the #1 string (high e) broke rather quickly. The rest of the strings are still fine. I'm just disappointed that it broke so quickly, it didn't even last as long as my previous strings even though it boasts that it lasts 3x longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great strings, bad seller?","review":"First of all, I love these strings. I played on polywebs for a while, and now I'm using the nanowebs, and I'll use nothing else.I usually buy them at my local guitar center for about a buck or two more than the price here.

It fits perfeclty into my hand when I use it, and also fits great in my pocket.It has held up very well over the past year, and still works great. It doesn't have all the features of the new Zire 71 (which I'd probably get if I was buying a new PDA today), but it's got everything that I need - schedule, sync. with MS Outlook, color screen, great games and software available, and a good amount of software that comes with the unit.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PDA","review":"I bought an m130 a few months ago and find it to be very handy.

When I say \\"bulky,\\" I say that while still being able to put it in a leather wallet and fit it into my pants' pocket.The expandability is nice, and the 3rd party stuff for it is endless.

My only complaint is that the battery drains much quicker then I thought it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Palm M130","review":"Though the M130 has nice features at a more affordable price, I am now very disappointed with my M130. It turned out to be defective when using an expansion card. The unit froze and resetting eventually no longer cleared up the problem. I sent my unit back to Palm and they are taking forever to repair my Palm Pilot. If you buy this machine, make sure to test out the expansion card slot as soon as possible so that if there is a problem you can return it to the store you bought it from. Corresponding with Palm has been frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Work","review":"Owned a M125 and loved it. The M130 that I received is bug ridden. From the very start it gave me errors syncronizing my data and crashed while installing programs. It would not write data to a Palm 16 MB memory card. I did a hard reset three times and reinstalled the software as many times with only marginal success. Tech support was clueless! They would not concede that I have a defective unit.

The screen is small, but the color makes up for it and although the 125 screen and 130 screen are the same size, you can see things better on the 130. I had a few questions regarding the Hot Sync and rechargeable battery, but I E-mailed Palm and they responded within 24 hours. I use it everyday and am buying an extra HotSync cable for work. I priced the other products, but with the extras you get like Doc to Go and the Palm Reader it's worth it to have them all in one package and not have to worry about compatibility. I have Windows 98 and used the bus port and had no problems downloading some free demos nor had any with transferring them to the Palm. Playing the games in color makes a world of difference.

There is very little variety in the photos, so you'll see many repeats as you squint at the pieces. All this to say that there is no context for where the pieces go, in relation to the puzzle as a whole. Other then brute trial and error, I can't see how you would go about putting this together.

It's 630pm now and I have not recieved a call yet.Highly dissatisfied with company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product. It lasted a day","review":"The idea was good but the execution was bad. This soft case is designed to protect the iriver from shocks as well as dirt. The reality is that the rubbery surface drags on everything it comes into contact with including hands and clothing. During the first day of use the material caught and tore across the back. Even if it hadn't torn I would have discontinued using it because of the texture catching every single surface it touched.If you are going to leave the iriver on a table, this item might come in handy. Using it in any sort of mobile way will surely cause you more headaches than it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad recording, but certainly not Anthony's best.","review":"When I think of Anthony Burger, I think of one of the greatest Gospel piano players of all time. This recording however, mixes classical style beginnings and endings to tried and true Gospel favorites. (What was he thinking???) Sometimes the songs come off very jazzy as well. All in all this CD sounds like a tired lounge act. Only thing missing is Steve and Edie. And, leave the choir at the church. Very out of place here. (Floyd Cramer used to ruin his recordings doing the same thing) On a bright note however, Gloryland Medley IS a sparkler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 90s music","review":"This CD has some very unique songs from the 90s on it. \\"Girl like you\\" is the ultimate driving song !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truly Detestable Summer Festival","review":"I don't even REMEMBER how I found this INCREDIBLE album that hasn't left my mind or CD player in years... I worked at a record store when it came out, played it a few times (ALWAYS with at least one person commenting on how GOOD the new DAVID BOWIE Cd was!). I think that the MAGIC of this album is that for the most part, Edwyn Collins was able to record most, if not all, of this album, pretty much on his own in his own studio, with no one looking over his shoulder complaining. This album is the sound and statement of one man alone, giving the best he has written whether anyone likes it or not, with honesty and integrity that should shame all of us. Sounds like a Bob Dylan review, right? It might be, except for the fact that the melodies, tunes, song structures, etc., are actually CATCHY. It's hard to see/hear your life nailed down by someone you've never met. This album will haunt you for the rest of your life, for better or for worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album!","review":"Normally I'm a diehard metal fan.Collins is hardly metal,but his one of a kind tunes can hold their own with most louder artists.Grinding guitars and/or brisk lerics surge through the otherwise mellow masterpieces .All in all,an amazing display of erie,loungy,rock that you'll listen to over and over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at best","review":"Very dated, with only a few excellent songs.

Don't waste your money on this...you can have mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"reversed song using a computer","review":"The song is simply reversed by using computer software. Both the music and the voices are reversed.A piece of art goes through a process of creation; it is not a simple click using a computer as in this case.Anyone can reverse Mozart but the result is not an opera and author is just a person who plays with the computer.While the songs in Christian-orthodox can truly inspire and generate positive effects the \\"reversed\\" song in the movie just gave me creeps.I reversed the movie song using a software application and it is exactly a Romanian Christian-orthodox song and yes, I speak Romanian."},{"rating":"2","title":"ECLECTIC AND PROVOCATIVE","review":"If you haven't seen the movie, the arrangement of songs on this CD may seem somewhat bizarre, but there are still some very good numbers on this CD that alone make it worth getting. I got it primarily for the Jazz and Orchestra numbers. \\"If I had you\\" is excellent, and the renditions of \\"When I Fall in Love\\" and \\"Strangers in the Night\\" are quite good. Of course, the famous Chris Isaak number is appealing, and \\"Masked Ball\\" and \\"Migrations\\" are intriquing, though they work best in context of seeing the movie. The other tracks vary in their appeal. This movie seems to have received sharply mixed reviews. You either really liked it or hated it. I enjoyed the movie only becuase I've actually had surreal nights like that before - thought not quite as \\"wild\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a \\"used\\" copy","review":"If I'm reviewing the company that sent it.

I was surprised at the \\"artistic\\" hiss & pops in some of the songs. You can register most of that out when converting, but than it sounds like something is missing.I picked this up because I wanted the better wma conversion to listen to, than MP3, but with the garbage (Masked ball) hiss & such, it wasn't worth it.If you liked the movie & want the soundtrack than I'd suggest finding a copy of this, as it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Potential Lost","review":"Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of a film, with subtle and not-so-subtle hints of film noir was utterly destroyed with its transformation into a soundtrack. While possibly playing with the masses in mind, it has resulted in an overhyped mix of undulating dischord and disharmony. One might compare it a Mel Gibson \\"flick\\" in its nascent impracticality to adhere to its ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best soundtrack ever released!","review":"Usually, I avoid buying soundtracks. 'Cause for every good song, they contain two or three less than mediocre songs. Eyes Wide Shut is the exception confirming that rule!This soundtrack contains perfect classical pieces, brilliant jazz, and the unique Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing sung by Chris Isaak, and used for the movie's trailer.Some of the tracks, like György Ligeti's tense yet pure compositions or the music from the breathtaking Masked Ball scene in the movie, are highly dramatic. Others, like orchestra versions of Strangers In The Night and When I Fall In Love, are optimistic and light.Well worth it, especially if you've seen the movie. And if you haven't... well, do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make yourself a Martini","review":"This is a spooky and moving soudtrack. The schmatlzy tunes are creepy in context and Listz's 'Grey Clouds' has a feeling of sensual dread. Though Ligeti's nerve jangling 'Musica Ricerata' frames the album I think the centerpiece is Oscar Levant's 'Blame It On My Youth', an subdued ode to the folly of desire. Classic Kubrick irony is also on display with the Shostakovich Waltz tune. This film and soundtrack makes a nice double feature to that other cinematic rumination on marriage, fidelity, and sexuality: David Lynch's 'Lost Highway'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected it to be good. It was better than that. By far.","review":"I ordered this soundtrack, expecting one or two good songs. What I didnt expect was that the CD was nothing but good songs.

I highly recommend this to anyone, even if they did not like the movie (Which i would find hard to believe!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack.","review":"This already is the best soundtrack I have ever heard (Aside from \\"The Thin Red Line\\" soundtrack).

They seem to last longer and have an extra first string. They both have nice sound, though the Elixir has a slicker feel (which I don't prefer). So yeah these were great until the first string broke and I had to replace them all (*cough* LOVE D'Addario for including extra first string).

I bought this because I thought I could make interesting music with it while I'm away from my piano but...it's much more simplistic and in my opnion, it's for people who don't have any musical background at all.

Little fun touches make it also enjoyable by being able to record short sentences, phrases or words that can be used on top of the music. It's a 2-channel little mixer!!

If you like games where there is no set \\"goal\\", no \\"point\\" system, and no way to record what you've done, then you'll love Electroplankton. If you're into games for the art, rather than the bragging rights, then you'll love Electroplankton.Personally, I love this... application. It's hard to call it a game, because it really pushes the definition. It's a lot of fun, definately for short bursts, say 5-10 minutes at a time, but I could see me playing with this game in years.It's deinfately a niche product, and it's very obvious why they decided to only sell it online. I just happen to be a member of that niche.As a basic rule, if you like Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works Vol II, you've probably got the mindset to like Electroplankton.

Enough about the MF bees already, we get it. He likes bees. Too bad Mailer lost the opportunity to explore historical characters from the era with his obsession on tedious detail. DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailer's Muse- Deiter!?!?!","review":"This is a purely scatological romp through Freud's scheme of childhood development. I made it almost to the end until Mailer etched in a pedophilic unzipping- wow what a surprise! I should have expected it. After that I did not want to know the ending or rather I already knew- Hitler was evil- surprise!!Move over Gunter Grass ( pen name: porno-Grass) you have been bested in the disgusting genre of slasher kuka. Simply because a writer can create a good sentence does NOT by association make him or her a great artist. And this festering mound of words is the leit motif for such venal and crass art.This book seldom gives you time to breath before the next scene offends your senses. The pages almost literally drip with a putrid ooze that can hurt you- caveat emptor!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are completing your collection","review":"Don't expect much from this one.

From premise to execution, this book absolutely sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wasted a couple of evenings plowing through this simply awful book. Awful not just for the subject matter but because it is so poorly written, clumsy and ridiculous. It's Mailer's self-indulgence at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this about?","review":"This was my first Mailer novel, and from what I've read - both between the covers of the book as well as the reviews here on Amazon - I chose poorly.We're led to believe this is a story of Hitler's formative years. When you look at the bibliography, it seems Mailer intended (and produced) something of a historical fiction. However, while we see much of Hitler's ancestors (particularly his father and his difficulties with the zipper), and a little of the young \\"Adi\\", it almost seems to me this is more of an musing on the workings of good and evil - God and the Devil, from the Devil's perspective - with an infamous product of this struggle as context.If I were to Twitter a riddle regarding Castle in the Forest, I might write, \\"What do you get when you cross The Rolling Stones (Sympathy for the Devil), Freud and Oedipus Rex?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Banality of The Castle in the Forest","review":"There is something extremely plodding about this book, which truly surprised me. A novel, narrated by an underling demon, tracing the development of the evil that animated Adolf Hitler sounds like a fascinating, delicious premise. Instead, it is the framework for banal insights about Hitler's mundane Freudian hang-ups. Even the demon underling assigned to his \\"case\\" does little more than observe the small, sneaky, cold-hearted kid grow up.But, in the end, what special ingredient the demons may have mixed in with the banality of Hitler's congenital evil to create the extraordinary evil of the mature Hitler isn't addressed.Perhaps that's the point. There is no explanation. But it was frustrating to continue reading, reading, reading in hopes of coming upon a kernel of fresh insight that isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pathetic book-Shame on you Norman!","review":"I have to tell you...there have been VERY few books that I have not been able to finish in my many decades as a voracious reader. This was definitely one of those books. I agree with one of the other reviewer's comment that the first 50 pages WERE mind-numbing and hard to follow. About 1/2 way through the book, I gave it up. Its all over the place and its just....AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The makings of a monster","review":"Mailer gives us an early childhood scenario of Hitler, a description of his surroundings and a look into his moldings of becoming a monster. His family is described as well. the problem with this book is that I never really felt the growth of this demon dictator. maybe it was written in such nuance that escaped me but I wanted to more vivdly paint a picture ofr me. It didnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to find Hitler in these pages.","review":"This is a strangely disappointing book. I guess I expected some clear connection with Adolf Hitler, some bit of evidence or conjecture that would make the man more of a creature like us. Instead, Mailer has seized on the old rumors about his family, his father, incest, and has drawn a picture that suggests the damage Hitler may (must) have suffered as a child. It is in short Mailer's imagination we are dealing with here, and his alone. There is nothing here for the historian, and perhaps that was my mistake. I was thinking historical fiction when I began reading it. There is virtually nothing of history present in the work. And worse, we learn nothing new about Hitler. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Castle In The Forest","review":"What a disappointment. Where did Mailer come up with this idea for a novel? Half way through it and I just couldn't continue -- a total waste of good reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and twisted","review":"I was very upset by this book. I stopped reading it after three chapters. Norman Mailer is a deeply disturbed, dirty old man. The book had less to do with Hitler than with Mailer's bizarre imagination. While no one would dispute the fact that Hitler was a horrible man, Mr. Mailer mind seems to dwell in a sick and twisted world. This book does nothing to enlighten us. It is demeaning to the human spirit.

I picked it up for $2 in an Ethiopian-owned tobacco shop, figuring \\"What the heck. For two bucks, if it stinks, I'll just toss it.\\" And that is exactly what I did. The print is horrible. The green banding through the middle of the screen rendered the DVD unwatchable. It hit the trash bin less than 5 minutes in. Sorry to soil my local land fill with such garbage. The distributor, Miracle, doesn't even print their name on the package. What does that tell you?I still haven't seen Strange Love...

Not only is it more realistic form of telepathy (the animals are not the heroes and Cherryh does not pretend to underline that) but the world explodes in your eyes, ears, your nose and your well being.Cherryh's writing is unmatched as far as her style. She really plays with the words and phrases in such a way that she makes you feel everything around you.In this book you get Cherryh's writing, great ecology, genuine charactes,impeccable plot, and a heck of a mystery with a twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rider at the Gate is gripping and well written","review":"C.J. Cherryh has created a world populated by both people and creatures that both fascinate and terrorize at the same time. Her writing style in protraying the telepathic link between humans and nighthorses as well as her world and character build up creates a novel that has the reader feeling as if they were there. While most writers would just descripe the weather in passing Cherryh makes you feel the cold blast of winter winds and snow down your collar and the strugle to put one foot in front of the other. As for the terror and suspense of the novel she delivers the same quality of writing making the reader shiver not from the cold but from the feeling that it is happening to them. Where some writers have a hard time developing just one basic plot, Cherryh gives due time and effort to all of her plot lines greatly increasing the depth of the novel as she overlays, merges and sometimes plot twits them. This is a definite must read page turning novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a materpiece","review":"A great idea suprisingly poorly written. Good humour used is its saving grace.

I only know three of the songs but enjoyed the whole CD; in particular Maria. He sang it so beautifully it brought goose bumps which just worsened with that last note. Vittorio would definitely appeal to the women because of his warm, passionate voice and not because of his good looks as a previous reviewer kept on harping on. Vittoria sometimes sounded like Josh Grobin but only fleetingly. I'm a Josh Grobin fan but I could grow to like Vittorio more because of his richness of voice. This CD is worth having among your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vittorio","review":"I just adore Italian singers and found Vittorio a year ago. His voice is higher and delicate and hecomposes this songs with a contemporary twist using electric guitar at times. I would not consider him a classical-type singer.

Although Groban is in his own space in the US, he is not in the same league. His voice will never be on that level. I've loved Bocelli since 1999 when I went to his concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I've always felt he was the best in terms of pop/italian/opera mix singer, but there was always something missing from his voice. I did not know what until I heard Vittorio sing Tu Sei. I've always believed that the song makes the singer and that if the singer did enough with the song to make it his own, he will deserve the praise. Vittorio has done that with Tu Sei. His voice is powerful with the right mix of talent and softness. I'm going to look forward to his future CDs and I hope he continues to pick the right songs to sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Italian Tenor","review":"I don't believe there is a more incredible voice on earth.

After a few trial attempts, it fit fine, and didn't leak at all.

It did not fit well on the 1/2\\" pipe as it was designed to. Even after greasing the stub, it never got flush with the wall. I got it to about a 1/4 in close to the wall and figured I'd caulk the gap. Tested for leaks and water dripped out the back when the diverter was up.

I give it a 4 star instead of 5 because I think the directions were not too clear. I had to read them a few times to fully understand the procedure, but once I did all went smooth. One thing the directions do not mention is about caulking around the tub spout where it meets the tile, I highly recommend that to prevent water from seeping in between the spout and wall.All in all, a good product at a great price.

Unfortunately more water was coming out of the tub spout than going up to the shower on my old one so I tried to replace it with this one. The instructions are poorly written, mine didn't even come with a hole through the threads to allow the set screw to contact the copper pipe. You have to adjust and readjust the position of the slip on plastic tube, to get it just right so that it tightens securely when the spout touches the wall AND the spout is facing downward.

Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze, Martins Lifespan SP, Dr, D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze, and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all, smooth on my fingers. Second, Elixir Phospher bronze, last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good.

The break has been consistantly occuring at the bridge.I called Elixir and explained the problem. They are not only sending me 3 new whole sets of strings, but 3 more spare G-strings. A search on the internet suggests that sometimes you can get a bad run of strings. These things happen, but I am very impressed with how Elixir takes care of their customers!I'd give it 5 stars, but..., well... the G-strings keep breaking. Let's hope it IS just a bad run of strings...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get These Strings","review":"I strung my Fender acoustic with these Elixir strings about 5.5 years ago, guess what? They're still on my guitar!! Going strong and sounding better with use. Initially, the sound is bright and crystal clear with high tones. Of course you can make them what ever you want by tuning your strings higher or lower, however they're very crisp at the onset. After some wear and use, they get even better. You still get that clarity and tone however with more character, as one can imagine. Easier sliding on the fret with less friction noise.I'm stuck on Elixirs for life. Just buy them, it's a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control and Customer Service!","review":"At a friend's suggestion, I purchased a set of these hoping to reduce the number of times I had to replace my strings. The 3rd string (D-string) snapped during installation and the string wasn't even close to being up to tension.While it would be theoretically great to have a set of strings that would last much longer, paying 3-4 times the going rate for a set of strings that breaks during installation is ridiculous. I contacted Elixir, but never heard a word. So much for their quality control and customer service.

They are good only when used in a noisy environment but next to unusable in a silent room where one would like to switch off the noise canceling feature to get clearer sound quality.The problem is that whenever the battery is installed the rightmost earphone makes this fast \\"ticking\\" sound. It is audible enough to be heard even with the music playing (with volume level set to low). Switching the headphones to the \\"bypass\\" mode does not eliminate this \\"ticking\\" sound.So I have found that the only way to use these headphones in the silent room is to take off the battery.

I've used the QC15s for roughly two years and absolutely love them. I'm in the market for another pair of noise cancelling headphones and wanted to give Sennheiser a shot--again. I paid $299 for the QC15s and $349 for the PXC450s.The PXC450s have decent sound reproduction but nothing compared to the QC15s. The sound is muffled with significantly lackluster. The drivers in the PXC450s also touch my ear when wearing them--with normal use and slight movement the drivers chafe and cause irritation. The over-the-ear cups are giant and leave gaps which renders the ANC useless. If holding the cups tightly to my ears, the ANC isn't anywhere near the quality and significance of the QC15s.My recommendation is to steer-clear of the PXC450s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I have been looking for headphones for traveling and notice Sennheiser PXC 450 headphoones.

The packaging is great. The headphones look nicely put together and they are super comfortable. It's all downhill from there. The noise-canceling aspect is highly overrated. It didn't block out any sounds. Now, I'm not new to noise-canceling and knew what I should expect at a minimum. It didn't even come close to the Audio Technica pair I had before. My son was playing the Wii and I could hear EVERYTHING. Additionally, while having it plugged into my laptop, the volume while watching Netflix left a lot to be desired. Needless to say, I returned these a few days later. I love Amazon, though. They took them back with no issue. Unfortunately, I'm still looking for a good pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The sound quality of the Sennheiser headphones is very good, but problems exist. The fit is poor. They are not snug over the ears, shifting frequently when worn so that there are gaps that allow noise to come in. This was true for both me and my wife. It isn't a case of \\"one size fits all.\\" It didn't properly fit either of us. Another factor of this shifting of position was that there was a frequent deep pulsation that was very annoying. If the headphones were held tight over the ears, the pulsation went away, but when worn normally, it returned almost every time I moved my head. Even the active noise suppression was not adequate. On a flight, it was not enough to allow my wife to clearly hear the dialogue of the movie over the sound of the engines. For a higher priced set of headphones, they did not meet our expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after PXC 350","review":"I am not a tech freak but do fly frequently and used to own a pair of Sennheiser PXC 350 to use on flights and was very pleased with them. However they recently were annexed by an unknown person on a KLM flight along with my MP3 player (you know who you are) so I needed a replacement. Since the PXC 350 is not made anymore I turned to the PXC 450 instead. The sound quality as well as the noise cancellation is way below the PXC 350. The volume control is integrated into the headphones and therefore difficult to reach vs the 350 where it was conveniently located on the cable. Calmer music (or watching a film where people whisper) is not satisfactory as the outside noise remains extremely high and the volume is very low even in highest setting with MP3 player and headphone. I absolutely cannot recommend these headphones, a clear step back from its predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Quality","review":"Yes they are expensive but they make sense if you do a lot of flying in airplanes.

Still, for really long flights and other noisy environments, they just aren't as comfortable as an over-the-ear style, so I decided it was time to invest in that second pair of headphones for these special cases.I looked mainly at the Bose and the Senheiser. Honestly, I liked the more compact size and shape of the Bose - but they really didn't sound all that good. Muddy highs, muffled bass - and good (but not terrific) noise cancelation. The Senheiser was clearly better in terms of comfort and sound quality, but they are unfortunately bigger and bulkier. In the end, I went for the better sound of the Senheiser's.To be clear, the Shure's blow away anything I've owned in terms of raw sound quality, but the Senheiser's are maybe 90% as good and are much more comfortable to wear on a four hour flight.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser PXC 450","review":"Headphones are fine - they are very comfortable.

With these Sennheiser headphones, they work great, are comfortable, never had a problem with them other than they don't get as loud as I like. Maybe it's because the power source is a little AAA battery. At the gym, I kept wanting to turn them or the iPod up louder, as I could hear the music the gym was playing.

I needed to wash that Synth-Zeppelin out of my brain and Purple did the trick. Perfect Strangers has better songs and much better musicianship. I got to hand it to Purple for having the guts to reform and deliver a strong album!

What the sugar happened to led zep? Well, they ran out of ideas, they over indulged in drugs/drink whatever. Just look at their solo careers. What solo careers? Exactly. You see most of their (good) stuff is derived from other people's music, blues and folk, so there was a limit to how much quality music they could produce, they hadn't got enough talent/imagination to break free and make good 'different' kind of music. So you get this mess of an album, it's all synths but they are not used very effectively. I am fond of careslambra in a cheesy way, that's it. Jimmy Page is a guitar God,not on this album though.

Early bluesy, hard hitting rock is the first 3 albums. Led Zep 4 through Presence are the middle period of the bands greatest works having that classic rock, very mature, fully realized and executed Zep only sound. The last period of work is the John Paul Jones influenced synth post-modern period. It is very similar in tone to Robert Plant's initial solo career workings. Very different from the Page/Plant post-led zep sound of today. In the evening and all of my love represent this newest, great sound from the band.

Im glad that good old J.D. let everyone know how Zepplin got around to deciding how they should go about doing their albums.All you had to do was show up to band practice first! I can see it now....Jones got up early on Christmas morning to discover that Santa had left him a brand new keyboard set.He rushes down as quick as he can and to his amazement he is the first to show up to practice so he gets to have first say on how the album will go.Soon afterwards Bonham gets mad because he thinks its his turn to be first and goes on a drinking binge and........well we all know what happened after that dont we.Get over it.this album sucked back then and it still does today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Zep freak who hates this album.","review":"I am a huge Zep fan but, when this album came out my friend and I thought it was a joke by the radio station that was playing it for the first time.

Like all of the zep albums previous to it, i either immediately loved each song, or it grew on me. I find it quite sad that many of the fans weren't able to expand and enjoy the later led zeppelin just because the sound evolved. The earlier stuff is wonderful, but I think the later is too. In fact, one of my favorite songs is the last track here, All of My Love. (Hot dog too, heh, heh, fun song) Regardless of what anyone else says, I loved this album, and the open Led Zep fan will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Everyone is quick to bash this album, even though it is perhaps their most progressive of all. Their sound had to change over their 11 year existence and it finally did on In Through the Out Door. Anyone who says the the synthesizers detract from the quality of the album is just being silly. If they kept with the same old style, which was not in any way getting old, they could not call themselves an actual BAND that makes actual MUSIC that actually has to CHANGE over time. They owed it to themselves, as well as the fans, to show everyone what they were made of and come out with something a bit different. In Through the Out Door is no better nor no worse than any of the other Zep masterpieces and anyone who thinks any different is really not a TRUE Zeppelin fan, but someone who is meerly finding small flaws in the greatest collaboration of talent ever put together. May Zep's music live on forever to show future generations what music should actually sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"For John Paul Jones fans","review":"Some reviewers believe that if John Bonham had not died, this album represents what the mighty Led Zep would have sounded like during the 80's. What is not understood is what was going on in the band in the late 70's. Pagey's heroin habit was catching up to him, which explains why he is such a non-entity. Take a good look at the song credits, nearly every single song includes John Paul Jones in the writing credits. This is a Jonesy/Percy album, not a Pagey/Percy album, and yet another facet of the band that included folk (III), pop (Houses of the Holy), blues (I & II) and hard rock (Physical Graffitti, Presence), and combinations of all of the above (IV) in their repertoire. Check out the outtakes from these sessions that appear on Coda. Page is back in control of the band and back in form (Darlene, Walter's Walk). In Through The Out Door is just another step (albeit the final one) in the wonderful musical journey known as Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Swan Song","review":"Final album features the emergence of Mr Jones.

To me, this band never made me a real fascination, though some their songs are nice too... I think Deep Purple is more quite nice and powerfull,...ok it is part of major taste! The early ZEP albums were much better, because their original style was more oriented in blues rock music, in fact Led Zep was not a typical pure Hard Rock band... This album is really a bit tedious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wha a disillusion feeling this one!!!","review":"the only one song I like is Fool is the rain, ZEPPELIN did not play like their those first albums in the early 70's.

That is no wonder.......right????"},{"rating":"1","title":"the man with the female voice???","review":"what happened to the man with a female voice?

I love \\"Hot Dog.\\" It is a fun song. Sometimes all a good song needs to be is fun. I'm sure that was what they were thinking. And Zep never padded the albums with filler. As far as the rest goes...the times were changing and so were Jimmy and company. I'll meet you half way and say a three star for a Zep album and a four star to anything else released by another artist that year. Final thought: Jimmy was out of it and every band needs to evolve and try something different. I will never forget the weird water color album sleeve. What was that all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ten Minutes No Longer","review":"I had never listened to much Led Zeppelin before I was introduced to \\"Fool in the Rain\\" by a close friend. Since then, I have acquired every Led Zeppelin album except Presence on vinyl, and although they are by far the best band of all time, nothing compares to Fool in the Rain. It's just a song that makes you go, \\"Uh!\\" The album gets 5 stars for this song alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin's swan song? Indeed it is!","review":"There are those that say that this is Led Zeppelin's most uninspired album. I vehemently disagree. True, it doesn't have the rock and roll R&B feel like their first two albums, but it is one of my personal favorites nonetheless. The main difference between \\"In Through the Outdoor\\" and their other works is that John Paul Jones takes the creative lead instead of Jimmy Page. The result is a more melancholy, keyboard driven, sound. \\"In the Evening\\" is one of the more jammin' songs, while \\"All My Love\\" is a bittersweet ballad about Robert Plant's departed son. They even take an ambitious stab at synth pop with the song \\"Carouselambra\\". \\"Hot Dog\\", which has a hillbilly sound to it, is the only song I don't really care for. Overall, I can't think of a better way to end a colossal musical career than to depart from the norms that Led Zeppelin themselves established in the world of hard rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated Album","review":"Many people say that Zep started declining after Phsyical Graffiti. While they did start making different music, it didn't get any worse. I did not have high hopes for this album, but they were blown out of the water anyway. This is a very different kind of Zeppelin - definitely very different from the Zep you'd hear on II or even Houses of the Holy. I got my copy for under 5 dollars, when I would have payed 12 at a record store. Definitely take the time to listen to this overlooked gem.In The Evening does not set an appropriate tune for the entire album. This song features Plant's vocals at their weakest. However, the rest of the album is all gold. My favorites include Fool in the Rain, Hot Dog and All My Love.Please buy this album. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fares better than Presence","review":"Led Zeppelin's final studio album fares better than Presence.\\"In Through the Out Door\\" is a great title for an album. The songs have more structure and melody. \\"In the Evening\\" ,\\"Fool in the Rain\\", and \\"All My Love\\" are latter day Zeppelin classics. However, the rest of the album is awash with synthesizers and experimental rollicking songs like \\"South Bound Suarez\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\".

It was recorded in 'ABBA's 'Polar studios', and was recored after Robert Plant's son's death. Jimmy Page and John Bonham were both fighting dependcies. It also was the last album Zeppelin would record as a band. It was a springboard for what could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I do not find any of good albums in this synthesizer versions,...Led Zeppelin tried to make a pop scene, but left their legacy from the first three albums.

A few years later, tragedy in rock and roll land occured, Jimmy Page and the boys got lazy when they tried to also use the synthesizer, and downsized the incredible force that was Led Zeppelin. \\"In Through the Out Door,\\" Led Zeppelin's crapsterpiece sounds like an old man dying (the old man is rock), after taking an entire bottle of AOR. The only thing that makes this album palateable is the irresistable classic \\"Fool in the Rain,\\" which is reason enough to pick it up. It's ironic to think that an album containing such a fresh and exciting song is one of the albums that killed rock and roll and paved the way for many crappy 80's artists that were inspired by this rock and roll drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But not the best","review":"This Album has its moments, like In the Evening.

Its Led Zeppelin left to their own devices... and it shows. The album starts off really strong with In The Evening - great song. The 3rd track Fool In The Rain is kind of a fun pop song - pretty good tune . Unfortunately the festivities end there. The rest of this album is a musical exploration into mediocrity. The song All My Love is 100% certified crap. If youre Michael Bolton its a work of art. If youre Led Zepp its a cry for help. Im GonnaCrawl ... This is what Zeppelin sounds like trying to write a blues song ... without the help of Wilie Dixon , Muddy Waters or the host of other bluesmen they \\" borrowed \\" from . Anyway, the point is this is very dissapointing album especially comming off a 3 year wait from Presence.. which was a pretty decent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge zep fan","review":"This album was a dissapointment. Buy it only if you are a Zep fun. If not, prefer some of their older albums. The only songs that stand out are \\"In the evening\\" and \\"All my love\\", there is nothing else in this album. Even these 2 songs are mediocre for Zep."},{"rating":"2","title":"took awhile","review":"Initially, I didn't make it a priority to listen to this album despite of my new found \\"hardcore\\" Zeppelin fan status. I had heard a lot of negative things about this album, so I didn't bother. Then, my friend had a copy, so I gave it a listen. First listen, I pretty much figured there was nothing good on the album besides Fool In The Rain. I listened again, and In The Evening, proved to be a definite stand-out (imo, the best song on the album), and again, All My Love seemed very heartfelt and emotional. I listened to South Bound Saurez and I'm Gonna Crawl, turning out to be pretty decent songs. Hot Dog to me is the only \\"bad\\" song on here. Then, Carouselambra. I gave that a few listens, not listening the whole way through, then considered it an ok song, but I gave it a few listens all the way through, and I now consider it awesome. That song was definitely a step forward for Zeppelin. Don't bash this album.

I am still in discussion with them over who is going to pay freight to send the 'wrong' tool back and if they are going to refund my $49.99. I realize this type problem is noted in Amazon's terms.

Mr. Dyson should have made it differently because I am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great for Hardwood Floors.","review":"I first have to say how much I LOVE my Dyson vacuum. I was looking for a vacuum to sweep my hard wood floors better and could reach under furniture. This is awkward to use and it either pushes the dirt around or sucks to the floor so you have to bend down to lift just a little to get the right power. I would not recommend this, the bare floor setting for the vacuum cleaner works just fine.

I think it should be included with the vacuum and I think it should fit onto the vacuum somehow for storage. But that aside, my only real complaint about it is that it doesn't stay on the bare floor setting all the time. Sometimes it snaps back to the rug setting, and then the suction is too much for the bare floor AND it sounds like it's scraping the floor. Maybe I'm not snapping it securely enough into the bare floor setting, but whatever---it should be easier to do!I do love how it only needs a couple of inches of clearance, though. And the rug setting works just as well as that on the main vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jar Pop opener","review":"The Jar Pop opener is just great for opening jars with harmetically sealed lids.

It doesn't get too much into the nitty-gritty, hard-working pages of ads mixed with content, but it does talk about process and consistency of voice. The author lets several editors explain the design choices they made when faced with title relaunches and updates, and how those choices reinforced the type, photography, writing style, and illustrations used.

Ultimate Fights has done just that! They have taken a collection of movies both old and new and selected some of the greatest fight scenes ever directed. Of course, I don't agree with 100% of them, but that is where the fun is. I showed this to some of my friends and we argued over which movies should really be considered for ultimate fights and our list wasn't that different.

Her subsequent long-distance relationship with Maurice changes her relationship with both her grandfather and Monsieur Klein, the pharmacist who provides the thyroid pills for her grandfather.Zazoo's grandfather is reminiscent of the grandfather in Gentlehands by M. E. Kerr. Mosher, however, has woven a more intricate, delicate and rich plot around the threads of war and remembrance.This poignant dual love story speaks of war and peace, friendship and silence, love, hate and forgiveness in a stirringly poetic manner. As a librarian I read numerous young adult novels each year. This is the finest I have read in a long time. Reading Zazoo is like eating an exquisitely prepared meal.

However, the arrangements are pretty annoying; it's just not a pleasure to listen to. I'd suggest looking for something that's done better musically, even if the songs aren't standards.

I thought I'd give her vocal cords a break & increase his repertoire. Mom & Dad both dislike the CD BECAUSE it's got kids singing. (Most small kids don't care about staying in tune and it gets annoying if you have good pitch, which both parents do.) Nick isn't so sure yet but he may change his mind. This is not the CD to buy if you're going to play it in the car unless you like listening to small children sing (picture the little kids' choir from church or pre-school programs).

It is an adventure story about a California teen who is taken on a pearl hunting adventure by a sailor uncle. While written for younger readers it has captured my imagination for five decades and is still enjoyed regularly. The writing is clear, descriptive of the pearl trade, adventurous, and chronicals a young boy turned to manhood free diving into the depths paralled with dangerous encounters on land. It captures the spirit of the 1920s both on the open ocean and in the pearl lagoons after which it is named. The story rings true today and is in all ways entertaining. An easy read from a first class author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting.","review":"William Shatner explores the theory of the ancient astronauts as he meets & talks with serveral experts.

Freedom at Midnight is about the transition of India from a British Colony to an independent nation on midnight of 15 August 1947. I learned about the history and background of that event, however, the stongest attribute of this book is the description of the characters and personalities involved. The key players are Mountbatten, Ghandi, Nehru and Jinnah. I developed a high regard and respect for Ghandi and his work. I did not feel that the authors presented one viewpoint at the expense of others. If there is a fault with this splendid book it is in its over-reliance on Mountbatten. Even that is minor and forgiveable. What does come through is how the lives of the people at an individual level were and are still affected by this historic political change. If you are interested in the history of India, this book will be interesting to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition of this book is very badly formatted","review":"FREEDOM AT MIDNIGHTThis review refers to the kindle edition of the book that I purchased from amazon.I am disappointed with how the book has been formatted. I don't think the publisher as well as amazon took any effort to review If the content was converted properly to kindle format1) the original book had great black and white photographs and maps. None of them render correctly on the kindle as well as kindle apps running in iPad and android. All is see is some junk on the screen.2) the letters and words are spaced very badly. In many places within the book there are a few blank spaces between each of the letters in a word.This is true when viewing the content on a kindle as well as the iPad and android kindle apps.A wonderful book but the kindle edition has ruined my reading experience.FREEDOM AT MIDNIGHT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountbatten Autobiography","review":"I have to accept that this is one of the better books regarding India's early days. The authors are great narrator, and it sounds more like a novel. One of the major flaws in a book is that it is written to glorify Mountbatten. For example, initially the book goes through a great detail to explain that it was Mountbatten's idea to give Independence quickly. It explains that he fights with Churchill, and he goes against most of his colleagues to give India's freedom quickly. But later when Punjab is burning, the authors say that it was the Indian leaders' idea to give freedom quickly.I have to accept that I never read anything about Jinnah, Is he really as evil as he was portrayed in this book?The authors really did a good work on Gandhi. Each and every event, such as Congress stabbing him in the back, controlling the riot in Calcutta was written well.In conclusion, great book and a must read, but don't have your conclusion based on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debatable Information","review":"Fascinating book! A must buy! But way too much regard for the 'Butcher' Mountbatten.Read 'The Proudest Day' (written by British authors) for more info on his bungling of the power transfer.One more thing.The authors term Veer Savarkar(a misunderstood revolutionary) as a 'homosexual'.Huh?This,after reading tons & tons of material on Savarkar.Can anybody tell me how the authors found out this 'fact' ?Mind you,this guy was termed as a fanatic,& not many people took him seriously ...certainly not the establishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly prejudiced","review":"The book has two heroes, Mountbatten and Mahatma Gandhi, some supporting roles like Nehru, Krishna Menon and villains like Jinnah and Godse. I guess the authors did not accurately put the case of Jinnah and Godse as to why they did what they did. The author is very selective when describing Mountbatten as a person to whom the so-called \\"desperate and incompetent\\" Indian establishment, used to fall back. If the main interviewee for the book is Mountbatten, obviously the hero is Mountbatten. Dominique Lapierre was a friend of Lord Brabourne, son-in-law of Mountbatten and suitably the story was aligned to what Mountbatten had views on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is worthless","review":"I have read this book many a times.

The details the authors are able to give while having a smooth and easy read is incredible. After this book is a must to buy the Red Sari. II would say that in the west most people have little knowledge of the two biggest countries in the world India and China, the better we understand their history and their thinking it will be possible to understand why they act or do things differently.

As a Hindu I was apalled.The book demonizes Jinnah, makes Gandhi a ... mess and Nehru into an inept fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allright but not neutral","review":"This book looks at the events leading to and after the independence and partition of India in a western angle. Allots too many pages to Hindu rituals irrelevant to the subject. Majority of the content is based on Mountbatten's input. Claims that the British wanted to do good for India at the same time saying that they tried to make 576 parts of India. This should be named \\"Mountbattens adventures in India\\" rather than \\"Freedom at Midnight\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Man Self Aggrandizement","review":"This book is based on thirty hours of interviews granted by Louis Mountbatten to its authors. It is essentially a one-man version of how India won its independence. Reading this book, one would think that the \\"white-knight\\" Mountbatten rode into India to save the day, overlooking the fact that the British had subjugated those people, sometimes, brutally, for over a century. There are several better books which give a much more balanced and objective account of the Indian Independence without sounding like someone's diary or a sycophantic homage from a couple of grateful writers.

One is by content another by the quality of the book itself. The content of \\"Freedom \\" is great. The best single read to understand the tensions between the modern states of India and Pakistan. Laprie and Collins are at their best here.However I was disapointed to find the quality of the book itself was poor. The paper was substandard ( close to newspaper quality). The Picture on the hard back was seeminly glued and ofset. The plates ( pictures) inside the book were hard to see and the captions were difficult to read .Had I known the quality was this bad I would have ordered the soft back version. Sadly this book was to be a present . Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Acting by Hero and Villain; fine supporting cast","review":"Somewhere along the line, the TV Cowboy and Spaghetti Western Tough Guy, became Actor and Director, Clint Eastwood. Now at 3 days younger than I, he is one of the relatively very few Hollywood figures who can claim a body of work, before and behind the camera, which justifies membership in the Entertainment Business Elite.This is a film which allows him to be tough and tender but never overblown or sentimental. The matching with Malkovich, who also turns in a first class performance, provides a dialectic of qualities which energize the production. The interaction with Rene Russo, humanizes his character, with a minimum of romantic moments. There are a few static and stereotyped characters, but, for the most part, the few important supporting roles are strongly performed.Not the best film of its type ever made, but, a very good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father's Day Gift","review":"I purchased this DVD for my husband for Father's Day. We had seen this movie at the theater when it was released and enjoyed it. We have now watched this movie again and find it has remained timeless and as entertaining as ever. Classic Clint Eastwood, plenty of suspense and action. John Malcovich is very convincing as the villian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Eastwood!","review":"Perfect blend of suspense-thriller, romance, & action. Eastwood, as usual, blends humanity and vulnerability and being an action hero. This is a guy who is aging gracefully and is at the top of his game. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, but corny ending","review":"this is a pretty good movie that revolves around a Secret Service man who is haunted down by an assassin out to get the President of the United States. Eastwood's character was a Secret Service agent that was there the day JFK was killed, but he did nothing, and how Malchovich is trying to kill the President and leave Eastwood as the only Secret Service man to be involved in the death's of 2 Presidents.good overall movie, but then the last half hour or so just gets to corny and it almost ruins the movie. you already know what is going to happen, but in the matter or way that it happens is corny.still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, if you like movies about chases.","review":"This movie was a hit, but an underrated hit. You can ask a lot of people what they think of this movie and they reply never heard of it, or they forgot about it. But John Malkovick gives the most respectable bad guy performance up their with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Clint Eastwood gives a great role as a secret service agent.Great music also.I like the part where Makovich asks Clint, \\"late at night when the demons come, what do you see\\". Other nice parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLINT and John!!","review":"In this movie we find a secert service agent past his prime trying to prevent the assasination of the president. Clint Eastwood's best acting job since his Dirty Harry day's. As always John malcavich does an excellent job at acting. Hands up for all acting in this movie. and great story line that made the movie very intreging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thriller ever","review":"John Malkovich gives a remarkable performance that is simultaneously both incredibly terrifying and gripping. Clint Eastwood gives an equally strong performance as a washed up old secret service agent. This is my favorite Eastwood film, because there is such complexity to the story but with that same Clint Eastwood attitude that gets your adrenaline pumping. There are a couple classic lines that Clint Eastwood makes unforgettable. His romance with Rene Russo is done very well, I especially like the charming piano scene, which showed some complexity and gave insight into Eastwood's character. Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malkovich at his best!","review":"Though the first billing of this show was Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich was the real star deservedly earning himself the Best Supporting Actor nomination. No offence to Mr Landau's impeccable performance in Ed Wood but I bet the Oscars are going to do the same to Malkovich some time when he's a senior too. It's your usual run-after-the-bad-guy thriller but Malkovich's evil portrayal of the screwed up assassin maniac will keep you watching, even if you know he's going to die in the end (typically Hollywood!). He's a bad guy you love to hate and though he's supposed to be the evil one, you can't help but like him simply coz he's just so evil, you know like Alan Rickman in Robin Hood or Gary Oldman in Dracula. Brilliant movie for both guys and gals to watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"I watched this movie long time ago at the theater and liked it very much.Then I own it in a VHS tape.Now when I tried to search every site to own it in DVD, the price was too high thinking about how old this movie is.It was 19$ and something when I bought it and it's even higher now.Give us a break.

The hero is disgusted with the Luffwaffen and their bumbling leadership. I don't want to reveal ending but although based on a play, this in no way detracts from the film. Actually, it enhances it. It seems too many people these days want nothing more from a film than explosions and car chases and they have forgetten what real acting and drama is all about.

It is what I call system level approach for slicon fabrication. There is also emphasis on measurement and simulutions that are missing from traditional books. Both these are essential to modern technology. Also, I was very happy to see details on manufacturing choices - e.g. LOCOS vs STI.

I couldn't even turn it.At this point it would have been more exspensive to ship this piece of crap back than I paid to buy it so after trying to widen the gaps a bit it got a little easier to turn but still too hard.

It is made from thin plastic and it was extremely poor fitting, not a perfect circle. It was not even worth the $4 to return the $6 hood. No click like Canon Hoods. I had it for 42 or so days before it just split from end to end on its own while on the camera sitting on a shelf. Obviously there are also quality control issues with this manufacturer.

Like in many other reviews, I was scared I might break my expensive lens. But as suggested _ bought a 150 number sand paper from dollar store, rubbed the back of hood to take out some material. It took may be 10 minutes for me to do this. I need to take considerable amount of plastic from the bottom of the hood so that the hood fits lightly on the lens. used a vacuum cleaner to clean of the plastic dust.

Five med students (Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, and Oliver Platt) want to know what really lies beyond death.

One by one their sins are brought back to haunt them until they make amends with their past. The dark lighting and music keep you entranced throughout the film.

You cannot adjust their sensitivity to avoid this. I even had a neat idea to use them as faux orchestral chimes, each with their own arm coming off the drum rack.

However, after wearing for a short time it would start to slide but that is to be expected since my thigh is larger than my calf. At the end of the day the straps would start to cut into the back of my knee which was quite uncomfortable. To resolve this issue I started wearing the brace outside my pants (since it is winter). I have seen improvements in my knee since I have started using it. I don't have the pain and swelling that I had been having before hand. I will continue to use the brace when I exercise in the near future. I love the fact that I can bend my knee enough when using it that I can use it in yoga class (it allows me to kneel completely in the floor). I would recommend it to other fat people who can't fit anything else being that nothing else would fit for me to compare it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"run's large","review":"right style, support and design, just runs larger than expected.

I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay in place - keeps slipping down to ankle","review":"It won't stay in place if you move around alot so any activity is out of the question. If you are going to wear them to sit with your legs elevated they are fine. Otherwise they slide down to your ankles. I was able to get it to stay somewhat but I had to have it so tight that it was a bit painful.In short, I was disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.. could be better","review":"I received it in excellent time. However according to the sizing chart it said I needed a 5x. This was huge!!!! As in couldn't keep it up no matter how tight the straps were huge. So the sizing runs a bit big. Overall quality seemed ok but the primary reason it was returned was because the stitching on the side of one of the hinges was completely missing causing the hinge to pop out. Outside of that it appeared to be good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit","review":"I was very dissapointed first the 4xs made by this company in the other models are larger then the 5xs in this model which did not seem to make sense. aslo the brace always sliped off after a few steps I had read this in another review but did not take it to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"knee brace","review":"the brace has helped with my knee troubles and it is doing alot better thanks to the brace and yes I would buy another one if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly long lifespan","review":"I started using these strings about 2 or 3 years ago when I started to get sick of replacing my strings every week or two. I've had these strings last months before on my guitar, they endure some severe beatings and I think they sound better once they're settled in for a while anyway. These are honestly some of the best strings I've ever used, and they're much more worth buying than the cheapo strings because you end up paying more to replace those so often. The feel, sound, and overall quality of these strings is excellent, so if you're looking for a new brand of strings to rely on, Elixir is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I will keep it Short.

His main selling point was that they last a lot longer than most other brands outliving even rust better than most... and he was right.Here I am an adult now with a Gibson Les Paul and I still use these as I always have, and I know that these are the best buy you can get for quality sound and a nice solid feel that you can see and hear.Upon stringing these I love to know that I am getting another few years of quality sound that I refuse to live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound","review":"Excellent sound coming from these strings even with age.

I went to the store and bought another pack, put them on and within 2 hours of playing I broke another string that was bought from Amazon. I'm not sure if they were old when they were shipped, but I won't buy them again. They sounded good for the two hours they were on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elixir Disappoints","review":"I play at least ten hours a week, and typically change strings once a month. They get thoroughly cleaned after each session. Thought I'd try the Elixir strings (mediums) to see if they'd hold their tone better between changes than what I had been using. The experiment was very disappointing. When new, the tone wasn't as full as it was with my regular (much less expensive) strings, and what tone there was began to deteriorate in just a few days. In fact, the high E string already displays rust spots. After one week with these overpriced, underperforming strings, I'm changing back to economical, great sounding D'addario nickel mediums tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sound I've had in 40+ years","review":"I put these strings on my Gretch solid body, 70's vintage. I love the full and varied sound I can get with this guitar, can play anything with it. I don't play as much as I used to so I thought I would try the nanoweb coating on some super lights. Hated the sound. Not very full, and this guitar has very rich sound. Almost tinny.I have never had a set of strings that were worse than these in over 40 years of playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I bought a few sets of the elixirs because Suhr uses these as there standard string. These strings took all the fullness and rich tone out of my all mahogany guitar, they provide almost a fake new sounding quality if that makes sense.

There is maybe one track that haas any trace of Fripp's guitar skills. Ballad of Rodney Toady is consistently annoying, with Fripp's cheesy, pausing narration: \\"Rodney was a sad young man, because he was fat and ugly...'' The second half is even worse, but the song that is the most compelling in its patheticness is the ballad \\"The sun is shining, but it's raining in my heart ...\\" I wonder how many high school hours Fripp spent pining over those moving lyrics? Listening to this album is like prodding a wound: it hurts, but you feel compelled to keep prodding.

Wrong! This is a horrible adaptation, not at all true to the book. The characters are completely changed: Jane is described as \\"the pretty governess,\\" and engages in perky verbal sparring with a dashingly handsome and charming Rochester. In both the book and all other film adaptations I've seen, Jane is rather plain and humble, and Rochester is moody and NOT supposed to be handsome. Aside from the terrible adaptation from book to script, and the bad acting, the movie print itself used to master the DVD was in poor shape, and NOT restored. The resulting DVD is of annoyingly poor quality. This particular movie version is just plain bad, both story and technical quality. Try the versions with George C. Scott or William Hurt instead; they're very good. The Ciaran Hinds version is passable, though in his version Rochester comes off as just plain mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Jane Erye","review":"This movie isnt at all like the book its a very old movie !If you are a Jane Erye book fan dont waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Budget?

He swept away many of the cobwebs of human thought and meta-physical mysteries. To him, the brain, the limbic system,(although his concepts pre-dated modern brain theory), are really what's at the heart of human reason. He helped me to understand, the nature of truth, which is sufficient rational, based upon very human perception. Why is art beautiful? Why are entire people's irrational? Schopenhauer's work opens doors that modern psychology, in Freud and Jung stepped into.Heston's narration is very pleasant, and this treatment, although academic was very approachable for the dilettante.Gare Henderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur Schopenhaure","review":"Too much about him and not enough about his philosophy.

It just has crisper color and looks better on today's TVs.Oh, the best part - You aren't subject to 90 minutes of commercials when watching it!Pick up this classic on Blu-ray.

DeMille remains one of the greatest filmmakers Hollywood has ever seen. DeMille & Hitchcock are probably my two overall favorites. And DeMille's Biblical epic \\"The Ten Commandments\\" remains one of the greatest films ever to come out of Hollywood. Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner both shine in their respective roles as Moses and Ramses. And there are so many other great performances as well from Anne Baxter, John Derek, Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Yvonne DeCarlo and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, among others. The epic tale of Moses leading the Hebrews out of slavery never gets old, and I still get goosebumps when I watch the parting of the Red Sea! \\"The Ten Commandments\\" is a masterpiece, a timeless epic, and I hope that many generations will continue to enjoy it in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRINT, LOUSY SOUND","review":"THE STUDIO HAD A GREAT CHANCE HERE TO GET OUT A GREAT PRINT. tHE PICTURE IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN ON DVD.

The first part of the film is actually about Moses and the Ten Commandments. The second part of the film is a modern story dealing with the Ten Commandments.The first part of the film was the part that I really liked. It was pretty well done considering it was a silent film, and almost had to be over the top to get across its point to you.It was the second part that just dragged the whole movie down for me. I felt that part was just too long and spent time on scenes that didn't really need it. It lingered and lingered when it could have moved on to something else. It was well done, but just too long. And I say this as a person who appreciates the art of silent film. I know some of them were long, but this didn't keep my interest.If you're looking for the 1950's classic done in a silent version just watch the first part and skip the second. Or just come back to it at a later time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the Past","review":"They just don't make movies like this anymore.

The acting is first-rate eventhough it can be preachy and soap operaish at times. The settings are styleish. The clothes were right on the mark. The Moses in this film is cold but yet so commanding and caring. The Ramses in this film is likeable becuase how evil he is and he doesn't care who knows it. There's also great passion and rage what's brought out in his acting. The Supporting cast is first-rate becuase they have great actors to play them like Vincent Price,Edward G. Robinson & Mike Connors. They get across alot with very little screen time. What also makes this movie stand is the harshness. A world that's advance but yet savage. The only downside is that the movie forgets that Moses & Rames were brothers and there was no love in their eyes when they meet face-to-face. Overall,It's a great film despite it's flaws. I give this movie a 9 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it","review":"(ahem) Buy it, since what comes out these days is simple forgotten once out the bijou junk.. so.Buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount Blunder","review":"What happened to the 1923 Two-Color Technicolor? The best part about the original Cecil B. DeMille version of The Ten Commandments was its use of this early tinting process during the Exodus.

But...... well you know the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old testament mumbo jumbo","review":"Except for Yul Brynner's performance, costumes and attire, the rest of the movie is Old Testament religious propaganda. The movie is a slap in the face of the ancient Egyptians (of the New kingdom in the 18th & 19th dynasties) face. Moses never led the Hebrews from Egypt. He drove them out with the rest of the Hyksos invaders in 1570 BC. I'm surprised that more people don't question the Old Testament Megalomania. Is there a way to vote zero stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space Seem like a artistic Triumph","review":"Thankfully a lot of people feel the same way I do about this film. It is offensively bad. So bad it makes Wood's Plan9 from Outer Space seem like a true cinematic classic. The special effects were raved about in the 50's but films that pre date this one such as Pal's war of the World and When World's Collide trumph this by centuries. Fans of the mythology should have been appalled and those that found it campy give it a universe of extra credit. First time I've seen the film. Heard about it for 50 years and admittedly the subject matter has kept me from really ever watching it. But I had no idea just how bad a film could be. Give me Attack of the Killer Tomatoes any time over this abomination. This should have ended the acting careers of everyone involved. Its like Criswell Predicts meets Kathryn Kuhlman being produced by the crew of MST3000. Only its not funny.

The acting is superb, the colour sparkles and the story is is strong. At close to four hours, the time just flew and the restoration of the movie is excellent. I have rate this as one of the best movies movies this area. Yul Brynner's acting was also excellent (sorry, am I rooting for the bad guy?) but to be fair, I thought all the acting was excellent. For some reason though, Yul's acting as Rameses II stood out for me. His appearance and voice appeared more true to me and was a good foil to Charlton Heston's lead.Special effects wise this is good too. Even today you are hard pressed to compete against the final water scene where Yul's Egyptian army are destroyed by the flood of water held back by Charlton's Mose's role. I really think this is a strong movies for all the reasons listed above. The quality of the colours, story and acting really cannot be bettered. Top marks for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Annual Easter Tradition","review":"To me the most profound scene in the movie comes while Moses and Zipporah are resting in the shadow of Mt. Sinai. It is then that Moses questions how a God that lets men live in slavery can really exist , and why , he asks, is he a God of only Israel , and not all men ? It's a great moment.The three disc set is about as good as it gets in DVD collectibles. Great documentaries and the original 1920's film , which I confess I haven't watched.

I remember watching this on television for the first time and every year after, around easter, we knew to prepare for this spectacle when it came on. I remember how it filled my heart at such a young age with spirituality, a belief in a higher source and how through prayer and togetherness we can overcome evil. Now with this beautiful, ornate and powerful spectacle created by the great Cecil B. Demille, boasting a great cast such as Charleton Heston, Yul Brynner, Estelle Taylor and the GREAT Edward G. Robinson and many more, on DVD, in beautiful sound and color, it can be enjoyed for many years to come.

However, I highly recommend this DVD for its quality. I have owned three different VHS versions of this film and a laser disc edition. This DVD transfer is, by far, the best ever offered to the public. The image is sharp andwell defined and the sound is first rate. One minor flaw is that the \\"entr'act\\" music is not in stereo. When viewed on my computer screen, the image is the the widest I have ever seen of the VistaVision film offering the most complete frame image I have ever seen of this film on video.One final note, the commentary track by an author who wrote a most inadequate book on the making of The Ten Commandments, isfilled with errors, lacks commentary during scenes that cry out for it and contains comments unrelated to the scenes being shown.

Great picture quilty and no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ten Commandments (1956)","review":"Remaking a tale he had previously filmed in 1923, DeMille achieved a career high point with this humongous, star-studded epic--sadly to be his last production. Certain sequences--the parting of the Red Sea, the climb up Mt. Sinai to receive the stone tablets, the orgiastic worship of the golden calf--are some of the most indelible and majestic in film history. Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, and Yvonne De Carlo provide excellent support to Heston, who chews on the role of the hoary, self-righteous prophet, especially in his confrontation with Brynner's feckless Rameses. Only DeMille could make a Bible epic this visually robust and brashly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Classic","review":"If you don't have a copy for your family, get one.

It is superbly realised. the color and the imagery is unbelievable, what what Cecil B say? I dont think he had any idea he made a movie that looked as good as this. The only problem of course is the blue back screen projection scenes which look truly awful and this is, of course, the big thing blu ray shows up--dated special effects. Strangely the big epic scenes such as the parting of the red sea , despite the rather obvious way they part the red sea, is still awe inspiring, but when Charlton and his mates stand in front of deserts and obelisks it is clearly poor blue screen. Regardless, its an amazing transfer, wonder where all that fake jewellery and necklaces that come up so impeccably, is today??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Edition DVD A Bit Disappointing","review":"This movie looks and sounds great on DVD but the extras were not enough for me. I particularly wanted to know more information on how the parting of the Red Sea was done, and I know from an American Cinematographer article from many years ago that plenty of source pictures of the process are out there.Commentary was very interesting, but jarring in places where Ms. Orrison mispronounces words. She is obviously a big fan of the movie, and I now understand Mr. DeMille's philosophy in the making of the movie. I agree with her statement of how frightening the Yochabel/Stone Block scene is to children. I was 5 years old when I saw this movie in 1956, and that scene really scared me.I thought it strange that the intermission music is in mono on this DVD, but is in stereo on the laserdisc version. Also, much is made of the fact the Elmer Bernstein replaced Victor Young as the composer, but no mention is made that the Overture music is composed by Mr. Young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging???","review":"I am writing this review prior to viewing the blu-ray version of The Ten Commandments. I truely believe the movie on blu-ray will be spectacular. However, the cute packaging of the Limited Edition sucks. Please don't waste your money on this edition. Mine arrived today. The cute stone tablets that hold the disks is very cheap! In fact mine was damaged to the point that it did not hold the discs in place and they were scratched during shipment. Had to return the set. I wish when the studios released these Limited editions they would take into consideration that the blu-rays/DVDs will be opened and played. Thus designing the packaging for use. The pakaging is great if you are just going to sit there an stare at it and never open it. Thus the 2 star rating for the \\"Limited Edition\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"love story instead of Bible","review":"I was very disappointed that so much of the movie consisted more of love stories than what was going on with the Bible story.

The acting is wooden. The characters are cardboard. The story moves at brontosaurus speed. The dialog gives the word trite a bad name. No, I love this film because it's a perfect, and I mean perfect, example of how Hollywood chooses to sell real-life. If biblical history actually occurred just the way this film portrays it, then God did all the hard work for him, and Moses was about as effective a leader and visionary as Yogi Bear. But that's not the point, is it? This film accomplishes completely and precisely what it wants to do. It gives us a bright, shiny object to play with for a few hours. Engaging, yes. Enlightening, no. If that's what you are looking for, you can do no better than this film. And if you want to know the real Moses. Well, there's a good reason he was God's buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"On The Ten Commandments","review":"If there was a God, he would have struck down Cecil B.

It's \\"big\\" movie - a breed of epic that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. The sets, costumes, swelling music, acting are all deliciously hammy, over-the-top, and wonderful. It's really, really FUN to watch. As a purist, I usually prefer to watch TTC in the traditional way - Easter or Palm Sunday, on TV, with the commercials and everything.

I like a bolder dark roast Sumatra and this filter - even with the bold setting on the Hamilton Beach Ensemble coffee maker - didn't allow the full flavor of the coffee to come thru. I had another similar filter whose bottom was a solid plastic.

I promise you will be mad when you get it cause you would think it would be custom made for the actual brewstation but is not.Oh, and the water filter has to be change every one to three months don't bother buying it just used your personal water filter for the water.

It has a half inch clearance around it when I put it in the coffee maker. I tried it and found coffee grounds in my coffee. My theory was the grounds would splash out around the edges and get into the coffee. Soo I put it in again and this time put a paper filter in first to catch anything that was coming through. Sure enough, the paper filter caught the grounds. I don't know how the manufacturer couldn't have known about this but...

The FBI agent (Rick Moranis) assigned to look after him is a systematic, recently dumped man named Barney. It isn't easy to break old habits, and so Vinni gets involved in any crime that he can, and always trying to talk his way out of persecution from the local D.A. (Joan Cussak). This is an incredibly funny movie that shows the difference between New Yorkers and the yuppies of Fryberg. This humor is characterized by a grocrey clerk saying \\"Have a nice day,\\" and Vinni returing with \\"F*** you.\\" The humor is smart and quick, all topped off by great acting from Martin, Moranis, and Cussak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"My Blue Heaven is a classic.

For example, the author makes basic errors in his description of the GSM logical architecture (particularly with respect to the network databases) and he does not describe the current HR and EFR GSM voice codecs; the section on IS-95 CDMA does not describe soft handoff or cell identification in detail and has not been updated to describe IS-95A. His derivation of Erlang B is also missing a number of key steps. These factors make this textbook unrecommendable for my students. A THOROUGH revision is in order for the next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty light","review":"If I had not seen the Gorden Stuber book I would have given this book only 1 star. However in comparison, it does deserve at least 2.This book has all the stuff you would want in a wireless text book. It covers fading, Rayleigh, Rician, GSM, AMPS etc. My major complaint with the book is THERE ARE NO EXAMPLES. Per chapter there are probably 3 or 4 examples, but none of them are really challenging.For instance in the fading chapter, the examples are on coherence time only. How about a couple examples that actually use the fading PDF's/CDF's. We spend so much time \\"discussing\\" the distributions, maybe it is time we actually use the distributions?Compared to \\"Principles of Mobile Communication\\" the book is marginally better. For one it is not as heavy on the math, and it does a better job explaining pretty well everything.However..

Also, the maps are not accurate. My husband and I spent lots of time searching for items listed and could never find them. After the first day, we carried another map with us and consulted it instead of the maps in the book. Also, be careful with the maps printed in the book, as most of them are not pointing north. We got turned around in many of the walking tours by accidentally turning the wrong way because of the map's orientation. Also, we tried to eat at a couple of the restaurants listed in the book. One was no where to be found, not even the street listed, and two more that we had hoped to eat at were supposed to be open and were not. We will NEVER buy another Frommer's guidebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, not helpful","review":"I purchased this book because it had lots of maps and suggested itineraries. With only a short stay in Rome planned, it seemed like an excellent guide. However, we found the book very unhelpful. First, it is already outdated. I believe it is from 2009. Some things were closed, prices were off, and some tips were inaccurate. For example, it suggests you leave the sistine chapel through the door on the right to go straight to St. Peters, however that entryway is now only accessible to tour groups. The other main complaint is that the book is extremely repetitive rather than going into depth. There are so many itineraries and some are practically the same (ex: Baroque walk and Piazza Navona walk are practically the same) A few more sentences on each site would have been a much more useful way to stretch out the book - the descriptions were way too abbreviated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Take Along Book","review":"The book was in excellent condition.This is a perfect book to take on your journey.Not bulky but packed with all the necessary details you need.Condensed fold out layout of the city and major attractions.Extensive more detailed folfing map tucked in its own holderin the back.

The Strong Willed Child, Nurture by Nature, 123 Magic, the list goes on. None of them were very helpful. I halfheartedly started reading this book and was blown away by the first couple chapters. The description of the \\"baby self\\" explained SO much and made me feel like maybe I wasn't failing as a parent after all. It just makes so much sense. We've only been using the method for about a week but so far it's like magic. My kids, who are incredibly stubborn and persistant, really do stop their behavior when we don't \\"feed\\" the baby self, and they are much more content. My daughter was actually running around the house yelling \\"I'm happy! I'm happy!\\" yesterday. I am thrilled to have found the book, but sad that I didn't find it a few years ago.

It made a lot of difference in my approach to parenting and gave me understanding on what was going on with my son. It takes a lot of work and effort to stop old parenting styles, including punishments, threats and manipulating with rewards; at the end it really pays off. It has been 5 years since I found this book and we follow its advice, it made a lot of difference, my son used to go to his room slam the door and shut down; he would be upset and crying. He has not done that since we started a different parenting approach, including dialog and setting up expectations. My son is 12 now and he is a great kid.

Bill Kennedy did an excellent job of producing this CD. The jacket states that 'John Berry's soaring tenor, nearly operatic in its power and timbre, flat-out knocks listeners to their knees. As a result, Berry can claim a string of hits that include huge ballads and sly toe-tappers.'SO TRUE and I can't add any more accolades to this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Queen's best","review":"Queen has so many memorable songs that this is a must to have for anyone who likes one or more of their songs.

On CD 2, I love all of the songs. I play it all the way through without skippin' anything.CD 3, on the other hand...It's supposed to be a CD of remixes done by various artists. Well, most of them, in my opinion, are not worth the effort, and you aren't likely to find them entertaining if you're not a diehard Queen fan. If you aren't, you would probably be better off buying Greatest Hits 1 and 2 separately.

Those songs are what made Queen famous, rather than afterthoughts like \\"Body Language\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" (included here).It is ridiculous that so many key tracks are omitted on a 3-CD set. None of the songs here are bad (Queen's worst is 10 times better than most bands' best), but these aren't the songs that gave Queen such a following.

However, events move far too quickly for an extended pity party and soon he's right back in the thick of the action with his Assassin's Guild bodyguards.Cajeiri is moving from brat-hood to an interesting character who actually contributes to the storyline a bit more and the Dowager continues to delight yet again.Very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherryn At Her Best","review":"I have been a C.

It was truly a page turner, and hard to put down. Ms. Cherryh keeps things moving quickly right to the last page. I agree with one reviewer who said it would be a hard place to start as it is a continuation of the Foreigner series. I can certainly recommend that one enjoy the entire series from the beginning. It would be a worthwhile effort. I am one who enjoys extended series such as this, and am already looking forward to the third book in this third sequence. I hope she moves on to a fourth sequence as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...","review":"Bren finds himself in the midst of a civil war. Under threat in the mansion of aging Lord Tatseigi, Bren and his security are forced to flee across country to the capital where Aiji Tabini (the deposed ruler) will attempt to regain his power. Will their attempt succeed or will Bren and his friends become the latest victims of evil Lord Murini and the assasin's guild?I enjoyed this installment in Cherryh's renowned Foreigner series. Bren was endearing as usual, and I enjoyed the heir apparent Cajeiri. I did feel that there wasn't really enough going on in this book to justify a 5 star rating... They pretty much spent most of their time travelling. As usual, Cherryh pulls even this off with flair. I have nothing really to criticize. It was good... Just not totally awesome.I also think this cover makes Bren look terrible and Jago look like she has no chin.Overall, a solid, but not spectacular read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I have read all 13 Foreigner books and have the 14th on pre-order - all in hardback. I like them that well. The story pace varies greatly. Extended periiods of character buildup and story background followed by action which proceeds at breakneck speed. I really enjoy CJ Cherryh's plots and writing style and have read all of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well paced and detailed.","review":"This book had more action in comparison to Destroyer and also covered quite a lot of material leading up to Bren's presentation with Cajieri's assistance at the Bu'javid, including assassination attempts, etc.Tabini's felicitous arsenal of 9 wine bottles-cum-petrol bombs didn't seem like much of a force to be reckoned with, aside from their symbolic and provocative value. Then again, Atevi wine bottles would be larger than Human wine bottles :-)There were a few technological and cultural development oddities, but it would be getting too picky to be reasonable, I think. More reasonable would have been for Destroyer and Pretender to have been consolidated into one 400 page publication, with Deliverer as the second and another for the third, which would have simply ended some place else further on.Readers of Pretender might find 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T.E. Lawrence' interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I liked this story. Just like the other if you like Doctor Who you will like this one.

Typical of producer Hinchcliffes work.","review":"The Doctor and Sarah land on a planet plagued by an anti-matter monster who has caused a number of deaths amongst a crew mining for anti-matter. This is probably one of the better serials of Tom Baker's era as The Doctor. The CSO effects are good and the story is a good reworking of the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story. The interplay between the Doctor and Sarah is fantastic and the guest cast put in some credible performances. Overall, one of the most horryfying and gripping stories of Phillip Hinchcliffe's era as producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Who does a horror version of Forbidden Planet","review":"In this extremely well directed story with Hammer-like flourishes, The Doctor (Tom Baker) explores a lush alien jungle on a planet at the edge of the known universe. There, Professor Sorenson (Frederick Jaeger), engaged in experiments to harness the power of anti-matter, has unleashed a terrible anti-matter beast that threatens the men onboard the ship sent to rescue him. The alien planet is extremely well designed, and the scenes involving the anti-matter monster leave the viewer with a genuine sense of dread. There are also some very nicely directed sequences involving The Doctor falling into the anti-matter pit. As the anti-matter monster divides itself and attacks from all sides, the claustrophobia and tension increases, making one frequently look behind oneself. In an midst of a very well done Forbidden Planet remake, we have a terrific and genuinely frightening story with nice special effects for the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallace Stainless steel flatware service for 12","review":"This product was given as a high school graduation gift.

This is a fun and unique recording. Compared to Paul's boring piano recitals that he calls albums, it sounds like Pink Floyd at their height. And in reference to the idiot that blasts Mars. Bob Stinson and Chris Mars had tremendous influence on the early Mats. The last two crappy albums were Paul's babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mars' talent < talent in Westerberg's fingernail","review":"Where to begin with the douchebag review below. First, the \\"pop-star wannabe lead singer\\" was also the songwriter and reason the Replacements existed, moron. The Replacements weren't a great band because of their friggin' drummer. Paul Westerberg's last few solo albums have been rough home recordings in his basement, hardly a \\"pop-star wannabe\\" approach; they're uneven albums, but they've got a few gems.

I do not think it is the best of all of her 31 , but certainly ranks very very high. Tanya is executive producer and co wrote \\"Should'a Thought About That\\"and it showcases her saucy attitude. The first single is \\"A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be\\" and it is great. My other favorite is \\"Old Weakness\\"- its just FUN! There are some real tearjerkers as well. Tanya has outdid herself this time and it would behoove any music fan, not just the diehards to buy this album. There is no one better than Tanya doing ballads, rock, or traditional country, with more soul than she gives all her songs. She is AWESOME and so is this album. Thank you Miss T. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, the best Tanya so far!","review":"Anyone who is in a heartbreaking relationship will love this cd. You can feel Tanya's pain as she sings about the love, the loss and the hope. You know your not alone and life will go on and somehow it brings you comfort. She really puts herself out on a limb exposing her feelings through her music. It's a shame she didn't get more exposure for this one. In my opinion it is a true representation that she is like fine wine. Only improving with time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Tanya's best!","review":"This cd was worth the wait. However, I don't want to go another five years without Tanya on the radio! This cd is incredible from start to finish. \\"Old Weakness Coming On Strong\\" is a mixture of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. She rips in to Old Weakness and makes it one of the strongest songs on the cd. \\"A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be\\" is an upbeat song that reminds me of Tanya songs from her early days. On \\"We Had It All\\" and \\"Oh What A Love\\" Tanya brings to life the anguish the writers were trying to convey to the listener. By far, the best song on the cd is \\"Borrowed Wings.\\" This song is truly a Tanya masterpiece and destined to become a classic. Tanya feels her music and you can feel the pain in her voice. \\"Shoulda Thought About That\\" is a lover scorned song and Tanya does those songs best. \\"I still Hear Your Voice\\" is a fun song you won't be able to quit humming. This is an outstanding cd by a country music icon. I can't wait to see what the next cd holds for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to agree","review":"I've been a fan of Tanya since she (and I were 16 years old). I have always marveled at how every song that she has ever sang comes with such gusto and meaning.This New CD proves that she is one of the most consistent artist of our times. The collection of songs on this CD are primarily focusing on the Ups and Downs of LOVE, an area Tanya easily shows in her voice as heartfelt as anyone can do. I cannot honestly say that I have a favorite song. They are all superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album","review":"This is Tanya's first album since 1997's COMPLICATED, this is definately one of her stronger sets and definately a return to form. She covers two Patty Loveless songs (from Patty's WHEN FALLEN ANGELS FLY album), \\"Over My Shoulder\\" and \\"Old Weakness (Coming On Strong)\\", she definately does them justice and gives them her own flavor. The album's first single is the uptempo \\"A Memory Like I'm Gonna Be\\", definately a highlight. One of the set's best track is the uptempo country song \\"I Can Live Without You (But Not Very Long)\\", check that one out for sure. She shines on ballads, which have always been her forte, on songs like \\"I Still Hear Your Love\\", and \\"We Had It All\\". This is also on Tanya's own label called Tuckertime Records. Overall a solid collection, good for old fans or new of Tucker. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF THE BEST!!!!!!","review":"This is my favorite movie in the world!!!

Harrison Ford and Sean Connery delivered remarkable performances ,as expected from two actors known throughout the world. The special effects were spectacular and there is never a dull moment, so don't even think of leaving your living room chair to get a beer during this film because you might miss an important moment.

Which is a nice little twist in this movie, It's done in the style of the first movie. And it works, Indy racing the Nazis for the grail. Who will get there first, but once they get there, there are a series of tests that Indy must go through. A highly entertaining story, plus Indy finally gets the respect of his dad at the end.

It's funny to see how Henry reacts to the idea of people trying to kill them, and how Indiana just explains how that is always happening to him. I like the references to the Bible and the Holy Grail, because it is really cool to go on a quest for something mythical.

I was advised by Rode that I could modify the mount by cutting a hole in the bottom (this thing is just made of thick plastic) to pass the cable through, but that in no way makes it useful anyway as the mic is not held in place in the mount.

It's an awesome movie, I highly recommend it. I agree with the person who said it's better than American Wedding. It really is. The scene where Stiflers brother and Elyse first kiss was sooo amazing. I also loved the actor who played Stifler's brother. He even looks like him and has that Stifmeister attitude down pat. I hope they make another movie someday based on his character and Elyse with a bigger budget because I bet it would be even better than this one. Plus the Sherminator and Jim's dad make appearances and were great. And wtf is up with people reviewing this without even watching it first? Watch it and buy it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie for Middle Schoolers","review":"If you are between the ages of 12 and 16,lack intelligence and laugh at the most pathetic of things then this is just the flick for you.

When it comes to straight to video releases I don't have very high expectations, but much to my suprise, I enjoyed the fourth movie of the American Pie series. The only cast members left from the original movies are Sherman, and Jim's dad.In American Pie presents Bandcamp. Matt Stiffler is sentenced to a summer of bandcamp, after he gets caught pulling a prank during on the band during graduation. Hearing of all the sexual escapes of band camp, Matt orders a bunch of video gear, to make Bandies Gone Wild. After awhile he begins to bond with the band geeks. Eventually learning, that if he continues to act like his older brother Steve no one will like him. So, Matt begins to change his ways and becomes friends with the bandies in the end.Fans of the previous American Pie films will enjoy this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really a Sequel","review":"This realy isnt a sequel to the first 3 it doesnt have anyone from the original execpt Jims Dad. How could they have Jims Dad without Jim? American Wedding was a good ending to the series and if they wanted to make another one they should have made American Reunion with everyone not this. This movie also copies almost the same idea of the 2nd one. im going to rent it and if its good ill get it just to own the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb, overdone, unoriginal","review":"They just try to hard, the whole story with Stifler's brother being and acting exactly like original Stifler is just dumb, save yourself some money and time and don't bother watching this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessus Chriist","review":"Come on.

Every generation is supossed to advance. Life doesn't go backwards. The kids today are so deviod of anything to shock them into adulthood. Even a war that they might have to join in with sooner than they'd like hasn't made them aware that there are things in life that need to be serious about , DEAD SERIOUS!Maybe a draft activation will shock these kids into growing up. The movie is made for 16-20 year olds with 10-13 year old mentality. My father used to say\\"..it's nice to be a kid. When you're a kid you've got a clear head\\"I guess they may as well injoy this mindless nonsense as long as they can.

Maybe it is meant for young kids that don't care about stupid acts. It is nothing like the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There is not much to say about this movie. It wasn't the worst movie in the world, yet as a fan of the other American Pie movies, I was disappointed. My main problem with it was that it lacked substance, as another reviewer mentioned. I found the ending to be a little forced, and as for the humor, I can only remember one time that I actually laughed out loud--and even that time it was more like a small chuckle. I also found myself checking the clock quite frequently towards the end.I am guessing that, in general, this movie will probably be most revered by the younger crowd (mid-to-late teens) as anyone looking for mature comedy or depth (or anyone who has seen a fair share of great movies) will not be impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, funny movie","review":"I really don't understand why this movie got such harsh reviews... I honestly thought it was the best american pie!!! It's so hilarious and Stiffy junior is amazing, maybe even better than the infamous Stiffler!!

But don't worry its not worth the wait. I has maybe 2 American Pie standard funny parts, the rest is really average. The guy that plays Stifflers brother is quite good, maybe a bit to good, instead of playing his brother he comes across as trying to act EXACTLY like Stiffler. Theres also a lot of near nudity parts, this usually doesn't bother me but its really obvious they used bad editing to basically cut everthing, which as you isn't like and American Pie movie. Rent if you must, but don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good teen movie","review":"This was a lot better than American Wedding! It was entertaining for the most part, and brings back a few original characters. I did find that they used a stand-in actor for Stiffler's older brother, which was really stupid considering how funny the original was. Either way, it was a good movie, and i don't regret buying it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Hoping For Something A Little Better Than This","review":"Straight to DVD usually doesn't mean anything good, and this film followed that trend. I was extremely pleased with the trilogy, loved every movie, own them all and have watched them many times. This movie just goes too far. With hardly any of the original cast, and a cheesy Stifler takeoff with a horrible ending, this film definently leaves its viewers hoping for something more. As most of the American Pie films have been heavily laced with sex and crude jokes, getting former playmates to star in this movie has just made it a movie that young teens can giggle at the chests of the counslers. Many things such as ordering tons of cameras with a credit card with no trouble at all just make this movie cheesy and unrealisitic. Coming from a HUGELY disappointed American Pie fan, I say stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"American Pie was awesome. AP2 was pretty good. AP3 was not very good and this is plainly abysmal. Beyond the fact that almost nobody from the first three is in this, it just doesn't have any humor in it.The entire thing centers around Stiffler's younger brother, who captures a lot of Stiffler's original character but lacks any of the comedic value. The result is that you've got a movie where you see this guy's backside three times within the first thirty minutes.I watched this with my brother and we both quit at the half way mark because the most the movie had mustered was a simple chuckle at one point.It's just a bad movie and if you don't believe me, ask yourself why it went straight to DVD.I actually feel sorry for anybody who likes this movie. If you gave it five stars, shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Tasteless!","review":"My husband rented this expecting something similar to it's predecessors. He didn't realize that \\"straight to video\\" means \\"THis movie stinks! Don't bother! You'd be better off watching the original movie if you like that type of comedy.Band Camp completely insults it. I saw only one original AP star, Eugene Levy who plays a Quasi-counselor to the rude and annoying characters.I watched half of it asking myself, \\"Was I supposed to laugh at that?\\" and rolling my eyes at how truly moronic it was. Finally I realized I'd have a better time sleeping so I stopped watching altogether.I think it has no true humor and is distasteful. If you can base a movie as good by the amount of nudity and really stupid humor this is right up your alley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter garbage","review":"This movie is about as funny as a toothache. They shouldn't have bothered to send it straight to video. They could have saved us all a lot of time, money and aggrivation by sending it straight to the landfill where it belongs.

I kept pulling for Jami to find a way out, for Judy to gain justice, and for Steve to spend the rest of his life locked in a cell. The book just rings so true.

Usually I devour her stories in 2 to 3 days, but I put this one aside for a week, and when I resumed reading I had to force myself to plough through it. Some of the cases described within are no more dramatic than a Saturday night drunken brawl in a sleazy bar. Where is her usual saga of suspense, intrigue, and pathos, all of which are noteably absent here? Accused by some of writing repetitively, this book is the opposite - veering away from the descriptive details contained in her other excellent works, details which are engrossing and interesting and suscitate the eternal \\"Why\\" queries that accompany the pondering of criminal behaviour.

Well I should say that at her best Ann Rule does a brilliant job of analyzing criminals, victims, crimes and the US justice system. She has the knack of drilling down into minute detail without being boring. However with 'Empty Promises...' the author doesn't go into any detail and, worse, the stories she relates are your basic slasher crimes; we've seen them all before (and were grossed out).At the very least Ann Rule still writes in a very readable, personable sort of way. So the book is a painless waste of time. If Ms. Rule reads this review can I ask her, as a loyal fan, to dispense with these half-hearted stories (as an attempt to cash in on her name?) and give us more classics like 'If You Really Loved Me' or 'Dead By Sunset'.Bottom line: Ann Rule on a very off day. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Promises is an appropriate title for this book.","review":"What you see is what you get and I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one.

Yes, there are plenty of \\"tips and tricks\\" here, as you would expect from the title, but there's a lot more than that. This is a perfect \\"next step\\" book if you're an intermediate user of SQL looking to develop some real expertise and stand out from your peers.One one level, this book made me more confident and skilled at Transact-SQL, but it also made me feel like I was beginning to approach SQL as a programmer, not simply as a guy who had memorized a bunch of syntax and keywords. And while the info here is specific to Transact-SQL, the thinking skills will carry over to any platform you work on.As a final note, the chapter on NULLs is worth the entire price of the book all by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't appeal to me - I wish I hadn't bought it!","review":"I can't understand why this book has been so highly rated. I bought it on the basis of the other reviews. I have found it lacking in all the areas I have needed to look up. I have found one or two useful things as well; but it seems to lack some basic (and I don't mean beginner) coverage. For example INSERTs are covered; yet there isn't any coverage about how to return an id from the INSERT. I believe the book could be improved just by addressing some of the questions being asked on SQL/VB sites. I also did not like the layout of the book. I have used SQL since the early days (1983)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Transact-SQL tour de force!","review":"Henderson has hit one over the fence with this one.

Usually, when someone at Microsoft recommends a non-Microsoft Press book on one of there products I listen, especially when that someone is also a friend. Second, let me say that this book blew me away. The cover of Transact-SQL internals is the best I've ever seen. I'm a certified old timer in the world of SQL Server, but this book told me things I didn't know. The undocumented T-SQL chapter alone is loaded with stuff I didn't know and will certainly use. Also, the Statistics chapter and the one on Sets and so forth is rife with solutions to hard problems that I've not seen before.

I didn't find the author's technical explanations of his own examples, brillant though they may be, very indepth or complete, even. There seemed to be an excessive amount of multi-page \\"code listings\\", which become difficult to follow after a while. Mr. Henderson seems to be styling his writing after his long-winded friend, Joe Celko. Perhaps the holy grail which I seek, in the name of \\"T-SQL for T-SQL dummies, but for otherwise database and programming Smarties\\", shall remain interminably elusive.I also bought Mr. H's Guru's guide to SQL Stored Procs, which on the face of it seems to be more promising.

There is not much I can add to all the other reviews: it is an outstanding book, and I am sure I will reach for it again and again when the real-life problems come up. I have less than 1 year SQL Server experience, so it was somewhat hard for me to read, but hey, this is called learning process (as the title implies, read something more introductory if you are a complete newbie). The only downside is that author allowed his political inclinations to show up in a couple of places in the book, hence 4 stars. Other than that, do yourself a favor and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for developers","review":"Book is obviously written by an expert developer just for developers. You learn tsql just like you would any other language. The author takes you inside it and teaches you everything you need to know to build high performance, scalable sql server applications.

I never cease to find some new nuggest when I research a solution to my latest SQL SERVER challenge.I also like the non-technical writing in each book.

I'm shipping mine back and buying the O'Reilly book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Transact SQL Books ever","review":"This is one of the best Transact SQL books out in the market. I am on the first chapter and Mr. Henderson is already talking about topics that other books have in Chapter 21 or not at all. For e.g., He writes why a where clause in a join may give incorrect resultset if you use the old join syntax. On the other hand this should not be the first book for a SQL newbie. S/he will probably not be able to follow. I mean if you don't know what a join is you would not gain from reading about the nuances. The author points out in the preface that it was his goal to not use filler material and he has succeded in that. This book has a very high density of good information and requires and repays careful rereading. I would highly recommend this book. It will also help to have Chris Date's Guide to SQL Standard handy to complement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners, but a darn fine book nonetheless","review":"Though this book is way too advanced for the average beginner, if you have a bit of Transact-sql under your belt, the Guru's Guide is your fastest ticket to becoming an expert. The book assumes you've read through the Books Online, so if you haven't, you'll definitely want to before diving in.Once you have a basic foundation on which to build and extend your knowledge, you'll find a treasure trove of useful info and expert advice in this book. The chapters on Cursors, Statistical Functions, Fulltext Searching, and OLE Automation are chalk-full of expert insights and are masterfully done, as is the rest of the book.As a whole, the book is among the best technical books I've ever read. I consult on SQL Server projects large and small here in the Bay area, and I often carry the book with me from client to client. I find myself reading and re-reading passages to really glean all that's there. I can recommend this book without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"Anyone who uses Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (or any of the related products) must have this book on the shelf. It is THE best-written and best-organized computer book I have come across. It picks up where the manual leaves off. Despite its name, this book is useful for someone who has just a little knowledge of T-SQL, as well as advanced users. Chapters 1 and 6 serve the beginner well. The information on performace tuning is great for the more experienced user. Even DBA's will find useful information. I don't know what I would do without this book. It showed me some of the techniques that I use regularly, such as the CASE statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers everything","review":"There's no stone left unturned here. There's so much code here that I still haven't read through all of it. The commentary is right on - not too thick, not to light.

It's one of my favorite programming books ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Brilliant","review":"I do not normally give five star reviews. For one thing, most books, regardless of genre, don't deserve them. For another, computer books are especially prone to being thrown together, barely publishable hacks. Not this one, though. It's easily the best database book I've ever read and one of the best computer books I've ever seen. It it a compendium of tips, insights, and deep technical knowledge that only an expert would have. Get your copy and get it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The programming book I have ever read","review":"Not only is this the best Transact SQL book around, it is also the best programming book of any kind that I have ever read. It doesn't waste your time with stuff you can find elsewhere. It gives you the things only a guru would know. My favorite parts are:1. Cursors chapter - worth the price alone2. Undocumented chapter - lots of hidden power3. Statistics chapter - already using some of these examples in my work4. Performance chapter - also worth the price by itselfI have all the other Transact SQL books and none of them compare. This is the best programming book around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great advanced T-SQL book","review":"I have read all the other T-SQL books and this one is by far the best of them.It is the only truly advanced book on T-SQL that I've seen (I have the O'Reilly and Apress books - this one is much better). What I like the most is the way the author goes to such pains to explain everything in detail. He has obviously been in the trenches a time or two. Add to this 600+ code samples and you have an expert-level book that every T-SQL programmer should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Ken Henderson","review":"I have two other books by Ken Henderson: one on JavaScript and one on C++. This is another fine book in the Henderson tradition. It is exceedingly well-written and engaging. Also, it is loaded with examples, as are all of Henderson's books. There's over 600 in this one, which is, I think, the most I've ever seen in one book. And every example is used to illustrate some larger point -- this is not just a boring solutions cookbook. The sections on transactions and cursors are particularly good, as is the OLE automation chapter, and the statistics chapters.

However, I would have expected any book on Transact-SQL to cover more than just the latest SQL Server incarnations. Sybase invented Transact-SQL, but there is no mention of Sybase to be found anywhere in the book.I picked up this book based on recommendations on Amazon as an alternative to the O'Reilly book (which doesn't get very good reviews for the most part). However, we use Sybase and this book is utterly useless for anything other than recent versions of SQL Server.Why couldn't the author have taken the time to actually cover the different major recent incarnations of Transact-SQL listing the differences?

Looked very promising and I was really looking forward to working through it using the code in the book and on the enclosed CD. However, there is no cross-reference in the book to which files go with which code samples, resulting in a lot of hunting around to find the right files. And then, quite a few of the code samples simply won't run. Even with the corrections referred to in the Errata section on his website, I got many more errors than I can fix. Between trying to find the correct sql files from the cd, and trying to fix the errors, I've pretty much abandoned the book altogether. Not much use trying to learn from bad code. Wouldn't spend the money on this one, if I had to do it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tight treatise on a wonderful language","review":"I learned about things from this book that I could do with Transact-Sql that I never dreamed of before I read it. The SELECT chapter is worth the price of the book alone. So many great examples and great code. This chapter alone gave me a whole new perspective on Transact-Sql.I also loved the full text search chapter. This part of Sql Server has always been a bit of a mystery to me. Now I understand it well enough to use proficiently.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Administrative Transact-Sql chapter.

This is the best T-SQL book bar none.","review":"I've been working with SS for about five years and have been looking for a consumate guide to the language for some time. I wanted something that went beyond the books online and that covered the current release of the product. Henderson's book was just what I wanted. It's a godsend. Just by reading it, I've seen my T-SQL skills improve dramatically. I feel like I'm getting near being an expert. I had no idea you could do so many things with standard T-SQL. I guess it's just a matter of knowing what you're doing, and this book helps you get there faster than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advise, samples lacking","review":"I found the advise and guidance this book offers to be top-notch. Anyone and everyone developing for SQL Server should read this book. My only gripe is that the examples aren't as practical and applicable as I'd hoped. The author over uses temporary tables in sample code, and doesn't give good examples of how cursors could be used for complex calculations that aren't easily expressed with the Select statement. I think this is because he is so adiment about not using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best there is","review":"I recently bought this book and one titled Advanced Transact-SQL by Itzik Ben Gan. This is by far the better of the two. Compared to this book, Advanced Transact-SQL is a beginner's book. This book leaves out the BOL repeats and the strangely formatted code that takes up half a page and gets down to business quickly. The writing is crisp, witty, and will keep you engaged -- not an easy task for a book like this. I've read some good technical books in my time, but this is by far the best, SQL or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed with the book. In initially KH has a go at books that fill their pages with screen shots. However half the book is filled with ugly Courier code slabs of not only repetitive code but also repetitive result sets. Notwithstanding that some of the code is useful to browse, it is usually pretty ordinary to someone like me who has been writing T-SQL for 10 years. Also some of it is just showmanship as KH often admits that there are better and more efficient ways of getting the required result (either with code or tools). I ended up reading the book in a few hours and then putting it on the shelf where it will probably now collect dust which is unfortunate after laying out US$50 after postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sql book","review":"i liked this book for its simple way of explaining t-sql. and there are many examples too. but i wish they could come up with 2005 and 2008 version too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to bypass certain limitations of MS-SQL 2000","review":"I certainly like the way its written.

Absolutely loaded. Take the statistics stuff, for example. No where else will you find so many useful functions (medians, anyone? runs and regions?) and so much code you can just drop into place and use. The OLE Automation chapter is similarly chalk full of original and useful code. All throughout the book you find reams and reams of fresh, astonishingly powerful code. The book says there are 600+ examples and I don't doubt it. It's worth twice the price for the code alone.

It contains more tracks and has a slightly different mix. None of the extra tracks are throwaway and some are arguably better than the songs on the original 'Driving to Damascus'. Is it their best album? I think it has more depth with the lyrics than anything Stuart Adamson has done, and he was always a great lyricist (these things being relative). If you don't yet have 'Driving to Damascus', buy this version instead. If you already have DTD, consider getting this one for the extra songs and the slightly different mix courtesy of Tony Butler, the band's bassist. It all works for me. Great melodic guitar rock, some of it very hard-driving while some of it very soft. Great, great lyrics.

Of course, it focuses primarily on the Metropolitan Opera and in particular the the Saturday afternoon broadcasts (I'm listening to a delectable 'Don Giovanni' as I write this--'La ci darem la mano').And for people who are new to the world of opera it is easily the best periodical for easing them into this admittedly difficult (at first) art form.

A complaint might be(and this is really trivial) that effects from TMP were used in this one(drydock sequences,models reused), but why carp?(read my review on Trek V-believe me effects are not that important, I merely point this out because I am seeing all angles).This film, like Trek IV, is a lot of fun.There are moments that take you back to the series(just Ricardo Montalban coming back as Khan is enough!)such as the exchanges between Bones and Spock.James Horner's score is exciting(a better musical score than Goldsmith's TMP).All-in-all a fast-paced exciting entry in the series, but sequel is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Trek","review":"Undoubtably the best Trek movie, The Wrath of Khan delivers not only the action and comedy that non-Trekkies require, but the thoughtful, mind-bending questions that true Trekkies relish... and, in the grand tradition of the very best of science fiction, the question of 'are we trying to play God?' is not given a definitive answer in the picture. It's left up to us to answer that question ourselves.

Watch the VHS release (the one in the box set, where you could see the Enterprise if you lined all 6 tapes up) if you don't believe me. The picture is much smoother and finished looking. The additional scenes were nice though, but I've noticed they changed the timing and pace sometimes. Overall, the VHS beats the widescreen DVD.The movie itself is the best in the entire series and should be included in film courses at college so it remains part of our collective heritage.So go...and see if you can track down an older copy.

After watching this new version against previous releases, I'm somewhat disappointed. The sound quality is excellent, you can again hear the people speaking in Engineering during the first attack. But that's overshadowed by the over-use of the blue color-tint: everything seems to have been made more blue. Check out the white pieces of the uniforms, they look blue. The ship looks more blue. The biggest impact was on Regulus - the brown moon is now blue. I checked this against multiple TVs and DVD players, and got the same result.

But ST2, ah ST2, that had Ricardo Mantalban giving William Shatner's scene chewing a run for it's money.In fact, Shatner is relatively subdued for the better part of the movie. His Captain Kirk is feeling his age and faced with an estranged son that would prefer to remain estranged. Lost love and missed opportunities, and a tight reign from director Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, ST6), help keep Shatner in check.Also marks the screen debut of Kirstie Alley as Lt.

Ricardo Montalban replaces the frightening believability of his Khan in the Space Seed TV episode, all restrained intellectual and physical energy, with hammy, scenery chewing bravado. Instead of the majestic and ambitious 2001-esque Star Trek: The Motion Picture, with it's so Roddenberry-esque tale of different life forms communicating, understanding and actually combining, we have big spaceships firing laser weapons at each other and plenty of boring running, jumping and falling down - if TMP had the ambition to take Kubrick as it's model, WOK settled for the considerably inferior Lucas. Even the - admittedly VERY moving - Spock death scene means absolutely nothing, because he's back in the next one.If you prefer George Lucas to Stanley Kubrick, you'll love it.Mind you, compared to the horror that was JJ Abrams' movie, it's a masterpiece.

No other movie has ever duplicated the issues of growing old, dealing with death and life...it will be on American Movie Classics if it's not already. I don't think that any other film came so close to being perfect as this one. Don't rent this one if you already have it on VHS or DVD....buy it now!

I would of liked to see more extra features. With the Popularity of Star Trek you would think Paramount would have something extra to add."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIRK VS. KHAN","review":"The first of the MANY sequels that followed. When executive producer Harve Bennett was asked to helm this film, he HAD NEVER HEARD of 'STAR TREK'. In order to get the feel of it he sat down one day, and pre-viewed ALL THE EPISODES of the original tv series. He decided that this film will serve, not only as a sequel to the first film, but also as a continuation of the 27th 'STAR TREK' episode from season 1, 'SPACE SEED'. Ricardo Montalbon is once again excellent in his portrayal of 'KHAN NOONIAN - SIHGN' Once again I rate this film with 5 STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic.","review":"This is the only star Trek movie or episode you need to see.

So cut one already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A crackerjack \\"Star Trek\\" adventure!","review":"This is perhaps the best \\"Star Trek\\" movie, with a terrific plot, exciting battles and a heart-tugging ending. To top it off it features Ricardo Montalaban's reprise of one of Trek's grandest villian of all, the ruthless and terrifying Khan, as well as the appearance of Kirk's former flame and their grown-up son.

It was a perfect place to pick up and continue a story line. After all, Kirk has more enemies than all the tribbles in the galaxy. There is plenty of action alongside comedy relief. And yes, the uniforms are much better in this film than in TMP!Even if you've never watched an episode of Star Trek you will be able to follow the story well. This is a must have for Star Trek fans of all ages. Montalban gives an excellent performance even though quite a few years have gone by since he orignated his role and he's obviously kept himself in good shape despite his chronic back problems.The acting is much better here than TMP. Everyone actually looks as if they are glad to be on the set. And why shouldn't they be? One little t.v. show has brought them more dough than they ever thought they'd see.You'll enjoy this one.

VI is a finely done ending, but these three \\"treks\\" support each other. Since the day of Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", there hasn't been a classic, simple, and enganging story of revenge and hatred. Nick Meyer's directorial takeover from Robert Wise (ST:TMP), was a good choice since Meyer likes to lay back on his classic-story roots. He portrays the characters, for the first time, as human...not forever youthful heroes. The Kirk-Khan rivalry take the vengeance scenario to new heights as past and present come together. ST II is about the acceptance of loss, the past that comes full circle, and the bystanding people who get caught in the middle. The Wrath of Khan remains, by far, the best in the series...and a chilling awakening of a realistic storyline. It may be sci-fi, but you can be assured the tale hits home..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trek","review":"With the possible exception of First Contact this is easilly the best Star Trek film in my opinion. The extras here are interesting but the films the thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Star Trek","review":"This is, I think, the best of the Star Trek movies made, mainly because we get to see Kirk at his best. And I think it's one of the few times we get to see him rage on and against someone. We see him as a more human character, trying to set a good example for this younger set of cadets coming up as well as dealing with the fact he is getting older. We see his resentment at being no more than a desk jockey and wanting to relive his \\"glory days\\". He becomes (again)the Kirk we always loved and maybe disliked a little because we didn't always like his methods. And we get to see him get his heart ripped out and lose his right hand man.None of the other movies capture the emotion, the frenetic pace, of the feel of the original series.

The video transfer is excellent.One of the best Star Trek movies.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the director's cut!","review":"This is not and does not offer the much better director's cut version! The director's cut version is freely available on DVD, but not on Blu-Ray. Other Blu-Ray discs such as \\"Donnie Darko\\" offer the theatrical and director's cut in the same package, and there's no reason Paramount couldn't do the same thing here.Hopefully, Paramount will eventually release the director's cut on Blu-Ray. But by not releasing it now, that means you have to buy it twice, once now to enjoy it in HD and the second time to enjoy it the way the director meant it to be. That could've been easily avoided, but instead Paramount wants to milk us, or something.I'm not buying it. Hold out for the Director's Cut, which is a more complete film and more deserving of the Blu-Ray treatment, especially in light of Nicholas Meyer's new book about the making of the film. For now you might be better off buying that book, \\"A View From The Bridge\\", and holding onto your DVD until Paramount makes this right."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Watched Star Trek Movie","review":"Arguably the best this franchise has to offer. It is classic confilct with great characters. Richardo Montelbann is Magnificent as Khan. He's easily the 'single' greatest star trek villan in franchise history. An evolution beyond most of the one dimensional villans, he adds a sophistication to the plot that most ST films don't touch. What's more the main cast is together and in classic form. No hamming it up in this one. And who could forget the end: Spock's apparent ultimate sacrifice.......truely touching! A strong four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek II","review":"Many regard this as the best film in the Star Trek series, and it's easy to see why. It has action, it has drama, it has all the stuff that made the original Star Trek series a household name, and had people all across America holding their hands in the Vulcan salutation.Wrath of Khan is certainly one of the better entries in the film series. It is vastly superior to the first film, and stands above the two follow up films (although Star Trek IV is not a terrible film). This, along with the Undiscovered Country, is certainly one of my favorites.Watch it yourselves and you'll understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"khan!","review":"In the wake of Robert Wise's \\"director's edition\\" of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, it was only a matter of time before Nicholas Meyer's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN was awarded the same treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fergit the rest, try the best","review":"All the other Star Trek films (including the recent reboot) are thin soup compared to this film.

It certainly is the most exciting. It is great to watch William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban try to over-act each other while quoting Moby Dick. The scenes of The Enterprise duking it out with The Reliant have never been topped. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 Stars is that this DVD--although it looks and sounds great--doesn't have any extras on it. Perhaps they are holding that version off for a few years. It seems a common tactic so if you are holding out for \\"The Wrath of Kahn--The Ultimate Version\\", hold onto your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Makes Movie New Again","review":"I finally got this movie on DVD and it was terrific! It was like watching it new again! The scene's where Kirk and Khan duke it out in the nebula are awesome, special effects that still look great today. This is a must for any Sci-Fi or Trek fan. The movie offers more than great space battles, the character introspection is great, the tension is real, and (not to ruin the ending) it's a helluva thing when Spock dies. I know there are complaints that Paramount doesn't offer much in terms of special features, but DVD's were created for movies like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can boldly go into any good DVD collection.......","review":"This new release of the succesful edtion of the Star Trek movie franchise is truly the best of the bunch. From the Shatner/Montalban war on who can chew up more scenery with their acting to the special effects by ILM, this is a definite must see for even non-fans of the series. Any complaints at all would only be for the sound quality which is a little below par for a DVD edition and the lack of extra materials. This edtion only contains a trailer and the standard scene selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best of the six","review":"This is easily the best of the six ST movies, with only ST VI coming close to it.Excellent action and dialogue with some humorous moments mixed in. Ricardo Montalban reprises his role of Khan Noonian Singh from the episode \\"Space Seed\\" and does a very good job. (Interestingly, in this movie, Khan's full name is never mentioned. One can only assume that even back in 1982, political correctness dictated that the film's producers not give an evil villain such a clearly ethnic human name as \\"Singh\\" for fear of reprisal in the form of some protest by members of that ethnic group.)Certainly, viewers who are familiar with \\"Space Seed\\" will more readily understand this movie, but the movie itself does very well as a stand-alone piece as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep that expensive MacBook Pro pristine!","review":"I keep my MacBook Pro in the sleeve, which I then carry in my North Face Borealis back pack (which I also recommend).

To find what she needs, she must gain the wolf clan's acceptance, and Rule Turner is the key to doing that. Though it goes against police ethics regarding conflict of interest, Lily and Rule's relationship moves from business to beyond pleasure, making the case personal and doubly dangerous.**** Suspense and passion will keep you flipping pages rapidly until the end comes too soon. Readers will be glad to know this is only the first in a series focusing on Lily and Rule. Ms Wilks has crafted a new world of urban fantasy that will appeal to Laurrell K Hamilton and Melanie Jackson fans. Combining Indian and Oriental culture with her own version of the werewolves has resulted in a series that has depth from the get go. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I gave it a try!","review":"I thought it was a great story with very interesting characters. Lily is an Asian-American Detective and Rule is the \\"Prince\\" of the local werewolf tribe.

Rule and Lily are actually \\"Chosen.\\" Apparently this is something that rarely happens in the werewolf community, where the \\"Lady\\" herself chooses mates for each other.The story is a sweet romance with lots of action to boot. My only complant was that I found a few slow parts that were difficult to follow what they were talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of Lily and Rule","review":"This is the start of Lily and Rule and I loved it. I think Wilks' worldbuilding and Lupi culture is unique and fresh and fascinating.Lily is a homicide cop, a woman and she's got a secret - she's a sensitive. Rule Turner is a skirt chasing werewolf prince. When they meet it's instant attraction but I loved that Wilks makes us wait for the eventual consummation and didn't have Lily just accept her chosen status immediately.The mystery, which unfolds further through the next two books, is intriguing and well done as is the action and the chemistry is incredible.I love it when fated mate stories are handled right, Wilks has done that and leaves me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I have never cared much for novels that involve \\"alternate realities\\". By alternate reality, I mean that the book involves the paranormal/supernatural in everyday life. The characters are fully aware that creatures such as werewolves and magic exist; the world in the novel now excepts such oddities as being normal. However, once I began to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It drew me into a fantasy world, which the author has flawlessly created. The novel is filled with suspense and romance. I can not wait until the sequel.I won't explain the plot of the novel, since others on here have. But, if you enjoy suspense, romance (especially the concept of \\"soulmates\\"), and the supernatural, then this book is for you. I promise that you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much new, but well put together","review":"It must be hard to come up with new slants on the urban fantasy genre and werewolves in particular. This book did not add anything new that I could see, but it was well written and edited.My main criticisim was the mystical bond that was shared between the heroine and Rule Turner, the werewolf. This type of \\"cheat\\" saves an author from having to write about the characters in such a way that one can see why they are attracted to each other and how that might turn to love. Just having them virtually touch to then be bonded by the \\"lady\\" saves a lot of effort, but also detracts from the romance.Generally, however, an easy read and I will get around to the second in the series in due course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Light Read","review":"The title of the review says it all. It took me almost two months to get through the book but that's the fault of my busy life, and nothing to do with the book!Ms. Wilks brings an interesting and exciting cast of characters to life in the first of this psychic/werewolf series. Lily Yu is exciting, fun, and most importantly she's real and endearing. Both strengths and flaws were exploited as the novel progressed, and I loved the fact that I couldn't guess if Cullen was a good guy or turned to the darkside until the very end.I've already downloaded the second novel of the series to my kindle.

END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Trek","review":"That the series took a comedic turn with Star Trek IV is well known, though the 80s-style humor seems a bit forced and dated now (punk rocker, Russians, etc.). Nimoy's second turn at directing is more imaginative than his first Trek, even if this one suffers occasionally from stock characters and a case of the \\"cutes.\\" Star Trek IV delivers on most fronts--good dialogue, decent special effects, competent acting. The plot is recycled sci-fi: Kirk and crew timewarp to save Earth from a menace that's never quite explained or explored. Along the way, they deliver a heavy-handed message about ecology and have some misadventures. Leonard Rosenman's asymetric score will make you pine for Goldsmith and Horner, and Catherine Hicks is at times grating and juvenile, but there's some genuine warmth here. Widescreen also makes this look like a movie, rather than a big TV show. Basically completes a story that took three films and five years to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spock Swims with the Whales","review":"Haven't seen this in many years--I'm introducing Star Trek to my next generation--my kids. And this was the biggest hit of all. My 7 and 5 year old thought it just wonderful and told me to give it \\"all the stars.\\" I couldn't agree more--the story was solid and the CHARACTERS came through loud and clear. The humor was great--worked within character and developed them in sly ways.

The next generation is safe--new Star Trek fans are born."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Admiral! There be whales here!\\"","review":"ST IV is a Star Trek story in the classic tradition. Earth, and therefore the Federation, are in dire peril, only the Enterprise crew can save the day (and this time, it's not because they're the only ship in the quadrant; actually, because they're the only ship that wasn't in the area and didn't get itself whacked!), and we have a nice social commentary thrown in for good measure (as a result of the high profile of ST IV, especially internationally, whale hunting has finally been revealed as the butchery that it is, and whaling as an industry is finally on its way out).The story is well-paced, characterizations are letter perfect, and there's just enough special effects to get the point across, but the story doesn't depend on them. As Star Trek, it's a resounding success.

Otherwise a great movie that even the kids can enjoy. I never realized how much better the scene (where she picks up Kirk & Spock in her truck) is when you can actually see all 3 characters at the same time in widescreen.
