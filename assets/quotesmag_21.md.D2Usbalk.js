This movie could've benefitted from an extra 10-15 minutes of story and 5 minutes less of transition imagery. All-in-all a solid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Savages","review":"The previews to the movie were better than the actual movie. I'm not really for sure if the movie directors are running out of ideas or if all the good actors are old n dead.

Stupid movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on many levels...","review":"Nothing in this movie works...the sexual aspects are really awful not in so much the acts, but rather their total lack of relevance to the film. Surprisingly the action is almost non-existent in this film.

Bad writing, acting, directing. The 3 protagonists were not qualified to star in anything other than porn. I read the book and enjoyed it and thought Oliver Stone would do a good job adapting it to screen. Boy was I wrong. Total garbage. I would recommend this for either people who have no taste or for those who want to have a mystery science theater sort of joke fest. My gf and I did the latter, which was the only way to make this movie tolerable.

Two best friends, who's relationship is easily questionable, combine science with the best marijuana in the world. The women they share is kidnapped and they use wit and skill to save her. Blake Lively's acting is weak.

It also had a less than predictable ending which is always nice. I'm not a fan of Travolta or Del Toro, fortunately they played bastards so it was appropriate to hate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Excellent movie with lots of main actors.

All three big actors had great roles. I would recommend this one if you want something fun and intense. The ending will throw you off. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this movie would be thrilling and exciting. But in the end, I was really just disappointed that I had wasted the 2 1/2 hours watching it. The 3some love triangle was weird and even some of the violence was unnecessary.

This movie delivered on every level for me. Hot, sexy and raw with more than a little action. Well acted, well shot and well put together.This is long movie, but its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savages don't make deals!","review":"I liked this movie as I thought it was a good combination of the plot and action with a good storyline. We watched the unrated version and it is violent and macabre with sexual situations in the story. The movie is about a hostile takeover of a California pot producer and distributor by a Mexican drug cartel.I won't ruin the movie or the plot for you but I found the movie interesting and it was better than average. It is worth renting it if you like this type of movie and I thought the acting was good and the storyline was intriguing and interesting to follow. I don't think most people would watch this movie more than once so renting it is probably the best deal.It has a lot of action scenes and sexual innuendos in the movie and the interaction with the three main characters is like a three way love triangle between beautiful savages. I rate this film a 4 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible.","review":"Do not waste your time unless your worship director Oliver Stone. I was really disappointed. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olive Stone at His Best","review":"Savages is a brutally entertaining story about a drug cartel from Mexico imposing its will on independent pot produces in California. The acting is great and the scenes of violence and brutality are horrifically portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After his hugely enjoyable \\"Natural Born Killers\\" I was looking forward to Oliver Stone's \\"Savages\\". It is dreadful. The script seems to have been written by one of the less intelligent Mills & Boone authors. John Travolta did his best, as did Salma Hayek, to make something of this pathetic script but you can't polish a t*rd! As for the lead parts, they were unbelievable and the actors were totally unconvincing. There is a reference to \\"Butch Cassidy ...\\" but that was then and does not justify this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I really don't know what has happened to Oliver Stone.

One of the worst films I have seen in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Savages","review":"Everyone(with the exception of Taylor Kitsch) performed as if they were in a parody of a crime movie.I can take that if everyone is in on the joke, but it appears that Oliver Stone wasn't.Ridiculous script filled with ripped off moments from other films. The voice-over narration especially was an almost exact copy in tone and content of the narration of the much better True Romance.I hope to never see another Blake Lively acting attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"a baggie full of ditch weed","review":"it looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing but kind burned your throat and didn't provide a good buzz.B Del Toro was outstanding and is always worth a watch.

Incredibly self-important, bad cinematography, convoluted plot. The whole movie just seemed to exist to give Selma Hayek a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"senseless movie. Easily the worst movie that Oliver Stone has done. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, not sure what else to say (and I'm a fan of his previous works)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The movie's premise is sound and topical enough with the current cartel violence in Mexico spilling over into the US. Plot details are available in the other reviews, so I'll share general thoughts. About half way through I kept watching because I was invested, but had pretty much lost interest. All the performances were good, but the poor writing and length of the movie began to make the whole thing redundant. Opening a film with a character saying \\"I may or may not be dead\\" indicates a weakness in the writing since you see things in the movies and shouldn't need a character telling you what to think. The ending(s) were a poor attempt to tie up all the threads, and having two once more shows poor writing, masquerading here as \\"cleverness.\\" If you liked \\"Traffic,\\" a far better movie, you'll find this interesting but won't want to see it again and probably won't think about it after you pop the disc from the player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth viewing","review":"It's not just an action flick, but has some depth to the relationships and explores our preconceived notions. Worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worste movie of 2012","review":"Terrible movie. I wish I could get those two hours of my life back. It's a sad day when you see a good collection of actors partake in film so horribly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action and great acting","review":"Big stars, lots of action and a great script. This is an awesome action/suspense thriller. The actors were great especially my boy Benicio del Toro! And Selma even with that wig you are still as hot as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This movie really proves that Stone, needs to choose his projects a little better, this movie felt like it was dragged out and the ending was just confusing and stupid, it felt like the filmmakers just said hey let's throw some action in here that's very convoluted and ciched, and then let's confuse the shit out of the viewers.Oh and then there's certain actors in here who for better or worse ham it up big time eg. Del Toro and Travolta.A cheap rental movie at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really bad","review":"Wow, what a horrible movie. It was like a 10 year old directed it: lots of cliches and weak acting. Benecio Del Toro was the only redeeming factor. Oliver Stone has truly lost his sh*t"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspenseful Movie","review":"Enjoyed watching this from beginning to the end. Love their connection in the movie. The ending is a shocker! Great Movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Similarities to the movie Traffic but a lot more aggressive. Casting was very good and I liked the twists throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Stone has gone to seed","review":"It seems that not even Oliver Stone cares about Oliver Stone movies anymore, as he has done his best to make a Guy Ritchie film, here set in SoCal instead of Soho. But other than that, it all feels very familiar. Stories like this have been done before and done better. The film making isn't bad and there are memorable scenes, but everything about \\"Savages\\" is sort of \\"eh,\\" at times compelling (usually the violence) but often laughably dumb. And the attempt at a Postmodern ending is just lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mortgage payment","review":"Every once in a while I believe that an actor takes on a poor script because they (like all of us) have debts. This seemed to be that kind of a movie. Make a crappy movie, collect your check, pay your mortgage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"Good movie. Decent story. Pretty good action. Not sure if two guys could really share a girl like that without there being some issues. But it did make for a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"This movie was just to gory for me.

Pretty people in the movie though, until there eyeballs are hanging out of there eye sockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great diversion on a four-hour bus ride","review":"I enjoyed this movie for its excitement and an introduction to a lifestyle very foreign to most of us. It's not what I'd call a \\"serious\\" film, but it's very skillfully made entertainment for those seeking action, violence, and a taste of the drug culture. It's the first movie I've seen with alternate endings, which I understand is now in vogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with a great cast","review":"Of course Oliver Stone pulls out all the stops and this wild and deadly story is made credible with a great cast and narration by Blake Lively.

Too much Granola Hippie like feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I like the idea of this movie. Entrepreneurial young bucks in a twisted relationship with a stupid girl. One guys doing his civic duties with ill-gotten gains and the other just wants more. I actually like Benicio in this movie. Travolta is wasted. Blake Lively offers nothing but something for the boys to fight over. I can't even stand the sound of her voice narrating the film. Salma Hayek looks weak as a female kingpin. I don't like the way her character is written. It offers no real twist in her development.I'm glad I saw it but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really less than 2 stars but.............","review":"Selma was the only reason I give it 2 stars. There are Countless reasons why this movie sucks and with the caliber of stars in this epic piece of junk I would have the blame the editor. Can't fathom that any of the actors would cosign on this garbage. I lost 2 hours of my life that I can never get back, I just kept watching hoping it would get better but it did not, kinda like Catwoman. Can someone please tell Blake to take the cotton balls out of her mouth, I could barely understand what she was saying in the movie just as on Gossip Girl. The trailer looked awesome, so thankful I didn't waste $ and go to the movies for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept WAITING","review":"I kept waiting for this movie to take off!!.

I'm not into drugs and do not like movies that put any 'glory' into it--ie good pay, good lifestype (quite frankly IMO if you are involved with illegal drugs in any way,shape or form they should line you up and put a bullet in your skull and that would quickly decrease the blight that it brings to our country and people). The story lines intertwined well. John T always surprises me when he plays a shady character. I would probably rent this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Great actors but everything else about it was straight up terrible ugh, I would of done anything to just club the main characters to death.

Echoing other reviews I agree that the acting was terrible, the plot was inherently unbelievable and the ending was an embarrassment to film. Blake Lively was especially bad and her character was so two dimensional I couldn't stop laughing at it. I haven't read the book so at first I thought Stone was trying to channel some tarantino and just failed miserably, but after reading other reviews it seems he just botched the translation from book to movie.Basically I just want to say DO NOT PAY FOR THIS SHIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savages","review":"I liked the plot and the possible ending the movie could have taken.

The plot is terrible, the acting is uneven, and I do not understand what is likeable about any of the characters, nor what motivates them. The actor who plays Chon looks like he is on release from a soap opera contract and John Travolta just makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Blake Lively is so vacant that her doe eyed stares only carry her poor acting ability for the first five minutes of the film. This was a poor attempt at pulp fiction for the big screen and would have been in better hands with Quentin Tarantino than Oliver Stone given the campy subject matter.The book was better; any book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I don't mind mindless violence, but the whole thing was mindless. Too much of everything. Nobody worth rooting for. The guys were cute, but worthless. The girl cute, but worthless. I stopped it several times to do other things. And all you could say for it is that it showed what the Mexican Cartles are doing now as we speak. Savage animals who do anything for money. To be specific, it's about two guys who grow exceptional pot and share the same girlfriend. The Mexican cartels want to learn how to grow the exceptional pot and kidnap the girl friend. The rest is disjointed crap about getting her back. Two scenes were good. That was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the trailer-see it all","review":"This is 1 of those movies where the trailer shows all the good stuff. The ending is simply retarded. Sorry to use such a crude description but both my son and I looked at each other in dismay as the ending finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 minutes of VO equals bad story and script.","review":"Oliver Stone is a relic. One could not imagine such a poor script in an Oliver Stone film during his prime. Indeed, 10 minutes of VO in the beginning of the film means both Stone and the script writers were too lazy to care about crafting their story. So why should we care enough to spend time to watch it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"This movie was way too twisted for my taste. I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one. This movie wasn't plausible in my mind. I'm sure there are people who disagree with me and may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iraq meets the Mexican cartel","review":"Great acting and interplay. Interesting and edgy story line. Salma Hayek was wasted, she's too cute to be an evil drug boss. The v/o narrative, didn't help the story, particularly by the protagonist who was the cause of much of the strife, which she never acknowledges. The plot started strong but dissolved at the end, although the alternative ending created some intrigue. Good entertainment. Good acting, visuals. I like that Olivier Stone is staying with his themes of war and the effects it has on civilian life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Stupid Characters","review":"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the print was beautiful. The beach scenes show up so clear on my LED TV it was almost 3D.Salma Hayek's character seemed to be based off of the woman in the documentary \\"Cocaine Cowboys\\" and that woman was like a black widow spider and a shark rolled up in one deadly package.The characters in the movie were SAVAGES and they would have killed the threesome the moment Ben and Chon rejected their offer and attempted to run.Benicio Del Toro's performance was excellent. In fact without him, Salma Hayek, John Travolta the movie would have been a total waste of time.Regardless of what happened to \\"O\\" how did that airhead become a ruthless killer when Ben tossed his cookies when they robbed the cartel?The movie would have made better sense if O was a wife or the cartel kidnapped a child but even the O admitted she was a slut.

For those looking for porn, they would have gotten a kick out of it. There was a typical storyline about drug deals gone bad. The savage acts weren't so surprising or menacing as they may have intended them to be. Salma Hayek over-acted in some parts. The end message was that small time drug dealers could get away with this kind of thing. Very disappointing movie with unnecessary sex scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding coupling.","review":"Getting this coupllng in such performances makes this an outstanding buy. For those who love Oistrakh and Shostakovich, this is a wonderful addition to a collection. The recording is live, intense and in very good monaural sound; when recorded (1956) the concerto was almost new! The Khachaturian bounces perfectly and carries the imprint of the composer's authority.Sitkovestsky's sound, not heard very often, is a true discovery and shows his marvellous Ukranian pedigree (what did they put in the milk from Kiev!? Notes?)Having the very musical Sitkovestky family behind production proceedings, makes this a true labor of love.

If you are even considering getting one of these dogs this book is the place to start.

If you're looking to elarn the histroy of the X-Men or are new to the series and can'ty afford spending the money to buy all the old issues, this is the place to start.

And with those changes there must be a new force to spearhead the change. This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track \\"If I Could\\", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender \\"Heaven Only Knows\\" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful \\"Beyond Life\\" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], \\"Dreaming in Colors\\", and the African chant-anthem \\"Uneasy Street\\". Then for an upbeat flavor is the celtic-fueled \\"One Voice\\", and the seductive stirrings of \\"When She Comes\\". This is an absolute must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Channeling Peter Gabriel","review":"This is the atmospheric, electronica-tinged record the former Genesis lead singer would be making right now if he hadn't bothered to drop off the face of the earth.

Why? Why debase a classic when Mr. Henriksen could be to TV soundscapes what Danny Elfman is to movie soundtracks.Can he do it live?

You need to be able actually get out there and find these positions and books simply can't do that for you.

Or better yet, use some sort of portal service (there's a few out there, but in my experience the best is HelpdeskCrossing [[..] because of the sheer quantity of jobs they post, and the obvious focus on this field).All that said, once again, this book is great for what it is and I'm happy I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful and life-changing","review":"I couldn't believe how beautifully written this book is.

II found this bookso lacking that I read less than three chapters.The title implies that Italian Lifestyle is the topic. The author uses thisonly as a take-off runway for her advice about managing relationshipswith others.Rarely does a book disappoint me so much. Almost also there are at leastnuggets on insightful information on a topic. I am sorry that I am leavingsuch a negative review, but feel compelled to do so given that the titleis so misleading.

Raeleen gives us a prescription for embracing the things that truly matter--all wrapped up in what the Italians call \\"La Dolce Vita.\\" This book really resonates with me, and I'll tell you why: My mother and her family immigrated to the US in the 1950s, not to run away from their values, customs, and traditions, but to more fully embrace them here in the US...They did.

The author has pieced together quotes and statistics from other sources and throws them around liberally. It has the feel of a high school writing project. The advice she gives reads like something out of an article in \\"Seventeen Magazine\\". For example, here are some of her tips for cultivating friends, Italian style:1)Spend the time it takes to cultivate new friends.2)Go beyond the superficial to create intimacy.3)Practice giving and receiving affection.4)Be willing to listen.5)Show loyalty in your words and actions.I bet you never would have thought of those things on your own, right?Well, pay the $15.00 for this book and you can read 205 more pages full of equally valuable \\"Italian\\" advice.Buy it for a teen, or better yet, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for hip hop fans","review":"Almost every song on both cds is bangin.

This is fresh and innovative music and for that, I give it a 5 stars. My problem is, (1) Andre 3000's portion I think is a bit stronger (I'm more partial to singing than rap though I think Big Boi does do a good job) and (2), thought this is edited, I think that this work could've have stood alone without the bad language and sexual themes that had to be edited out. Still with the edited edition, you can see where on BOTH albums Andre 3000 and Big Boi were going with the lyrics. I can see why this album won 6 grammys. It is great! 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Ya - OutKast prepares for world domination","review":"I heard Hey Ya while flipping around the radio in my car, and I HAD to find out what that incredible song was!

There isn't even enough good music to fill one disc. It's sad when you have 40-something tracks and only a handful of worthy material. Let's use Janet Jackson as an example here. Her single disc Rhythm Nation album spawned like 5 or 6 huge hits. Outkast on the other hand won't do that with a double disc album. There is something wrong with that. I'm not saying that these artist are in any way simular. I'm just comparing hits on a single disc album vs. a double disc one.

It is a real shame too, because he's one of the most talented MC's ever and his album is just plain bad. if you want to check out Outkast, get ATLiens, it's from a time when they were hungry and flowed from a love for hip hop.

Hey Ya and the song about Valentine's Day and the other singles with their videos are a complete joke and totally stupid. It's a shame how foolish they had to be musically and visually to be accepted by mainstream. And now America thinks they are new artists or possibly one hit wonders when they've been doing their thing for almost 10 years now and had amazing songs back in the day. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is by far Outkast's most disappointing album. The fact that they have two seperate discs for each artist was a mistake because their combined talent and unique personalities is what makes them so good in the first place. Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is very sub-par, his rhymes are mediocre and the constant interludes with his kid talking are annoying. Andre 3000's side has two good songs, \\"Spread\\" and \\"Hey Ya\\" but his love songs get repetitive after awhile and are not nearly as good as his rhymes. For those of you who are just getting into Outkast, I recommend skipping this one and picking up Aquemini or ATLiens, far better examples of their talent. I hope the next album they get back together and stick to what they do best because, simply put, an Outkast divided does not stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Year 6000","review":"Once Again Outkast has pushed the limmits of sainity to the brink and have come back with remarkable results...This foreword for all casual Outkast fans...\\"you will not like this album, if you expect them to simply recycle what has worked for them in the past.\\" Hands down Outkast is the best hip hop group of all time, the only group to contiunally get better, expand creatively and be accecpted at the same time. Love/Speaker is better and their creativity has definatly expanded, but this album may be be accepted. ThiS album is A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN A WORLD FILLED WITH MUNDANE PROFIT FOCUSED MUSIC. IF THEY WIN ANOTHER GRAMMY (AS OF NOW...IT SHOULD, THE ONLY ALBUM THAT COMES CLOSE BLACK EYED PEAS)...THEY WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST MUSICAL GROUPS OFF ALL TIME NEVER MIND JUST HIP HOP."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 Very good cd, 1 you could live without","review":"I pre-ordered my copy right after watching the music video's for \\"Hey Ya\\" and \\"The Way You Move\\". Im happy i bought the cd's but Speakerboxxx IMHO didnt have any songs that really caught my attention. The Love Below on the other hand i love, i think the beats are great the lyrics put a grin on my face even after hearing them a dozen times and most of the cd is solid.So overall i would say buy it, one cd will probaly be to your liking judging by the other reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is off tha meat rack!!!!!","review":"Yo, this/these CD(s) are off tha chain. I really enjoy listenin to both of 'em. I'm more of a R&B kind of girl so I really like The Love Below! That Speakerboxxx is great though. I love both of the CDs and I've always been a fan of OUTKAST. Their uniqueness has always attracted me to them. They have never let me down and I don't think they ever can. They bring it fresh and new and nobody can pull it off like they can. Do you see how Andre be dressin? Man that is some crazy stuff he be wearin and it's cool at the same time. I'm goin to start followin they words now. The lyrics to these songs are funny as h#ll. Go ahead and get the CDs and find out for yourself what these guys have grown to do. I doubt you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Hip_Hop","review":"What the Hell is this??? I mean Amazon put this crap in Hip-hop C.Ds and I tell you guys this is not Hip-hop.This sounds like the Beatles (Iven if I love the Beatles).Outkast must been drunk or really high when they did this record! I accept that hip-hop has to grow but not in this way! If you are a hip hop fan and that u are looking for a good C.D, don't buy this crap, don't buy this crap!!! I'm a nice guy so I put one star but only for the featurings with Killer Mick,Ludacris and Jay-z. This is not hip hop I'm telling U the truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outkast The Love Below","review":"The reason why I gave this 2 stars is soley because of 4 or 5 songs on Big Boi's disc. I've seen Outkast a number of times in concert and those were some of the best concerts I've been to. Just listening to 88 percent of this cd made me want to vomit. How does an artist completely change there genre succesfully? By going completely teeny bop. Every one of Andre's songs is without rap and there all about love crap. I've tried to listen to these songs multiple times as I never base my impression on just the first listen and I still hate this CD. This album is a perfect example of why people download music. I will now download the next 2 albums of Outkast to make up for about $20 I wasted on crap songs. By the way did anyone see Dre's acceptance speech when he won a grammy for Hey Ya? All he said unconfidentely was \\"thanks\\" Even he probably feels like he didn't deserve that grammy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too original for me","review":"I give Andre props for being original but Im just not feeling what he's become. Big boi's cd is the reason for the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God!!!!","review":"This is this biggest load of garbage that I have ever heard in my life. Both cd's are WACK!! If there was any doubt that Outkast was through, there isn't now. This has got to be one of the worst rap albums in history. Don't get me wrong, I love Outkast as much as anyone, but this album sucks. I have never heard an album so wierd in my life. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for putting out such crap. If this is the best they can do, good riddence to bad rubbish. Please don't ever put out another album this bad. It's even worse than Aquemini! Save your money and pass over this so-called album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not their best work...","review":"First of all, anyone spelling OutKast with a C shouldn't even be allowed to review this CD. Now that thats out of the way. I gave it a 4, but its more like a 3.5. This is probably my least favorite of OutKast's albums, but thats not saying anything bad. Since I would give their first 3 albums 5's and Stankonia a 4. After hearing Hey Ya, I knew that Andre's disk was going to be very strange. I am disappointed with the lack of rapping, but was impressed with the funky sound, which you expect from OutKast. I also expect this to be the only album they do that sounds like this. Andre just had to get this out of his system, that is why they did two separate disks, Big Boi probably didn't want to go the same direction as Andre. So I expect the next OutKast CD to be back in the Aquemini/ATLiens sound. As for Big Boi's CD, I'd give it a 4.5 by itself, its more in the mold of the typical OutKast sound. Just one complaint, there are way too many skits and interludes."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THA HELL!!!!!!!","review":"I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SOLD OVER 10 MILLION RECORDS ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUY THIS BECAUSE I WILL WANT MY MONEY BACK. IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD ENOUGH TO BURN IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs and the rest is no good.","review":"In this album, we have two sides of things. Speakerboxx and the Love Below. Speakerboxx is mostly rap based. Pure hardcore rap. The Love Below is hiphop with some more soul. The Love Below is better. All in all, you are only buying this for 2-4 songs, so you might as well download them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Could Ask For Anything more?","review":"With two disks in the set from this mega duo the solo albums are a welcomed change from a band break ups. who could break outkast up? NO ONE but themselves. the Big Boi Disc is the firm reminder that outkast are forever and the Andre 3000 disc is a full of intresting concepts and guideposts for the future of music. this disc is a cd changer filler that is nothing but killer. this is not an album to be attempted unless you know something or if you know nothing about music. i suguest you research outkast or take the crash course. this cd is both and neither at the same time. did i confuse you? good."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"What happens when you cross the musical styles of Prince, Cameo, and southern jazz musicians? The answer of course is Andre 3000. 'The Love Below' is a breath of fresh air in today's stale musical enviroment. At times the lyrics are simple (maybe even stupid), but just the fact that Dre is trying something new for all of us, we will give his lyrics a break. Big Boi's side of the album is not that impressive. Same ol' southern flow, there are a couple of good tracks here and there. Will this album break them up and send them in different directions ... we will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but good","review":"It's a lot different than I expected it to be, but OutKast switches their style every album, so I cant say I'm really surprised at how off the wall it was. It was well worth the purchase price though (I got it for 10.99 on release date). Also, I thought Roses was a little crazy, but still funny in its own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS TIMES 1,000","review":"I have been a fan of Outkast since SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADILLACMUSIC put the \\"dawty south\\" on the map. This double album takes me back to the smell of mary-jane in the dungeon. Andre3000 could easily take the place of the Neptunes as the greatest producer and Big Boi should start a school along with Mos Def teaching these 50 cent worth a busta's how to put substance in their lyrics. Other than that .. no words can describe how good this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMMMMM.......","review":"The Speakerboxxx album is a good album. His flow is incredible and the background music on his songs isnt too bad either. The Love Below is weird! BUT....not realy in a bad way. IT is just...strange and very experimental. Best song is \\"Hey Ya!\\" #9 on The Love Below. i say get this cd to hear something that is not done much in todays world of hip/hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn!!!!","review":"All I can say is Andre and Big Boi really did it this time. For people who thought that Stankonia was a little to the left.... that was nothing. This latest CD from outkast is a big move for hip hop. When every rapper is out getting 3 tracks from the neptunes, outkast produced many of their own beats and put out a unique album.So you're probably saying \\"why do I care how unique a cd is?\\" well you shouldn't care but the truth is the CD is just hot. The Big Boi disc brings the southernplayalistic style people are used to but the Andre side is really where you're gonna be if you want to hear something that's really different and ready to experience something new in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visionary","review":"This album is impressive to say the least. Outkast is by far the most creative hip hop group in the main stream and this album proves it. In a pop culture so intent on segmenting its music into clear genres, Outkast rebels in the most post-modern sense and insists in this album that our cultural conscience is and should be informed by a wide range of artistic influence. The album recognizes the intrinsic link between jazz and hip hop that evovled through the permutations of rock, funk, r&b, and now is moving into the realm of electronica. This ablum is a beautiful fusion that relishes in its musical history while not afraid to glance towards the future; at once cognitive of where it is, where it's going, and where it's been. If your not stuck in the stereotypes of what music should be, and you really want to know what makes the music tick, go for this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it--but it's not for everyone!","review":"This isn't commericial hip-hop--if Outkast didn't have a huge following this album would be a complete flop!One of the best albums in years; ingenious in its wanderings. At times it has hints of Frank Zappa, other times early Mr. Bungle--both rock groups! Perhaps the finest quality of this album lies in it's pure \\"musicalness\\". Outkast has transcended the rap genere, and I'm happy to follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes a lot for hip hop to get my attention","review":"Outkast... I would have to say they are one of the greatest hip hop groups ever since they can get away with making two discs each with a totally different style from the other and still remain awesome. Big Boi is one of the greatest rappers since he has very catchy songs with incredible lyrics and great beats, he is like the Metallica of hip hop today. Andre 3000 is so different yet he remains to have such great songs and even though some might be plain and simple, in their own way they are complex and thats what makes him so great. I have no clue what Dre's style is (it might be reggea), but whatever it is I like it. These guys deserve way more attention and publicity then they are getting, and yes people they are in every way much, much better than that wigger Eminem. Buy this album no matter what type of music you like, rap, rock, R&B, pop, even country (in which case you are retarded)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best this year.","review":"Who ever said Chingy's album was the best rap album of the year must have been crazy. I mean Chingy was fun and poppy but was not really a quality rap album. Now this is a quality rap album, well atleast Big Boi's is. Dre's album is a poppy jazz album and I also like it but Big Boi has the beter of the 2. The 2 hit singles Hey Ya! and the The Way You Move are very good and if Dre did all his songs like Hey Ya! it might have been one of the best albums of the year. Well anyways this is a very good album with almost all the tracks being decent and a few really good tracks. This is yet another Outkast album needed to be put in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about Speakerboxxx","review":"Everyone always talks about Andre and how Hey Ya is a great song. Well Speakerboxxx (Big Boi's disc) is one of if not the best rap album I've ever bought. Every song is great, with amazing beats and production. His collaboration with Jay-Z and Killa Mike, Flip-Flop, ventures into trip-hop territory and does it better than anyone else. Forget The Love Below its overrated and over-played. Speakerboxxx is worth the price alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.. at least to me","review":"I was very excited to get this cd and thought that 2 for 20 bucks was a great deal. Especially since it was outkast. Well, from now on i will be cautious of getting another outkast cd. The first album is just about complete crap and has just about no actual rap on it. The 2nd cd is a little bit better with actual rap but still is very disappointing. Like some of the other people who have reviewed this album have said... if you're getting this cd because youve heard songs like Hey Ya, The Way You Move, Church, or Roses, then you might want to hear some of the other songs first. I dont like how Andre has changed his style here and I really expected more from this cd. I know that they are trying to be different and everything, but if you're gonna do that at least have the same or better level of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlasting and Everchanging","review":"This album is very good. So many rap albums today are so alike; all the artists rap about is sex, drugs, guns, and da hood, but Outkast continues to reinvent themselves with every cd they release. They force you to listen to what they have to say instead of spewing on about a bunch of crap that's unoriganal and boring. Outkast is so unique and origanal and they make music what it's supposed to be...fun. There's a song for everyone on this album. The only problem I had with the cd is that Andre doesn't rap enough. He's proved he can flat out spit in songs like \\"A Day in the Life of Andre Bennjamin\\", but I wish he do more of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS C.D. IS JUST PLAIN BAD. THIS IS MY EXPLANATION.","review":"What is this stuff????? The only two credible songs out of both c.d.s are Hey Ya and I Like The Way You Move, which are the two you can hear on the radio every ten minutes. If those two songs are the only reason that you're getting the c.d., then it's not worth it at all.I Like The Way You Move and Hey Ya are no examples of the c.d. It sounds like two different duos, when you listen to some of the stuff on there.Please, do yourself a huge favor. If the reason you're getting the c.d. is I Like The Way You Move and Hey Ya, then just burn those two songs and get on with your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smart, very well-produced","review":"I'd heard great things about the CD but was not a big fan of the two big singles. After I heard the song ROSES, with its funky beats, I decided to buy it. Sorry I waited so long.It's simply brilliant.These two men have put together a crazy-good CD. There's industrial sounding rap (GHETTO MUSICK), Prince-influenced ballads (the delicious PROTOTYPE, a fast-paced yet mellow groove (A Life in the day of Benjamin Andre), infectious keyboards (UNHAPPY), and several funny skits.Genius together.AWESOME: They include the lyrics in the sleeve - how rare is that for rap!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"outkast","review":"this is one of the best 2 albums ihave ever heard.andre 3000 introduced me to music that i would have never payed attention to while big boi continues to do what he does best.the love below took me a few times to get it but after i got it i couldnt stop listening.speakerboxxx had me hooked as soon as i heard it. every track is perfection from ghettomusick to last call and love hater to a day in the life of benjamin andre outkast is the best duo in music and these 2 albums prove it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outkast SECOND BEST album!!!","review":"Next to ATLiens this is Outkast best album. All though it's nothing original as real WIDER music listener know, on the count that Dre has taken so much from Kool Keith and more of Prince it's too obvious, but still better than any other MAINSTREAM groups album to date.Andre really shines on this album. The Love Below is 10x better than Big Boi's Speakerboxxx. Andre produced 98% of the new sounds and stands alone without Big Boi on his side of the album. Where as Big Boi only put out a few beats of his own no where as creative as Andre's sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cut Above the Rest","review":"Outkast remains strides ahead of the rest of the hip hop community with the release of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. While many of todays rappers continue to focus on blatantly vulgar lyrics and recycled beats (save the Neptunes), Andre and Big Boi grow with every disc and this is their finest work yet. Andre singing is the greatest thing he could have ever done. It adds a whole new level of diversity to the cd. The beats are the best since The Chronic, and the collabos are sick. If you were shaking your head in bewilderment as to why Outkast temporarily split up, don't worry. It couldn't have worked out better. One of the best releases this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outcast slipped","review":"Outcast have released a lot of good albums in their reign but this one is horrible. 2 Cds and only 3 good songs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Fell Off....","review":"Let me say first that I love OutKast and I have loved everything they've put out up until this CD. The Love Below is nothing more than Andre 3000 attempting to sing and stay on beat...these songs would be great, but they are sooo slow and all about the same thing. I didn't like any songs on The Love Below. I liked 5 songs on Speakerboxxx (Bowtie, The Way You Move, The Rooster, Tomb of Boom, & Flip Flop Rock). Maybe it's just because this CD is so different from everything else they've done. Very creative...I'll give em that...very unique...and if I could i would take it back.

It's a travesty that lots of good music was overlooked and this was singled out as the best. \\"Hey Ya!\\" was great on the Grammy Awards show, but the cd containing the song is easily the most disappointing album I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"WHat a disappointment. These guys have officially fallen off. They don't sound anything close to good. I couldn't even listen to Andre's CD because it is sooooo wack, he has a song with Norah Jones!- WTF!. I think he is f***ed up in his head for good. I found a couple good songs on Big Boi's disc. But I think he's gonna leave his far out friend soon. I have every Outkast CD and liked all of them.

Plain and simple","review":"OUTKAST is the absolute worst rap group to date.... they suck so bad. If anyone could explain to me how they are classified as rap/hip hop it would be greatly appreciated.... They should be under the genre of either Funk or Childrens Music! This cd sucks just as much as their other ones.... actually it is probably their worst album to date. They have 3 songs that are good out of all their albums....

Avoid until Outkast start using some discernment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Classic Outkast","review":"If you thought this would be a classic Outkast CD like Southernplayalistic or Aquemini or ATLiens you are sadly mistaken. Speakerboxxx sounds like Outkast meets Techno and Love Below sounds like Outkast meets sappy love songs with no beat (aka Justin Timberlake). Anyways the basic jist is if you like old school Outkast you might like about 3 songs out of all of them... if you like new school rap meets a bunch of [junk] then you will like this cd. All I have to say is what happened to Outkast... they definately fell off... their last few cd's have just gotten worse and worse.

Do not waste your time buying this album. In plain english, it sucks!!!!! This album is a smack in the face of Outkast fans and such a major disappointment.

Run-DMC this is not, heck it isn't even Wu-Tang to be honest. Yes, as a middle-aged (there, I said it) woman, I am not part of the targeted demographic.

No, probably what their production execs fear them doing. They actually attempted something innovative and creative. This isn't cookie cutter rap, and yes it is different. It is wierd. It is funky. It is beautiful and it is art. This is a great example of why music is such a wonderful artform. The TRL teenieboppers that are just looking for a \\"tight beat\\" to \\"bump\\" in their cars may not be too impressed. However, if you are someone that can appreciate innovation and creativity, you will thoroughly enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I've been missing in music returns!!!!","review":"Many of us, who enjoy music, and miss the days when talent was the most important asset, instead of a hype machine for mediocre talent, will embrace the breath of fresh air that Outkast continues to provide the music industry. True Outkast fans never ever attempt to predict the vibe of an upcoming album. But no one would have ever come close to predicting the styles of Speakerboxx/The Love Down Below. Andre 3000, takes us back to the times of Parliament, Funkadelic, George Clinton, Prince, Ohio Players, and others. Big Boi provides us with solid hip hop music with an array of featured guest. This is an album to be embraced, and has set the pace for other to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Cadet Hip-Hop as Art or Commerce...?","review":"...who cares, when the flow is this effervescent and beautiful? Two divergent solo discs, each possessing each owns' singular funkdified delights, Andre without Big Boi, Big Boi without Andre, each threaded, this time, by a common moniker and sold as a double unit. Pretty astute business sense - released as separate entities, a sales impact as remarkable as this one proved would be hard to substantiate. So chalk one up for industry and let's dance along our jovial way. But don't negate \`art' either - this is a confection that revels in the whole of it's excessive parts, with nary a misstep along the way. Hyperbole aside, it's not a sonic landmark as \`Stankonia' proved to be - but it is rock and roll and funk and soul and r&b and hip-hop all juxtaposed for the beauty of the earth. My grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"might've given it 3.5 if i could've","review":"i didn't think it could be true, but it is: big boi's half is better than dre's. _speakerboxxx_ tops _the love below_. i thought with the sheer briliance of \\"hey ya!\\", dre's triumph would be effortless, but aside from two or three other standout tracks, _the love below_ seems too thin, too incomplete. in some ways, it is a more intriguing, more surprising listen, but _speakerboxxx_ is uncontainable. the unbridled power of hip-hop, the joy and rage of hip-hop: when it's done well and it's done right, it sounds like this. \\"the rooster\\" is right up there with \\"hey ya!\\" one of my favorite hip-hop albums, i'd say. but listen: the friggin' skits have GOT to go. so ridiculously annoying. there's only so many times i can stomach hearing a toddler say \\"muthaf*cka\\" or dre prissing on about \\"feeling fantastically well\\"...BLEH!! that's one habit hip-hop needs to break, and break in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is my favorite OutKast album. the best disc is Andre's \\"The Love Below\\" : I love the song \\"Pink & Blue.\\". Why? Because it samples Aaliyah's (RIP) \\"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number.\\" I love that he got approval to sample that song. This proves that Aaliyah's music still lives on even though she has passed. I have never heard an Aaliyah song sampled. Aaliyah was and always be my favorite R & B artist. The best track on this disc are : \\"Pink & Blue\\", \\"Hey Ya\\", and \\"Roses\\". This Disc Rating : 5 Stars. Big Boi's \\"Speakerbox\\" : Not as good as Andre's disc but still it is great. The best tracks are \\"The Way You Move\\", \\"Bust\\", and \\"Church\\". Rating for this disc : 4 1/4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time someone put out a good album!","review":"Simply put, this is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. I don't really buy CDs anymore, but got this one for Xmas, and I'd highly recommend it. It's everything current music needs more of: funky, smooth, ingratiatingly catchy with a beautiful groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an Outkast Fan, but I think I've entered Stankonia","review":"I'm not an outkast fan, I like some of their songs but not enough to buy an album. This new double disc entered me into the realm of Stankonia. I really didn't enjoy Big Boi's album it really didn't have a theme and all you heard where fast beats. Andre3000 needs to be slapped for his album it is so SICK!!! His concept of the Love Below is so Great. Some highlights are Prototype and Pink and Blue, Happy Valentine's Day and Hey Ya. Well that's it go and pick it up if you don't like both you are sure to like one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD('s) Can Buy.... Or Can It?","review":"... OutKast has gone to another level with this CD. That level, until this album, was unbeknownst to man... hence they had to create it with this masterpiece of music.Each song is like watching a flower bloom in fast-forward, while having electricity pulse through your body. Each song is a beautiful creation, that will never be sucessfully imitated or duplicated by anyone without falling miles short of OutKast's bar. As soon as the first song ends, and the new one comes on, it puts you in a wholly different world. You'll find yourself moving in sync with the beats and silently mouthing the lyrics as you become immeresed in the energy. This album is a total sensory joy-ride, and will make you feel music in a way you haven't ever felt before. You need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats right... they did it ONCE AGAIN","review":"Both cd's are tight work.. Personally i like andres side better, but big boi definetly held his own. It took me 2 listens to finally get big bois disc. This album is beyond amazing, another atl classic, many people will hate this disc, but it is by far...., well lets just say each LP stands on their own, and this one definetly does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love outta tha Boxxx","review":"Outkast has done it again. I've been listing to these 2 cd's since 9/23/03. These guys are the best. Every album they top themselves(there is no other artist out that can even compete). I at first was stuck on the Andre CD, but now I'm jammin' the Big Boi. Each album is played in full from start to finish.Once you hear one of the cd's you want to hear the other again and again. I don't know how they will top this one but I'm sure they will. I've said that about every CD they have ever put out.Man if you don't believe me go buy all of their other work and listen from the debut CD til the current CD and see that they get better with age, like fine wine.PEACE"},{"rating":"2","title":"what the hell","review":"Its a good cd but my cd flip flop rock is missing. it has hip hop rock and its 24 sec. long and its just some person talking. I GOT ROBBED!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"Im a really BIG Outkast fan and I really anticipated the release of this latest album and it was way overdue. Wow the minute I heard Andre 3000's CD I didn't even know what to think besides wow this is definately not the same outkast style as before; it is more of an jazz mixed with techno if I could some it all up. As for Big Boi's CD it was not bad it more like old outkast but it lacked impact as far lyrics are concerened but I have to say that big boi's disc earned the 2 star rating. I did like: the way you move, happy and knowing. I can't wait for Outkast to go back to their old style. Aquemini and ATLiens are definately outkast best (in my opinion). If new wave type style music is your taste this CD may be right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"what???????????","review":"ok i knew dre was switching his style but damn! althought he has the better songs of the double cd...big boi did not by any means put any effort into his portion of the music there were only a few songs i liked\\"prototype\\",\\"she lives in my lap\\"and \\"a day in the life of andre benjamin\\"are all the types of music i was expecting throughout the whole cd(s).i am a huge fan of oukast and think that dre is one of the best lyrisistin rap,but as much as it pains me to say this,....this is the worst outkast album they've ever put out...i went from highly excited to highly dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH WEIRD ALBUM","review":"sorry, but out of the, like, 50 (overkill, overkill), songs on the album, only 3 stand out. hey ya, the way u move, & roses. sorry, but stankonia was much betta"},{"rating":"1","title":"most OVERRATED group ever!!!","review":"Ok, I'll admit i've never been a fan of Outkast. But everyone started talking about how \\"original\\" and great this new cd was, so I decided to check it out. BIG mistake!! I was already sick of the first two singles by that point. And there is NOTHING else worthwhile to listen to on either disk!! Roses is one of the worst songs i've ever heard, and the video is very annoying. I gavce this 2 stars because, well, there ARE songs that aren't about being a \\"gansta\\" and getting it on with \\"ho's\\", so that's kind of original I guess. I just think the state of hip-hop and r&b is REALLY sad when a mediocre album like this gets so much praise...don't bother buying if you've heard the singles already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk a delic","review":"I know to appreciate what Outcast did with this album you will have had to be a fan for a long time. This is just a hot album on both sides. Definitely any real outcast fan will be rotating this for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that saved hip-hop","review":"Genius. Thats the only word to describe the new Outkast album. I became interested in Outkast after hearing Bombs over Baghdad at a party and i saw this, and knew i had to get it.Andre 3000's disc the Love Below is the more creative and eclectic of the two. the best tracks include \\"Vibrate\\" which begins with the record skipping, \\"Take off your cool\\" with Norah jones, \\"A day in the life\\" which has the best beat on the entire album, a cover of \\"my favorite things\\" set to a heavy dance-ready beat, and of course the single Hey Ya. A more upbeat album that never fails to put you in good mood.Big Boi's album on the other hand is more gangsta oriented, but it still shines. His flow is never off balence and he does have some really good beats. Key tracks include ghetto muzik and the single the way you move.An excellent album for any real hip-hop fan. Give all of your love to this album, you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the c.d. (or should I say c.d.'s) that you flip into your disc player and enjoy from start to finish. It has a wide variety of styles from hip-hop to soul to great 70's sounding funk beats all done in the Outkast style. Put it on at a party or just sitting at home with your girl (or guy, depending on who's reading this) and you will get ultimate satisfaction. I gaurantee you'll love this one or I'll chew on my sweaty gym socks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tight","review":"First starting off with big boi he is a genious but he should stay away from the guest appearences they ruining it, but itz a tight album overall with songs like \\"Bowtie\\", \\"Last Call\\", \\"Reset\\" and \\"Unhappy\\". As for my boy andre3000 thats a strange guy but iz amazining he has everythang on his cd and \\"Hey Ya\\" is one of the best songs ive heard and i like \\"Prototype, and \\"Happy Valentines Day\\". This is a good album go buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: Superficial white boys need not apply....","review":"I bought this album mainly because -I had just discovered Herbie Hancock's \\"Headhunters\\" and was looking for more funky groovy stuff to chill out to.And, all the rap lovers at my school HATE this album.The people who will not like this album are the same people who watch American Idol and refuse to admit that ALL hip-hop is essentially the same garbage churned out over and over. Rap is dead, anybody who has the slightest knowlege of culture can see that. There is no innovation, no intelligence. That is what makes this album so enjoyable. It's music that you can sit back and do homework or drive your car to. It doesnt ask a whole lot of you, and you dont have to give anything to it to make it a pleasant experience. And, its not mind-numbingly stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"evolutionary","review":"i like the different feel of each side. it was a new step for outkast. their music keeps changing"},{"rating":"2","title":"great musicality, lyrics, and humor","review":"this cd set is tight. don't let anyone tell you different. each disc is a story, and if you listen carefully, the music is tight too. Outkast has done innovative things here, folks. it's a must have for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"challenge your mind","review":"If you are looking for a handful of club-friendly songs/bangers, buy Big Boi's album. If you are fighting boredom when it comes to most music, buy Andre's album. If you are looking for the quintessential Outkast sound, pick up both.If you are looking for another Stankonia, you may not be ready for this. Buy the damn thing anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"separate's always better","review":"this is a QUALITY album. or a quality two albums, on level with stankonia and probably will eventually be far more widely popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks!","review":"first, i loved the singles \\"hey ya\\" and \\"the way you move\\". but this CD sucks.The other songs don't sound anything like those songs, who cares about the lyrics? i wan't good beats not the stuff on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth...","review":"The part I liked best about this album was the contrast between Big Boi's pumped-up sound and Andre's more experimental tone. It seems like a double-album was necessary to give these two enough space to show their stuff. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good hip hop or jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Love Below is Brilliant!!!!","review":"When I first heard The Love Below, I was blown away.. It's great. I think too many people get caught up in labels and categories, and how things are supposed to sound in any music genre. But I give Outkast credit for having the courage to just make GREAT music. If some people can't appreciate that and want to stay in their little worlds and listen to the same sh.. all the time, go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream crap-hop at its worst","review":"Wildly overrated, eccentric just to be eccentric rather then for the purpose of furthering the music...don't be fooled by the hype, this album is nothing special, in fact it's quite irritating..pick up some of their old stuff, or better yet, just leave Outkast alone altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin Andre 3000","review":"I have to say that the album is good but mostly the \\"The Love Below\\" side. Big Boi has 1 or 2 that are okay, but Andre talks to me through his music, I could totally relate. It's unfortunate that we had to buy the two together but it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, no.","review":"I'm sick of these guys. Where critics and the like get off that they have talent is beyond me. Hey Ya is not a good song. It's not even close to charting in my book. I can't understand why it's even on Billboard's chart. This CD would make a great coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's with the fake funk garbage?","review":"not feeling this at all. the fake jazz. the fake funk. the goofiness of andre's album. he is not prince, not jimi hendrix and not john coltrane. so he needs to stop imitating the greats - find his own voice and be himself. btw - everybodies criticizing/hating on big boi but at least he still representing the real hip hop. i liked big boi's cd ten times better than andre's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst double CD ever","review":"Outkast should consider a retirement after this double cd. This has got to be some of the worst music I have ever heard. I was an Outkast fan before I listened. After I would like to burn everything asssociated with them. DO NOT LISTEN will cause permanent damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're kidding right?","review":"This is just an unbelievable disappointment. These two have been putting in good work for about a decade, and then this. I'm just waiting for Andre to tell us all he was just kidding. Even Big Boi disappoints. Sad man. I hope they bounce back, this is almost as bad as Mos Def \\"experimenting\\" with rock. Stick with Hip Hop, it's why people fell in love with your music. Experimentation is fine, but this is horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!","review":"I am a huge Outkast fan and have seen them in concert twice. They are one of my favorite rap artists but this album just plain old sucked. I was looking forward to hearing it and that's all I talked about before I got it and when I finally heard it I was very disappointed. I thought the only good song that mad me want to hear it over and over was there hit song \\"The Way You Move.\\" Other than that the intro was ok. I like good rap songs with killer beats, so if any of you are like me then don't waste your money. Make a mix CD and include \\"The Way You Move\\" on it and that's all you'll need from these two CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andre's album sucked but Big Boi's was good","review":"This album was really dissapointing especially that song, \\"Carolyn\\"...whatever the song's name is. What da hell was Andre thinking?!! I know he was trying something different but hello...doing something different doesn't mean doing whatever!! It's really sad how they went from ATliens to this crap!! I'm shocked!! If Andre can't sing or if he was trying to do something different on that song, \\"Carolyn\\"...he didn't have to go overboard by just doing whatever. Oh, it's got to be whatever!! Big Boi's cd was good on the other hand...now, he meant business. I can't believe it was the best album of the year but again, we know who thought it was....obviously, those that don't have their rythm straight...Andre, get your head straight!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the love?","review":"Girls, don't lay out any cash for this trash ...or any other crap rap ... that just tells how he's gonna give\\" it \\"to you cause hes so great.

It was great. I prefer Speakerboxx 2 The Love Below. This is probably the best album they have evermade. There also not rip offs f**ckers like Nelly, they at least put 2 albums 4 the price of 1.

Dre is really creative. You can tell that he really put alot into his songs.Now i think I like the love below better than I like speakerboxxx. So when you get the CD, don't just listen to the first couple of seconds of the songs and skip the ones you don't like. Really when I did that, I skipped almost all of them. But when you take the time to listen to the whole album, you will see it in a different light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I think Outkast is one of the best southern group out and that have ever been out. This CD is tight as hell cause they have so many different styles, I gave this cd 4 stars because the only little flaw with the cd is Andre making a whole cd singing he has changed so much overtime I thing he should stick to rapping cause hes a great lyricists but he has his own style and I still like him, anything other than that that this cd is tight. Outkast keep doin yall thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talent if Furocious!!!","review":"I haven't heard this entire cd, however, I still believe I can rate it with 5/5 stars because if you can listen to a cd nowadays and like more than four songs a lot...ya know its gotta be good! I was introduced to Outkast a few years back when they did stankonia...i was intrigued by their unique style of rhythm and their talent is emmense. I can't believe anyone wouldn't love them...I'm at school and even the guys that love heavy metal say that Outkast is good to listen to...heavy metal and hip hop???what is this world coming to...lol. Don't hesitate to buy this cd...it is worth your money...if you choose to download music, don't do it this time...pay them for their effort, because they deserve it for 'doing their own thang', which is hard to come by in this day and age. Kudos to being unique!! 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AND ANOTHER THING....","review":"300 Reviewers ARE NOT WRONG...

For those of you who are afraid of innovation and originality turn back now and go buy Chingy's CD instead. But if you're like me you'll absolutely love it! You'll appreciate the genius that is Outkast when you listen to Big Boi's \\"Church\\" and you'll realize that the more things change the more they stay the same when you hear Dre's \\"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre,\\" one of the few tracks that he actually flows on. Some advice...listen to each disc at least twice before writing a half-a** review. You might hear something you missed before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so disappointed","review":"It's lucky that it was a gift as I wouldn't have wasted my money buying it.As a great fan of rap/hip hop, I'm sorry to say that this double effort from Outkast doesn't make my cut.

Dre isn't rappin {considering he's one of the BEST out there, thats an insult} I didn't like it when Ceelo did it, and I don't like it now. But if that wasn't bad enough, Big Boi done lost his mind as well. He's rappin, but his beats {if you wanna call em that} are HORRIBLE. Outkast done got rich. They're not hungry anymore. They're just showin their ass now. These last 2 albums prove that. By last 2, I'm including Stankonya. You people don't realize it, but thats what they meant. Break it up, Stank on ya.

I've been listening to this duo since they first came out, and I feel that Big Boi and Andre 3000 are better served (just like the fans) when they combine their strengths into one CD instead of going solo on each one. There are a couple tracks that I like from each one, namely Big Boi's \\"Tomb of the Boom\\" and Andre's \\"Happy Valentine's Day\\", and I also like the change of pace from their usual foray, but it doesn't work. Instead of getting Big Boi's gangsta apporach and Andre's snappy funk combined into each track, we get each artist's specialties seperately, and like the duality of man, one doesn't work without the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning do not waste your money","review":"Yes thats right this album is a waste of your money any if you listen to it, your time. The entire album/s have an appauling lack of talent and no real music. I fail to see what Andre and Big Boi are trying to do here...unless is it completely ruin their reputation, because I see that. I dont even give this album one star. I bought this album off of the recomendation that it was really good hip hop/rap, I dont think that i could have been lied to more. If you see this album on a shelf in a store my advice is to run, run far away and not look back. Do yourself a favor, buy andre 3000 it will remind you of the days when Andre wasen't a mainstreem 60's trying sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Hip-Hop, too strange to even call music.","review":"I loved all of the Outkast albums until I collided head first with this garbage. What the f**k happened? I use to like there different style, but this album is really weird. All the songs are wack, I can't believe they just totally switched their sh*t like that. They turned really soft on their real fans. If you like this album you're just blinded by the fact that you like Outkast.

Hater I am not. I love outkast in the past for there original style. selling 2 different cd's as many had me wanting and expecting the best of both worlds. Dre has always been on the edge with his style & Big boi he just bring it to you mostly. This album is not the best it is definitely the worst Outkast complication I have ever heard. I listened to it for about a week now. I tried to be objective and give it a 2nd 3rd 4th & 5th try but to no avail. Dre has more singing & music that is PRince (Purple Rain) music than anything. I am far from close minded. It hurt tru Outkast fans to admit that this is a junk CD. It is very easy to not say that to support OUTKAS.

Yes, hip-hop (or whatever passes as hip hop nowadays) needs to change from the dull junk most of it has become (not J5 and some others) and experimentation needs to happen in order to breathe new life into the genre, but I think that Outkast miss on this one. Especially from some really great albums (i.e. southernplayalistik!! and ATLiens)...It's a little too in your face poppy. they have always been so smart in their stuff, it just seems like they are trying to bring it to the masses through this watered-down-clown-groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellout 3000","review":"There aren't enough words to say how disappointed I am with this album. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because Big Boi had sense enough not to sellout and stuck to being OutKast while Andre tries to be the next Prince. But even Big Boi was barely even trying with his lyrics. The only good songs on Speakerboxx are \\"The Way You Move\\", \\"Bowtie\\" and \\"Church\\".I understand why Hey Ya was #1 on TRL so much, and that's because TRL is a pop video countdown. Dre has definetly sold out. If you wanna hear OutKast and their best, buy Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, ATLiens or Aquemini (Stankonia was alright, but not as good as their first three). The Love Below is the one that really smells like boo-boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Outkast: Speakerboxxx/The Love Below","review":"this is a very big dissapointment to me. i like the old outkast days when they were together on their raps but on this album they had seperate cds, which is dissapointing.

I am amazed this album is #1 for the second week in a row! The Love Below was one of the worst CD's I have ever listened to! It sounds like Prince and George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic got together and made a very craptastic album. Speakerboxxx on the other hand saved this CD, and it has a typical Outkast flavor, but is not worth more than $6.00. There are only a couple really good tracks on Speakerboxxx and the other ones are just ok. If you were smart you will not buy this CD. I bought it, sold it to some sucker on ebay, and I say good riddance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outkast RULES!!!!!!!!!","review":"Outkast's new album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, is great. This album consists of guest appearences by Norah Jones; on the Love Below, and Ludacris, Big Gipp, Killer Mike, and Jay Z; on Speakerboxxx. The two albums are of the two members of the band. Speakerboxxx is Big Boi's album, and The Love Below is Andre 3000's album. The best song, definitly, on The Love Below is, Hey Ya. The best songs on Speakerboxxx are, Toom of the Boom; featuring Konkrete, Big Gipp, and Ludacris; and The Way You Move; featuring Sleepy Brown. Outkast has made many albums over the years, but this is a very good one; not the best album.

HOWEVER, after immensely enjoying \\"Hey Ya\\" and \\"The Way You Move\\" (and finding out I needed it for school), I picked this up. Kick me if you want, but I found The Love Below to be a horrible CD (and I'm a girl, too!). The only good thing it's got going for itself is \\"Hey Ya!\\". Honestly, I licked up Speakerboxxx like a cat drinks milk. \\"Bowtie\\" is my favorite (I have even danced to it for a presentation, and the crowd loved it), followed by a tie (\\"Ghetto Music\\" and \\"The Way You Move\\" and another tie for third (\\"Rooster\\" and \\"Tomb of the Boom\\"). If I could give this three and half stars, I would. One lopped off for the stinky inclusion of The Love Below, and another half for all the times I've heard \\"Roses\\" on the radio.

Unfortunately, I believed the advertising on this item and my pizza came out of the microwave floppy and yucky just like it does if you just reheat it on a plate or paper towel. Tasted like soft mushy bread with cheese on it. When I picked it up, it flopped right down. Disappointing at best. However, I think it's great for storing the left over slices rather than trying to wrap each one of them in aluminum foil which is both expensive and difficult to cover a triagular slice with. So, I don't really know if it's worth or not. Would I re-buy it? No. Do I use it for storage? Yes. So not a complete waste of money, but not all that great a gadget to own.

Hey I'll be the first to admit that Christians, in terms of entertainment, have always had secondhand stuff. Mostly because the producers and performers never had enough money to do anything of descent quality. I think in terms of production quality and acting that it is much better than some of its predecessors like \\"\\"A Thief in the Night\\", or \\"Image of the Beast\\".

And, so, I give it a one-star rating as my way of nominating it for status as a cult classic. If it were an animal, however, I'd have to give it a mercy killing.Besides providing proof that Christian filmmaking has arrived nowhere after more than twenty years, it \\"reveals\\" the silliness of Hal Lindsey's ideas for the end of the world.

I urge those who liked it to rent a film starring a good actor like Harrison Ford or Kevin Spacey, and compare them to Casper Van Dien.... I shudder mentioning him in the same sentence. But I even doubt that a great actor could have saved the script.

Casper Van Dien has apparently been studying under the Tom Cruise method. Stand there and look pretty but heaven forbid you should do good work. I understood what the plot was. That was pretty effortless. Getting there seemed a challenge for the filmmakers though. Oh, yes. I kept track of the violence.

He shoot shim, sneaks out, is suddenly confronted at all turns by shadowy people who seem to have the power to do something to this guy.. since he seems to want to avoid any confrontation.. THEN he gets cornered by two of them and grabs a child holding her hostage.. now we think he will get his, but they just TALK! Then he walks away with not a care in the world.

True, the context may be difficult for both the novice and the unbeliever, but the general idea of God's purpose for mankind's redemption, the prelude to the Rapture, and the story of the book of Revelation is given life, in this format. \\"The Omega Code\\" is a must see family film, that will inspire all age groups to look into the topics that have been presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible!","review":"I rented this movie out of curiosity, but it was so bad I could barely stand to watch it the whole way through.

Here is how boring the movie really was, upon viewing it on my VHS VCR I notice that Goodtimes who manufactured the tape made my tape defective. You see in the long run I only saw 60 minutes of visually portrayed actors, the rest was distortion in the picture. Oh well so much for organized religion.

The one thing that separates this film from the others is that I did not see how a non-believer could come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. There are very subtle hints throughout the movie but other than that it's almost as if the salvation message was an afterthought. I hate to say that it seems like this film was merely an attempt to try to imitate Hollywood films with all the fancy special effects and explosions but, in my opinion, what matters most in a christian film is the message of Salvation that it contains, not all the glitsy special effects. Let's stop trying to imitate Hollywood and get back to imitating Christ and fulfilling the Great Commision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"This movie has to rate as being one of the most boring movies of all times.It's just terrible in every respect.

And, oh yes, it was! While not quite measuring up to Spielberg, it was quite refreshing having the story told in less Hollywoodian style. The movie follows the book script strictly but this only emphasise the fact that some books are better on screen.Good directing, credible story-telling and a wonderful couple of villains - Michael (York) and Michael (Ironside) - carrying the film through. While York's slick face and British accent makes him the likeable world saviour from the beginning, the evil, ever-present smile of Michael Ironside portrays just the wonderful sidekick that would love to mess things up.

None of the actors seem to even remotely take their roles seriously, with the notable exception of Michael Ironside. Mr. Ironside is the only one who does a decent acting job in the entire film. He delivers his usual better-than-average \\"bad guy\\" portrayal.I like to think of The Omega Code as a Jack Chick Tract on film. If you are a Christian you *know* what these are.

Born-again fundamentaloonies never took to it because it isn't 'biblically accurate.' Most sane people dismissed it off-hand. If it didn't completely bomb at the box office, it's because of it's 'limited theatrical release' and the fact that it was [messed with]so well by TBN. Now there's your 2.7 mil at the box office. The TBN crowd (read: instant gratification evangeloonies) flocked to see this croaker. They also put money in Benny Hinn's pockets. Enough said.Well, it didn't take me long to get a hold of this.

Example: the main character is in LA running from the police. in the VERY next scene, he wakes up in israel in some castle with the female lead, who explains that she found him passed out on the street in LA and brought him back to israel, on a private jet, in a car, to a castle without help and without his waking up.

Yeah, they revealed snippets of prophecy, but they left out massive parts in the story. And also it appeared that the anti-Christ needed the Bible to tell him what to do. And anyways, it was terribly done in the first place. Cheesy pyrotechnics, terrible computer generated effects, and non-Christian people supposedly converting everyone to Christianity. I mean, i dont know about you, but to me a movie like this needs not only to be accurate, but be done so that people can get the feel of the real End of Days--this doesnt even go into religiousness really, its like people are afraid to go out and show real Christianity in a Secular movie area.

Even taking the religious elemnet out of the movie, the plot is so boring and contrived that I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes every 10 seconds. Now I am not trying to just rag on this movie for the sake of ragging on it. It was just that bad! Don't fall for it! Yes, it is a Christian movie and the filmmakers had good motives.

It was sometimes difficult to follow why various conclusions could be drawn, or why certain assumptions could be made.As a student, I do not think that this was a very good textbook.

This book offers wonderful insight into one of the greatest minds of the century, if not all time.the book is a compilation of letters, essays and writings on all sorts of topics. He speaks about his thoughts on America, the world, life, you name it.It interested me that Einstein was an anti-prohibitionist; stating that \\"any law that cannot be enforced only serves to undermine the authority of the government. it is no secret that this is closely linked to the sharp rise in crime in this country.\\" This could easily be applied to the modern-day drub problem and supports the decriminalization movement.The book is a great companion for anyone who is a fan of Einstein or who considers themselves enlightened (or in need of enlightenment).

The synthesizer part for \\"E.P. Nights\\" is more-than-slightly annoying and the remaining two songs will put you to sleep.

I wanted to try this product as a more healthy alternative but did not reach the results I was looking for. I was getting the old fashioned fluffy big hair Farrah Fawcett look instead of the more modern sleek look I was going for. No matter how much I experimented with it, the result was a bit messier than desired. I believe it is the result of the moisture, as well as the softness of the foam rollers. Additionally, for someone with long and thick hair like mine, even the jumbo sized rollers are not large enough but shrink if you wrap it tightly in an attempt to get cleaner curls. It seems to be an ideal product for achieving natural looking curls without causing much damage, if you don't mind it looking a bit messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"When I received this product, the rollers (that were in several different baggies) all had a moldy musty smell to them. So far, soaking them in several soapy solutions hasn't helped. They work, but I would suggest that they be used for young girls (tweens/teens) as they don't keep a lasting curl.

Packer considers this to be a series of small studies concerning G-d, as separate messages, but provided a whole in this audio book edition, narrated by Simon Vance.Vance provides a husky voice, presented in a discussion format. Vance does an excellent job at proper intonation, inflection, and authentic reading. Small groups will identify will with the narration, but find struggle keeping up with the material. In truth, this book, in itself, is evidence that audio books will never replace traditional format books (to be read, that is, not necessarily printed). Greatly complex, this book is not suited well for audio, despite the narrator's best attempts.Read the score, disclosures, and more at scriptedgenius (dot) com."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Calvinist","review":"The book really wasn't that good.

Because of this, I am glad for Packer's work. Yet my reading experience of Knowing God was, to be candid, painfully boring. I yawned my way through it. If people want a thorough Christian view of God, the Bible is not only more lively reading, but it's the original treatise on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to draw on practical experiences","review":"After reading this book I closed it and had a hard time relating this information to my own life.

All Christians need to 'know' for certain the entire gospel of Christ, how can anyone follow God unless they 'know' exactly what He's saying to us? The Corinthians had a 'wrong' knowledge of God and that's why Paul was admonishing them because they were following 'after men' (wrong knowledge) rather than Christ. The 'knowledge of God' is good and brings humility but the 'commandments of men'corrupts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on who God is ever!!","review":"Knowing who God really is has helped me on understanding what the Gospel is.

You will be blessed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic worth reading often","review":"Recently we ordered 20 copies of this for one adult Sunday School Class. Those who have participated in the class have reported how much they appreciate the book and discussing it, even though they read it before. It is extremely helpful in getting a vision of God that lifts the soul beyond the present into eternity and creates a sense of awe and reverence in regards to God Almighty.I do not recommend the study guide sold to go with this book. Rather, go to a site by William Meirsheid where you can get both teacher and student guides for discussion and study. The website is http://william.meisheid.com/index.htmThanks be to God for J.I.

You get a fairly detailed description of the geography, politics, and culture of the kingdom of An-Teng and the Lintha pirates. An-Teng is based loosely on Colonized Southeast Asia, although I don't think the guy who wrote it actually knew anything about Southeast Asia. But who cares about that nerdiness, An-Teng would be a fun place to set a campaign of any nature.There's also a Chapter on Lintha, but its off the wall in a bad way. I don't think I'll ever use it in a campaign.Finally, there's an Antagonist Chapter, containing the usual array of Gods, Exalts, and plain old weirdoes. The antagonists are interesting, but I doubt many of them would challenge a Celestial Circle.Overall an interesting book, but not as good as the rest of the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herding Catlow","review":"An honest lawman and a hired gun are both on the hunt for the charming (?) cattle rustler they call Catlow in this amiable, almost casual 70s Western. Like other films adapted from L'Amour novels, this one has a solid, sturdy plot. The protagonist here is dependable, stalwart Richard Crenna and Leonard Nimoy has a VanCleef-like presence as the bad-guy, he's a little under-used (if over-exposed). Brynner in the lead grins up a storm and looks somewhat amusing, done up in his gleaming, spotless blue denim. Daliah Lavi is the lusty female lead.The film was directed by American blacklistee actor Sam Wanamaker and the second unit was headed by John Glen who also tightly edits some broadly comic set-pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joint Venture","review":"Louis L'Amour is a great western writer and Yul Brenner is a great actor.

So in desperation I get this...and it doesn't give the fine ground consistency needed...very unimpressed.....most of my efforts resulted in small bits of walnuts which did go into the cake...[no choice].

I planned to use it to coarsely chop walnuts for granola and baked goods, and to prepare nuts to toast for salads. This product has both a \\"coarse\\" and a \\"fine\\" option, selected by the direction you turn the handle.The \\"coarse\\" option results in about half walnut meal and half very tiny pieces of nuts. I tried it three times: with walnuts at room temperature, refrigerated, and frozen. In all cases, I had to sieve the ground walnuts in order to get any pieces that could be used, and thus I threw out about half. Haven't bothered to try the \\"fine\\" option as anything finer would be walnut flour.I'm really disappointed with the performance.

I used as directed for coarsely chopped nuts and thought maybe they had the instructions backwards. No, it chopped even finer on fine. The only advantage to this nut chopper is that the crumbs you don't want are not scattered all over the cutting board. I am sure I have fewer crumbs when I chop with my knife.

I adore the subject. Yet Harvey's hopeless writing makes a mess of things. I beg to differ with the review who calls this book \\"exquisitely written.\\" It's full of verbiage, hyperbolic prose, overstuffed with description, and it just gets on your nerves. Case in point: \\"the winds of doom seemed to be shrieking through that library, swirling and shrieking.\\" A tad melodramatic, maybe? Just maybe?Just when Harvey starts sticking to his subject, and the story gets interesting again, he derails it with some self-indulgent, totally uninteresting discussion of his personal life, or waxes eloquent about Greek myth. You can seem him trying to be snappy and catchy with his prose, but it just end up as useless melodrama.Obviously the author has a knack for finding good stories, but he needs to take himself less seriously as a writer, because he's not nearly as good as he thinks he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book shares time and space with several others.","review":"There are a few other recent books that go well with this book. Longitude, Nathanial's Nutmeg, A Gentle Madness, The professor and the Madman. These are compatible wines. This is an intriguing book, showing history, collection, and theft. A good primer, with interesting characters.It's worth keeping, just to remind us that times have not changed. Once governments stole maps, now individuals do. Not much has changed,except to make theft more democratic. The author does a decent job of explaining collection imperatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, but too many tangents!","review":"I cannot add much more in terms of substance to what others have written. The book is very interesting, even if you don't have any particular interest in collecting rare maps. However, the writer goes off on too many tangents throughout the story. Some of them are somewhat related to the story, but others serve no purpose to the overall story. In all, it is a good book and I think you should read it, but the writer's editor should have done a better job of cutting out a lot of unnecessary, extraneous material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating book! Better than a novel!","review":"Even if you have no interest in maps or rare map collecting or rare books, you'll love this book. You get caught up in the story and want to finish it in one sitting. A fascinating read about a world I'm not familiar with. If you like to read mystery novels, this is the kind of true story you'll like. I most highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A plodding journey through a formulaic plot.","review":"The plot and premise were interesting and they probably made a great magazine article, which is where the author started his 'journey.' He should have stayed there. The author uses map and travel metaphors over and over again in this tale. We are on a journey. He is charting territory. He is trying to fill in the blank areas. He is Columbus. He is Humboldt. He is Fremont. He is tired and boring. The analogies become predictable and tedious to the point where they feel contrived and formulaic. Every chapter followed the same cartographic format. Why the predictable repetition? Lack of imagination perhaps. Perhaps this is what comes naturally when you try to stretch a thin magazine article into a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"What a disappointment! This could have been an interesting story. In the end we learn very little about cartography or even the events this book purports tot tell. One lengthy pointless detour after another that go no where. Where was the editor? The author's shallow attempt to relate the plot to his own \\"journey\\" is particularly stupid. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was not enough for a book","review":"The idea behind the book seemed interesting at first, but the way it is written just simply did not deliver.I understand he did a lot of research, but I almost got the impression that was precisely the reason the book was written: I did this much work, I might as well write the book although my research fell short on gathering enough materials. He didn't interview the thief, nor any other known map thief. His reasoning about the psychology of the thief (complicated childhood, etc) is weak, at the best, entirely based on his imagination.One thing that was interesting reading this book was to see how a writer can be so totally consumed with the subject that he loses sight of what makes an interesting story and what doesn't. Just because he spent so much on the topic does not justify the whole book. There simply was not enough material to make the book. The story started as a magazine article. Maybe, that's where it should have ended. A very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely enjoyable","review":"You don't usually buy a book by its cover, but the cover is the first reason I picked it up from the shelf. As an avid 'map buff' I was intrigued by it, so I decided to buy it even though I don't usually read true crime stories. I was not dissapointed. This book tells a fascinating story of the history of map making and the history of map collecting, all the while being led by the story of Gilbert Bland, the map thief. I highly recomend this book to anyone intersted in maps and map making!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story could have been written in 10 pages","review":"Diverges from the main point for about 300 pages. I kept reading out of hope that I would find out what happened to the map thief. Only bought the book because it was on clearance - a total waste of a $1.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvey tries to write like Tony Horwitz, but can't","review":"Many of the reviews here have this book pegged; too much truly uninteresting information about the author, reads like a padded-out book report, needs better editing. You get the idea that Harvey would like to have written a book like \\"Confederates in the Attic\\"; breezy, informative, filled with quirky people, and with honest and provocative insights by the author. Harvey doesn't seem to have it in him. \\"The Island of Lost Maps\\" is, by comparison, plodding, not so informative, populated by almost no quirky people, and too full of the author's pompous navel-gazing. The only parts that were interesting related to Bland, and the piecing together of his extended life of map crime. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Magazine Article Turned Into Weak Book","review":"Remember when you were in the fourth grade and the teacher assigned you a book report? It had to be 500 words long but you only had 200 words to say, so you really, really, really padded it? And you took out all contractions because they only counted as one word instead of two?This book is like that report. What was an interesting magazine article has been inflated beyond recognition or interest into this book-lenth effort. Maybe Harvey saw fellow \\"Outside\\" writers turn their articles into terrific books (\\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"Perfect Storm\\") and he thought he could do the same. He couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be poorly written. It did not hold my interest at all. It leads you to believe the book will be about the map thief himself, but it never really answers the questions that are posed.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A marketing triumph","review":"It is a shame that this book got so much attention when there are so many other books of this genre--creative nonfiction--that are better researched, better written, and contain more interesting observations and insights. Harvey has not figured out how to use the personal voice in writing. He does it awkwardly and for all the wrong reasons. This book must have been supported by a heavy marketing campaign--it could not have attracted this much attention on its own. It's regrettable because the subject was interesting and deserved a better writer, one who could have seen where the story was and gone there, rather than doggedly slogging through the story he set out to write, flinging cliches and sophomoric self-awareness left and right. A sad comment on contemporary publishing that this book was marketed heavily while so many truly wonderful books are published but not a cent is spent to ensure they reach the reading public they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I bought it overstock","review":"Aside from the poor writing style, this book is effectively about nothing yet Harvey tries to write about everything. The book never comes to a focus, but instead dances around many many topics related and unrelated to cartography. The interesting thing is that the author poised himself as a researcher, yet this book couldn't feel less thought out. Thank goodness for the overstock section at my local bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Island of loong story that you plough through","review":"Twas such a good concept BUT....the tale is too long.the meanderings are not that interesting.He tries too hard to find something to say about Bland when in fact maybe there is not that much to say.He tries to put everythign he ever learnt into the book - bad editing.NO real flair for writing.Lots of references, lots of names but SO WHAT?!What did I get from this book?ummm. i got a few titles of OTHER books that may be of more interest to me.Sad but true.Such potential BUT....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Island of Lost Maps","review":"I was drawn to the book due to a review in the NY Times. It had two key elements that I find very interesting, cartography and collecting, add to that mystery and intrigue and I was sold. I specifically checked reviews here on Amazon.Com and decided it was a worthwhile read. As previously reviewed, the first two-thirds of the book were very good, presented in a interesting and educational fashion. The last third was absolutly painful. The author drags us through an almost surreal look at his trials and tribulations in his pursuit of an answer, when all I was looking for was a decent conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"I read this (or tried to) for my book club. It is the first book in years that I have not been able to finish. I just can't get into it. If you are REALLY into maps, you will probably like it. It jumps around too much between the story of the theft and the history of maps. I like historical fiction and I like history that is told in an interesting way, but this book missed the mark in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor disappointment","review":"As a map collector I looked forward to this book but wound up disappointed. Harvey's writing is sophmoric at worst and average at best. He loses track of the thread of the story and rambles on about Graham Arader (who evidently snowed Harvey and got some free press). He sheds very little light on the map thief himself, but rehashes old newspaper articles and really does not come up with anything new. The book is physically unattractive, but that is not his fault. The author tries to personalize the quest but that device is so strained that it is not worthy of a freshmen English essay. The book's redeeming feature is that it brings awareness of map theft to the greater public and perhaps next time Gilbert Bland (the thief) will not get off so lightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I MADE A MISTAKE","review":"I READ THIS BOOK A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THOUGHT I HAD IT PEGGED, BECAUSE I AM A COLLECTOR, AND THE SUBJECT OF THE THEFTS HAD SOME INTEREST. BUT THEN, AFTER, I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT AND DECIDED, THE AUTHOR CANNOT GET INTO THE MIND OF MR. BLAND, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. HE WAS A POOR THIEF AND A DULL MAN. THE FACT THAT HE GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR SOME TIME IS A COMMENT ON THE LIBRARIES, NOT ON HIM. I COULD NOT CARE LESS. THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO CONCENTRATE ON THE COLLECTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely abismal - a view from IRELAND","review":"This book looked and sounded interesting - so I bought it. Don't we all make mistakes?! Instead of just giving us the interesting story which forms the substratum of the book,Harvey meanders around here, there and everywhere - and believe me it is painful. The supposed main focus of the book is a man named Gilbert Bland and this book is just that - bland. What a great dissapointment and shame. It could have been a good story well told. But no so."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply not very good","review":"The writer intrudes too much in this book. Gilbert Bland, the map thief, was bland, but Miles Harvey is more so. I didn't care about his childhood and I still don't. and the psychobabble is excessive and boring. I cannot understand why the book got so much hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"You'll run across a couple of great characters throughout the book, my favorite was Mr. Atlas the map collector, and they are interesting and fun. I also liked the part about what happened to Columbus after his first, highly acclaimed voyage. But I found the author's phsyco babble about himself intrusive and it put me off. In the end, although his pursuit of the story behind the thefts took him on some interesting detours, he was basically unsuccessful in finding out anything about Bland or the thefts beyond what was reported in the newspapers in 100 words or less. And come on - the Island of Lost Maps is a pile of paper in the middle of a table? That was weak. I think the title is misleading and raises expectations that it can't fulfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back!!","review":"I have not heard from Robin Lane since the Chartbuster's second album in 1982.

Dave Hall is a poet as well as a composer of music. While not obscure, his lyrics require close listening in order to appreciate the carefully chosen words.

It is best read in small pieces, but well worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best by far","review":"I lost my 26 year old son to suicide on September 16, 2011. As an avid reader my whole life, I turned to books for help in dealing with the unimaginable. This book was far and away the BEST in capturing what it feels like to be a bereaved parent. On almost every page, I found myself saying \\"Yep, that's me\\". Nobody can express the emotions/pain/torment like another parent in the same situation, and this book is one parents' story after another. I wish it had been the first book I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"So far I've purchased 2 copies of this book and would highly recommend it to anyone grieving the loss of a child,.

A grief counsellor gave me this book. I'm sure that a grieving mother would get help from this book. I won't sit and read a book that does nothing but put the grieving father down.

If you are a grieving father, this sexist book should not belong on your reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"Outstanding! Don't be fooled by the title. This is not a book just for people who have lost infants. This was an intelligent and sensitive description of life after the death of a child. My school-aged child died only a month ago.

I want to thank the author for writing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from favorite","review":"I bought 2 of these due to the reviews, wear a 38 J cup. IT is too big, and there is a TON of material. I HATE underwires. Under the arm pits is dreadful, it makes me sweat like a pig and I dislike the feel of the whole thing. It runs way big and does not offer much in the way of support. Not comfortable and the straps are not very comfy either.I must echo all other large breasted womens comments. What is wrong with bra makers? I tried making my own bra in desperation, that was a bust. Apparently unless you wear a 34 b or c cup we are doomed to crummy over priced, ugly colors and ugly pieces of junk. If I were not so large breasted I would just give up.I just wear my old glamorise that have muffin tops because they do not go over an I cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great fit","review":"I bought this hoping it would fit (impossible to find my size and suitable style) and be an easy wear. The straps do not shorten enough for any support at all.

The setting is captivating, and the daring choice of the three main characters makes for an exciting premise. However, the story feels a little thin. We never get a deep sense of how the characters feel about their choice and its consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential in an interesting topic, but didn't quite meet expectations","review":"This was a very quick read following the lives of several young women in 1830s China. There's some interweaving of their experiences, but the characters seem mostly two-dimensional. A lot of the book is striaght-forward narrative, which is fine, but the plot seemed largely simplistic and underdeveloped. There was potential for a lot more - greater depth in understanding some of the key characters (including the women who were not spinsters) and some of the historical events taking place in this period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was lured by the story's intriguing premise of three \\"spinsters\\" defying convention in 1830s China. Unfortunately, the book is written so badly that the premise never develops to its potential. The characters are poorly developed, as is the plot. It reads like a bad folk tale. Too bad - in the hands of a better author this could have been a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Quality DVD","review":"Rating based on Quality of the DVD and not the movie itself.Jason's Lyric is a great movie, that screams for a new release, as the MGM DVD is of horrible video quality,and seems to be the only dvd release of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying a video","review":"I bought this for my teenage daughter.

The acting of Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett as the title's stars, \\"Jason and Lyric, respectively), along with Bokeem Woodbine (\\"Joshua\\"), Suzanne Douglass (Jason's mother), and the brilliant Forest Whitaker (\\"Maddog\\")is flawless. One feels for all the characters as the tragedy of their lives unfolds on screen.Credit must also be given to Eddie Griffin and Lisa Nicole Carson. The former adds a little humor to an otherwise starkly grim and realistic story while the latter serves as Lyric's \\"muse\\".Also, the casting of the actors Sean Hutchinson and Burleigh Moore that played younger versions of Payne and Woodbine is commendable. Besides being extremely talented, they LOOK the part.As others have commented, the \\"acting\\" during the intimate scenes makes this film definitely for the adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless masterpiece!!","review":"This has to be the most beautiful and highly underrated movies of all time. I fell in love with this movie back in 1995, after I missed seeing it at the movies. Payne {Jason} and {Pinkett} Lyric portray lovers torn between Payne's undying love and devotion to his brother. The passion between them is undeniable and their love scenes are incredibly HOT!! Payne's ne're-do-well brother, Joshua {Woodbine} plays the hard-headed prison thug who struggles to stay on the right path. Payne is also plagued by nighmares he suffers as a result of a struggle between his parents that ended up in tragedy. In effort to get away from all the drama and the nonsense, he and Lyric plan to just go far away and leave everyone -and everything- behind. Everytime I watch this movie, I cry. Oscar-worthy performances by Pinkett, Payne, Woodbine, and Whitaker. Excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE LOVE STORY","review":"I saw this movie ten years ago when I was 13 and ten years later, I still love it. But now that I'm older, I can appreciate the story line even more. Jason is a troubled man haunted by his past that he continues to have nightmares. Due to his past, he feels obligated to help his brother who nothing but a criminal and content to stay one and his mother to help her out with his brother. But when he meets Lyric, a woman full of passion, sympathy and dreams, he realizes that he has to let the past go. But his brother continues to come between Lyric and himself until the end when he has to make the ultimate decision: to be with the woman he loves or to be with the brother he loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about love","review":"When I saw this movie I thought how deep someone's love can go, from the 1st meeting, the chase to where Jason decided that he want to be with Lyric somewhere else, I still believe in true love and soulmate and they really seem connected, I think they did a great job, some of the violence could've been removed, but I love the movie and this is why I am ordering a copy for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"I think that this movie was very good because it is very realistic as far as the situations of life in the ghetto,love,and the struggles of life. It's not like most of these trunped up \\"hood movies\\" that seem to always glorify ghetto life instead of potraying it as it is.I think that it's not an innapropriate movie for young people in their pre teen and early teen years because the movie potrays issues that effect alot of kids these days in real life.

And then there are the kids. Oh my God, what can I say about the kids? They sound like overweight chipmunks.I've read a few reviews here that says that Kidz Bop's Bring Me to Life and Evanescence's Bring Me to Life sound the same. That's impossible. Even if you take out the kids, Kidz Bop's version is nothing like the original. Just listen to each sample to get an idea. In the first verse of the original, Amy Lee's voice vibrates when she sings the word \\"home\\". On the Kidz Bop version, the word \\"home\\" sounds really nasaly. And that's just one word out of the whole song. Listen to both samples and you'll probably find even more differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary. Just REAL Scary.","review":"Talk about scary. It's one thing to re-record radio hits with small children... it's another thing to make poor decisions. Evanescence's \\"Bring Me To Life\\", clearly one of the frontrunners for biggest hit of 2003, doesn't quite belong on this CD. \\"Save me from the nothing I've become\\"... mmm... yes, this is what I want my 4 year old to be singing along to with a big grin on his face. I think not. That is seriously borderline morbid, and while it could serve as some kind of piece of abstract modern art, it's not a very good idea to bring it to the masses and into the minivan.As far as the remainder of the CD... sure, it seems like a great idea. Let songwriters get the maximum bang for their buck, ween older kids out of Raffi and into pop... but I think it should have been clear to the creators when they listened to the results of Kidz Bop 1 that this was just not a product with either a long shelf life or credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"&%$#@ CD","review":"This CD sucks. i've seen the music video for When I'm Gone (the real one) and it is dedicated to our troops.

It showed two girls peeking in a window to look at this \\"cute\\" guitar player playing and swooningwhen they see him. I don't know about you, but that is on the opposite end of the scale of the original.

The radio is not allowed. Since this CD has KIDS in the title, it's ok - even though it's radio songs - but it's managments call so go figure.Anyway, the main reason I bought this CD was for the Ketchup Song.

I was . This was all the hook I needed to continue and was very pleased that I did .The characters and style of writing remind me of Elmore Leonard .

The pace was wicked but after a couple of hundred pages I began to get dizzy. Not sure how he could've fixed it though. Once you get into that hard-hittin' prose it's hard to get out. Anyway, for a first effort ol' Bill did all right. Also, could have used a lot more on his reasoned feelings toward big bro. Not sure anyone blew up anything in Orwell's 1984. You know, the pen is mightier than the sword and all that. But surely, on April 15th we all have the sort of fantasies he spelled out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. I give it an 'F'.(A review of the abridged audiobook)","review":"This book gets some pretty decent reviews so...maybe it is pretty decent IF you are a fan of gratuitous, super-detailed rape scenes, splattering mists of blood and brains, barely fleshed-out government plots and revenge-driven soldiers who insanely act without cause.Admittedly, I listened to it as an abridged book on tape, however, Brannon's book is in serious need of more detail explaining the connections between the characters, including what some of these characters are doing in this plot in the first place. I was irritated at the lack of detail, but yet even more irritated at the insane amount of detail devoted to these items: 1) a visit of a 'John' to a hooker in Las Vegas; 2) an unnecessary rape and genital mutilation scene and similar descriptions of violence.In an abridgment, you should abridge the unnecessary parts, not the essential plot details!My grade for this book on tape: F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got talent but could not deliver. A head spin&dizzy reading!","review":"This author got talent but both of his books, LET US PREY and THE DEVIL'S HOLE, were miserable failures. Read like Joyce's THE DUBLINERs, both books made my head spin and dizzy. The plots and scenarios got lot digressions and blab,blab,blab, jumping around like a beheaded chicken with not much blood spraying around. All the contract killers in these two books were supposed to be good, but always turned out to be no-big-deal. All the characters could only give you vague and obscure impressions.

My 10 year old came with me but since it was in a box and there was no display, I was most worried about the size and quality. Well, after getting it home and blowing it up, I was VERY happy with the size and impressed with the quality. Even my 10 year old and his friends have had a lot of fun in it and trust me, they're not all that gentle with it but it withstands it.

What a drag for when more than one kid shows up for a play session. Also, this product only allows for weight up to 100 lbs max. per individual.

This try is a little better than his Reggae Tribute To Jimmy Buffett cd (UTTERLY ATTROCIOUS). Not as CHEESY as the first, it stays somewhat truer to Jimmy's versions. The arrangements aren't bad, but the lead singer sounds like he came from a Holiday Inn Lounge act. His voice doesn't fit the songs & it becomes more irritating the longer you listen. To be safe, stay with the Picking On Jimmy Buffett cd which is bluegrass versions of Jimmy's songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming Story","review":"This is a heartwarming story, very well written, about a man who builds a home on the side of a giant redwood tree.

It was fine for about six months, then a big mistake. Although I followed the instructions to use lower heat, plastic utensils, and no abrasives on these pans, washed them by hand, and even oiled the fry pan before cooking bacon, they lost their non-stick quality very soon. They also became difficult to clean. The interior black matte-finish obscures any film or particle of food that sticks to the surface, so you may think they are clean until you rub them with a dish towel. When it was uncertain whether the dark particles rubbed out of the fry pan were bits of food or the finish itself, I gave up on them.

It can take the heat well. The handles take forever to get hot, but when they do, it takes almost as long to cool down. I can say it will survive any burned-in food (I tested it :) and just wipe clean. They are heavy, though. Probably not the best for an electric stove.

Too many characters, the plot line is too complex and fantastic. I like fantasy, I like revisionist history, but at some point the story for me became discombobulated and way to far reaching.

Admirable, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and vacuous","review":"I thought at the end there would be some great insightful, philosophical meaning to this book. I kept reading it even though it took five weeks because I don't speak Yiddish and there was no plot to follow. At the end, and this is a spoiler, all that happens is nothing. It was probably the worst book I have ever stubbornly stuck through. I really like this author, and you can tell he expended a ton of energy and time researching and writing this long novel, but in the end it was all wasted. It just isn't that good and is completely uninteresting. I wait anxiously for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I read both books on the 2 for 1 and actually liked \\"When Life Was Egg Creams and Baseball Teams\\" much better. Its about a Jewish boy growing up in the NY area back in the 60s although the author doesn't tell you in his summary the story is about a Jewish boy. Its light and pretty amusing and good nostalgia. Anyway, regarding the Yiddish Policeman, I'm not a big fan of Chabon's writing but I did find this one of his better books, probably because I grew up with a lot of Yidish speaking relatives and neighbors so I could relate to the characters. It was funny and entertaining but not very believable though not a requirement of fiction genre. I did find this a long read and a bit dragging but if you stick with it it ends up pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale Of Two Books","review":"I had heard many good things about the writer and this book, and based upon this I was looking forward to reading this work. The writer is very skillful in setting up his story as well as its setting. It is understood that a portion of any book is taken up by the writer setting up his plot line as well as introducing his characters. It is unfortunate that it takes over 200 pages for the book to begin moving its plot line with any sustained interest. I was continually asking myself, \\"Why have I not put this book down?\\". It is not well done at all. Aside from the three major characters, the writrt does a poor job in character development. The book finally picks up with one or two surprises existing. Numerous characters drop in and out without any real development. The book leaves much to be desired as it plods alog into mediocrty. For a good nights rest, one might wish to consider it. It an be said of this story that the juice received at the end is NOT worth the squeeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Really, Michael Chabon comes through again with this amazing noir-style mystery that puts Jews front-and-center, showing the Jewish mobster scene rather than the common Italian one.

Those who do not know any Yiddish will need to learn some. Fortunately, my parents spoke Yiddish in the home and with relatives and friends on the street, so I did not have a problem. But, as I was reading this book, I kept asking myself how a person with no knowledge of Yiddish, Jewish or not, could follow and enjoy this good story. Sometimes, the parts of the story came very close to home. My mother as a young woman had a pet duck that followed her around her father's fish and kosher poultry store. There were other things that came close to home, but the pet duck?This was my first experience with Michael Chabon.

This is the exception. A great read, a great view of history and so well written, with such sharp scenes, strong plotting and believable characters that it is a totally believable alternate possibility.

I enjoyed the book and its humor. The main characters are interesting, flawed, and complicated people. The book motivated me to do a bit of research to discover the actual events on which the plot is based. I did find the consistent and frequent use of Yiddish a bit frustrating; however, I discovered when I reached the end of the ebook that there is a Yiddish glossary. Even absent the glossary, you can easily follow the plot without understanding the Yiddish terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another showoff","review":"Drunk on his own words, piling his strained metaphors on, Chabon is a \\"Look at me!

I didn't understand what was going on most of the time, I couldn't figure out what the Yiddish meant, the writing was choppy, and the plot didn't seem to be able to make up its mind about which way it wanted to go.I only finished it because I had nothing else to do when I was at work.

If you don't come from this background, you start off with a handicap. (Count the number of Jewish last names among the five star reviewers, and compare to the one star reviewers.) Then, the plot takes half the book to start moving faster than a crawl.On the good side, Chabon's virtuoso use of the language is as good as Nabokov with an extra side order of sarcasm. His laugh-out-loud wisecracks are almost worth slogging through this book. But not quite.

However, we all agreed it was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ulp !!!","review":"The nicest thing i can say about this one is that Chabom has done better!This is not a review in the strict sense, but my badly addled mind reacting to a horrible book. I cannot dignify this to be either a novel nor comedy, well written or not.I accept the basic premise (Israel overrun in 1948 - \\"alternate history\\") - which becomes the story line. However, the book is a combination of some the worst stereotypes (and stereotypes of stereotypes) and ugliness pretending to be comedy I've seen in years. I was sick to my stomach. I cannot believe that Chabon is such a self hater... And I will stop there......"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate downer","review":"Because of the title and the unlikely setting, I assumed this would be a somewhat humorous book. Not so! If you appreciate dour, hopeless, helpless subject matter, and excessive descriptive ability regarding illness and physical limitations, this is your book. The characters, all Jewish, call each other \\"Yid.\\" I found the entire book offensive, and I am not Jewish. I am not looking to any other offering by this author"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have tried to read","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. After three weeks of struggling to get into it, I finally threw it away. First, the characters where not painfully realistic. They were simply painful. Second, the premise while interesting, was an abysmal failure. Third, Chabon could not carry off the genre - he over wrote it. Finally, I hated the constant, unrelenting reference to Yids!With this book after Kavalier & Klay (which I loved) Chabon has proved the old adage: everyone has one great novel in him/her!

The payoff after nearly one thousand pages was not worth the trouble nor the strain on the eyes.

It serves up fantasy, fact, irony, and a love of Yiddish culture in equal doses. I'm grateful that Chabon can craft a blend of a great story with wonderful writing. I'm even more grateful that he is willing to stick his neck out and let his imagination run way beyond wild. More of us should do the same and then we'd remember what is important in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy Gevalt","review":"How could you take such an exciting idea and make it into such a tedious, boring, overinflated novel. I'm sorry, this writer is talented and smart, but he's no John Grisham, who as a writer is not as talented and smart, but he sure knows how to tell a story. This guy hasn't a clue, and I don't think he has any respect for readers to tolerate all the nonsensical, convolutions, the Jewish shtick is OK, but way overdone, of plot. I said to myself, is this ever going to be interesting, or worth reading--no less all the time and effort it took to write it--the answer was a resounding NO.I think any sane editor would have told him, very early on, Michael this is terrible, you have a gem of an idea and talent but, when is this novel going to wake up from its frozen pickled herring slumber.YAWN.

My boyfriend and I read it at the same time, and we would read passages out loud and wonder 'what does that mean?' It was as if we couldn't really get at the meat of the matter, the details, what was going on. Ultimately, I stuck with it until 50 pages shy of the end, then just had to stop. I got sidetracked with a Jonathan Lethem novel. I'm hoping my boyfriend will finish and just tell me how it ends.

Don't think I will try Chabon's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chabon at His Dullest...and Most Disappointing","review":"I usually adore Michael Chabon's work, whether it be a quick read like \\"Mysteries of Pittsburg\\" or a hearty, slow-burn page-turner like \\"The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\". Like other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating, I simply couldn't get past the first few hundred pages of \\"Yiddish Policemen's\\". Initially, I felt dense, perhaps as if I was missing something crucial Chabon was trying to get across to me the reader. However, what really WAS missing were two of Chabon's strengths: engaging language and characters the readers actually care about, even if they have a hard time liking them. If you ask the question \\"I wonder what happens to this guy at the end of the book?\\" and the answer is \\"Who cares?\\", it's time to put the book down, and move on to the next tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our entire book club couldn't get through this book!","review":"My book club is made up of well-educated and well-read people. A few read and loved Chabon's previous work. NONE of us could make it through this book. It seemed overly wordy, complex, and indirect. One third through this book we still couldn't figure out what it was about and why we should care about the characters. And, if you don't know Yiddish words, you're hopelessly lost. We can't figure it out: why does everyone else rave about this byzantine and plot-less book? Maybe if we stuck it out past the first half, it would have redeemed itself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Way below my expectations after Kavalier. Characters are unsympathetic ; story premise is weak; writing is plodding. I am half way through and I lost interest continuing to read it to completion months ago. It's the kind of book you have to force yourself to read to see if there is something worthwhile further on. Attempts at humor fall flat most of the time. Find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Yiddish Policeman's Union by Michael Chabon","review":"Only because I hated to give up on the book I have read laborously through 28 chapters. I finally just decidedin spite of not knowing the meaning to most of the words I would try to find a plot. However other than puttingme quickly to sleep every time I try to read it it has become a challenge even finding a plot. If you don't know anything about Jews or Chess it is not a book that a you would enjoy reading. I think the people who say that they enjoyed it are Jewish Chess players just trying to make you think that they are intellectuals. Noone could possibly have enjoyed this terribly written book. If this is one of the best books of 2007 I would not want to getnear any of the worst! A complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The premise sounded so interesting! Why did Chabon have to ruin it with his boring story?

It is degrading to Jews (I am one) and if I didn't know the author is Jewish I would say he was anti-semitic. But not only the horrible descriptions, on and on, the story plot was stupid. I kept reading hoping to find something, anything worth while, alas, as I neared the last page I realized what a waste of money and time this was.I have talked to two other people who read the book, one is Jewish the other Christian, and they too thought the book was not only redundant but disgusting and awful.Dorothy Harper, Northridge, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"kick\\"","review":"I bought the book because I was intrigued by the cover and also becauseit had the word \\"yiddish\\" in it, of which I have a smattering of understanding.The premise of the book is interesting, a Jewish \\"homeland\\" in Alaskawith everything Jewish, including street names, characters, etc.I admired his artistry in his use of descriptive words which, to mewas probably the best thing,no, probably the only thing I enjoyedabout the book.

Chabon violates this principle completely. While the Yiddish Policemen's Union is imaginative and literate, it also completely fails to follow through on its provocative premise that in nine weeks potentially the entire Jewish population of Alaska is going to be expelled. More worth reading for the atmosphere than the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read. Ever.","review":"This is Michael Chabon at his best. The story is gripping, the characters wonderfully quirky. And the writing -- oh, the writing! There are so many sentences and even whole passages that are simply breath-taking. I kept thinking \\"I wish it was me who had written that sentence!\\" Chabon has an amazing gift with words. I have read most of his other books, but I think this is his best work so far. I absolutely loved it, and I know I will be rereading it many many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginitive Alternate-History Noir","review":"No need to give another synopsis, plenty of those here already.I do recommend this one, it succeeds beyond a genre or genre-mixture.

Nonetheless, the spare jewels, such as the following, make it worth the price of admission. \\"Meyer's seed, even now, may be wandering through darkness toward redemption, striking at the membrane that separates the legacy of the yids who made him from that of the yids whose errors, griefs, hopes, and calamities went into the production of Bina Gelbfish.\\" I was reminded at once of Abba Eban (Personal Witness) when he wrote, \\"For peace to be born, its parents must meet at least once.\\" There is a reach of profundity here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Disappointing","review":"I tried very hard to get through this audiobook, but could not reconcile myself to one more minute of the narrator's voice.

Although not reaching the heights of Kavalier and Clay, Yiddish Policeman's Union, surpasses the pot filled orgy of Wonderboys. Like Chabon's other work, the writing is rich and detailed with everything English majors will love. There's a distinctive noir feel present throughout this book that gives it the feel of a old school detective show like Perry Mason. Added in here is an artful retelling of history after Israel is destroyed in the aftermath of World War Two complete with a replacing of Mein Kampf. Chabon's books often make the reader think and provide an engaging reading experience in the process. As an added bonus for the fans of political conspiracy the ending is perfect fit with any great conspiracy man has created from the moon landing to the Kennedy Assassination."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my kind of mystery","review":"I prefer books where the language does not call attention to itself.

Lastly, and I don't mind depressing novels, but this one just seemed cynical, dark, and as if the author was toying with the reader.Must admit, there were some times, I found the writing interesting and visual, but overall, just sorry I wasted my time when there are so many other titles that are on my list to read.

I found the writing to be unexpectedly dense, at times over-written with an abundance of descriptive language that dragged the story down. I wanted to like the story, as I thought the revisionist premise of a post-WW II Jewish district in Alaska was intriguing. But the main story kept changing direction, and I found myself just not caring by the time it finally showed itself in the end. The main character of Meyer Landsman was compelling, and the mysterious murder victim was interesting, but the rest of the characters were pretty flat. This was the first time in a long time that I really had to force myself to finish a book, because there were many times I wanted to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Once you put it down, you can't pick it back up. Almost a history of Jewish persecution and a downtrodden outlook on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate history made interesting","review":"Landsman, with all of his flaws, is a character who gets under your skin and quickly becomes that lovable underdog that you love to cheer on. The culture, language, uncertain future for the Sitka Jews, and setting are great characters too, bringing a richness that most stories (regardless of the format) simply don't have these days.The murder mystery felt lost at times but always pulled itself out, which made the main plot feel less important than the setting. This was the only flaw I found with this book. However, it did give the sensation that I was reading page after page of description that didn't have any real meaning. Ultimately, this does resolve itself. The murder does get solved.I understand how this novel won both the Hugo and Nebula award. All of its elements of alternate history and the fantastic push The Yiddish Policeman's Union into a place where a book about cops becomes a wonder of soft science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic--in every sense","review":"This is a fabulous book. You will be amazed, and in a good way, that this is based on a fictional history and location. It's very well written and darkly funny. (I fervently hope that the Coen brothers make this book into a movie. If they do, I would bet money that it turns out to be one of their really great, legendary movies.) It's fun to read, speaks to an intelligent reader, and I wish it was about twice as long.I must admit that I found the punchline/conclusion to be a bit odd, to the point where I felt it constituted somewhat of an off note in the book as a whole. But it's not that bad, and it by no means ruined the book for me! I have to give it a 5-star rating just because in its entirety, this is just a wonderful, entertaining novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This was not an easy book to read. First because of its setting in Alaska in a time that never happened. I know the small town, and in the book it is a very large city with a population about double the population of the whole state. I easily got past that and enjoyed the chance to think of what have been. The next hurdle was the way the story jumped from here to there, from past to present to what never could be. Expressions unknown to me are defined in the back of the book but that's one of the difficulties I have when reading on my Kindle. How to easily move backward and forward in the text. I'm sure it's possible but I haven't learned how.It was a challenge to read. I read too much for the pure escapism. This was a lot more than that but in the end that's all it was.I recommend it to friends, I look for opportunties to discuss it with friends. I want to know what they saw in it, thought about it and what I probably missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The atmosphere is well-done","review":"Unfortunately the plot is not. Starts off with a homicide case, throws in an extra one with no impact on the plot (but it does give the protagonist a chance to shoot someone), veers off into crazy conspiracy theory nutjobbery, and finally runs out of gas and pulls over to the side of the road without resolving anything.The Yiddish was fun, the alternate history take was fun, but at the core the plot needed another couple trips to the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"What an excellent novel!

The post-WWII Jews have been settled in Alaska, not Israel, and Chabon sets us at the center of a murder investigation of the son of a famous Hassidic rabbi, whose murdered son ranged far from the fold.Just a bang-up job in general, but again like with C&K; it is draggy in the second half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chabon is the Best and this is one of his gems!","review":"I bought this as a gift for a nephew, having read it last year. was entranced by this Alternative history, Noir Black Comedy. For anyone who likes a mystery and has a sense of the absurd as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise; Imprecise Execution","review":"I had heard about this book and this author, and figured I would get around to reading it. What prompted me to actually buy it was the coupon from Borders I received for reviewing the first four chapters.These first chapters were intriguing. I naturally thought the whole book was going to be like this - a unique combination of various genres. Being of Eastern European Jewish descent myself, I looked forward to a lot of the Jewish in-jokes other reviewers have mentioned.Unfortunately, as others have also mentioned, the tone became as dreary as the weather, and there was virtually no payoff to plodding through to the end.I will defintely read his other works. They all can't be winners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport,.......Meyer Landsman?","review":"What a refreshing novel. You have murder, action, alternative history, the intricacies of Jewish culture, and faith, plus geography. Oh, also, humor, and sadness. Did I miss anything? This was my first Michael Chabon novel, certainly not my last. The tale is a colossal accomplishment that is without a doubt UNIQUE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious meshuga melange of Yiddish and Alaskan.","review":"You won't be unintentionally jarred by the interpolation of Yiddish and Alaska. For all the strangeness of its alternative-history setting, the plot is as finely crafted as if it had been put together with woodworking tools. I mean this plot is as good as one by Thackeray. It's a love story, a good one. I did figure out the main aim of the conspiratorial combination long before it was revealed. There is not a dull character in the whole thing. This book was a superlative choice for a poolside book on my Alaskan cruise vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Humorous, Quick Read","review":"Since there's been so many reviews, I won't recap the plot. I thought The Yiddish Policemen's Union was a great, quick read. Both a murder mystery and an alternative history, Chabon's work is a glimpse into the darkly humorous wold of Detective Meyer Landsman. At times funny, touching, and disturbing, this book should entertain most readers.The only negative I would add is that the text is liberally sprinkled with Yiddish (who'd have thought from the title, right?). If you didn't grow up around Yiddish-speakers or don't live around those that speak it, certain words may require some investigtaion. However, Chabon generally provides enough context clues to get the unfamiliar reader through.This one is definitely worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read but...","review":"Didn't think much of this laggy plot. Thought the characters were trite. But I still read on. The writing is above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"One thing I truly hate to do is give up on a book. In fact it's rare that I do, but unfortunately, I gave up on this one after about 115 pages. I simply could not get into the story (and this was after trying to read it for 5 days.) One reviewer mentioned that the author should consider a yiddish dictionary for those, like me, who are yiddish-challenged and I have to agree. There were so many words that I was unfamiliar with that it made it that much harder to get into the story. Truly a disappointment since I had really looked forward to reading this. An interesting premise that just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"My book club selected this book based on the strength of \\"The Adventures of Cavalier & Clay\\" and because Chabon is such a gifted writer. I was very disappointed with this book.This follow-up to the Pulitzer winner is regrettably self-indulgent. Not sure who the intended audience is but it wasn't me. It seemed like Chabon couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a fantasy, an homage to 40's detective mysteries or a love story. In my view, he did none of these. And the ending is so preposterous that it exceeded my 'willing suspension of disbelief' limits to such a degree as to insult my intelligence.All that said, there are a few passages that are sheer magic but all they do is remind you that this is a failed attempt by a very gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived attempts at Humor","review":"This is an attempt to be humorous which falls flat in his contrived use of Yiddish words and idioms which for most readers should have provided a glossary of italicized words.Of course the idea was a preposterous story but any humor interspersed in the pointless detective story was lost. I grew up with parents who spoke Yiddish and I didn't recognize many of the words as they were used.I plowed through the book only because of a compulsion to finish anything once started and was implored by my wife to give it up as I moaned and complained.I did not read his first book but reading this casts doubts on the Pulitzer prize committee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Yiddish Policeman's Union","review":"I am stuggling to read this book because it is not holding my attention. The author is not drawing me in what-so-ever. Some things are overly described and others are not explained well. It is hard to follow. I have had to skim sections in hope to get to a more engaging part of the book. I have yet to find the more engaging part of the book. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This novel is vastly overrated. I do not like novels in which the tone of the novel is one of belittling and condescending. It just did not interest me at all. I wanted to like it, I am interested in Jewish life, Interested in alaska, but the authors attitude was evident in the book and I did not like that tone of one upmanship. Totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Th Yiddish Policemen's Union","review":"This book was recommended to me and I was very disappointed in it. I found the sentences went on forever and were hard to understand. I was confused as to why the Jews were where they were and in fact it was hard to determine who were the Jews and who were not. Who were the bad guys and who were the good guys. I'm still not sure what the purpose of this book was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score","review":"The Yiddish Policemen's Union is one of the best novels I've read in a long, long time. While it certainly has merits as a mystery, it is the characters, ghostly images of diaspora, and the plight of all people without a homeland that make this novel resonate long after one has put it down. Given events in the Middle East, Chabon's novel has an added poignancy, as it challenges one to contemplate a world without a Jewish homeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for quiet evenings","review":"I got aware of Stephen Bishop after the end of the film classic TOOTSIE.It was his voice that shattered me.Bishop is not a rockn Roller,his music concentrates on people who like quiet evenings at home or relaxing on the beach with your pod.The most memorable cues on this wonderfully remastered CD are ON AND ON,SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY,ONE MORE NIGHT,the great Beach Boys alike ANIMAL HOUSE and of course IT MIGHT BE YOU,which could easily be held as classic.GREAT STUFF."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Stephen Bishop compilations","review":"You can't really argue with the song selection here, but the sound is a step down from the other two Stephen Bishops CD compilations I own. The earlier MCA CD On And On / The Hits Of Stephen Bishop sounds warm and open and there is a nice natural level of hiss on the quieter acoustic tracks such as \\"Madge,\\" which is one of my favorite songs. By contrast, the 20th Century Masters sounds a little \\"cold\\" and there seems to be some clipping in the high frequency transients, especially noticeable on the drums and cymbals. Also, I couldn't hear any hiss at all, which makes me wonder if they used noise reduction in the mastering of this CD. I would stick with either On And On or the earlier Rhino Best Of Bish which contains the single mix of \\"On And On\\" and the superior movie version of \\"Separate Lives.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Stephen Bishop","review":"The CD is a great collection of Stephen Bishop's work. It includes several of his love songs as well as some of his famous movie sound track songs like Animal House. The songs on the CD brings out alot of old memories without the old scratching of teh original LP Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash + Clash = Waco","review":"This is the CD that started it all. \\"To The Last Dead Cowboy,\\" the Waco Brother's first CD, set a standard that has been hard to match. In fact only \\"Cowboy In Flames,\\" their third disk, matches this CD's energy and spirit. The Waco's literally marry the country purity of legends like Johnny Cash with the tempo and attitude of bands like The Clash. This marriage of punk and country (an idea first envisioned by the likes of Jason and the Scorchers) as interpreted by lead Waco (and Mekon punker) Jon Langford and his band mates, ultimately produces great rock and roll that transcends musical categorization. This is the album that established the Waco Brothers as the standard bearers of insurgent country and has secured them a place in the hearts of left-wing country punkers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"An excellent detailed study of the events leading up to the Black Prince's summer 1356 chevauchee, the first two months of the raid itself, the battle of Poitiers, and its aftermath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"My son is almost 3 and still uses these cups. They keep milk and yogurt cold and are easy for him to hold and drink from. We began using these cups before his first birthday because they are easier for him to drink from unlike the other \\"spill proof\\" cups with the valve. This made for an easier transition from bottle to cup. There are no valves to get clogged and replace. They do leak a little bit when turned over, but in the big scheme of things, it's not a huge deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea bad product","review":"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and an really disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference utility","review":"This reference set provides the reader with a complete guide to the controls used in each of the 5 programming languages.

The vocals are mediocre, the riffs are recycled, and the lyrics are, at best, moderately clever. Even the enthusiasm seems second-hand -- I felt like they were constantly nudging me to tell me what a good time they were having. Their proletarian posturing isn't quite as good as Bruce Springsteen's, but if you like John Mellencamp, there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night of the Hunter","review":"The Film is sensational! My 13 year old daughter LOVES this film. We watch it every time it airs. The contrast between the tough loving Lillian Gish and the schizophrenic Robert Mitchum make this film very entertaining. It is simplistic in the symbolisms but terrifying in the manner it is presented. My children cheer for Gish when she shoots at the psychotic Mitchum. And they have never forgotten the eerie way Mitchum sings his call to the \\"children\\". They remember the movie by that sing-song call. It is such a delight to see my children watch and \\"old\\" black and white movie with such involvement. It is truly a classic and I wish it had been nominated for an award. The performances of all involved should be applauded. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.....If Only","review":"Criterion has done a beautiful job with this classic. Flawless in every respect. Great supplements. My only complaint, and maybe he was unavailable, is why Billy Chapin, the star of the film is not included in the commentary?

Other than that, Criterion has outdone itself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Review","review":"One of the best, haunting, psychodramas I've ever seen.

I'm limiting my review to the 2+ hour \\"treasure trove\\" of outtakes, alternate takes and deleted scenes on Disc 2 as this is what interested me the most. Yes, you do get 2+ hours of fascinating scenes featuring the background voice of the director as he leads his actors through the scenes. The extra footage is presented in the same order as they appear (or sometimes don't appear) in the movie. I don't want to spoil anything for so I won't go into detail but trust me, you will not be disappointed by this extraordinary bonus feature unlike you've ever seen in any other DVD release (as least that I'm aware of)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy & crappy.","review":"I adore Robert Mitchum and I do not disagree with much that has been written here, but the religion was laid on with a trowel.

But I did almost condone his brutal slaying of Shelley Winters after her prayerful speechifyin' while laying down to sleep. And Peter Graves was comically stiff in his brief moment of \\"where to hide all this dough?\\" - in the way he answers his own questions instantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could It Possibly Have Been A Success?","review":"Night of the Hunter was Charles Laughton's attempt to elevate himself from actor to AUTEUR while at the same time getting on a film set with Bob Mitchum.In so doing, the faded, ill-humored, child-hating British star made other predictable moves:Turned direction of the childrens' scenes over to others because he lacked interest in them;Attached Lillian Gish as a stamp of respectability on the tawdry mess;Attempted to prove himself artistically and intellectually superior to young American Orson Welles in his startlingly transparent imitation of Citizen Kane's visual and allegorical qualities;Broke the rule about writing what you know;Substituted garish cliches for passion;Held his subjects and audience in utter contempt.Fifty years later, reviewers still don't have the guts to kick this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!

Awe-inspiring. Beautiful. Haunting. Terrifying. Unforgettable.If you are passionate about movies, you will love this immortal diamond. From start to finish it is bliss to watch. Mitchum, with his relentless pursuit of the children, is the stuff of nightmares. Every time he appears you will be chilled. As with Psycho, to shoot this movie in black and white was a masterstroke. Who can ever forget the eerie silhouette of Mitchum on his horse moving across the horizon, his song (\\"Leaning, leaning...\\") lilting across the fields to the children in the barn? Or Lillian Gish rocking on her porch seat with a shotgun? Or the radiant Shelley Winters in the car at the bottom of the lake, like the dead Simon in the novel Lord of the Flies?If I could, I would give it 10 stars. A must buy. Don't miss it for the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD cuts out half the movie","review":"This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and by chopping off the sides to make it fit the TV screen, the producers of this DVD have deleted the power of some *very* striking images.

It has the rare ability of holding my attention from the very start to the ending credits.Robert Mitchum is at his best in this one, and for the most part, the acting is quite good from all the cast. Some people might take off points for some of the low key sets, but they are not getting the whole idea of the film. The use of shadows and symbolism in this movie, is what makes it so amazing, it gives you the idea of what is going on, and your own imagination does the rest, much like watching arsenic and old lace, or the original Haunting. I don't want to say too much about the plot because it is the type of movie that you enjoy much more if you go into it with an unspoiled expectation. I will say this though, it is a good example of how people can be led into accepting terrible things into their lives, and also how the good in some peoples hearts can triumph over evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow... now THAT was a SCARY movie!","review":"I mean, I remember other really scary 50's movies (1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers; I rest my case), but this movie... wow. I just watched it on DVD last month and could not believe what I was seeing... Two scenes that still stick in my mind (and probably will permanently) are when the two children are in the basement and Robert Mitchum is walking downstairs... and the climax of that scene: oh, my God. Then there is the scene when he was chasing the kids in the river & he tripped and fell... again the climax of that scene was SOOOOOOOOO freakin' scary! I could not believe what I was seeing! This movie sure was a big deal in 1954--Charles Laughton never made another movie after this (I think) because it was so damn scary and out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives modern horror a run for its money.","review":"Without the blood, gore, screams and contraptions of modern horror flicks, Night of the Hunter can scare you to death, and creep you out. Robert Mitchum cornered the market on creepy in this film, and his double-life in the movie will leave you itching for the truth to come out. A talented cast, including the little ones, make the film all the more interesting. The black and white film is perfect for the dark mood set in this thriller that was definitely ahead of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"still one of my favorites","review":"I first saw this movie back in the early 60's when I was in high school. It riveted me then and still does every time I see it. I highly recommend this stark and fascinating look at dementia in the form of \\"love\\" and \\"hate\\".

It was so blindly touted by so many reviews...this could be one of the most over-rated movies ever. The acting is inconsistent and amatuerish and was embarrassing to watch. Robert Mitchum, an otherwise excellent actor goes over the top here and often parodies himself. Lilian Gish should have not come out of retirement. Shelly Winters is her usual watery mess. The children are so wooden, you can make a coffee table out of them. The editing, the continuity, the music...everything is a jumbled mess.

Now, each movie is flawed to some extent because of the time in which it was made, witness Birth of a Nation--no one really, except for the blacks who couldn't afford to go to movies--really understood those white hoods.

Don't believe it! This movie is just plain awful. One of the worst things I've ever poured down my eyehole. The writing has all the subtlety of a Jimmy Swaggart sermon. The plot is ridiculous from first to last. But what makes it nails-to-chalkboard offensive is the acting. The acting, the acting, oh the agony of the acting! It would have to rise a few levels just to be bad. You might have to watch the movie just to believe how awful it really is. But it will take you days to wash the stain from your soul. You may even swear off movies altogether.

Therefore, the unnecessary blurb at the beginning of the film about \\"formatting to fit your TV screen\\" would refer to a barely noticeable adjustment to a ratio of 1.33:1. In fact, the large majority of DVDs slightly crop the standard theatrical aspect ratio of 1.37:1 (including those for most films released before the mid-1950s) to the 1.33:1 TV ratio.

I actually think I like it a little more than you do. Despite my pretensions at being an amateur film historian, I can't remember ever hearing of this.

It's certainly the scariest movie I've seen in about 15 years or so, despite being around 40 years old. I had to keep stopping it because I simply couldn't take the suspense. What's new to me about this movie was that you were admiring the lyrical photography all the while scared out of your wits.\\"The reason I give it four stars, though, is that Laughton seemed to drop the ball in the ending: I found nearly everybody's actions in the final act both disappointing and hard to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a story of love and hate...","review":"This film is fantastic, if you're familiar with it then you already know and if not you will soon find out.

His portrayal of a religious fanatic after some money was spot on, especially the part where he uses the words \\"love\\" and \\"hate\\" on his fingers as an example of the battles between good and evil. Robert Mitchum made Harry Powell a man most people would most likely hate, and he did a very good job at it. One of my favorite scenes from the entire movie is the river scene. The song makes it even better. I give this movie four stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unqualified masterpiece!","review":"A lyrical, dreamlike film about the battle between good and evil; between love and hate. Charles Laughton's only directorial effort in a masterpiece of world cinema. Beautifully filmed in black and white, this film unfolds like a dream. Robert Mitchum is chillingly brilliant as the psychopathic preacher who hunts down a pair of innocent children. This is one of my ten favorite movies of all time and it its infinitely better than most of the films on the AFI's top 100 list. If you love movies, see \\"Night of the Hunter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull and scary, it's Mitchum at his best (worst).","review":"This was one of those movies that I heard so much about I just had to see it. After seeing Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear I realized that he may very well be the most frightening villian you'll ever see.The movie is about a man, Ben Harper played by Peter Graves,who is condemmed to die and is in the same cell as Harry Powell (played by Mitchum). While in prison Powell learns of the cash Harper stole may still be around in his old home town. After Harpers death Powell, now dressed as a preacher, goes back to Harpers old town and marries Harpers widow (played be Shelly Winters).During the movie you never feel that Mitchum is anything other than a ruthless animal looking for money and prepared to kill anyone, including children, to get it.Mitchum proves that he is not just a great actor but also a very intense one. This may be his best and scariest role.P.S. Look for my review on Cape Fear both the original and the remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh, kateccheer?

The Night of the Hunter police are not going to beat down your door and throw you into a dungeon. You have every right not to like Night of the Hunter. And believe me, if you suspect that anyone thinks any less of you because of your dislike for Night of the Hunter, that's their problem, not yours. I hope this makes you feel better, and that you can pick up the pieces and move on. And I want to thank amazon.com for permitting me the opportunity to reach out to the Night of the Hunter-disliking community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediathrill version of Night of the Hunter","review":"I purchased \\"Night of the Hunter\\" from MediaThrill, a website selling films on Amazon.

A lot of this music is just the same old, same old, rehashed. The name is silly too, this should warn the consumer. These dancers are not bellydance superstars by any stretch of the imagination, just randomly picked by aproducers who are again unaware of the real bellydance and Arabic arts scene.

Ark 21 should stop making a farce out of Middle Eastern music with these wannabe American dancers who know nothing about choosing authentic belly dancing music. It is a detriment to the art. They should get real. Arabs do not support this mess. This CD does not represent Arabic belly dancing.

The author did not have children, did not have day care issues, had her credit cards and her bank account as a back up. Most, if not all, of the people she worked with and wrote about do not have this type of support. When she got a rash, she called her dermatologist - the working poor do not even have a doctor, let alone a dermatologist.The author set a time frame of one month per job, anybody who is in the desparate sitation described, would be held to that job for years. They would not have the luxury of simply walking away. Most people in this position end up working at entry level jobs for many, many years. They have to make sure that there is a paycheck so that at least some of the basic needs of life are met.While it does give a bit of insight into the lives of these workers, it falls short in painting the true picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the title suggests...","review":"I cannot help but notice a little more closely or tip a little more generously each time I have the opportunity to come across folks working on or close to minimum wage - yes, they are everywhere - ever since I began to read this book.

I am shocked by the poor living conditions and the amount of mental abuse suffered daily by these hardworking people. Of particular interest to me is E's commentary on the health and diet of these \\"working poor\\" and how poverty pushes them into, for example, unhealthy, fast-food dominated eating habits that the public generally deplores and characterizes as slovenly and irresponsible.

First off, her approach is hardly scientific. In fact, she quit the experiment whenever she became sick of the work. To make matters worse, all that we have here is socialist propaganda. Ehrenreich quotes Marx and Mao more than she makes mention of welfare reform. She speaks of being \\"proletarianized\\" and of the evil \\"bourgeoisies\\", who is, according to her, anyone who can afford food, shelter, and clothing and will have a little left in the pocket book. Little does she realize that in her real life, she would be considered bourgeoisies. If I were you, I'd be mindful of the communist revolution, that, according to Ehrenreich, seems to be on the horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"In a previous reveiw of this book it was written, \\"Anyone who is curious about why poor people can't stop being poor should read this book.\\"Typical of the sort that should read this garbage and consider themselves \\"enlightened\\" as to the difficulties millions of Americans face.Buy the book, throw it onto the passenger seat of your Ford Expedition, and read it while waiting for Brittany or Blake to finish soccer practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and get this from the library","review":"Perhaps if Ms Ehrenreich had actually lived the life of a minimum wage worker this might be an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist propaganda at it's very best.","review":"This book is pure liberal propaganda. I was forced to buy this socialist pamplet by my like minded public university. Unless you are being forced to purchase this book by the University of North Carolina or some other educational institution avoid this book like the plague unless you are a dyed in the world socialist looking for justification to violate individual rights in the name of equality.

My son had to read this for summer reading so I decided to take a look. I could barely keep my eyes open, let alone if I was a 17 year old. Author is too focused on making sure the reader knows she has a vast vocabulary and, to add insult to injury, each incredibly long chapter is exactly the same as the next. Absolutely horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and well written","review":"The myth that hard work will bring success is very ingrained in Americans. It is used to allay our guilt about widespread poverty in our country. That myth is challenged by Barbara Ehrenreich in this excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"Anybody with half a functioning brain will understand her journey and the courage it takes to leave a secure position in society to report about the disgraceful disparity between the rich and poor in the United States. And for those who believe that having a heart for those who cannot defend themselves both economically and intellectually is a \\"left\\" position, then being part of the right should require a human rights investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitation of the Poor for Personal Gain.","review":"Brilliant, really. One could sum the novel up as such:\\"I thought there was a shortage of employment oppurtunities in poverty-stricken areas, or at least there was an under-circulation of wealth. So I, a college-trained writer with an ample income, will move into areas where jobs, low-rent housing, and money are all scarce and soak up resources, denying the portion given to me to someone who really needs it. Then, when all's said and done, I'll write a novel that exploits the poor and treats them like children, unable to help themselves at all, so that I can publish a national bestseller. Further, I'll make the brunt of my statement in the last chapter, where I agitate for violent revolution in a trite, forced, sledgehammer-message sort of way.\\"Other than that, glorious novel. Really exquisite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite at Best, Insulting at Worst","review":"Shame on those of who think that the book is good or poignant. Ehrenreich's book is neither insightful, nor well written. As with much that is praised by public radio, this book is disappointing.If middle and upper class Americans haven't figured out that a blue collar existence isn't idyllic, then it reveals their blind callousness.On the other hand, this type of book makes the poor seem like some exotic zoo animal or nature study that can be viewed as armchair entertainment. Obviously the working poor know their own condition and don't need it told to them in a book by Ehrenreich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. She was oddly condescending to the people she worked with and her research methods were sloppy. She made the book sound like it was this scientific experiment but it wasn't. For those of you who are not familiar with the book, she goes undercover to work in low-wage jobs to see if anyone can really live on it. She only works in the jobs for a month so you wonder how much she really learned and she always had the option of leaving and returning to her \\"real life\\" which, none of these other women she worked along sides did.It was poorly written too, for someone who boasts that she writes for the New York Times occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"response to review by JD from Boston MA","review":"JD from Boston MA posted on February 26th reviews this book as being insightful into the underpaid working class, but was badly written. I agree with JD that it was insightful piece of work, but I disagree about the writing style. I thought the style of writing was targeted towards the middle/upper class because they are the ones that can afford the money and time it takes to read this book. So I thought the writing style was great and appropriate for the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking","review":"How can a book on poverty be so entertaining? Though mostly sobering, I found myself laughing at points in this book. It is written in an interesting and, at times, humorous way. I learned alot from this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to broaden their understanding of the working poor in America. I happen to go to Wal-Mart today and found myself smiling and trying to be pleasant with every employee I saw. I made a special effort to put everything I looked at back in its proper place.Although, I appreciate the efforts of the author to understand the plight of those in our country struggling to get by on $6-$8/hour, I don't think the experiences of the author can even begin to compare to the real dispair and lack of hope that these people face. Unlike the author, they don't have a great job waiting for them on the horizon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Book","review":"Nickel and Dimed is interesting and entertaining. The book gives a look into the pink collar ghetto without being condescending or preachy. It is also an easy read while keeping the reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO new New's","review":"This book was interesting, but not till the end of the book. The first part of the book was really hard for me to understand Barbara because she came off so arrogant. For me Nickel and Dimed wasn't new information, for me or anyone I know. My life was worse than what she was writing about because I had to pay my next months rent. I didn't have the option to just get up and decide it was time for me to move to the next town cause I was tired of dealing with the reality of life. Barbara on the other hand had that option and she had her back up money, that the working poor don't have. It wasn't till the end of the book that she didn't come off ssooo arrogant. Barbara had a really good idea about doing the study to see if she could live on the pay of a minimum wage job. I didn't really care for how she went about her study, but the book wasn't that bad I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is very funny, with a lot of heart.","review":"What most reviewers haven't mentioned is that the book is often laugh-out-loud funny, especially when she works at WalMart. The author, an independent writer and academic, takes a fresh and bemused look infantalizing rules that employees of corporate America take for granted. Her stories reminded me of david Sedaris', because they're so real and affecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a bunch of proganda crap","review":"This book is so skewed it makes me want to throw up. The author is a communist with an agenda that is straight out of a science fiction novel. Can't pay the high rent? Try getting a roommate genius? She lives three places for three months and can't make it? Just starting out on your own the first month is always the hardest, if she would have toughed it out maybe she could have found a better job, ooops that would have meant she had to pass a urine test, I apologize that the US aint Amsterdam lady, but employers should have the right to know if they're hiring a crack addict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed...","review":"I was not very impressed with this book. I found the author not authenticly caring about the people that she worked with. She did not get into their lives more than very superficially and really examine how they made ends meet. It was my opinion that she actually looked on her co-workers with disdain through the entire project. She made some efforts, like with the maid service employee, but after reading the story I felt that it was all for show. When you are really surviving in the world you do not stick your neck out normally - you do what you have to do to survive and help your family survive. The story just was not detailed enough in regards to specific living strategies and the other personalities that are really living the life. I just felt the author did not and could not connect with anyone to really understand.Just my opinion.Kate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Also negative towards Christians.

She decides to attempt to live the life of a minimum wage worker in three different mid-sized cities.Barely getting by, even with special \\"perks\\" and \\"rewards\\" she gives herself, as well as aided by the fact that she starts off with no kids or medical problems, she shows the reader that it truly is practically impossible to live decently as a minimum wage worker in the U.S. today.While at times it is terribly depressing to face the reality, she also manages to inject several moments of humor and irony into what could have been a rather dull field report.A must-read for any U.S. citizen. and an eye-opener for anyone who has ever seen a homeless person on the street and thought..\\"oh, get a job!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in the Chump Change Lane","review":"I give \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" 5 stars because it's a great read, though it can be be variously interpreted, depending on one's perspective. Actually what fascinated me personally was the apparent shocking awakening the author herself had upon experiencing life among the working class. I wouldn't have thought that her education had protected her so much; most people I know have worked their share of horses*** jobs at one time or another regardless of their credentials. But then, maybe the circles I travel in make me naive in another sense. In any case, it's a safe bet that Ehrenreich's enlightenment from her experience has been humbling, and renewed her gratitude for her 'real' station in life.This personal odyssey of infiltration into low-wage America will teach something to everyone, regardless of background, and do so with much humor, as opposed to reading tedious and dry statistics. Consequently \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" is easily recommended reading for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"nickel and dimed worth every penny","review":"this book was in great shape and the fast shipping made this transaction pleasant"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Book","review":"This book opened my eyes to so many things I didn't know. It has convinced me that our would is in need of some kind of huge social change. I felt so sorry for each struggling person that Ehrenreich met along her journey, but also angry at our very unfair world. I think that everyone should read this book and discover for themselves the truth and pain of low-wage America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, badly implemented. A book of gripes...","review":"This book was recommended and looked good in the reviews. It even started out well, but after you are around a third in the book you start wondering when where the actual 'meat' of the book is going to start. It doesn't. Instead, you learn several things about the author. The author: (1) is quite jealous of people that are successful in any way, (2) seriously hates Christians, and (3) enjoys crude humor about body functions and obscene language.The obscene language gets worse and worse as to book progresses. You gradually learn that the author isn't really trying to learn anything about the people or jobs. She spends most of her time griping about how hard the work, mixing in crude ways of insulting workers of many types.My conclusion? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor: and this is why:","review":"I usually love books in this vein, but not this one. This author decides to take a break from writing to work at very crappy places. Sounds inticing, but when you read it- you don't discover ANYTHING. She does not reveal anything that is shocking, or give you anything that made you say; \\"Wow, I didn't know that!\\" At times this book was very boring. A page on what cleaning supplies she used and what surface they were applied. Through most of the book I was asking myself- \\"Why am I reading this? I am not learning a damn thing!\\"Another thing that I thought was poor was how she had to tell about her religious beliefs, whih could have clearly been left out. If you are a Christian, you may be somehat offended at times. Overall, a very forgetable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but check it out from the library.","review":"I found this book at the library and had to read it. I enjoyed reading at my job that would have fit into this book. It made me look at my work in a new light and I was glad to have my job which was better than the ones she was working when writing the book. I read it as more of an inside look at how things work than seeing if she could make it.By the way, I would never buy the book, that's why we have libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful book","review":"Like another reviewer, I agree that this is NOT the definitive treatise on the problems of the working poor but it takes a slice of the situation and analyzes it very well.We live well at the expense of others.That is a sobering thought. Moreover (though Ehrenreich doesn't go there at all) we do it not only at the expense of our fellow Americans but also global family members as well.On a day when I had more time, it would be entertaining to read all of the one-star reviewers. Those reviewers will tell you more about themselves than the book. (I want to simultaneously apologize for that grossly biased remark, but many of those folks were unwilling to minutely face the costs attached to their life style and who pays).A thoughtful but quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight","review":"This book, though skewed by the author's self-imposed restrictions and her financial and health starting points, offers good insight into what it is like to live as a minimum wage worker.

She is not grounded in reality. Sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept. Awful Author","review":"The concept of this book is really good, but the way the author goes about it is all wrong. This book is not enlightening at all because the author focuses on herself instead of the people who really have to make do on minimum wage. The footnotes in this book are good and the only reason I would even give this book 1 star. How anyone could read this book and not get the vibe that the author is self important is beyond me. What a waste of a great opportunity on the author's part to really explore the lives of the individuals she came into contact with on her journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give this book negative stars if I could","review":"This book is so full of whining liberalism that it unnerves me to think that it would ever be considered for use in a classroom. The author criticizes everyone but herself. She berates her coworkers, her employers, companies, capitalism, those who have risen above poverty, and nearly everything else. I think she will be very happy in an increasingly socialist USA. She would only be pleased if everyone ( except her) were to be in the same depressed condition she puts the reader.Working in a free clinic I see many people who have been dealt a bad hand with health problems and unforseen tragedies and I have empathy for them. On the other hand, I see those who make terrible life choices yet do not recognize that as the cause of their misery. This author seems to see things in black and white, good and evil. This book and this author give the reader a real case of nausea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Predictable","review":"This was a book club selection and I thought is would be a good read.Well, it was a fast read, however......The lady had a template all prepared and wrote her story to fit it.(Several of us wondered if most of it was even true.) The employers are mostly rich, heartless, greedy ogres and the people they hire are mostly honest, hard working people who are poor through no fault of their own.Taking up for the thief was really over the top. (Is stealing OK if there is a \\"good\\" excuse? Who decides what a \\"good\\" excuse is?)Her smug disdain for the literary collection of one of the clients of the maid service, says more about her than the jacket of her book.The left in this country love to give away the money earned by others.I wonder if Ehrenreich gave any of her proceeds to the poor people who populated her book. I would bet not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only A Beginning","review":"Working for $7.00 per hour or minimum wage was never meant to sustain a middle income lifestyle. Minimum wage is a start, but the most important thing to do is to obtain a formal education. If you are smart and poor and can prove yourself academically, you can get a scholarship. Take one step at a time and you will climb. We live in America -- don't ever think you have to settle for $7.00 per hour. The author exposes problems within our society, but there have been problems since the colonial era and will continue to be problems. As long as we are progressing as a country, the bar will be raised higher and higher for individual achievement. Americans should get off their laurels.Freedom is not free!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dimed out","review":"I belong to a book club and we found this book quite unnerving. Nine women belong to the book club--some of whom are republicans, democrats, career women, homemakers, moms, etc. We were all in complete agreement in our hate for this book. One person even rated the book a \\"0\\" on the scale of 1 to 5. This book certainly got us fired up! We found the author very self-serving and at the same time very condescending. In our opinion, the author was snooty, judgmental, and definitely not politically correct!

May be for top 5%","review":"After extensive study and field investigation, Barbara Ehrenreich came to a conclusion that the lower 95% of the population have always known: Starting from scratch aint easy.

Buy it on the cheap if you must read..either that, or I'll GIVE you my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for undertaking the project","review":"Dr. Ehrenreich took on a courageous project. Bravo for her chutzpah! She provided a much needed viewpoint on the other side of the economic boom at the end of 1999 to 2000. The book was a fascinating read about where the low-wage service employees reside.While she examined the life of the working poor and her own reaction to such a life very honestly, I disagree with her interpretations. For someone who is trained in the sciences, the statistics and studies she quoted to support her theories lacked rigor. I was very disappointed in the lack of reliable endnotes or bibliography.While we empathize with the currently inflated housing prices and the shortage of affordable housing, we disagree with her simple generalization that the wealthy oppress the poor. Such old-school socialist dogma fail to address all the complexities contributing to the economic divide between rich and poor. In addition, unionizing low-wage employees will NOT solve all their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Flaw","review":"The main issue I took with this book was that Ehrenreich refused to try to get any higher paying job that required a drug test, because she wasn't willing to give up on recreational marijuana smoking. She even tries to justify that this is acceptable, because many of the working poor escape into drugs. When she finally does try to get a job a Wal-Mart she researches how to beat the drug test. I can't feel sorry for someone who wants to break the law. Ehrenreich doesn't spend too much time delving into ways to see how people can escape from poverty on their own; all she offers is the utopian idea of a heightened minimum wage. People do escape poverty by attending school, they go to community colleges, they get grants and scholarships. People up to their 30's can join the military and learn job skills and money for school. Ehrenreich never gives these ideas any thought, because it would apparently be better to smoke up and get a handout from the government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewed Appreciation","review":"After reading this book, I have a new appreciation of the blessing of a stable address, food in the refrigerator, and the ability to close a door and enter a space that allows privacy without fear of interruption. Ms. Ehrenreich has made it impossible to ever walk into a mega-mart store again and see the employees as faceless servants or to dismiss them as under achievers. Although her political sentiments sometimes lead to some naive and biased conclusions, this is a work that changed my perceptions and for that I thank her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but what a tough crowd some of you [...]are","review":"I read this surprisingly light-on-its feet little book in two sittings. Though I was often charmed by the author's candor, and even more often delighted by her humor, I must admit I was rarely surprised by her discoveries. Nevertheless, hers was a courageous odyssey by any measure. More important, she draws attention to the elephant in the living room that is poverty in America. Yes, as some reviewers have written, it's an \\"old story\\". But so old that it doesn't still need to be told? Forget it. Does it cry out for a new way of telling it? Absolutely, and that's what the author has done, in a vibrant, compelling way. Look, this book's Newsweek review was one of the rare instances when the poor even rated a mention in that magazine. I honestly wonder what people who call this an \\"old story\\" were expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"She thinks Amy Tan is high literature (and other unintended laughs)","review":"I couldn't stand this book. Here's an especially telling passage where she is describing the clothing sold in WalMart:\\" ... sexless Russ and Bobbie Brooks lines, seemingly aimed at pudgy fourth-grade teachers with important barbeques to attend.\\"Oh, nice, trashing educators! Education is the KEY to avoiding the desperate lives being described. And as to her PhD, if she's so smart why is she using illegal drugs AT ALL, especially when a drug test is in her future? Dummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I feel generous giving this book two stars, and I only do so because I think the underlying idea behind the book has some merit. Unfortunately, the author's attempt ultimately fails miserably because she brings all of her own baggage and biases into her reporting, which I think ultimately clouds her conclusions and results in a book full of whining and complaints. While there's no doubt that life for the working poor is difficult, I've worked quite a few low wage jobs and known many people who did also. I never saw anything close to the attitude of helplessness that the author pushes in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is an outstanding look at one woman's foray into low-wage work - a healthy, white woman without children in tow. This book should be required reading for lawmakers - actually, lawmakers should have to try to live on low wage work by themselves for a month, and see if they make it! (Especially those who were born into money - most of them just cannot relate to the struggles of the working class.) Oh, and to the reviewer who claimed that Barbara Ehrenreich used a racial slur - \\"niggardly\\" means stingy or cheap. It's not a racist term, stupid. Buy a dictionary. And her remark that Latinos \\"hog all the crap jobs and housing\\" was sarcasm. Really. What is wrong with some people?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real point of the book","review":"The real point of this book, missed by everyone, is that \\"if you work below your ability and live beyond your means, you won't succeed.\\"Ms. Ehrenreich does everything but realize this obvious life lesson, including making up wild conspiracy theories about corporations. The book has been used to help justify increasing the minimum wage. As if forcing companies to fire thousands of workers to make up for the inflated wages of others would help anything.She did decide to work below her ability, and live a relatively extravagant lifestyle for the meager value of the work. She even failed to do what someone has to do when they are faced with such situations, such as cut living expenses by finding other roommates.Yes, if you decide to be lazy and greedy and work below your ability and live beyond your means, things will be tough. But that is your choice. Take responsbility, and don't blame others for your shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"A lousy book by a snobbish, undignified, drug abusing author.

What a phony."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please","review":"Just want to mention that millions of people work every day, and do so voluntarily to pay their own way, not because they were \\"forced off of welfare\\" [sic]. Why is it not legitimate for a society to ask its citizens to support themselves by working whenever possible? Pardon me for thinking that the women this author wrote about would not appreciate her pretending to be one of them, and then high-tailing it back to the NYC literati. Oh, and by the way I'm a single mother who worked my way off of welfare, started out at low paying jobs and now make a great living. It can happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A look from the bottom?????","review":"A look from the bottom?????I worked my way up from bagging groceries, washing floors and washing bottles. I worked in big box, and fast food and I escaped. I worked real hard, got educated and eventually got a good job. Each job helped me get the next job. That is the american story.I think the authour too an unrealistic approach to this, and this make the book useless. She is not doing the things she needs to do to escape.But what can you expect from a book that refers to Jesus Christ as a \\"wine-guzzling vagrant and precocious socialist.\\" The authour is really uneducated if she belives this. Maybe her failures in life have more to do withe her attitude about the creator of the universe than our country.He attitude and lack of morals can when she identifies with the thief and becomes defensive of him. even though he was caught red-handed stealing from the storehouse. Honesty and integrity go a long way and those that lack them can be stuck at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEBUNKED by Stossel and Shepherd","review":"Just see John Stossel's interview with Adam Shepherd in 20/20's \\"Bailouts & Bull****.\\" His own book, called \\"Scratch Beginnings: Me, $25 and the Search for the American Dream\\" seems to expose Ehrenreich for the defeatist hack she apparently is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of 10 dollars","review":"Barbara Ehrenreich's story of her experience of living as a minimum wage worker is an example of terrible writing/investigating. The intelligence she showed forth was small. She knew she had a limited supply of money but she didn't spend it well. She was biased in her views towards many people including blacks, Latinos and her coworkers. She constantly quit jobs and obviously wasn't able to become accustomed to the \\"minimum wage lifestyle\\". You don't have to life a terrible life if you are paid poorly, and you definitely can't live a life of luxury, but you can live fairly comfortably. It seems as though she did it all to simply sell a book and make money. Overall, Nickel and Dimed was a terrible and biased account of people that have to live their lives as a minimum wage worker."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Author Has No Work Ethic","review":"This book is a scham. Barbara has no work ethic, chooses poorly, and gave herself no chance at success.A guy named Adan Shepard wrote a book called Scratch Beginnings and he basically did the same thing. With a good attitude, hard work, and a little bit of good decision making he excelled where Barbara failed.It just goes to show you how far some hard work and perseverance will go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the nightmare that is the future","review":"... A few of the people that Ehrenreich introduces us to in this book understand that they are mere cogs in an impersonal,inhuman machine but of course they haven't a clue what to do about it.And here is where the problem with the book lies:Ehrenreich is too soft and wishy washy and wants to play nice with the vampires who are actively seeking to suck the blood out of humanity. ... One very good point of the book is that it points out that Conservatives are most often the ones who preach the gospel of money as the be all and end all of life and civilization itself,then are amazed that our nation grows more selfish,nihilistic,ugly,disconnected and amoral. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Read","review":"For anyone who did not have to struggle through a minimum wage job as an adult, this book is for you. Way too many Americans think people can survive on minimum wage. This will humble that opinion and identify your misconceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"This is essentially a modern remake of 'Down and Out in Paris and London'. I was quite interested in the subject, but the author always wrote in a detached me-vs-them tone that I found distracting. It was also frusterating how easily she gave up, or would not go to the depths that normal wage-earners have to go to... effectively limiting the scope of the book. It is, however, interesting enough to make it a worthwhile read overall..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social awareness","review":"This is the first social awareness book I've read in 10 years.

Her descriptions of how demoralizing it is to be treatedlike a non-entity by wealthy people were more interesting,however, she seems to have really missed the point, because itwas clear throughout the book that she truly considered hercoworkers beneath her. She even considered her identity as\\"Barb\\" at Walmart to be an inferior person to \\"Barbara\\" - hermore affluent self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Economy For Many","review":"This book is absolutely truthful when describing the dilemma of many; the minimum wage is not even close to being a living wage. The author describes what life was like for her when she was researching this book and tried to survive on the minimum wage. Anyone who thinks workers are lazy or selfish, unintelligent or less human than people with wealth, really ought to have to read this book to understand how the working poor live. It's a very tough life and she portrays it like it is. I found this to be an excellent book, especially in these tough economic times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Read, but Not Enough","review":"While I found the subject matter and the attempt at the \\"investigative experiment\\" quite interesting, I was disappointed that there was not enough of an effort to actually get into the lives of her coworkers. I would have preferred less statistical quotations about the working poor, and more of a personal account by more in-depth interviews and exploration of personal histories and life experiences. While an account of the author's attempts to provide a living for herself on her limited income was thought-provoking, it lacked the sense of realism that the description of her coworkers and other acquaintances along the way could have provided. I am not sorry that I read the book; I am just sorry that I didn't wait for the paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Far Cry from Better Work","review":"Read \\"Working\\" by Studs Terkel.Barbara Ehrenreich's journalistic method is biased and flawed, her intentions are good but this subject is wasted on her talents and approach. Barbara's too-late realization of what it's like to work a minimum wage job is what fostered her spewing of a laundry list of complaints with little or no advice on how to alter the system she abhors. For someone who doesn't know how to do her homework, one would have expected Barbara to have worked more of these jobs before she was 18, and I know plenty of 18-year-olds who know how to yammer better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Check: it's not really that bad.","review":"I disagree with the findings of this book. I'm poor. I started off working at 7.20 per hour at the job I have now. I opted to live with roommates to save money, rather than live alone as Erenreich does. I worked really hard, asked for raises and now I make 10.85. I live quite comfortably, I have enough money to go to school and go out. This book essentially says that America is a bad place to live. This is far from the truth.

My high wage employers also demand drug testing and a couple of them have finger printed me, too.She sprouts the usual liberal party line about raising the minimum wage because people can't live on it. She complains that rents were out of reach for a minimum wage earner in the cities she lived in. Well then why didn't she move to an area where the rental market was more in line with the wages? Or why didn't she try to get a roommate?

Anyone who has worked a low wage job knows it is not easy to get along, but Ehrenreich seems to have written this book to make herself feel better about being wealthy, to gain some redemption for herself by experiencing what it is like to make a living on minimum wage. I carried this book with me throughout my business travels, and actually felt embarrased to be carrying it or leaving it in my hotel room. Pick another book.

She wanted to see how the \\"little person\\" gets by in minimum wage jobs. It seemed that all the worker bees she encountered were hard working, big hearted individuals foisted into an unrewarding and unfulfilling life. All the \\"bosses\\" were brutish and loutish as well as bigoted and unfair. Her book could serve as the preamble for the Communist Manifesto. This book was neither valuable nor illuminating. Her husband by the works as a union organizer, need I say more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book was like working in a low wage job","review":"The book was dull, repetative and gross. It lacked any reasonable insight or commentary. Sure, it is a slice of life, but it comes to all the wrong conclusions. Like most people of her ideology, she thinks distribution of wealth, government intervention and unions would go a long way to solving most problems. She fails to consider that government is limited in its largess by taxation. Taking from one pocket to put in another is a zero sum game. And redistribution only goes so far.The idea that the working poor are self sacrificial is just nonsense. They don't \\"give and give.\\" They, like everyone else, get paid as much as they can get. I am not callous to the plight of the working poor. An expansion of the earned income tax credit may be a good idea. But unions and socialism are no solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Leaning Titillation","review":"While there are many legitimate issues regarding working poor, this author completely ignores the personal responsibility of many people for making bad decisions and the consequences of those decisions. This book is nearly pure Marist drivel, all poor are the result of being taken advantage of by others. Nothing is said about people who make no effort whatsoever to learn a skill or take a chance. Given the many opportunities available in this country and the author's deliberate refusal to discuss these issues, the book is a waste but will be loved by the far left."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder they don't succeed","review":"The author takes a series of menial jobs which she works at halfheartedly along with others who do the same.

However, there was just too much of things like off-hand Marx quotations and terminology, fantasizing about poisoning a client because his/her house contained conservative books (p109), etc. Pure venom, occasionally related to the surrounding content of the book, spewed at ordinary middle-class Americans.If you like the New York Times editorial page, you'll probably just skim right past this stuff. If you are looking for a serious book about the plight of america's poor, skip this one. There must be something better out there than this. The factual content isn't worth wading through the vitriol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author repeatedly cannot believe that no cares when she \\"reveals\\" she has a PHD.","review":"I really wanted to like this book, novel concept, should have paid off.

Along with her constant references to how lean, fit, and strong she is, was her constant elitist demeanor. Instead of describing the people she worked with she described what is was like for her. When I finished I thought that the thesis was more pointed to how a wealthy women lives on minmum wage for a month.If anyone wants to see a more interesting protrayal of life on minimum wage I suggest watching the first episode of 30 days. I know its a movie but its really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This is a most disappointing book especially when compared to the investigative \\"workplace\\" journalism provided by German author Guenter Wallraff.

Ehrenreich seemed to get off of topic even though her book was supposed to be on low-wage jobs and the working poor in America. There were many times when Ehrenreich used racism, criticism, and an overall rudeness towards the people involved in her project. The footnotes were really good, but Ehrenreich should have focused all of her attention on her project. Though, her writing was very descriptive, she made herself seem very contradictive and very unpleasant at times. I do not believe that Ehrenreich was very informative when referring to the main topic of her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"The Simple Life,\\" except serious","review":"This book reminds me of \\"The Simple Life,\\" with a PhD-educated scholar who belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America and who was voted Humanist of the Year instead of a spoiled socialite. It's essentially the same thing. If you like hearing a spoiled brat griping about having to eat convenience store food instead of the homemade lentil soup that she's used to, or if you like hearing rants about people who don't tip, this is the book for you. If you're looking for intellectual insight, it's not.As an entertaining read that can be devoured in a couple of hours, I give this book 5 stars. As a sociopolitical statement and work of undercover journalism, which it's technically supposed to be, I give it one. Averaged together and rounded off, that gives us two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be Required Reading!","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone graduating from high school in America, so they know what's in store for them if they don't have the right background, right connections, or right skin color/ethnicity. No wonder the conservatives hate it. It tells them the truth about the world outside their gated communities and the lives about those that serve them, and they don't want to hear about it because it spoils their fun. Most of all, I wish Dick Cheney would sit George W Bush on his lap and read this book to him every night as a bedtime story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea - poorly written","review":"Our bookclub did not like this book. Her first 2 experiences are an eye opener and some of her remarks are funny. But by her third experience it becomes boring. Nobody understood the need for her to explain her drug problems, which did not add any value to the book.She each time jumps in a job for a month and questions her colleagues. How can you tell what it is really like when you just pretend for a monthI also felt her evaluation was adding more statistical numbers without giving a way forward. The conclusion of her book is that when you are poor life stinks and there is not much you can do to help it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my Nickel and Dime","review":"Waste of time.

Poor execution and shabby insights by the author. The only insight is that cleaning services are not so clean. I guess this insight pays for the book, but otherwise a waste of time....and frustrating read.Try it yourself, but don't buy it..it's a waste of money.Donate the several dollars to charity...a much better investment in humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reality","review":"Like other reviewers, the author had resources to fall back on and she knew it was temporary and could quit at anytime. I was disappointed in this book mainly because I thought it would be more about stories of the people she met while working in minimum wage jobs. It was mostly about her and what she had to do to make ends meets, etc. I would have liked to read about REAL people who do this day in and day out with no end in sight. How do they manage to get up and do it all over again each day, knowing they'll never get ahead, never get a promotion, never make a decent living? I could never quite get into the author's shoes or feel any sympathy for her knowing she was playing a role and \\"pretending\\" to live like the other half. This is a good idea for a book, but needed to be written from the perspective of the low-wage workers...like interviews with them? How they perceive their jobs, how the future looks to them, how THEY manage to stay afloat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Boring","review":"No real insights here. This book seemed like such a good premise and that there was so much potential for insights and commentary on a social experiment, but I was left feeling like I wasted time reading it and was so disappointed it did not measure up. Here is all you need to know about this book- it is hard to be poor and being poor is hard. Physically demanding labor is hard and often not compensated with enough $$. Don't bother with this one, put your money to buying a sandwich and thank the person that made it for you with a smile and some kind words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work That Won't Pay for Housing","review":"Hopefully someone will leave a copy of this book in the office of every \\"Big Box\\" executive. Working two jobs and still not being able to afford decent housing is inexcusable in this country which is overflowing with excess. Barbara Ehrenreich's experiences were authentic for the time she worked the three jobs and provided a window to truths the \\"powers that be \\" choose to ignore. Life should not be so hard, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wake up call","review":"This book is an excellent look into the working poor in America. We follow the author as she tries to survive on the basic wage, her story and expieriences give light to Americans who media, and the wealthy try to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed. While her idea was very interesting, I agree with many readers about her condescending attitude, both towards the poor and the wealthy. She made sure to always remind us that she was not one of \\"them\\". Halfway through the book it seemed her only agenda was to write an expose on Merry Maids and Wal Mart, and not about living on mimimum wage. Instead of being a book about how hard people struggle to successfully survive on low wages, she made it seem as if her co-workers were lost souls who had no direction or goals in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"poor\\" excuse for a social experiment","review":"Seriously this book is garbage. This woman is very obviously only playing house she has no idea what it is to be poor or struggling she certainly doesn't have the mindset to survive as an unskilled worker. She always had her real life to fall back on and I'm sure she exaggerated on more than a couple of things. I can get khaki pants at goodwill for less than $7 bucks to start work at Wal-Mart and have them nicely ironed as if they were new not an issue she just spent money where she didn't have. This woman is simply used to the high life and being pampered she has no right to try and act as if she has any idea what it's like. And this was just supporting her self, real women out there have to do this with children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Invisible Americans","review":"I found Nickel and Dimed to be a good book. I read it for my ESL class and it helped me to improve my vocaburaly even though it was so hard at the beginning. It was amazing to realize how some Americans being Americans - as Barbara said in Nickel and Dimed - being white, English speakers, struggle in their own land with an unreasonable economic system. Barbara shows very well how poor workers are unable to live with their wages. The working class experience incredible and some times inhuman circumstances just to survive. Nickel and Dimed shows some of the terrible working conditions, and the result of them in most of those workers. It shows also how the same system is designed - in my opinion - not to help and assist these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Book","review":"This book is a waste of everyones time.

It is quite shocking that a grown well educated women seems surprised that she has little money left the day before pay-day, or that her back hurts when she has worked as a cleaning lady for ten hours.She is jealos of the people she work for, because they earn 2 dollars more an hour.In general this book is a boring tragedy of a women who really hates to work, and loves to complain. Get a life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Paid A Quarter For This Book Used","review":"It is worth more like a nickel or a dime. Unless you enjoy dark-minded griping and the glorification of cursing a lot. This book could have been something great, but the author clearly believes she is way smarter than everyone else. The Dipper despises elitism and it is everywhere in this book and in those who insist I am too dumb or mean to not see it their way. Tough times can build character unless some pandering ivory tower type insists that that is too hard. Someone clearly has a god complex, but despises God. Sounds like daddy-issues to me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"exploitation at its worst","review":"This is a horrible book. She obviously knew what she wanted to say beforehand and did the 'research' because she had to. She goes into the situations with half a heart and is completely unwilling to see them through until the end. She is basically taking advantage of the situation of people struggling to survive in order to get a best seller based on her reputation and her publishing company's ability to advertise. Read The Working Poor instead. It gives a much better anaylsis of the situation and is built on years of research and relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Turn","review":"This work was selected to be a community read. Barbara Ehrenreich's adoption of an unassuming disguise provides her readers with a dramatic portrayal of minimal income low level jobs. Ehrenreich's investigative approach is to be commended. But it remains to be seen if readers take Ehrenreich's frustration and then do something to cure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title of the book","review":"The name of the book is Nickel and Dimed: On (not) Getting by in America, it is supposed to be about the work experience of the \\"working poor\\" and how it effects their living habits. So when people sarcastically said all she proved was that the working poor have it tough, they are right because that was the point. She wanted to expose just how much they work and deal with compared to us. The book was not meant to be an emotional story of their family life it was a story of their WORK life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for corporate VIPs","review":"I just finished Nickel and Dimed, and found it fascinating, often hilarious yet mostly heart-wrenching reading, and I learned a lot from it. I couldn't believe Wal-Mart - charging employees $1 for the privilege of wearing jeans to work on casual Fridays. With over 800,000 employees, that must be a great source of easy profit for them!This book opens your eyes to the plight of the working poor - and the author was healthy, had no kids to think about, and the knowledge that this was a temporary situation for her. I applaud her courage in undertaking this experiment. She's educated a great many people, and every corporate executive should be required to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it is...","review":"I used to work jobs like these, and it scared me enough to get me back to college. The author's done a marvelous job of giving us those behind-the-scenes things that many people may not realize. This book does a lot to explain why customer service leaves so much to be desired. It's amazing what people are expected to do for $5.00 per hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book was a waste of my time. The time she spent working on this book gave her BARELY a superficial knowledge of what it is like to live on or below minimum wage. She started out with a chunk of money to help her through hard times and constantly dipped into it yet acting like she had to work hard every hour to earn it all back. Sure, her back hurt a little and she may have been \\"offended\\" by drug tests, but it is not even remotely a taste of what it is like to work 2 jobs and not have a house to go home too. She wanted to go rescue her co-workers from low paying jobs, but she worked and spoke with the mindset of a well off White woman who is in these situations only temporarily. I doubt she came back to her real life and stopped hiring maids or even fought her change. Poor book, her experience was quite superficial and I am surprised so many people liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Paranoid, But A Great Expose","review":"I don't agree with everything Ehrenreich says in this book--Maids are made to scrub floors on their hands and knees so they will be \\"anally accessible\\"? Oh please!--but nevertheless it is a true-to-life portrait of real life at the bottom of America's economic ladder. I especially enjoyed Ehrenreich's very strong anti-drug testing stance, though I disagree with her opinion that \\"living wage\\" laws are a solution to the problems she uncovers in this book. Even if you, like me, don't agree with all of Ehrenreich's politics, this book will open your eyes and encourage dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can learn about people you usually overlook","review":"Ever since I read this book I look at waiters, maids, clerks in stores and supermarkets with a totally different eye.We (the more or less affluent ones with good jobs) tend to take these people as granted and sometimes don't even treat them as human beings anymore, just as machines who have a useful function.I never was unpolite or tried to save on the tips, but because of Ehrenreich's book I make sure to treat the people that \\"serve\\" me with extra respect and give them very good tips.So I can say, that reading the book definetely made a difference in my life. My wish would be that many people get a chance to read it and in my opinion it should be required reading in our high schools.Update September 2011:Wouldn't you know, the Austin/TX school district added this book to required reading for high schools!Thanks to me (just kidding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the read but not your time","review":"I did in fact read this book in one sitting. And much to my \\"surprise\\" i found the author to be very snotty and felt that she fell VERY short of what she was trying to find out. In the beginning of the book I couldn't decide if I should keep reading or stop dead in my tracks. Nonetheless I continued with it. In some parts I questioned this woman's authority to be saying she had to eat and have housing to make it, I don't think anyone told her that she doesn't always have to have a table to dine at or food on it for that matter. And was she racist or was it just me? I tried to understand when she first started saying weird things, telling myself that \\"she needs to do it so we could better understand the book\\" but after two comments I wanted to throw-up on her. The only reason i would recommend this book to anyone is if they 1. were a housekeeper at anytime, which i was and found parts of this book funny. and 2. if you already hate wal*mart"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just flip to the end...","review":"As entertaining as the book sounds and can be at times, I advise you for the sake of valued and limited time to flip to the end entitled, Evaluation.

Now that's success."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea not well done","review":"I wanted to read the book from the time I saw the cover -- a good premise and a unique (these days) approach to the matter.The book is indeed a good quick read -- if you skip the preachy Evaluation part. The story that is told, though, belongs to the author and her adventures -- not that of the people she works with and for. The other folks in the story are not well-developed and come across as one-dimensional or as caricatures.If you're looking for insight into a way of life that you didn't have to bear by some good fortune, you'll have to go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"She hit a nerve, that's communication....duh......","review":"Before I learned here why I should have hated this book, I loved it and only wished it was longer. Barabara didn't write this book to be literature, figure it out, she wrote it because NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS STUFF ANYMORE AND NOBODY IS WRITING ABOUT IT OR READING ABOUT IT, they are too busy caring what celebrities are screwing other celebrities.I have lived in both worlds. One of the reviewers basically said, she should get a family or friends then high rent would not have been a problem. I have been through the roommate thing and would rather wander the streets than live with my family. Some families are not helpful and some people simply have no support system. I know. I was one. Men were my support system and I lived with some of them just to get by.She has courage and heart, and wrote her truth. Most importantly, she wrote a book that is readable about a subject that usually reads like an encyclopedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish this book","review":"I could not even finish this book even though it had potential. the author should of approached the subject in a Studs Terkel fashion with interviewing low wage earners instead of posing.Since when is the minimum wage supposed to be a \\"living wage?\\" minimum wage jobs are supposed to be stop gap jobs for high school and college students, immigrants. people in transition. i worked 2 low paying jobs nd put myself through trade school and have made over 6 figures a year for well over decade.Two things I learned about chronic low wage earners . One is that most of them have self esteem issues. Second, they will usually give you the shirt off their backs to help you. The nicest people I have ever met in life were strawberry pickers, farmworkers, maids, waitresses , etc.The name of the game is 'supply and demand' and always will be. It's not the big bad corporations as the author tries to make it seem.This book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the Effort of an Investigative Journalist.","review":"I read this book a few years ago for one of my classes in college.The idea: a woman would give up all of the privilege and comforts of life to investigate the impoverished masses of America. Sounds brilliant, except the execution and dedication Ehrenreich puts into the book is sickeningly low.In the beginning, she sets rules to safeguard herself from actual injury or any dangerous situation, but it turns into an easy cop out whenever Ehrenreich was presented with a situation that was unappealing to her, yet these situations would have vastly improved the read for the audience and improved our gained knowledge from her experience. It may be that I have an unpopular opinion of investigative journalism, but I feel like if you're going to commit to something like this you have to commit with a Hunter S. Thompson level of dedication.Bottom-line: Fantastic idea, but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and understand","review":"Another book explaining how we as a superpower are continuing to do a disservice to our own people. We can spend Billions on other countries to insure they have high-speed internet, but fight when it comes to guarnteeing medical for our children. It is not just that the system is not working... it is so far broken that it has been forgotten. How do we fix this?

Ya-a-w-w-w-w-n....","review":"A decent writing talent, but unfortunately just another elite class-warfare socialist, using the same hyperbolic vituperation, false assumptions, and questionable statistics that so befoul Das Kapital.She hates the rich because they are (while she deducts $20,000 a year from her tax returns for mortgage interest!). She disdains the middle-class - and tries to hide her disdain of the poor - because they are just too, too banal, doncha know, and lack her intellectual pretensions. This book could have been so much more than just another left-wing piece for massive government intervention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the roommates?","review":"No one can afford this type of rent solo on these kind of wages. I made this work with a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment and splitting up the expenses with roommates. The general premise behind this book is that people are entitled to live better than minimum wage will afford. I do not believe that people are entitled to any standard of living. People are certainly not entitled to a standard of living mandated or granted by the government and definitely not by taking the money earned by one person and giving to another person who earns less. People are only entitled to opportunity. There are millions of stories of people starting with nothing and achieving success in this country. There is no caste or group that you can be born to or join that will bar you from the highest rungs of success in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickel and Dimed","review":"This book will reveal just how difficult it is to live under the poverty level in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Barbara Ehrenreich may have a PHD in Biology, but she knows nothing about economics. Why not just raise the minimum wage to $100 per hour? Then everyone would be rich. The book is too much emotion and not enough reason. Anyone with an understanding of and respect for the free market system will see that this book is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Book, but WAY too condescending","review":"My family is not wealthy. In my life I have worked many of the same jobs that the author did (waitressing and wal-mart, to name a few). While I agree with the author's descriptions of the jobs themselves, and some of the conclusions she draws, I was mostly insulted by this book. I was not aware that I was so desperately \\"poor\\" and that I was such an object of pity, scorn, ridicule and amazement (as if the fact that I have a college degree, or actually read makes me something of a well-trained circus monkey). Basically, I was so insulted by the author's attitudes toward the people she was working with, that I had to force myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"This book was required summer reading before my freshman year at the University of Missouri. I was appalled to find after the first chapter or so a political undertone of liberals masquerading as journalists yet again.Now I am a middle of the road individual, but my biggest pet peeve is when people are NOT UPFRONT with there intentions. It was the most hypocritical book I have ever read.She does her best to point out how hard it is to get by on minimum wage with minimal education. She stays in these personas long enough to learn about her coworkers and show us how hopeless it is. Our lives are what we make of them not our jobs or money-I certainly hope I can not be reduced to a $ sign. Maybe if she lays off the drugs long enough she will stop blaming society for our problems and realize that it boils down to individual responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickel and Dimed","review":"This book came to me in near perfect condition.

Then she began surmonizing and it went downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Damaging Book","review":"This is truly the most disheartening book I've ever read. Barbara Ehrenreich has killed the dreams of a lot of people by writing this book. I include myself here, because I spent over a year after reading this book with zero motivation, thinking why bother anyway, since the system is keeping me down.If you've read this book and feel discouraged, I recommend you pick up a copy of Think and Grow Rich (the book that helped me break out of the depressing mindset this book had me in).Ignore the noise of pessimists like Ehrenreich who try to tell you things are hopeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of paper","review":"It takes the author almost 200 pages to arrive at the conclusion that one cannot get by making only minimum wage. Thank you Mrs. Einstein. In fact, the only time she talks about anything resembling is in the evaluation section- that the system is flawed- the proleteriat is oppressed by the bourgeoisie, and that through the sacrifices of the poor, are the middle and rich able to live their lives cheaply. Ehrenreich's credibilty is hurt by the fact that she smoked pot while she was 'undercover'- well maybe she might have saved some more money is she hadn't blown it on drugs. All in all, a waste of time, read Marx instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A real eye opener.I am the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book; both interesting and informative","review":"This book is easy to read because the author tells her story of her experience with working in low paying jobs and trying to get by on such a low salary. It is a must read for anyone who wants a better understanding of the working poor people in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"read Theodore Dalrymple for another point of view","review":"I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could). The author is a snob who doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself. If they take their \\"menial\\" jobs seriously she looks down on them. She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement. For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the Basics","review":"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, written by Barbara Ehrenreich, is a well-written book. However, this book should only be used just for the basics to learn about those who work at low-paying jobs. This book does not cover the major and fastest growing of poor people, which is working single mothers who work at the low-paying jobs. Since the welfare reform of 1996 a lot of mothers are working at some of these low-paying jobs that Barbara Ehrenreich has based her research on. I wonder how those mothers get by. If Ehrenreich have done a section on that, then the readers who have gotten a more of a perspective on what is really going on. She could have based her research on interviews of single working mothers who have kids to support."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of bull","review":"I can't believe I read through the entire book. the only consolation was that I filled the sidebars with angry comments. the whole tone of this book was bitter and angry. SHE was angry to be poor not her workmates. THEY were rather happy with life and full of hope looking towards a better future. Those of you who read it and bought into it, I advise you to read it again. pay attention to the tone of the book. Observe who the author is, and what her outlook in life is like. then, imagine youself in the situation of these people she writes about. than think to yourself if you would be as angry as she is. I am sure you wouldn't if you are well adjusted.The whole book was a sream of ranting and raving: I just love the way she compares a husband to a dog at one point, and the way she talks about pubic hair in the shower. a real OPTIMIST I gotta say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending","review":"Barbara Ehrenreich seems to have gotten it all wrong. It appears as though she learned nothing on her journey. Not to mention the continuous use of classist and racist ideas. This book gets two thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book explains nothing about living poor!!","review":"Nickel and Dimed may be only 230 pages, but at times it feels like it will never end. Ehrenreich may be the most insulting and prejudiced person I have ever read. She manages to insult every sex, race, and social class. If you are in the mood for a wealthy woman's jaded views on life in the poor lane(yea, like a month is anything like real life), go ahead and pick this book up. If you are looking for actual information on how the poor survive, save yourself $13.00 because you won't find it in this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"preordained conclusions","review":"Perhaps this writer has never worked (thankfully her father did). She should not have bothered to waste her time experiencing the work force. Her conconclusions were all preordained although she claimed she was investigating her hypothesis. I'm sure she's planning to give the fortune she makes on this book to those unfortunates she has written about.(Perhaps George, the Czech she failed to defend on charges of stealing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't, don't, don't read this book","review":"I can only conclude that the author slept with the publisher, since I can't imagine why a rational person would publish such a total misfire. Great concept for a book, which is why I picked it up, but executed by an author who put very little effort into the project. It's all about her, and that's a problem in a first person account, because she's spoiled, lazy, vacuous and narcissistic. It's so hard to follow what is supposed to be the subject of this \\"expose\\" because the ratio of topical content to her whining is so low. SPARE YOURSELF. THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK. You will not even be able to finish this book, as you will end up furious that someone published it and wasted your time. I wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lived it.","review":"Babs worked at a few low wage jobs but she did so as a tourist. I worked as a janitor and a factory worker for years. I dont feel that she really knows anything. I would suggest instead Ben Hampers book Rivethead. I give her credit for looking into the subject, but come on. She is just another Harpers denizen who doesnt' know bupkis about the world if she cant write some nifty article about it. There is alot more to say about blue-collar America than Babara wants to fit in here cute little articles. Too bad. Try Ben Cheevers book. Hes' significantly less flippant, believe it or not. Thanks for nothing Babs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad in so many ways","review":"Basically this book is based on so many ill-conceived notions its scary. The authors approach is one of people making it rich by taking a minimum wage job but is then amazed how people that take the jobs don't do well. It ignores the idea that these are typically meant to be entry level jobs where people learn and advance through experience. It also talks how she went to a church. Wow, what a description. I'll bet Christian everywhere are wondering just what she based her \\"commentary\\" on since its certainly not from anything they read. She describes Jesus as a socialist etc and one wonders just what Jesus she's referring to. This book is so far from reality, that frankly one wonders how people make it to the end. It was painful to stick it out to the end. I could go into detail but this was so painful to read I don't want to have to re-live it. Avoid it, whatever you do DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"liberal barbie goes camping","review":"the overwelming impression I got from reading this book is that this upscale, phd'ed (as we are constantly reminded), neo-socialist reporter spent three months playing at being poorand we get a book ?3 suggestions for our erstwhile writer1) ancedotal evidence is not evidence, and gets tiresome2) personal spite is not a substitute for a lack of ANY facts3) nobody cares about your personal journeydon't waste your time, or money, on this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book.","review":"I had to get this book and read it for Comp 1 class but it is awful.The author basically complains the whole time through the book while she is trying to live as a low income person but she cheats constantly and still complains about it.

However, the way the author has written the book doesn't provide much more information than what we already know. The author did a half assed job in her experiment.

The two stars go to the last chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"one long article","review":"Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic.","review":"Even though I liked the concept of the book, I feel that there were many additional types of entry level jobs that she didn't consider.I worked in a warehouse distribution center for 6 years. People hired off of the street with no experience or even a mastery of the English language were paid $12.50 an hour to start. (And that was 3 years ago!)She also never attempted to use a temp agency - something that totally perplexed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics and sociology brought together and made real","review":"I first learned of Barbara Ehrenreich when, as an OB nurse and aspiring midwife, I read her seminal 'Witches, Midwives, and Nurses.' I've been a fan of her writing ever since, and 'Nickle and Dimed' doesn't disappoint. To do the research needed to write this book, trying to determine if one can live on the salary of an entry level minimum wage job, Ehrenreich decided to do what was necessary to REALLY find out: she would live the life herself. She worked as a waitress in Florida, a cleaning woman and nursing home aide in Maine, and an employee of Wal-Mart in Minnesota - - - and came up with the not-surprising result that she had to work two jobs, seven days a week, and still almost wound up in a homeless shelter.But the most enjoyable part of this totally bleak vision is Ehrenreich's inimitable writing style: sarcastic, outraged, funny, witty, and very, very liberal in her political outlook. She makes reading this expose a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting a Face on Those Who Do the Heavy Lifting","review":"In the late 1990's, Barbara Ehrenreich, a writer with a PhD in Biology went undercover to work minimum wage jobs: waitress, house cleaner, nursing home aide and retail person. Though the late 90's were years of prosperity in America, Erhenerich discovered that a minimum wage job allowed one barely to survive; and given a car repair or medical emergency, one quickly sank into debt out of which there was no easy path. For me the value her account lay in the descriptions of her fellow workers, the problems they shared, the difficulties they faced, and the kindnesses they extended to each other. Strangely, I was reminded of a long ago time, among Marines in Vietnam. The stories of people we almost never see, but who serve us every day, are given authenticity in this short collection of case studies. Against the backdrop of the current 2012 political debates, this is a timely book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If you are in the mood to get angry and emotional, this is the best book in the world to read. Not only does it make you go completely insane, it teaches you nothing. The author of this book, has no idea as to what she is saying--she is a total hypocrit. She really knows how to provoke emotions such as anger but unfortunately when she does, the hate is aimed towards her. The book teaches you nothing about the situation of poverty. Rather you learn about how the author has a PhD every five lines of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She sets up to fail","review":"Anyone can fail at something if they try. As Steven Malanga critiques in his book \\"The New New Left\\", Ehrenreich sets out to prove the thesis that you can't \\"make it\\" in America in an unskilled, entry-level job. However, as Malanga shows, Ehrenreich sets the experiment up to fail, and she doesn't stay on at any job long enough to gain any of the social support factors or promotions that might make the job sustainable. Hence, she goes into the experiment, with a view to forcing it to fail, so that she gets the results she wants. For example, people might start out at a low-end job, but then move up, develop social ties, get a second job, and end up far better than she portrays, because she refuses to do any of that. If entry-level jobs in the U.S. are so terrible, why do millions of people all over the world want to have those jobs ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it in the recycle bin","review":"I bought this book with two goals: 1)find good ideas to use in my volunteer work with working poor families or 2) to become a more informed voter on issues related to minimum wage-earners. The author did not make any suggestions for improving the issues we face with affordable housing and living-wage jobs. Instead, she used one anecdote after another to condemn the \\"wealthy\\" (defined as anyone who can shop for fun) for spending their money. The great evil in Ehrenreich's eyes is the fact that people spend money in industries like house cleaning or restaurants. Ehrenreich never considered that, if people stopped spending money on services, many jobs would be lost. Ehrenreich did the working poor a disservice. She got people who vote and volunteer to buy her book, but wasted their time with self-righteous indignation. I threw this book in the recycle bin rather than donating it to the library. Enough time had been wasted on it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal!","review":"An upperly bound liberal decides to see how the other half lives. She does this by living in three different cities for three months. Of course, she does this without sticking around, feeling this gives her a great and wonderful insight into the plight of the working poor.I wonder what would have happened if she had done things like getting a roommate, asking for community help, or even set her aim a little higher. For example, why didn't she take her experience at a diner and gone to a place where the tips were better? Or stick around and find out what happened after a month on the job, when she made friends with the customers and knew people? How would the experience been different if she hadn't gone to places known for their high cost of living?I currently live the life of the working poor and found very little in common with this woman. Of course, I'm getting education and plan to pull myself up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author short on real experience","review":"I truly thought this would be a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of how people try and live on minimum wage jobs. Instead it is a long rant by an obviously overprivileged writer who is offended that people actually take jobs cleaning other people's toilets. Rather than tell us HOW she gets by one low wages, she rages about the indignity of the jobs. Every day in America people go to work and bend over to load a dishwasher. For most, it's a job, not a an oppression by an Aristocratic government. The only social study going on here is how far removed someone well-educated and well-fed can be from working class society.

It is very powerful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"Barbara Ehrenreich took on several working class jobs to see how she would fare if she had no money, husband and no relatives to go to for help. She also made her fictional background pretty bleak with regards to work background and education.Just as I suspected it is nearly impossible to live any sort of life that most of us take for granted. A lot of it was pretty depressing when you think about the real people that live like that every day. Forget having any fun and be prepared to run yourself ragged if you find yourself in their shoes. It's no wonder so many people turn to drugs in that situation. It might be all you could look forward to.Despite being depressing, it was absolutely facinating. Go ahead and take a ride on the other side and be sure to thank God that you're not in their shoes when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"A noble idea, deeply flawed in implementation. Ehrenreich's analysis is superficial and her tone whiny. By the end of the book, you know a lot more about the author than about the challenges facing low-wage workers--and what you know is not particularly flattering. With a great deal of editing, this material might have made a good magazine article, but there's just not enough reporting or research for a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"I live in small town America and the people in this book are all around me.

However, I do believe that this story could be told better by someone who has actually lived the life of a minimum wage worker.

However, Ehrenreich's sanctimonious, condescending, self-satisfied writing does a disservice to the issue. Her tone was so self-righteous and smug that after 5-6 chapters I put down the book in disgust. Save your money. Borrow the book from the library if you feel that you really must attempt to read it and then brace yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I had to read this book for class...I found a very unaccurate potrayl of poverty, Ehrenreich only keeps jobs for a month, quits when the going gets tough, and does not fully emerse herself in a low-class society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life [disappoints] - The world according to Ehrenreich","review":"It is amazing to me that a person would spout such nonsense. As a person who has worked many low paying jobs, I can say with authority that the author's portrayal of life is dead wrong. We don't sit around and whine, we try to better ourselves and succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"Though Ms. Ehrenreich continuously mentions throughout the book that she holds a PhD, evidence of that fact in her intelligence and logic are surprisingly absent. She essentially goes on a half-hearted journey to work in the unskilled job market, ensuring she has plenty of extra money and advantages that others wouldn't have. It's easy to tell by her writing that Ms. Ehrenreich thinks quite highly of herself and her status in society - that without her the poor wouldn't be able to get out of their situation, though they have been surviving for years without her. She is self-righteous in her claims, even going so far as mocking Christians by attending a service, sitting smugly for only about half of it, and somehow asserting that the service proves her point. Overall, this book offers nothing more than an unsubstantiated liberal agenda with absolutely no academic fortitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"leftist rant","review":"This was a really great premise, but was scattered, shallow and turned quickly into a naive rant. This woman is out of touch with reality. It is a shame, as a true adventurer could do this and come out with a gem. She is an academic snob, who can't write in logical sequence, and should stick to her biology. Even her co-workers were not impressed!

This so called research project and its resulting insult is just about the most selfserving piece of work I have read in years. I'd call it complete dripple except that its too insulting to too many hard working people and the people who appreciate and even rely on them. This book actually does harm. Barb is either self-centered at best or an out and out bigot at worst and since she takes so many fortuitous pot shots I'm betting on the latter. Spreading ones condescension around does not make for fair play. And who let this stuff get out there? Where's the editorial staff? Shame on all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea that gets mired in leftist demagoguery","review":"The premise of this book is interesting and the author is reasonably successful at portraying the plight of the working poor. Unfortunately, the book degenerates into a lengthy and disingenuous leftist diatribe. This book would be much more persuasive if told from a more objective point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple Comment","review":"I think that Mrs. Ehrenreich has very little appreciation for the fact that our country's poor have as good a lifestyle as they do. I'm not saying it's easy to work a minimum-wage job and support a family, but perhaps the author could benefit from a comparison with a number of third world countries where the poor are not only literally starving, but also comprise a much larger percentage of the total population. No society has it perfect, but the United States is doing a DARN good job of providing a high standard of living for its citizens while also forwarding the previously unprecedented idea that anyone has the freedom and the capability to take it upon themselves to better their situation.In short, \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" was fine as a personal story, but it fails as social commentary. It would have greatly benefitted from a bit more perspective and a bit less agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Centered","review":"This book was not about how to make it by in America on an average wage, it was about how much the writer could inflate her ego. All the writer did was talk about herself and give social commentary (misguided at that). She goes into excrutiating detail about what she eats, what she packs, etc. Actually, in my viewpoint, Ms. Ehrenreich is making money on the backs of the poor with this book, exactly what she is disgusted about in the corporate world. I do not recommend this book unless you want to read a book that will completely agitate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Like a Pointless Exercise","review":"Maybe the author was well intentioned, but Nickel and Dimed was a real disappointment. I did not understand why she chose to live on the financial edge, unless it was, of course, just to get material for a book. She showed little compassion for the people she worked with and was never one of them. A certain smugness about her education and fall-back funds was always there. It was more stories about abused wives,abusive husbands, abused employees,surviving with no education,living in awful conditions with drugs and alcoholin the background. I think most Americans who can read know these things. If the book had had a point it might have been how the plight of the poor can be helped with education, stronger families, programs that help the poor help themselves. The book was a downer with no answers and no hope. The only positive thing I can imagine coming out of it is profit for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking class","review":"I was quite disappointed in it -- I guess I bought into all the \\"hype\\" that I had heard about it.

I was also impressed by the author's dedication to living the life of the poor.Half way through the book it became very evident this author had an agenda and contiuned to get her ideology in front of the facts. The book was very one dimensional failing to address how immigration is suppressing entry level wages, what impact education has and what choices these people made that put them in this situation.I found it ironic Ehrenreich rated herself a B+ employee when she was always bad mouthing the company and or supervisor and never gave the courtesy of notice of the jobs she left.I would suggest she writes her next book on being a business person who has invested their life savings in a business and is dependent on employee that fail to show up or have an attitude like our author."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" Here","review":"As a dedicated populist, I was looking forward to reading this book. I teach high school history and assign the Grapes of Wrath to all my AP US History students. I was looking for a book for the students to read to demonstrate how the poor live today.Instead, what I found was a book about Barbara Ehrenreich and her jobs. It was not about the people who hold those jobs. I do not want to know why she refused to hire a maid when she could afford one, I want to know why someone takes a job as a maid and how they live on those wages.It helped me truly appreciate the stark brilliance of Steinbeck and his ability to portray the reality of poor American people. It also demonstrates the distressing inability of the popular liberal media to understand or describe the reality of life for poor Americans.I agree with another reviewer -- read Studs Terkel. I would also would welcome other recommendations for short reading that I could assign to my class."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you didn't know by now...","review":"Ehrenreich doesn't claim to know answers as to how to combat the low-wage problem, but she sure describes her experience in a concise way. Obviously, average low paid workers are not in her position - they have other issues to dwell upon besides shelter and food. However, at the bare bones minimum, she gives it to us like it is - you need to use your imagination to add on kids, child support, drug problems, etc. Go wild and see what you come up with. She does not claim to offer solutions to the issue - as free thinkers, we need to brainstorm new ideas to fight, whether you are a middle class person, or a member of the under class. Her analysis of labor unions is right on - what has happened to them, anyway? They teeter on the fence if they are worth a damn these days, and on the other side when they aren't. Unions and their legacy of hard struggle for the common worker died many years ago. If anything, this should be a wake up call for loyal unionists everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and insightful!","review":"I found this book very interesting both in its topic and its approach.

Nor did I choose to question the authenticity of her experiment.This book simply made me more grateful for things I tend to take for granted and after I closed it, I found myself counting my blessings..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS READ","review":"While this work does have it's faults, they are few in number.The book draws attention to a very, very common and worrisome problem our country faces. The book is quite well written. Admittedly, the author is examining problems through eyes (hers) that cannot possibly, fully understand the plight her subjects face day after day, she nevertheless hits pretty close to the mark, all things considered. I do feel it would be good if she did some follow up at a later date. I would like to hear and read more.

When it arrived (in a very timely manner), I was elated! Following all of the instructions for connecting the thing to my desktop, I could never get it to work as advertised. Finally, it corrupted my host computer to the point that I could not get any sound at all from my desktop! Stienberg's Support Services were top notch in trying to assist me with this issue, but subsequently, the thing simply would not work, so I had to return it. I will now have to spend additional money to get the sound back on my desktop, something that I am not at all happy about having to do.

After about three months of moderate use it started acting up on me (such as disconnecting). These things continued to get worse with more time and after about it year it stopped working altogether. I will give it that the sound quality was fair and Cubase LE isn't a bad 'out of the box' recording program. Furthermore, the preamps leave something to be desired. I was able to get a few decent sounding recordings out of it while it lasted, but I could have spent my money much more effectively on another product. I would recommend something by PreSonus or M-Audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac users beware!","review":"Horrible support for the MAC, despite claims that it is compatible with 10.4 and above. The software reverb is VST not AU and will not install in 10.5. There is nowhere on the companies support page that even mentions the Mac version. All of the controls are on the hardware including routing and volume as well as live input mix. Routing is problematical and is made very unclear when in apps using the interface. Logic had no problems getting signal, but Guitar Rig 2 and 3 couldn't get signal no matter what I did (if I cant get it to work, I'm returning the unit.) Sound quality is adequate and I were only using Logic I would have scored it at 3 or 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality -WTF Lexicon???","review":"PROS- Low Price. Decent Mic preamps and converters. Pantheon Reverb is high quality. Good signal routing features.CONS- Cheap plastic casing. Limited applications - the Pantheon plug-in sounds good, but will ONLY WORK in the version of Cubase LE they ship - which is buggy. Big Letdown.Also, the USB installer is buggy. From time to time I get a \\"Found New Hardware' message and things stop working until I reboot to a previous configuration. HASSLE (sigh).You get what you pay for. I only purchased this because at the time the EMU1820m was out of stock.I've also got an Echo Layla interface (paid $700 new) from 1998 that still runs GREAT under WinXP, worth every penny.Now if the Layla from 1998 will run flawlessly on XP, and one released last year will not, it's obvious that the Lex was rushed into production, COMPROMISED all the way.The Lexicon Omega is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, didn't work","review":"I had problems getting this to work.

Do not expect it to capture that perfect 100th take of your next single when you finally get it after weeks and weeks of takes. This thing will happily glitch out, distory the audio, not record, or otherwise horribly botch even the simplest of recording tasks. I replaced this unit with a MOTU ultralite and am now much happier. The MOTU is somewhat smaller, but MUCH heavier, as it is constructed of metal. (The Omega seems to be made mostly of cheap injection molded plastic)I never could get this to work properly with my studio monitors or headphones either. I bought this for a mobile setup, and have no such problems with the Digidesign 003 mixer/interface I use at home, or the MOTU ultralite I ultimately purchased to replace this flakey incident-prone product.Do yourself a favor, you're better off with your computer's built in sound card than this device.

However, it still did not work when they returned it to me. Now it is out of warranty. It definitely has defective craftsmanship.

After purchasing the Lexicon Omega the device would disconnect about 5 times a day and I would have no sound until I unplugged and replugged the USB/power in a specific order. Lexicon was very helpful and replaced the mainboard in a timely manner.Since then the sound quality has been slowly deteriorating to the point where I now have a constant hiss that continues to get louder. When I turn the level knob I get extremely loud hissing and popping around the 25% mark.

I keep trying to believe that there is something I could do with this unit. But I can't. It is cheaply built, it records badly, the drivers don't install right, Cubase LE is worthless, the Pantheon 'Verb is a joke (might be OK if you are doing some REALLY cheesy new age stuff, but even then it would be a thick wad of cheese fluff). There is nothing worth having in this package. Buy something else. Buy ANYTHING else. Buy a cheap hand held cassette recorder. At least you can record with it.

I've found the Omega to have a steep learning curve that requires some reading and experimenting, but the results are stunning when compared with analog tape machines or early entry digital devices. I've had to add some memory to my RAM and have upgraded my Cubase to a better version than LE-there always seems to be more to do or learn-but right now I'm having lots of fun with this machine and it hasn't failed me once.

Through sketches and musical numbers from a variety of sources, this CD captures the essence of Python. Where it fails however, is its use of live performances in place of the excellent original recordings. The live performance are filled with audience expectations, they know the punchline, the exquisite timing is lost amidst the guffaws. The slapdash sequencing is also a bit annoying, but it's still funnier than most things available.

It was sooo good and fun until those 2 instruments came in. The good news is that the Supertones at least lost one of their band member who played the horns (which made this album a lot better than lost one bleah). Otherwise this album is excellent and probably is going to be one of the biggest Christian albums of '99. The best song on this whole album was Away From You with Crystal Lewis. Other good songs were One Voice, In Between, and Old Friend. For you Ska lovers you'll hate this album. For you party animals and rock with horns in it lovers you love this album.

I've read other Star Wars novels that I wasn't particularly fond of, but this one I found to be particularly egregious. It was a whole lot of boring military strategy and bad characterizations. When Anakin started thinking that his shiny new mechanical arm was so nice that perhaps he should have his other arm replaced I stopped reading. I understand its my own personal taste, but I would prefer my Star Wars fiction to not read like a dramatization of historical battles. If I wanted that, I'd re-read Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anakin Skywalker's final days as a Padawan","review":"David Sherman did a good job in the writing of this book. The story line was lacking a little for me, but Mr. Sherman did a good job with bringing us into the complicated mind of Anakin.We get to see Anakin Skywalker in action without the assistance of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin is dispatched by the Jedi Council to the planet Praesitlyn along with Jedi Master Halcyon to defend against the Separatist force, which is led by Pors Tornith. This serves as Anakin's jedi trial to determine if he is ready/worthy to be called a Jedi Knight. He passes with flying colors.If I had my wish with this book we would have learned a little more about Master Halcyon and Pors Tornith. It would also have ended with Anakin being formally recognized as a Jedi Knight.This is a good read for die-hard Star Wars fans, however if you are only a casual reader there are much better Star Wars books for you to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish.","review":"I found this book spent more time on military tactics than characters.

Its so bad I think School teachers should consider including it in there cariculum. They could either use it as another way to punish their pupils or they could use this to show what defines a bad book. If I was to write a dictionay, next to the entry for \\"bad\\" I would put a picture of this book.The only way i could finish this book was thinking that something has to happen that is important but no not realy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst SW novel I've ever read.","review":"This book has no redeeming qualities about it, whatsoever.

I was sorely disappointed upon reading the book, however. It doesn't have the feel of other great Star Wars books and the authors are pretty poor writers in my opinion. The book is lacking much of a plot development and the dialogue and characters are both very wooden and lacking substance.While the book claims to be about Anakin, I found that I was let down by the abysmal portrayal of him through the book and it was fairly obvious that the authors weren't too familiar with the Star Wars saga and shouldn't have been invited into its wonderful expanded universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better","review":"The battles were very cool but everything else could have been better. I was dying to see Anakin's Jedi Trial. To see what exactly a real Jedi trial is. But we don't get to see it even thought its all Anakin talks about. Obi Wan is sent on a mission without Anakin so Anakin gets a new master temporarily in Jedi Halcyon. I was very interested in seeing how this played out. Anakin having a master who wasn't Obi Wan and one who was a lot like him. Considered a maverick or wild card of the Jedi. They have a lot in common including having a love one even though its against of the Jedi Order. They would have made for an interesting team and yet they weren't. They were more boring then I ever could have thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors not familiar with the SW universe","review":"Jedi Trial is the 15th or 16th Star Wars novel I've read/listened to, and I must be nearing the bottom of the barrel. Jedi Trial is written by two authors unfamiliar with the Star Wars universe, and it certainly shows. Anakin Skywalker's personality is totally at odds with anything previously (or since) written, and his part could have been played by any number of cardboard cutout Jedi. Equipment and weapons function in ways previously (or since) unknown. The authors are militaty tactical fiction writers, and they do a fine job wth the battle scenes... but the details they create don't fit with what readers know about the universe, and it's terribly distracting. Definately the WORST Star Wars novel I have read to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Book","review":"This was the worst Star Wars Book ever. I wanted Anakin to kill everyone. Nejaa Halycon was not nearly the Jedi I thought he should be because I have read so much of his grandson Corran Horn. This booked bored me. This was the one time I wanted the droids to win. Save your money, if you want to read it, get it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SW hardcover yet","review":"I don't normally take the time to critique the Star Wars books that I read (and I've pretty much read all of the Adult ones), but this one was so bad I had to speak up. As many of the other reviewers have said, the book is boring and poorly written (as if written for a child). If you like military stylings and Star Wars you might like this one. However, don't expect much compared with the majority of stellar SW fiction out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible,horrible,horrible","review":"I've read about 1 book every other day and have for the past ten years or so. With that in mind, saying this is the worst book I've ever read should be saying alot. I'm a huge star wars fan so I ussually like star wars books even if they aren't the best in the world, but there is no excuse for choppy, none fluid sentences. No excuse for flopping between past and present tense with every other verb. No excuse for such horrible dialog. I'd say shame on these two men for writing this. Shame on their editor for not catching all the gramatical errors that made the book feel so choppy. Shame on del ray and lucas books for allowing this to be published. Shame on the authors parents for encouraging them to be writers and shame on the authors' high school english teachers for passing them when they obviously know nothing about the langauge"},{"rating":"1","title":"It showed so much promise...","review":"How long have SW fans waited for a Halcyon novel? Too bad this one isn't it. Nejaa should have been a high point in the Clone Wars novels, and instead we're shown a foundering, outcast Jedi who can apparently only associate with a Padawan.The action in this book is not compelling; the strategies are basic at best; and some of the Expanded Universe knowledge is wrong. The authors imply, through Halcyon, that marrying among Jedi is rare, even for Corellians. However, the (much better) book I, Jedi states that Corellians were known for doing things differently, staying in their own planetary system (it took a galactic war to bring them out) and training their own padawans. Halcyon's placement as an outcast was a horrible mischaracterization and it ruined an already mediocre book.Cross your fingers for Stackpole to write a real Nejaa Halcyon novel. Don't bother with this one in the mean time; the bad characterizations and sloppy plotting will only dishearten you."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to fight a Galactic War for Dummies.","review":"With advance apologies to the authors of this book, I have to say this is the worst Star Wars novel out there. The attempt to bring the action in the Star Wars universe closer to reality by discussing at length what exactly the job of the quartermaster is is not only brain numbing, but useless to the \\"plot\\" of the book. If you do choose to endure the book simply to see how it ends as I did, you will be disappointed that all of that \\"how to fight a battle and win\\" knowledge that you trudged through turns into filler as Anakin does what he should have done about 150 pages before he actually does. I am sorry but the last time I checked Star Wars was a fantasy story where the main focus is the struggle between good and evil, not a documentary on how often a X-Wing needs an oil change in order to function properly. While their writing style may have it's place in stories that take place on Earth, it is not suited for a galaxy far far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"If by trial you mean the authors should be sued.","review":"This book is awful, I never thought I'd say that about a Star Wars book. I can't help it this book sucks. It is not gripping at all. It has too much description on the actual battle tactics going on in the story. I mean if I ever need to attack a forward position that is uphill with two divisions of troops while conducting a simlutanous air assault, I can thanks to Jedi trial. While some battle action is nessecary, to move the story along, This book felt like I was attending some military class at West Point. I was skimming through the book so I could skip the the tactics parts. Anakin character was very poorly developed. I could not recommend this book to even the most die hard Star Wars fan. I just hope Del Rey dosn't commission this duo to do another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most useful and comprehensive book on SQR","review":"Without a doubt this is THE best book on SQR.Though the coverage is comprehensive, I do wish however the authors had eleborated more on topics such as Dynamic query variables, array sorts, breaks and given more elaborate anaysis of the code with more examples on these chapters. At least a brief write up on other array sorting algorithms -insertion sort and Quick sort and their relative merits with examples would have been in order.

However, the main character and the baroque & over-the-top violence of the game and sex with a panoply of individuals who might be found in Joel Peter Witkin's photographs gets tiring, and Fabian always remains abstruse at best. If Kosinski desired to shock the polo world, he acheived it--see the other reviews by polo players below--and I do have to give him kudos for that, the image of the average upper-class WASP professional, or better yet macho South American, who bought the book based on polo content, reading the sex scenes does make me laugh. But in the end I'd recommend staying away from this book both from the perspective of a polo lover and Kosinski fan. There is a great novel to be written around polo, but this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polo anyone? Hardly","review":"As another commenter indicated, this book is written by someone who only wished he was a polo player. It's frighteningly inaccurate and I can't believe that one polo player in the world would agree with the presentations (or should I say misrepresentations) provided within the book. But to focus on the pathetic longings of a man who cannot even understand the rudimentary principles and practices of an elegant and beautiful sport that he wishes to focus his novel on is not even enough...no the content of the book is entirely jumbled with ridiculous sexual escapades merely placed in convenient intervals to titillate domesticated bookworms who may find men and women and transvestites and transsexuals sodomizing each other interesting. Fortunately I didn't buy this book and with the cold weather upon us I now have the kindling I need to start the Yule log--so thanks Jerzy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pashion Play? - I dont thnk so","review":"You ever read one of those books and get about a third of the way in and you say to yourself \\"what the...\\"?Well this is one of those books.In essence its about a rather sad individual who drives across the country in a horse box with his polo ponies.Now, anyone who plays polo and reads this book will read some of the descriptions with utter astonishment. The idea that you can stop your horsebox in a middle of a city car parking lot and practise on the tarmac is to anyone who knows about horses and or polo impossible.

I don't think I have ever spent a more boring 4 hours in all of my life. The limited geographic areas covered by the films, the inarticulate narrators, and the lack of stunning cinematography compel me to give this blu-ray 2 big thumbs down. I gave one star for just making the bloody film, and another star for effort, and the bargain basement price.

If an astronout gets so much as a hang nail, the program stops to insure that injury or death is essentially impossible (though the Challenger accident shows us to be a bit more humble: we simply don't know everything).

I tried this and was totally disappointed. It is nothing like wasabi; it is the anti-wasabi. I don't know how they get away with calling it wasabi. I threw it away (almost a full tube)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and excellent","review":"Another thing to keep in the fridge. Better than horseradish alone. It is hot and if one mixes a little of it in a cup of broth when having a cold, it helps you to expectorate!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I second the other \\"Terrible\\" review","review":"When I went to my local QFC in Seattle, I was pressed for time to get to a memorial function, so when I found they only had this product and no powdered wasabi, I gave it a try. I was bringing a smoked fish plate, and I wanted to make a wasabi mayonnaise to accompany the other usual sides for this appetizer.Interesting that the other \\"terrible\\" review said it tasted like it was blended with mayonnaise. Obviously, I WANTED it to taste like wasabi mayo, which I've made many times with excellent results, and why not? It's just wasabi and mayo!!!When I whipped this batch up at the function, it tasted excessively salty, almost like baking soda, which rendered it unservable. Lucky I had other condiments so no huge deal.I know I've used pre-made in the tube in the past, but this brand was truly awful. So, people, learn from my mistake: buy powder, add hot water, you're done-enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hon-Wasabi","review":"This wasabi-flavored product seems more horseradish than wasabi.

Not only does this album not do justice to the Metallica songs it attempts to recreate, but it's also nothing special as far as electronic music goes. This CD was probably envisioned to do something similar to the S&M album, which exploited the amazing qualities of two clashing musical genres; but it definitely fails to do that. On most of the tracks, the Metallica lyrics are not skillfully integrated into the techno beats, so the words sound just plain useless. Many of the tracks distort the songs so much that I could not even tell which song a track is trying to imitate without looking at the track listing. This is quite a poor album, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no no no","review":"This is the worst tribute to metallica I have ever heard. I am sorry to say this has nothing to do with metallica's music at all except for the lyrics and a poor try to combine matallica and electric music. I do not say that it should be impossible to do so, but it seems that it was so for those who tried to make this cd. If you will or cannot put an effort into a metallica project do not do it. This is not a way to honor a great metal band, it is a cheap way to try to ear some money on the behalf of good music.I do like both electric, and metal music but this is no way to express either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Just Horrible","review":"Those Bastards in this tribute cd don't even deserve to listen to the best metal band since Sabbath. The covers sound gay because it sounds nothing like the real thing. These covers are so stupid don't waste your time or your money, for crying outloud get real people that know Metallica,s Music. Good examples are Anthrax and Apocalyptica."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Our New Table","review":"We love this table! It is quite comfortable for sitting on as well as resting your legs/feet - resting our legs and feet was our reason for getting it. It looks great and is quality leather. The burgundy color goes well with our burgundy leather furniture - not the same exact color but has the same tones so it goes well. We were able to easily put three blankets (and probably could have doubled the blankets) along with magazines, etc inside when company came and still had plenty of room to spare. It was easy to attach the legs and they appear to be quite sturdy. We were pleasantly surprised as we were a little leary about buying a piece of leather furniture sight unseen. It was also a great price compared to what we were seeing in the local stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"They said it's quiet - and it IS quiet","review":"One of my main problems with excercise bikes of any kind is that they are just so noisy.

True, his side kicks have little or no attracting value and I personally wouldn't enjoy hanging with any of them.I think the writer, himself, got pretty fed up with the \\"full of hangups\\" four heroes and started to write the bad guys better; they were certainly more interesting and even redeeming in some ways.Unlike Story of Saiunkoku and other animes, I'm not waiting with bated breath for the english version sequel to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Nabori no ou","review":"I love this anime!Nabori no ou has the perfect blend of romance,with friendship and close to perfect action scenes.The only reason why it got 4 stars was because yoite's life story was so sad.I love the ending though.I won't tell you what happens at the end,because it would spoil to much.You should try out this anime series,it's a really good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"first timer","review":"never used these guys before, this will not be my last. i am impressed with the product i received, and give them two big thumbs up. promp in shipping. everything was faultless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"I simply love these headphones!

Since then I had it stolen (along with my car) and have bought the album a second time. I like acoustic guitars. I like well written lyrics. I like folky music. And even on the couple of songs where the guitar goes away, Jill's writing is enough to carry the song. And her voice is a very nice vehicle for delivery of those lyrics. She doesn't rock quite as hard as Jennifer Knapp can, but the comparison is fair and I can hear the similarity with Sheryl Crow on \\"Forget\\" and \\"Not the only One.\\" This album's strength rests in Jill's song writing and vocal skills.

The woman is far away in the picture but every time he looks at the picture the woman gets closer and closer. The next story is about a group that is down in the mines and they come across a woman in ice. One of the men goes crazy over the woman and says that he loves her. The last story is about a man that has a dream that he is in a dark alley and he sees a door and goes inside. There is a Fortune Teller that says that she will kill him at midnite.This is a really good old Chaney movie. If you like some of his other movies I think that you will like this one.

My wife and kids were just howling at various scenes ranging from the stinky lunch room to the slammy whammy infomercial. We must have replayed that slammy whammy infomercial over 20 times, proving how kids can appreciate well written comedy.

This is not a sincere attempt at establishing a serious dialogue, but a cheap caricature. Moreover, the author's own views are presented as though they reflect Catholic tradition. Instead, they reflect Catholic modernism, thinly veiled. I accept historical criticism and the legitimate gains made by modern scholars, but the view of Scripture in this book is much closer to liberal protestantism than to the Church's official teaching. Fundamentalism serves as a convenient surrogate for attacking the Church's own high view of inspiration and inerrancy. What a shame.

It reveals biological facts around sexuality that are astounding (and, for me, somewhat disconcerting).

Nevertheless, I feel that the book could have benefitted from their inclusion (perhaps in an appendix so that readability is not affected).Apart from this minor point, this book really opened my eyes and got me thinking ... and gave me great material for conversation with friends! A highly recommended read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I was hoping for something along the lines of \\"The Moral Animal.\\" This book cites no sources, too much fluff, and seems like just hypothesis.

It's based on the author's fantasy.Robin Baker is a mediocre scientist (at best) - he's even worse as a fantasy author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious science - buyer beware","review":"Just a warning to readers of this book. The favorable ratings and reviews fooled me into thinking this was established science and well respected in academia. It is not. While the hypotheses and stories are intriguing and entertaining, the science behind it has not held up in the past decade. People have not been able to replicate many of Robin Baker's findings, and the whole notion of \\"sperm wars\\" in humans seems to be false. For instance, under the microscope, the \\"kamikaze\\" sperm and \\"egg-getters\\" don't seem to exist. Combining two men's sperm doesn't increase mortality of the sperm either, dispelling the notion of \\"killer\\" sperm that don't attempt to find the egg. The fact that Robin Baker has left academia and now labels himself an \\"author\\" not a biologist should be telling. More recent work has provided a far more nuanced and less hyped version of sperm competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated Book Even Better than the First!","review":"This updated version of Baker's landmark book has provided readers with updated statistics, new research that further proves that attraction and passion has less to do with flowers and more to do with chemical reactions actually taking place within the body.Baker's research and analysis will give men pause, and realize how important it is to integrate the best of the 'bad boy' into the terrific, redeeming qualities of a great, confident man!I wish these books were out 10 years ago!- GiddyupGuy.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex is fun, this book . . . less so.","review":"This book is just really weirdly written. Each chapter begins with a little soft-core porn scenario - like something you'd find in a romance novel, only slightly less sexy. It's then followed by a fairly long explanation of what just occurred. Baker opened the book saying that she would try not to get too statistical and biological-sounding so as to not bore the crap out of us . . . but even without charts and tables, it's tough to get through. The sex scenes certainly appeal to the voyeur that lies deep within every sexual being, but the rest of the book is hardly worth it. When there are so many other books out there on this topic written so much better - more interestingly, with humor, whilst still being scientifically factual - Baker really dropped the ball on keeping her audience captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource-Brainstorming Tool","review":"While this book is dated 1987, and references to technology are a bit out of date, this book is a gem. I use it as a motivator to encourage me in the process of doing interviews, and preserving family history. He calls it a \\"Life History Interview\\" and gives you more examples of questions than you would ever want to use. But his questions to use, and his approach to the process, sensitivity to the narrator's aversion to the technology, are right on. This book will spark your own insights and get you moving to preserve your own histories.

They are like \\"greatest hits\\" albums, that often don't contain an artist's best songs. This book, however, captures the width and breadth of Quaker literature. Just as the Catholic tradition has wonderful liturgy (at its best) and Baptists contribute moving gospel hymns, the Quakers have a literary profile second to none. Editor Brent Bill captures the excellence of Quaker literature with a wide variety of authors. The pieces included are diverse, sometimes funny, often moving. And Bill provides introductions that are clear, precise and organized to highlight what the reader should notice in the works. Literature teachers should include this volume in their curriculums. Faith communities should pick this one up and read, discuss, and enjoy. The book is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quaker Reader Is Grateful for this Quaker Reader.","review":"In Spirit and Imagination, Brent Bill assembles a wide variety of contemporary Quaker writing, and does so superbly.

The wheel was flat on arrival, unfortunately we kept it and by the time I went to use it in the spring, it was flat again. It was too bad for us, and too late. I recommend sending back flat wheels as they are usually defective if they arrive like this. It rusted out the first summer of using it in my small gardens and this was not \\"industrial use\\" by anyones measurement. I don't feel this was a good value at all.

What I find very interesting was that many of the techniques employed by sales people or con artist that was used on me was discribed step by step in this book. Though I didn't fall for them back then, it was eye opening to see 'their' textbook on persuading you.Most of the information and studies in this book are quite old. But nonetheless it is still revelant today. This most fascinating part for me was how retail stores and supermarkets showcases their merchandise. Or how simply by putting a more expensive item next to the cheaper item will generate more sales on the cheaper item. Sounds simple, but it isn't, that is why companies spend so much money on marketing and research.More rational people will generally not fall for tricks illustrated in this book.

In Levine's superb book, he helps the reader arm him- or herself with knowledge of some of the strategies and tactics purveyors of all sorts of things - from consumer goods to salvation - use against those of us who assume we're walking into such situations evenly matched. As someone who has spent his career in corporate procurement (and who wrote his thesis on advertising) I can attest that Levine is spot on with his cautionary analyses. Read this book carefully and pass it along to others, especially the young who may not have built up their defenses against some of the tactics described herein. If nothing else, at least you will recognize what game is being played with you when it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Book for Marketers or Consumers","review":"Dr. Levine really did his homework and put together a great read for marketers and consumers.

It's filled with typos, incorrect answers, and just plain wrong information. For example, in explaining the rules for creating indexed views, \\"sp_dboption 'ANSI_NULLS', true\\" will not work. That's the incorrect syntax. The DB name must be included. Another problem I found that was extremely time-waisting are in answers which were calculation-based. For example, in the author's attempt to answer correctly regarding several questions about calculating the hard drive space and DB size requirements, he fails by providing wrong answers or answers based on different calculations not specified in the book.

He played with it for about an hour before it came crashing down on him. The reason for the collapse is because of the way the easel is constructed. Four little wooden dowels hold the tray in place. This tray keeps the easel in the upright \\"A\\" stance. However, a little pressure on the tray and the little wooden dowels break causing the tray to fall which then causes the easel to collapse. We took it back and bought the less expensive Crayola Double Easel. This product has large plastic arms that lock in place. The trays have nothing to do with the easel keeping it's stance.

Recorded, apparently, at Dave Edmunds Rockfield Studios, this offering fairly brims with atmosphere and drama. Robbie Blunt contributes some virtuoso guitar work in those banjo-like tones that work so well with these compositions.

There are two very good songs here in \\"Thru with the 2 Step\\" and the album's best song, \\"Big Log\\". In both of these songs the vocals, music, and emotion all mesh well together.

I used to listen to this album quite a bit back in the day but it just doesn't hold up well now days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best There Is","review":"Robert Plant continues to demonstrate why he is the best vocalist in rock history. His solo efforts are far removed from his Zeppelin material, yet the voice won't be mistaken. \\"The Principle of Moments\\" is Plant's second solo effort and further expands his songwriting capabilities in his post-Zep era. Robbie Blunt is also a very under-rated guitarist (also quite different style from Mr. Page). I played this album to death in high school, but it still sounds great almost 20 years later.

All three of his first solo albums are masterpieces of originality and musicianship-Where some would have been devastated by the tragedy of the loss of his friend and bandmate John Bonham, he rose from the flames with a strength that few have matched. Like many, as I listen to these first few solo albums, I can't help but wonder what Led Zeppelin would have accomplished had Bonham lived, but the point is moot-And what we got from Plant far exceeded anything you would expect from a man who's string of personal tragedies could have left him broken.

He wears a belt holster for his pistol and you can pose it in his fist or in the belt, however you choose. Many areas of the figure articulate, infact for the amount of detail it has more articulation than I would have supposed. The cape is flexible, to a point. The paint on Vincents face makes him look a little different than from the game or the movie, but it isnt really bad. I would recommend this figure highly, but especially only for teens and up.

But it has been a big disappointment. The book explains the concepts of OLE DB templates and the various macros, quite well. Lot of figures explaining the relationship between objects. But it is very much lacking on real usable examples. There is not a single complete example. Most examples are real simple. Inserts and Deletes get just one page each, hardly useful, and also the example used for these is with a CTable. How many people use a CTable for inserts and deletes? It is like saying \\"Delete/Update the first row in the database\\", which is hardly practical. There are about 30 OLE DB types, but no examples on how to use these. In summary, the book is better than the SDK documentation on OLE DB templates, but not much useful if you want to get into OLE DB programming quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good Book handling some advanced OLE DB topics.","review":"The coverage for basic OLE DB is not good in this book.

One can tell it was put into publication in a hurry without careful proofreading. Maybe the same thing can be said of tech books on the market in general these days. I own many Addison-Wesley books, but have to say this one is of a lower quality in comparison. Just the first 20 pages or so contain no less than half a dozen obvious errors - makes one wonder how trustworthy the rest of the book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost ok - READ THIS","review":"As you can see, there are not many books on the subject. However, this book contains very few code lines and it is not organized well. The fact that a programming book does not have even 1 (!) full example can't be good. You will get a fair amount of information from this book; however, YOU WILL visit MSDN regularly. The author spend time on known subjects like performance again and again (although that C++ programmers are well aware to this subject) and less to the whole concept of the templates. He is breaking up all the objects very well, but failing terribly in providing the whole system. A \\"nice to have\\" book as a second or third reference.

Brian's lyrics range from personal, to smart, to fun, to funny! Overall, Mondo Magneto is a ton of fun. It's one of those albums where you can find something new every time you play it and it just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern \\"true black metal\\"?","review":"definitely, the new millenium is the new rise of metal, and when we talk about black metal (pseudo most of all), there has been a lot of wonderful releases. But, there has been a problem, all the fusions the bands had done made them lose what black metal is all about (and for me is about evil atmosphere and skullcrushing madness), and satyricon is one of the few bands that progress a lot while sticking to their black metal roots volcano is no exception of that. the album has industrial influences while having its dark, speedy, and wild moments. Another thing that had labelled black metal is the production, and in that sense, volcano does the job on getting good production but not sounding over-produced (like dimmu borgir f.e) having the familiar foggy sound of old mayhem, emperor and darktrhone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new wave of black metal","review":"Satyricon always surprises me - they have no two similar albums, but all of them are masterpieces. I disagree with those former statements which claim that they do now 'pseudo-black metal', because they don't. Shadowthrone was really a piece of that (but also very good), but Volcano is rather on the line of RE. However, it is slower, and the importance in it is the dark atmosphere created by catchy, monotonous riffs.They're not really heavymetallish, I would call the style blackish extreme/dark metal. 'With Ravenous Hunger' is the most blackish track. Sometimes it's very strange, for ex. in Fuel For Hatred it's a little punkish, but it don't fear - it's also a genial track! My favourite is 'Repined Bastard Nation'. Maybe the only mistake is in the last track, which isn't so various to be 15 minutes long, so in the end becomes a very little boring. But, according to the general impression, it's a very strong, well-done album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britham's Destroying Angel: Being the Life, Confession and Startling Disclosure of the Notorious Bill Hickman, Danite Chief of U","review":"Basically simply the story of Bill Hickman in his own words.

I would recommend reading a companion book like Hiltons \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickman and the Mormon Frontier. It is good to get someone elses views based on their research.

It's by no means the most in-depth work on Daleks available, but its humorous presentation makes it unique. By no means a program guide, it divides its attention between identifying Dalek characteristics and providing pseudo-factual information on dealing with Daleks. Its premise is that the Daleks are real (and that Doctor Who was a documentary detailing the Doctor's actual adventures), and deals with the inconsistencies of Dalek history as incomplete histories and contradictory sources. A bit slow in the historical section, but overall quite amusing given its dry British humor. Probably for Doctor Who (or Dalek) fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry's Bakery Twists","review":"Great tasting treat!

I don't enjoy going to the gym and have quite the library of workout dvd's, trying to find one that will keep me interested long enough to want to continue with it everyday. Well, Mel B will keep you going. I found her funny and quite entertaining. Even though she is fit and educated in the exercises, I liked the fact that she's not a fitness expert. During some of the exercises she's complaining right along with me. Making me more relaxed.I, also, enjoyed her nutrition segment and found the scenery quite beautiful. I would recommend watching the dvd first because there were times when she would change exercises and the camera would be focusing on her face, so I would miss the first couple of reps."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"This dvd is awesome!!! I am a beginner, finally trying to get rid of the last of the baby weight and become more fit. I have tried different programs, but I have found that this is by far the BEST! The choreography is not complicated, the steps are very simple to follow so you won't get lost in the shuffle of the program. The dvd is set up so that you can choose at the beginning of the menu which exercises you want to do. This is fantastic, because the program runs almost seamlessly and you don't have to lose momentum by fast forwarding to the section you want. But most of all, Mel B is TERRIFIC! She is very engaging, funny, motivating and real (she doesn't hold back if something is tough, but she there with you to \\"pound it out!\\") She has the perfect personality to do workout videos - I hope she makes more!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I feel that you need to be \\"totally fit\\" in order to do this workout. Mel B gives no instruction on form and there is very little modification (one woman does not use \\"weights\\" during the arm section) to the exercises. Also, the exercises are done at a very fast pace and I'm not entirely sure that this is effective for anything other than the cardio sections. Advanced exercises may enjoy the fast pace but those looking for instruction and exercises that build upon each other should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first workout dvd","review":"This dvd is great if you get bored easily like me. The menu is Divided into Warm Up, Tums, Bums, Arms, Cardio, Advanced Cardio, Legs and the Cool Down. You can pick and choose what workouts to do and in what order. It flows very well, Mel B is very easy to listen to and at some points feels your pain.Like some of the other reviewers have said, she doesn't explain the work out so its a good idea to just sit and watch it first. Mel B also wears some really low cut shirts, which I thought was a little distracting at first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found the Warm up, the Cardio section and the \\"Total Body Workout Section\\" of this workout extremely boring. I can't stand the music at all and it seemed like the counts were off with the beat as if the music were added later. I agree with some of the other reviews that the camera work was really bad. Even though some of the moves are basic aerobics moves, it would help if there wasn't a close-up shot of her abs or something else when the moves are changing.The minute long exercises become very boring which makes it seem like an eternity for 1 minute.The only part of this DVD I'll be using will be the toning segments as add-ons to my workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate if you have children in the room","review":"I did like the workouts, but after doing it a few times I started realizing that a lot of the camera angles are focused on her chest, stomach, and between legs (I'm trying to put it nicely). I quickly began to feel uncomfortable putting this video on in front of my children because it's clear this is also meant to be used for adult \\"entertainment\\". I ended up throwing it in the trash. If you want something more family friendly, any of the jillian videos give a great workout and can be viewed by anyone in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"You can tell Mel B. is not a professional exercise instructor. This is just something all celebrities are taking on. This I will tell you, she does kick your butt in this dvd. It is very intense and you will feel the burn and lose weight. You just need to do this dvd (3) times a week. I am very please with this dvd. I was doing the insanity dvd with Shaun T and I have to tell you, I did the first month and it was very hard on my joints. I quit because I was starting to injure myself. I gave Totally Fit 5 stars because it gets the job done and Mel B. has a great sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This was actually a better workout than I expected.

Die-hard fans will probably prefer the more involved instrumentals and themes on the \\"House of Atreus\\" or \\"Marriage of Heaven and Hell\\" albums, but \\"Guardians of the Flame\\" is a great early effort. The interview with the band (track 14) offers some very interesting insights into the band's early life and their philosophy toward their music.

You need to read this biography to get the whole picture of his macho persona. Hem was absolutely devoted to his cats and dogs. The sentiment ran fine and deep. My only qualm with this book is in the quality of the black and white photographs. So many of them are blurry and the contrast of nearly all is downright poor. It makes me wonder if no one around him had a camera that could shoot decent pictures. Composition is generally good, but, man, you would think that some digital enhancement could have improved the lot. The 4-stars are for these faults alone. Otherwise, it is nice to have these selections from his family photo album. The text is always revealing and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intimate Portrait of Hemingway","review":"An intimate portrait of Hemingway 'the man' is painted by this book. With details to his domestic life and loves, female, feline and otherwise we glimpse the very human side of this prolific writer who profiled others so well. Regrettably, the quality of the photographs in this book are overall very poor, taking away from the well written text. For Hemingway aficionado's it's a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed my view of Hemingway","review":"I was excited to find this at the library as I have always heard Hemingway was a cat lover. Apparently his view of love was a lot diiferent than mine. I was very upset that his ignorance in cat care despite the fact that he often referred to a book on cat care. Most were never altered which is why there were so many. There were several sad stories of cats being found dead.I also found it disturbing that when he died, he made no provisions for his cats in Cuba. His last wife went to Cuba to settle his estate and justy left the cats to fend for themselves. I would have been happier thinking of him as a cat lover than reading this book and now thinking of him as an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, this album is stupid","review":"I consider myself a Christ follower, this kind of music however just doesn't seem God inspired to me.

At first, I just thought it was alright, but over time, the songs grew on me. I eventually ended up giving the cd to several people for Christmas.The songs may not be their original creations, but the group sings them well. The songs inspire me to think of God while I listen to them. The group has added interesting commentaries inbetween certain songs that add to the experience of listening to the cd. For example, before one of the songs, the band says, \\"The foundation of this country was built on the Word of God.\\"Overall, I would highly recommend this cd. It offers a great worship experience, and I would never get rid of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great worship CD with an awesome sound.","review":"BUY THIS CD!!!

And although this is a great worship CD, it doesn't have that \\"praise and worship\\" kind of sound that you normally associate with that kind of music.

I can honestly say that I exspected it to be awful. I was sure that the stories would be boring and completly impossible to read. Fortunatly, I was proven wrong very quickly. The uniqueness of each of the stories in this book is evidence of how differently people can experience their familys. As a college student I have recently moved out of my parents house and am experiencing a life without family for the first time. This book really made me appretiate them and all their quirks. The piece that touched me the most was Edwidge Danticat's \\"Papi\\". Being of Haitian desent myself I could recognize some things in her life that I had also experienced. This book was fascinating from cover to cover. I felt as if I got a glimpse into the most private aspects of the writers' hearts.

However, the Ship of adventure is great (5 stars).If you like these, I can recommend 1) The island, 2) the castle, 3) the valley, 4) the sea of adventure (listed in order of publication).One thing I did notice that was somewhat odd, is that the two boys in these adventures often boss the girls around, which everyone seems to find totally acceptable.

Sometimes we will go and read as many customer reviews and play the safe road. Other times we will go off and purchase things on a whim... Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. This is one of the cases where it was definitely a turn for the worst. I thought that seeing a couple artists on the album that I really enjoyed was hedging the bets a bit in my favor, but I couldn't be more wrong. The entire mix of music on either cd is disjointed, and uninspired. The song selection takes no chances and rides with the sappy \\"downtempo\\" stereotype of popular artists. The 'chilled' part is questionable when we start getting assaulted by clubland beats that seem to do exactly the opposite.

Even more fascinating is Dwan's inclusion of some of the legendary dirty material that didn't make it to air, material that wouldn't shock a minister nowadays and that almost always has the saving graces of comic wit and verbal inventiveness; in other words, Groucho wasn't just dirty (and indeed, as Dwan points out, he deplored what his NY accent called \\"terlet\\" jokes).The secret word is \\"Dwan,\\" and if you say it on Amazon, you'll get a fine and fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groucho made boring","review":"This book, while no doubt being historically accurate, manges to turn the life of one of our most colorful personalities into a complete bore.

A wee fey truck along with Beaton's usual delightful dialogue, well drawn characters and starkly vivid landscape are only part of the charm of this story. The murder victim, is as always, totally unlikable, the suspects numerous, and the plot twists and turns but never loses its pace. Will this be the turning point for the unlucky in love Hamish? Or the final straw in the career of this ever un-ambitious police constable? A clever whodunit, with all the wonderful bits and pieces Ms. Beaton formulaically delivers in an artfully distinct manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"This book is one of the best in the whole Hamish Macbeth series.

She has other guests at her health farm; her ex-husband, John, Harriet Shaw, a writer of cookbooks, Ian and Sheila Carpenter, and Diarmuid and Heather Todd. Heather Todd is a terrible snob and is not friendly with anyone including her husband. Heather is found dead in the curve of an overhanging rock at the beach. Hamish notices that she has a broken neck and a bad bruise on the side of it. The police think it is an accident, but Hamish is convinced that it is murder. With the help of Harriet Shaw, Hamish investigates. This is a good read and a very good addition to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamish at a Health Farm?","review":"This is one of the best examples of a cozy Christmas mystery that I've read for awhile. Hamish is at loose ends on Lochdubh. He can't go to his parents' house since there is going to be an aunt there who hates him. Priscilla is too busy with her father's hotel, so he accepts an invitation to go to lonely, remote Eileencraig for the holidays. One of Priscilla's acquaintances has asked him to come in an unofficial capacity to investigate whether or not there is someone trying to kill her. While he's there another resident at the health farm turns up dead, and Hamish finds himself in the middle of a murder again.

They watched their buddies blown up next to them, followed orders, and did what it took to 'just get home' again, and return to an ordinary life.

It's sucking power really isn't that strong, despite cleaning the filters and having the floor setting on the lowest setting it refuses to pick up cat litter or anything that might even resemble it. The beater bar of the machine never turns off, so when I go over the tile it just flings things back out all over the room and I have to go over the same spots multiple times. It's a pain. However, I do like the round handle; it's great for lugging it up the stairs. I bought this vacuum on clearence so I can't complain too much, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

It was gross having to manually pull pet hair and dirt out of it every time it was used. The UNO actually made more dirt when used on the bare floors, leaving a trail behind bigger than what it had just cleaned up!

Should have spent more on a product as this one actually creates more work. Filter clogs very very easily and this vaccum blows dust, hair etc all over the place - basically picks up the dust/hair and shoots it off into a different direction. With the slightest turn, it does this. When I'm \\"done\\" vacuuming, the mess is much worse than not even vacuuming at all! Also, although there is a setting for it, it does NOT work on anything but carpeting - and actually doesn't work well for that either. Believe me, you do not want to waste your money on this item. I regret ever purchasing this and will turn to a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strong, but quickly disappoints","review":"When I first brought this vacuum home, I thought it was great.

Better in the trash than my floor.However, I caution against using the Uno with bare feet. One would be forgiven for believing a small army of ants was assaulting your shins and ankles with a barrage of rocket-propelled detritus.

I also like the Sammy Spider series because it portrays spiders in a positive way. Spiders are our friends -- they eat flies and other annoying bugs, and are nothing to be afraid of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Rosh Hashanah","review":"I bought this book for a class of Kindergarteners to teach them about Rosh Hashanah, and it was really fantastic. Most of the children were not Jewish and it covered all of the basics of the holiday, leading perfectly into more descriptions and activities after we'd finished. The repetition and basic concepts in the Sammy Spider books are fantastic for children following along--by the middle of the book everyone was saying along with the story, \\"Silly Sammy...spiders spin webs!\\"I would recommend this book and the other Sammy Spider stories for preschoolers and Kindergarteners of all backgrounds. They're really fantastic.Just a note: the book uses simple vocabulary (challah, etc), so you may want to make sure you know how to pronounce some words that are used if you are not familiar with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn of Remembered Spring","review":"Collection of short stories with a snake theme by rural Kentucky author Jesse Stuart.

Indeed, this is a remarkable unbiased account of the so called Castro's Revolution, as well as a good synopsis of Cuban history from the XIXth century to our days.Well researched (except on the African adventure of the Cuban dictator) well written and generally fun to read, this book is a must to all those that have an interest in the Cuban phenomenon and totalitarian regimes in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was first published in 1883.","review":"The data above, provided by the publisher, did not reveal that this book was first published in 1883.

I installed this in a keystone plate along with a network jack and left/right rca jacks going back to the Yamaha so I can either play through any of my analog devices hooked up to the receiver or plug in my ipod or laptop locally in the bathroom and play my music collection or stream audio. I have not had any problem controlling the receiver on any of my other devices. Picks up bounced signals off the walls and ceiling very well, so we don't have to worry about pointing the remote in any particular direction when sitting in the hot tub. This (along with good in ceiling speakers) was a nice inexpensive solution to getting audio into the room without paying for a more expensive speaker distribution or whole house audio configuration.

I haven't read the books but, according to my 12-year-old, this movie is stitched together from several of them (no wonder it lacks any semblance of narrative cohesion). Also, they apparently changed Greg, the main character, so that in addition to being wimpy, he has an oversized ego. Hard to find a more annoying combination IMO. If you have kids, they may dig it but no adult should be forced to sit through this horrible excuse for a movie, which stinks more than that ancient piece of moldy cheese out on the playground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power to Losers","review":"Of the three teen self-empowerment movies currently out on DVD and rating for creativity, acting, cinematography, storyline and I never want to see it again vs. I've got to see this one again, is as follows: On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 as a jaw dropping great) then \\"Mystery Team\\" is a zero; \\"Kickass\\" is an eight; :Diary ...\\" is a three.So, good audience - choose your time (life) appropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not get the DVD Diary of a Wimpy Kid that i paid for.","review":"I got this from my niece that \\"yesterday,we got the movie Diary of a Wimpy Kid in the mail.

The book went into much more of the thoughts kids spend their time thinking about and presents them in a very thought provoking and funny way at their level of understanding.

Unless you are buying just one box and a bunch of other stuff so you get the free shipping don't buy this box from Amazon until the price is adjusted.Full disclosure: when I purchased this item thinking I was getting two I informed Amazon of the price disparity and they agreed to double my order at no extra charge.

I had envisioned installing the lantern one way but when I tried it I didn't like it. I then modified the lantern to have the lights come down from the top rather than up from the bottom and then the lantern looked great! So if you're not sure what will look right, this lantern gives you plenty of options so that it will look great when you are done.My only negative comment was that the manufacterer did not appropriately package the small screws in a plastic bag. These screws fell out of the box when I opened it and I almost lost one of them. This is poor packaging design which would have left me with an unhangable lantern.

And although I don't make it to that great city nearly as often as I would like (understatement), I feel like I know the city at least moderately well. A big part of the credit for that has to go to the many hours I've spent browsing, or doing concentrated research, in these pages. It's truly an outstanding reference.Sadly, it's much too large to carry around as a guidebook. However, I returned from our recent London holiday with a long list of streets, squares, statues, parks, and other landmarks to look up in \\"The London Encyclopdia,\\" and was uniformly pleased with the results. The authors have done a remarkable amount of research, but presented it in a way that is accessible and highly readable.

In a way , I suppose this is a 'puff piece' , something to make Bob seem hip to all the kids .Bob is acting in this , so why not just watch something where we're sure he's acting in character ?

It was the artists who were important. The effectiveness of mass media, television and movies made it possible for artists to reach a whole world of fans - not only with their music, but with their attitudes and thoughts. Bob Dylan new this, and he was one of the first artist to really take the full advantage of it. His arrogant attitude, his clothes, his style, his songs which he knew that millions of fans were listening to - all that were instruments or weapons he could use to express his opinions in a time of political scandals and cheap entertainment. - This move is one of the most interesting documents from the sixties, and also an entertaining study of the most important artist in the sixties: Dylan. As a bonus, there are in fact a couple of great musical performances by Dylan here, too. I just love the man and his music!

The close-up look into the tour life of Bob Dylan is so great, you feel that you are in the room with him. The music is excellent. The scene with Dylan and the science student is a classic, and shows the wit of Dylan, that also appears in his music. Pennebaker's work with this film is as good as it gets.

He had a great Halloween, and plans on wearing it for his Train-themed Birthday Party as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"agree, it runs small","review":"I bought this for my daughter who had a train themed dance recital. She is 5 years old and I expected this to be too big (we got the 6-8 yrs.) But it really fit her quite well, though it was perhaps just a tad big. When i pulled it out of the box she was quite disappointed, until her mom dyed the whole thing pink. Then she was ecstatic. She was very proud to wear it at her dance recital and got loads of compliments. Her little brother was not so happy about the dye job, however. Anyway, the quality of the materials was better than I expected and should hold up for years.

I tried very hard to like this book. The style in which the book was written makes it extremely hard to understand. My 8 year old son, who is not a fan of Language Arts to begin with, is more frustrated than ever trying to get through this. I have put a lot of effort trying to decipher what is meant by the explanations so that I can make sense of it to my son. The questions are very unclear and quite frankly, at times make no sense. There are some chapters that are better than others, and I may be able to use it as a reference in the future, only once a particular subject is already understood and if practice is needed. For those two reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.

A group of money-hungry corporation presidents team up with prospectors who claim to have found oil right beneath the streets of Paris's Chaillot suburb, and the Madwoman rallies her bohemian friends and neighbors to stop them from destroying the city. The play is very dramatic and also humorous in parts; it seems primarily a fantasy, but has several fantastic parts for female characters, among them the Madwoman and her group of eccentric, delightful fellow Madwomen. I recommend it highly to any group of adolescent/young adult actors who are looking for a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know this was a play","review":"I must not have read the description of this item correctly; I thought it was a book.

This play is hysterical, entertaining, and a joy for those performing it as well as those seeing or reading it. It involves eccentric, rich old ladies who try to carry on with afternoon tea despite thier various quirky personalities(mainly quirky due to senility and the hallucinations that accompany it). A great play for adolescent through adult actors. It is worth having on your shelf if you instruct drama in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger Slammin'","review":"I have lived in the Albany NY area all of my life, and I have followed the local music scene for years. The scene now is probably the best it's ever been, with many good CD's coming out in a wide range of styles. I must say that this CD is the best record to come out of the Albany scene. It's a smart , playful slice of pop music with hooks galore, perceptive lyrics, and great attitude. This can sit alongside Elliot Smith, Aimee Mann, even Elvis Costello. Modern Music you actually can sing along to. The production is top notch, very inventive. I knew that Mr. Brodeur was good when he was in a local band called the Explosives, who broke up before releasing anything( I could be wrong about that).Any fan of smart power pop will dig this record. Help John out. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story","review":"I loved this book, I loved this book enough to go out and purchase the author's other books. This is only the start to a very in depth world. I think the author does a good job portraying the giant's broken family and adds a bit of mysticism to their home on top of the clouds.I like the added detail of just how much water a beanstalk that size had to consume to grow that quickly, also the subtle idea that it lends strength to the person climbing it. I also liked the portrayal of Jack as a rich, old man, with a legend floating behind him that no one quite believes.I had to feel bad for the giantess though, she went from an abusive husband to a cruel son."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Fashioned Adventure","review":"I can't tell you how much my 8-year-old son and I enjoyed this book! This isn't one of those damned sensitive young adult books that the teachers push, it is a rollicking and often scary adventure story. The boy at the center is brave and true, the human and giant villains are really scary, the writing is crisp and the vocabulary very advanced. Oh sure there is a good moral to the story, but the author doesn't beat you about the head with a message. I am going to order the next four books in the series right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Suspenseful","review":"Nick is a boy who was abandoned at a young age. He has realized that the only way to survive is to steal. He even joins up with a bunch of older thieves. One of his first missions is to go inside an old man's house named Jack, the one who climbed up the beanstalk. Once Nick gets inside he gets intrigued by the story and takes some magical beans from Jack and plants them. Soon a beanstalk grows. As Nick climbs up he realizes this isn't just for the treasures, but for saving the world from two huge Ogres.This book was very good. It had a lot of description and the description of the ogres made me feel like I was facing them. It also was very true about the regular jack-and-the-beanstalk story. Every thing seemed to perfectly match. I was also surprised to learn some things about the story that I did not know. The Thief and the Beanstalk was very suspenseful with new plots coming up around every corner.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews, www.flamingnet.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is a cookbook that makes your mouth water.

It's a bit oversized format and may not fit in tighter bookshelves, but I am sure you have a spot for it somewhere. The photography is excellent. Images of tantalizing food, sitting on rustic wire racks and cutting boards and utensils against a white background, which fits with the theme that these are modern versions of classics. The spot varnish on the photography with white backgrounds really makes the food pop off the page. Some of the recipes have a series of smaller photographs which show the process of cooking the food. The design and layout is very clean. This is the first Donna Hay book I have added to my collection, but it won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I,purchased this for my Husband for Christmas.

Frankly, I wish I had my money back.Now the other side, Kevin's work is ground breaking. His suggestions about improving skin texture are to be found no where else. His technique is unsurpassed. I want to be sure that I make that clear. I also have his video from Software Cinema. So, one more time; Kevin is great! The book is useless to me, because the graphics are just bad.

It emphasized the concept that can actually be applied to any type of photography. Personally, I like to take Portrait, Street Life, and Candid. This book really hope me to think more of how and what I want to have as my final result from the pictures I take. I used to think that postproduction of a picture is pointless but the more I learned from this book. It became more evident that that is not the case. It is an essential part of digital photography.

It is a very slow read at first, but then the pace picks up. Many real historical figures make an appearance, either in person or in gossip. A nice historical romance thus far, with plenty of detailed court intrigues. While the main character (and her mother) are fictional, the rest of the characters are not (including the Prince of Cleves himself, who never married in real life). Keeping in mind the period this was written, it's quite good. But the constant referring to characters by titles/surnames rather than given names got very old, and I found Madame de Cleves too hypocritical to like the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It Almost Cost Me My \\"A\\" in English Lit","review":"I was forced to read this literary sleeping pill way back in college, when there was no internet and not even any Cliff's or Monarch Notes for it.

It also has worship with tracks \\"Thrive\\" \\"Million Pieces\\" and \\"Lord I don't Know\\".This cd also has good promise in having some secular hits because you can hear hints of other bands in their music such as Smash Mouth, Lenny Kravitz, and U2.

The final track \\"Lord (I don't know)\\" is a great expression of faith, even in our limited knowledge.

In such a vision, in a town like Libby, when people who can make money from asbestos, people who might be you and I at whatever distance, when we, even if only in acquiescence, when we kill unknowing souls for profit for generation after generation, when that happens, the best of the American dream flows away from us like a river irredeemably polluted.Peacock has given us a mirror on the triumphant nightmare of American greed. \\"Libby, Montana\\" is a perfectly heartbreaking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"journalism vs. soap opera","review":"As a former Libby resident (1976-1982) and one who has since found out that I am one of the 'victims', I was looking forward to reading \\"Libby Montana\\".

I personally know (or knew) many of the folks named in the book. Instead of writing from a true journalist's viewpoint, Andrea Peacock instead presents a verbal 'Oprah Winfrey' show. She wanders back and forth through history with no really coherent thought process and hopes that by throwing in an occassional tear-jerking story now and then she will keep the reader interested. She has managed to turn would could have been an excellent documentary into a soap opera and by doing so only belittles the overall magnitude of the Libby disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Andrea Peacock did an excellent job of describing theenvironmental disaster that has ravaged this smallMontana town.Peacock's description of human suffering,corporate greed, and \\"bought\\" politicians bringsthis true story to life.Highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than most other brands","review":"This shirt is thicker than the others I've tried in the same price range; it doesn't look cheap or flimsy at all, and it feels good.

A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point?

Nowever, one protector is larger than the other one, so which one does it go on, I assumed the top so I started there. I applied it just like I did for my touch phone but these are super sticky. You get 1 try and that is it. Needless to say, I had so many bubbles that I carefully took it off and threw it out.I tried the bottom one, same results. There is no \\"easy\\" way to put these on and they seem to result in bubbles galore everytime.The bubbles are probably because they did not fit on just the screen, but overlapped on my DS which resulted in air underneath.

I decided to forget about the air bubbles but then felt the filter was preventing the stylus from making good contact with the screen. I found this too frustrating and wanted to remove the filter.

However, my attempt failed when a blue microfiber unleashed itself from some unknown gallaxy wonderfully petrifying its buttocks between screen and filter.

They were extremely durable considering the price I paid.However, I want my DS lite to last me a long while still. After reading up a bit on other screen protectors, I finally broke down and decided to dish out the money for the \\"official\\" ones (Hori).I am so very glad I did! These screen protectors are great. They are thick and seem very durable (I highly doubt they will last any less time than the cheasy ones I had before), and best of all they \\"fit\\" to the screen.

It's not too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Debut Ever!","review":"Selling around 7 million, makes a good state, that this album is no mistake to buy it!, Paula Abdul debut album embraces the music of the end of th 80's and the welcoming of the 90's, she should be remember as the top artist of that slack of time cuz she was, better than Madonna and Janet. For my taste 9 of the 10 album cuts are great. Next to you(should be left out), The other songs are definetily great! and the 6 singles release in this album are just classic, sadly as most of all the albums in the eighties the radio version were slightly different but if you want that The Greatest Hits will do you good(beautifuly crafted all the singles version, way to go Virgin Records!!!). But as for all Forever Your Girl will be considered always one of time best debut album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to dance to","review":"Though she may not have the greatest voice on earth Forever Your Girl is still a fun and uplifting listen for me. Her songs and videos both have been memorable for me since. The best songs here are: The way that you love me, Opposites attract, the title track, Straight up, and Cold hearted. The synthesizers pulsate chirplily and the vocal delivery is so undeniably Paula that I can't possibly imagine another person singing these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashy Dance Pop At its Best!","review":"When this was was released, my friend loaned me a copy. During a get together, someone said that the album's \\"all trash!\\" But another giggled and admitted that he liked it. So it became the well loved trashy dance album of the 80s, giving Madonna and Janet Jackson a run in the pop dance market.The songs are very groovy. Besides the No 1s like Straight Up, Forever Your Girl, Opposites Attract and Cold Hearted, I especially like Knocked Out and I Need You. My only beef with this is that they did not put in the version of Cold Hearted which had Paula rapping.Many of of us ended up getting the accompanying VHS too to learn to dance like Paula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s, but I just never got it...or her.

We'd send our \\"viewed\\" movies to another ship in exchange for the movies they'd seen.EVERY EXCHANGE we'd end up with a copy of J.D.'s Revenge and Revenge of the B Girls. J.D.'s Revenge was so funny that the crew and wardroom watched it nearly every night for nearly 6 months. In a few months, nearly everyone had memorized the entire movie.

Clams and clunkers (wrong or misplaced notes) abound. The director had so little confidence in the piccolo that he had it lay off of the solo the first time through (when the rest of the band plays softly) the famous part of Stars & Stipes Forever. The recording quality is on a par with the musicianship. Sousa deserves much better.Correction (1/5/03): They didn't have the piccolo lay out, but they didn't take the last repeat (which is indicated pianissimo the first time through and fortissimo the second) - they play it once, loud. As written, the famous melody (\\"be kind to your web-footed friends\\") occurs three time, the first in the Trio, with no piccolo obligato.

This is a landmark album and the 30th anniversary edition only got better with the digitally remastering job and the addition of the bonus material. This marks my fourth purchase of this seminal recording. First on vinyl in 1972, then on cassette and CD, and now this. The NGDB said it best in their liner notes: \\"The Circle stands as a record of an event of unusual proportions, a presentation of music that 'did' change the world.\\" Time has not diminished how special this recording is. For me personally it was an introduction to some of country and bluegrass music's most influential artists.[It's worth noting that it's this album's version of \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\\" that was recently listed by CMT as one of the 100 greatest country songs of all time!] ESSENTIAL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always","review":"Another album I grew up on.

If you have ever heard this disc on vinyl you would know what I am nitpicking about. I wish the producers had given this disc all the attention it so justly deserves.

First time listeners will hear giants of the genre and can move forward to original recordings by the \\"old-timers\\" engaged by the NGDB to complete this album. A simple step up would be to the recordings of the \\"Seldom Scene\\" with John Duffy. From there, you can move into the recordings of Bill Monroe, Jim & Jessie, Don Reno and Red Smiley, Dry Branch Fire Squad, The Country Gentlemen and so many others.

I enjoyed the obvious borrowing from Lovecraftian tales (think Cthulu mythos meets The Hills Have Eyes). Unfortunately, the anti-climactic, sudden (almost forced, really) ending took a huge dump all over the positives of the novel; and amplified all the shortcomings of it, e.g., easily predictable plot twists and weakly developed characters.

I mean, that sex scene between him and Susan felt like Penthouse letter nonsense.

A better use of your money might be to purchase 3 or 4 of your favorite screenplays and read them. Look how they are written and use that format. Buy a couple text books on writing for general guidelines. Then take your money and start hitting the streets meeting people. You're best bet is to have an \\"in\\" at the place youre pitching your material.Is it a bad book? No. Is it a must have? Absolutely not. A few good pointers, but alot of self-centered, self-important tips that won't make or break your deal. If you have an original idea or a new twist, that may be enough. The best bet is to take that original idea (if there are any left)and punch out a good screenplay. Do your homework, get good honest feedback and don't give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely redundant but it's honest","review":"I have to say getting through this book was really kind of torturous. Basically, it's 100 things if that. The portion on ACT II is interesting if onlybecause so this is by far the most difficult part of a script. The author knows this and attacks all of the problems. But even then, it could have been written in three pages instead of 150 annoying little items. A thoroughly obnoxious format. Everything here is more or less in Lew Hunter's book anyway. The only unique thing is her perspective as a reader, but as others pointed out, why the hell do you want to write for a reader anyway? I'd say SKIP IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, read it, and read it again!!","review":"I work for a film production company as a story editor and I couldn't agree more with the points the author makes.

Now, I know we've all wanted to beat a Hollywood reader before -- like, WITH A STICK! But now we should get down on our hands and knees and worship at this woman's feet, her book is THAT GOOD. From tip one to five hundred, I read this how-to in ONE SITTING! I now flip through as I'm rewriting my script -- I'm not even halfway through my new draft, and I'm floored at how much better my writing already is.

It would be interesting if any of their scripts ever came across Jennifer Lerch's desk!The book, incidentally, is a rather average concoction which borrows heavily from other volumes and seems to revel in stating the obvious.

Don't get me wrong -- I didn't buy the book. I just borrowed it. What would people think if they saw it in my bookshelf? (\\"Gawd. Is he trying to write a script? I thought he just read them.\\") So will this book help you write a script that I'll like? Maybe. More likely is that it'll just annoy you. And keep this in mind: ten thousand readers can like your script, but never once has a reader bought a script. It's the development people, the producers, the c.e.'s who cut the checks.

Each member of the trio is a prodigy in their own right. When combined they're unstoppable. They are the \\"Rush\\" of texas blues. Yet, their music is never boring or over complicated.

It was fascinating to see how much of what was predicted for the \\"imaginary\\" Shikasta has actually come to pass in recent years. But what I really felt on this read was the deep flow of Canopus, with its heart based approach of flow and interconnection patiently waiting for the egoic and suspicious Sirius to catch up.

The drone and slam approach to music has never done much to excite me, and the notion that one has to adhere to a signature sound instead of trying out something new and different proves stifling. It's as though the band is drawn to produce this one sound much like a moth is drawn to the light.I like some of the tracks here---Cocaine Star, Burning Down My Sanity, and I See Sound---but it's the session as a whole that falters, leaving one in a stupor much like a moth stunned by cedar.One quick question: If this CD really merits all those 4 or 5 star ratings, why is it that used copies are going for less than a nickel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent orientation on Jesus in the Gospels and Christ for today.","review":"As a student of the Bible, I have benefited from the presentation Marsh and Moyise offer of the Jesus made known in each of the four New Testament gospels, as well as in lesser known gospels not accepted as part of the Bible. Their simultaneous engagement with contemporary scholarship on Jesus as a prophet, as a \\"word-spinner,\\" as a political liberator engaged with the poor and with women as well, as a spiritual and ethical guide, and as the Christ of Faith provides a deeper sense of both who Jesus was and how we may understand him today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for a unbeatable price","review":"the set is very nice, and from Japan to boot.

NOT what I wanted, although I can hardly complain to the seller at the price I paid ($2 plus shipping for a factory sealed cd). I haven't opened the cd to listen to it, so the music may be perfectly wonderful.

There were many characters that were introduced, which made me pay attention to the story. But when Rei goes back home and to her normal life, I didn't understand why she wanted to be involved in solving Setsuko's murderer. I would understand if Rei and Setsuko were acquaintances, but they had no relation to each other at all. I found Rei Shimura very nosy and annoying because at times, she wouldn't speak up for herself, especially when Mamasan and other people she met were very rude to her. Her nosiness gets her into trouble most of the time, which made her look clumsy and childish. The murderer was revealed in an \\"all of a sudden\\" matter, which created no suspense for me. All in all, my first experience reading a suspense novel is only two stars, but I won't stereotype all suspense novels on this first experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time..","review":"Don't read this, if you are japanese mystery fan.

How on earth could she have won an award for this piece of trash?The main character, Rei Shimura is xenophobic. I have no doubt that Ms. Massey really lived and worked in Japan, but she couldn't have been here very long because her character's disdain for all things foreign reflects homesickness typical of the newly arrived. Her command of the Japanese language betrays her longevity, however, and that's what's unforgivable.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thinking woman's mystery","review":"Massey serves up an intelligent mystery that zigs and zags, keeping the reader on her/his toes. Interwoven in the story is the experience of a Japanese/American heroine who faces the discomfort involved in not quite fitting into the Japanese culture in which the mystery is set. Thus the book serves up a cultural mystery which educated all the while that it is entertaining! The female protagonist is fun, brave, and vulnerable without ever veering into a stereotype. Massey keeps you up nights and sends you rushing to the bookstore where you are greatful that she has continued to publish mysteries with the same wonderful lead.

With ingenious characters and subplots, Mr Buckley provides the reader with an immensely entertaining, can't put the book down thriller. Blackford Oakes is a much more believable secret agent than that we are served up in any James Bond movie, more along the lines of a Jack Ryan, tenacious in persuing the aim of his mission.

Don't look for melodies that you can whistle along with, or simple beats that you can dance to. This is a spacy trip through caverns and canyons between stars and galaxies. This is a soundtrack to a tangerine's dream. This is an audio vision described through synthesizers and electronic music that is unlike anything any other artist can offer.

This book is very well organized, with all of the information oriented toward accomplishing a task. Most of the marginally useful fluff that you find in most XP book is absent here, and the information is of top quality throughout. I've already put this to good use in fine-tuning my networked small office setup. An added bonus in the book is a slew of great MVP tips and techniques from the author and his team of high-qualified pros. This is a worthy addition to any XP library.

This is the perfect music to listen to when you want ot relax, or just have a soothing background for working, socializing, or driving. It's not \\"over produced\\" like some easy listening music. I love the mix of familiar tunes and some that I've not heard elsewhere. If you like harp, cello, and flute, you'll love this collection.

I figured that if this is the book that all the teachers go by then I should just go to the source. Now I see why! It is magnificent in it's writing and teachings.

ACIM is a failure in this regard, as are many highly regarded spiritual books including the Bible and the Koran.

It is very easy to get him in with this model because there are no arm rest ..(My 5 year olds booster has the arm rest which untill we got the hang of it was a little frustrating.) Easy to adjust the seat because when he is wearing his winter coat it needs to go up a bit verses when he is not it needs to be down more..

They are so thin you can literally see through them which kind of negates wearing them as a protective shield against contact allergies (why I bought them in the first place), the wrists are so baggy they fall off your hands unless you clinch them with a band or string, and the seams were already holey before I put them on, which only worsened after a cold water wash on the delicate cycle. I'd return them if I could, but I can't. I just ordered some 100% cotton parade gloves from Premiumuniformal.com I called first to try and get some info so I wouldn't repeat my same experience, but they wouldn't tell me how thick the gloves are. Instead they told me to just buy them and see (not exactly off to a good customer service start......). We'll see. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised or maybe I'll just be throwing another $20+ away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dry skin protection","review":"For dry hands you can't get better help than these cotton gloves.

My pre-order of \\"Dancing with Granny\\" had arrived. I sat down and read it from cover to cover in about 3 hours. It made be cry, laugh, and get mad. The remembrances of the author's \\"granny\\" brought back wonderful memories of my Irish and German grandmothers. The picture painted of the author's Granny was very vivid. I,too, am from a large, very close bonded family. I come from the Midwest and so have not ever encountered any prejudice like that encountered by the author and her family in Mississippi, and even up North when the author went to college. It made me angry to believe that people would treat other people that way. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and anxiously await Frankye's next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVA SAN LUIS!Conjunto Primavera is number one!","review":"Nacho Galindo along with Tony Melendez do a brillant job in this CD .

Not even a new picture. Two great songs though (\\"Anything For You\\" is the 2nd track). \\"Forever All Over Again\\" is a ballad. An absolutely terrific song, but an odd choice for a single, since it perpetuates the wrong impression that Night Ranger are a ballad band. While Night Ranger do great ballads, as \\"Forever All Over Again\\" shows, they are a rock band, and they definitely know how to rock. Luckily the 2nd track shows this. Thought not the definitive Night Ranger song, \\"Anything For You\\" show Night Ranger haven't forgotten how to rock. These are two great songs, but there are more where they came from on the Neverland album. The single's worth buying, but better to buy the whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"Just as with the other set of miniatures (Heroes), I was very disappointed. The only good thing I can say about this set is that at least all 6 miniatures were present in this box (rather than having 1 missing as with the other set). The bad thing is that not only did most of the miniatures come in 2 or more pieces that were in many cases hard to glue together, one of the 6 was so bend out of shape that nothing could be done to save it.My advice: stay away from these miniatures and buy your miniatures from a company that specialises in them, rather than buying this set..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor casting","review":"I have to agree with Jos Ververgaard, this set as well as the Heroes set is badly cast with discoloration of the models and some air bubbles.This is overshadows the fact that the models are finely detailed, the amount of work needed to make these models representable is not worth itIn all not worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Obsession With Marlon Brando","review":"It's sad, but I'm obsessed with Marlon Brando. While everybody else was drooling over JTT and Leo DiCaprio, I was staring at the millions of pictures I'd gotten from various sites. And I mean, the young Marlon Brando. The Marlon Brando from 1950 (The Men) to 1958 (The Young Lions). In that time frame, he was cutest in Sayonara, and Sayonara was also his highest grossing film until the Godfather came along. Personally, I think Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. It touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy. And Brando should have won for best actor, though he was beat out by Humphrey Bogart (I think, don't quote me). Anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive to no end, and now you have no reason not to see it! Do so, and fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I can only nod my head in agreement with the other reviewers who have lauded this film. It is beautifully filmed, well-written, and turns out suberb performances by Red Buttons, Miyoshi Umeki, Miiko Taka, James Garner, and especially Brando. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a beautiful love story that is heartwrenching and inspiring and provides a lesson in the infinite power of love--a power that transcends all barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sayonara","review":"Gee, this is a very moving film, and one of the few that I understood what in blazes Marlon way saying.

This movie does not seem dated to me, aside from the cars and the clothes, even though it was filmed almost 50 years ago. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, and I was heartbroken at the suicide of Kelly and his young bride. I was equally thrilled at the ending when Brando and Hana-Ogi rode off into the sunset. However, I think Brando stunk in this movie, all he did was mumble in that horrible southern accent he put on. However, here is something interesting: the actress who played Hana-Ogi, Miiko Taka, was born in Seattle, Washington. You wouldn't know that, would you, by listening to her or watching her? Great acting job by Ms. Taka. Wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sayonra","review":"This is a wonderful older film, Marlon Brando is stationed in Japan and falls in love with a Japanese woman.

Lots of Japanses beautiful shows and custumes, exotic asian traditions. The Japanese leading lady is also cute and she gave a good performing. Romantic and touching, really woth seeing if you are a romantic fan.The picture quality is not so good though, not very sharp, may be normal for a classic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible movie, unforgivable DVD!","review":"The one star is to bring attention to the DVD transfer quality. This is a fantastic film! Brando is, as usual, unbelievable!! The greatest actor of all time, in my book, for sure!!!This DVD, however, is unforgivable, an embarrassment to the studio, the movie, and to home video itself. It is 16:9 letterboxed onto 4:3, making it tiny and grainy on a widescreen TV, and the transfer itself is washed out and dull. This is especially annoying since a good HD transfer does exist; I saw it on HDNet movies on DirecTV. That transfer is beautiful.Come on, MGM, bring the HD transfer to Blu-ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I must admit I have watched this movie at least ten times. After renting it over and over at the video store, I finally broke down and bought it. I still watch it. I don't remember why I picked it up at the video store the first time, but I was so very impressed when I watched it. It is a fascinating love story and very well told. The acting is superb. James Garner is a nice surprise, and of course, Brando is at his best. It tells a great story of the difficult choice many men faced in the military while stationed in Japan after WWII when they fell in love and wanted to marry their Japanese girlfriends. I credit all those attached with the film for their wisdom in making this film about love that transcinds racial barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"Wow this book has so much information that I had no idea where to start!

But why should the universe work as if it were a computer? Siegfried bows to the weight of scientific culture in refusing to draw a conclusion, but his refutation of the Fredkin Hypothesis is probably not meant to be convincing.

It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"New ways to play as my son has grown.","review":"I bought this when my son was about 6 months old.

So I let my 1 year old girl play with it for a couple of weeks until it was time to mail it to my nephew. She played with it off and on every day. Her attention span is still pretty weak...so she only played with it in 10 minute intervals. But that's about twice as long as any other toy keeps her interest. Seems to be a good toy.

Somtow takes you on a tour of humanity's scarred underbelly. Our character, an unlikely hero. Our villan, a frightening reminder that evil lives inside man as part of us, his madness convincing and as far removed from the earlier, more contrived Crow villians as can be.

Fun for him, deadly for the overall production (although even Tom Baker at his best couldn't have saved this mess). A serious contender for one of the worst Whos ever made. Save your money for the really good Tom Baker stories that have yet to be released on DVD like Seeds of Doom and Terror of the Zygons.For masochistic completists only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Go Now... into the garbage can.","review":"Dismal electronic pop music with a reggae flavor. Isaacs' vocals are the only upside, which somehow retain the emotive quality he is known for. But the music often sounds like pre-programed keyboard beats. It's sad that a music legend couldn't afford real musicians when producing this album. Truly awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artist Whose Art Makes Me Happy","review":"I picked this book up a few years ago after seeing an exhibition of Joe Norris's work. This book is a really great tribute to Joe Norris and you get beautiful reproductions of quite a lot of his art. If you can't go to an exhibition to see his work in person then this is definitely the book to buy.However, like all great art, you really have to see his work in person to appreciate it fully. The colours are so bright and the images wonderful but, for me, Joe Norris's art is definitely not just a visual experience. The wood panel paintings he made, the furniture he painted, they all have such a great smell to them and all of the colours seem that much more vibrant in person. It may sound really odd but the smell of his work alone makes me feel very comfortable & cozy (reminds me of my family's cabin).Looking at Joe Norris's artwork in this book reminds me of that & makes me feel happy & content.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Medicine - Good Book","review":"A spirited defence of evidence-based medicine with a wry sense of humour, this is an entertaining and informative read.

Not only did it give me some insight into the human body, it has helped me start to think more critically about what I hear in the media about medicine and health. The author is a person with a lot of common sense, and he's basically trying to get us to see things from a reasonable, logical point of view. He tells us why the Atkins' diet won't work on a long-term basis, why homeopathy is not necessarily a good thing, and how ancient medicines--which weren't particularly effective--are still with us today. And he does it by giving us the facts. Not only does he tell us why some alternative medicines are bad, he also reveals HOW we have been convinced otherwise. This gives us the tools to debunk bad medicine on our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man thinks we are all stupid","review":"I was predisposed to agree with Mr. Wanjek -- I bought the book for ammunition. But his elitism, constant denigration of TV watchers (of which I am not one), insults of people who disagree with his positions, and sneering at or ignorance of the science that *does* support a number of herbal remedies put me right off. There are better books on the topic, including physicians' handbooks that are quite readable, and which make clear which remedies are scientifically supported and which aren't. I suggest that prospective buyers shop around for something a little less insulting to their intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK If you actually think this is a good book i am sorry","review":"It's not that this book is horrible, but come on.

I guess if you have never picked up a health book and even a magazine you would think this is such great information. Well, I hate to break it to you, it's nothing kept in the dark. I am so bored when I read this book.

After the Scarlet Witch goes crazy and slaughters the Avengers, she is taken to Genosha by her father Magneto who, along with Professor Xavier, seek to repair her broken mind. Naturally, as anyone who has read House of M knows, that is easier said than done. There's also some additional stories including interaction between Archangel and Calisto, but there's really nothing here that would be needed to know what is going on in the long run. Legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont doesn't do much here to add any kind of flare, but Aaron Lopresti's art is pretty good mostly.

I pick up about three times as many stations with my old rabbit ears. I'm pretty sure I'd be better off jamming a length of wire into the back of my TV rather than using that antenna. I even disassembled the unit, hoping to find that a lead wire had come loose, leading to the utterly miserable reception, but no dice. Also worth noting: the build quality is pretty poor, and the co-ax connector is the push-on type rather than the (much better) screw-on type. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money!!!!","review":"The Trek Indoor Low-Profile antenna was a complete waste of money. I'm going to return it if I can. I don't even get as good reception with this Trek antenna as I did with a cheap rabbit ears from K-Mart. I live in the metro Denver area. With the rabbit ears, I got over 15 channels (including Spanish and Christian) that came in clear and another 15 that were watchable if I adjusted them. The Trek didn't perform nearly as well. My recommendation? Get something at K-Mart or Radio Shack and save your money. The Trek antenna isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book ROCKS!","review":"I'm so glad this book exists! It really helped me figure out what to look for in a man--and what to avoid! Dating is so hard and there's no time to spend wasting my time on a pointless relationship. Thanks to THE LIST, I finally know what to look for. It's definitely empowering, and a great, fun read overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No games, no rules, no gimmicks","review":"If you are a single woman wanting to get married--read this book! As the Corbett sisters write, when you have found \\"the one,\\" there are no games, no rules, no gimmicks--the relationship just flows naturally and easily. When I read this book, much of it rang true for me. Girlfriends agree that there is a lot of truth and advice packed into this little book. No need for ultimatums or feeling sorry for yourself because you're alone again, having wasted your time on yet another wrong man. This is an intimate and special book that tells it like it is. Read it and you will learn how to recognize the man and the moment and the marriage you want--with the right man for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you're with the wrong one","review":"I don't think this book is good if you're looking for marriage and not in a relatioship because you will probably marry the first man who exhibites everything on the list. It does seem like despiration. This book is good for if you want to get married and you are already in a relationship. This helps you determine if it's going anywhere so you can take the necessary steps (get rid of him or realize you don't have a future and just have fun in the now).This book is a guide for women who are ready to settle down. I don't agree that it only takes a month because I had a list guy and it took three months (maybe because we were 19). However, I do believe you can see signs in the first month that says he's NOT going to marry you in the future.This book is good on telling you if the guy is ready for marriage. What it fails to ask is if you are ready to marry this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!!!","review":"This book is it! It is easy to read, funny and oh so true! I am single and can't wait to put these rules to the test. I'm convinced they'll work because I've seen it happen for others. And really, the book doesn't tell women something we didn't already know, but it does a great job of reinstating confidence and conviction! Must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical","review":"This book is not really recommended, it will cause you to feel that your relationship isn't right when it could very well be headed in the right direction, just because he didn't follow some list items. Its a bit crazy, and I think that the best thing to do is enjoy your life, because you only go around once and you should live on your own terms, defining your own happiness. Enjoy your time together rather than analyzing everything. The list probably could weed out some guys who are just plain bad but its not a surefire method. It will make you insecure if anything..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Jazz at its Best","review":"Colley, a respected yet underrated young lion of modern jazz, teams up with drummer Bill Stewart (of John Scofield and Pat Metheny Trio fame), guitarist Adam Rogers, and tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. The set mainly features abstract funk-based tunes, but this is not \\"jam band\\" music at all. Colley and Co. improvise their butts off, swinging relentlessly. Ornette Coleman's \\"Alpha\\" is given a fine run-through, with Stewart kicking up a storm, much as he does on the other swing vehicle, \\"Barracudas.\\" While this CD may be a bit too abstract for some, those who enjoy modern jazz that is exploratory and very much NOT commercial would dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simpsons Go Hollywood","review":"This boxed set, like any other piece of Simpsons merchandise is a good buy. Tape One starts out with \\"Marge vs. The Monorail\\" a great, hilarious episode featuring a classic Simpsons musical moment. Then, \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", my favorite on the set, and named one of creator Matt Groening's favorites as well, is an episode no true fan could do without. Tape two features the Who Shot Mr. Burns episodes which are both immediate classics. Tape three includes \\"Bart Gets Famous\\", a fun episode with some absolutely hilarious box factory scenes, and the funniest closing lines in Simpsons history, in my humble opinion. Finally, \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" rounds out the set, and it's endless parade of guest stars, amazingly, doesn't bog down the episode, but improves it, unlike some modern episodes. Overall, I have to say that this is one set that Simpsoniacs everywhere can't do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever.","review":"Now, it's probably me just being a blind fan of the simpsons what with the jokes and the laughter and the MUHAY! But this little tv series I feel is most deffinately the best ever. Plus the only people that I have met who have not liked this show are you cold hearted \\"no laughter\\" types. Most likely because a main point the Simpson creaters make are that many republican polititions have been extremely greedy and obsessed with money and many democratic polititions have been just plain ... :) and the reason you \\"no laughter\\" types dont like that is because you KNOW IT'S TRUE!! So instead of hating this show, how about u just shut up and watch an episode with a simpson lover (like me) and i garuntee you will fall in love yourself.Next Rant:I Love South Park!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't want to see it again","review":"It's a good pack.

A must have for any Sabbath or Dio fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there...done that..","review":"This is Sabbath's attempt to cash in on the RJD era by performing the Dio era classics as well as a couple of newer songs and calling the band Heaven and Hell to distinguish it from the Ozzy era. Only problem is, we've been there and done this before. Many, many times. Dio flashes the horns around, makes silly faces, he even reverts to part of the same corny ad lib in Heaven and Hell that he did on Live Evil. To their credit, Appice, Iommi and Butler do sound very good so I suppose it's more what you're into than anything. If you're a guitar guy then you will love this...drummers likewise cuz Appice is fun to watch...but if Dio annoys you, you better just skip this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven and Hell","review":"We gave this as a gift to my brother.

There is no denying the awesome sound and force that it is DIO or Ozzy's solo careers, but when it comes to Sabbath DIO was always the best fit. True Ozzy had some amazing album with Black Sabbath but it was Heaven And Hell that proved Ozzy was just holding them back and DIO made them each their full potential like he always does every time he comes back home to sabbath as he is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rose by any other name rocks just as hard...","review":"Great DVD. Man, we're all getting old, aren't we!?! It was really cool to see the Great Ones together again after 2 major falling outs over the years. Like I said about the Heaven & Hell CD, the new stuff falls a little short, but the old classics were great to hear again. I couldn't understand why they chose to open with 'After All', but before you know it, they're burnin' up the stage with old faves like 'Mob Rules', and 'Voodoo'. And of course they have to close with 'Heaven& Hell' and the timeless anthem 'Neon F***ing Knights'! Overall, great stuff, and a great reminder to us old school metalers. And I don't care what the package says--- It's BLACK SABBATH!!!Regardless of what money-hungry Sharon Osbourne says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money on this DVD","review":"I was really anticipating a good quality concert when I heard about the reforming of the Black Sabbath era with Ronnie at the vocals, unfortunatly I have to say I was very disappointed.The concert starts out with an opening song that was very low energy for an opening song, if you watch the audience even they all stood thier watching the opening with a boring sense of anticipation.Ronnie was off key in several of the songs, the timing was way too slow compared to the album versions of the songs.Tommy was off tune and out of time several times.They should have done more practicing before they caught this on film because none of the songs they did even compared to the blistering licks and pounding bass that you would hear from the original recordings.I was one of the fortunate people who actually saw these guys live back in the Heaven and Hell days and the new version is nowhere near the quality of the line up of yesterdays group.Could it be old age setting in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Boring. Yes, you read correctly. From the 1st song on, this never picks up steam. Kind of like metal elevator music. Forget about rockin out unless you mean rockin chair out on the porch. Dio still has the voice and plenty of enthusiasm, its the MUSIC that doesn't deliver and considering that it's him, Iommi, Geezer and Vinny Appice, this is a FELONY! Mid tempo stuff all the way through, with the exception of Mob Rules. No Holy Diver. No Rainbow in the Dark. No Heaven and Hell. NO ANYTHING!!! I was going to sleep! I still can't believe it...Don't buy this unless you just are nuts over Dio and even then, I'd beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST LIKE BEING THERE!!","review":"I RECENTLY SAW THIS SHOW IN LOWELL MA.

They looked so happy to not play Paranoid and Iron Man, as was I to not hear it.Instead, The band rocks us with such awe inspiring numbers as \\"I\\", \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" and \\"Children of the Sea\\", \\"Mob Rules\\" and \\"Computer God\\".You get the concert, and unlike previous Black Sabbath DVD's, there are no inverviews interupting the playing.

Then it makes sense to have the pick and ear phones. Otherwise, don't bother.The silent brass system ($119) is not silent. It is slightly quieter than a Harmon mute ($30), has more back pressure and weighs more. If you are in a room by yourself, you don't need the silent brass system. Use a cup mute or Harmon mute and save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Issues","review":"We've returned one of these units only to find that the replacement has the same issue with poor manufacturing quality. The 1/8\\" jack on the body of the mute is loose. This creates a loud 'pop' through the line.

The mute otherwise works as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yamaha Silent Brass System Does the Job","review":"The Yamaha Silent Brass system is just right for practicing without distrubing others. I find myself using the mute without the module and ear phones.I simply put the mute in and go. It think it's a bit expensive so shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much back pressure.","review":"I bought the Yamaha SB79 Silent brass system because I live in an apartment building. I had not tried the product prior to buying it. Using the mute does make my cornet quiet enough to use in my apartment, however it creates a tremendous back pressure. This back pressure hurts my ears and gives me a headache. When using the earphones, the sound is unacceptble. It is advertised as creating Concert hall sound quality, but it only provides a tin like sound which is louder than the muted cornet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Brass not compatible with Smart Music","review":"Silent Brass is a very quiet mute. There is back pressure, no doubt about that. But since it is for practice, when you take the mute off, the horn blows easier, so there is some additional training benefit, if you see it that way.I don't use the electronics, because I can hear the sound without it without a problem. If Yamaha would make the mute perform multiple duty as a tuner and compatible with Smart Music, it would be a much better buy. In todays electronic age, this isn't a technical challenge, but maybe a marketing one on Yamaha's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a great buy","review":"I bought this product during my Freshman year of college, while I was living in the dorms for the first time. After getting it, it finally allowed me to practice in my room instead of having to find a practice room in some dank basement so I wouldn't disturb others. Although I haven't messed around too much with the effects processing, what I did use it for sounded very good, I'm just to lazy to plug it in. It works well with Jamey Aebersold play-a-longs, if you are into jazz.The only major problem I have with it is the backpressure, which as another review says, is more than advertised.Overall, I think the Yamaha Silent Brass Mute for Trumpet is a great buy for any trumpet player."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"This book seems more a bland compilation of every bed and breakfast the authors could find than a selection of 'special' places. The reviews are short, the pictures often uninformative - everything is in black and white and many places look like standard, run of the mill places. A truly special place I stayed at in Sicily wasn't even included. For random selection of bed and breakfasts, I suppose it could be useful, but even for that, I would recommend several websites instead that seem to have a much wider selection and are more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealized potential","review":"This book is derived from a short story, with the same title, in \\"Women at War\\". There is plenty of material, but the novel is a major disappointment. Perhaps the assorted myths, legends, and songs sprinkled in with the story inspire false hopes. Children seem to regress as they grow up, travel times are out of alignment with distances, the war sequence is as precise as a fumbled handoff, and the finish goes splat like a bowl of macaroni salad dropped from the top of the Sears tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"I am a great fan of Jane Yolen's writing - including the Books of the Great Alta. I read Sister Light, Sister Dark several years ago and was lucky enough to find a used copy of White Jenna when it was out of print.I had high hopes for The One-Armed Queen, but I found it to be a major let-down. I guess that White Jenna really seemed like the end of the story to me - this book seems tacke onto the end. But aside from that, I just found it a little dull, and I had to force myself to keep reading. I've never had that experience with a Jane Yolen book before. Usually, I find her writing engrossing and I devour her books a few days after buying them.If you're a fan of the Great Alta books, you might as well pick up The One-Armed Queen - but don't go into it with high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"I read White Jenna and Sister Light, Sister Dark and I loved those two. But this book just doesn't meet those standards. It was ok. I liked it because I found how the rest of the story went, but it just didn't seem to catch me.

That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition! When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section. The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs! Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years. Reprehensible and unconscionable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\`\`Lasting Valor'' an amazing story, told with amazing skill","review":"\`\`Lasting Valor'' is not only a superb war story, it is a superb life story. With this book, Vernon Baker and Ken Olsen have handed us a piece of history many of us never knew existed - and they have done so with captivating skill. A tightly told story, \`\`Lasting Valor'' doesn't bog down with the minutiae of war, but instead gives us a closer look at and a better understanding of the human drama that was World War II and its aftermath. From his life growing up in Wyoming to his time spent in Italy and his years in North Idaho, Vernon Baker allows us to see him as a human being and not just a war hero. He also gives us a vivid and honest tour through America's horrendous history of bigotry. It's a refreshing perspective and one we're all better for receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale about surving the ugly side of glory.","review":"Vernon Baker's life is a tour through some of the worst 20th Century America had to offer: from his roots as an orphan in southeastern Wyoming, through his childhood at Father Flanagan's Boy's Town to his glory years as a war hero who fought valiantly under racist officers he despised. Yet, in Lasting Valor, Baker never becomes GI Joe -- a war hero caricature with cartoon emotions. That Baker handled life's trials with an Everyman's mixture of frustration, anger and resentment shows that Baker was a soldier -- and a man -- of remarkable courage and dignity. That we were able to learn this about him is a credit to his honesty and Olsen's reporting. This is one of the few books I've read about a great man that also taught me something about mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to \\"stuff we should have been taught.\\"","review":"A timely book that adds to current discussions about race. Like the story of La Amistad, Vernon Baker's story is one that should have been heard by a lot more people a lot sooner. Baker and Olsen make us understand what it was like to be a black soldier in a white man's army and just as importantly, the unglamorous difficulties of being a soldier in often no-win situations.The story weaves between taught World War II battle scenes to growing up in small-town Wyoming. If you like stories about real people of character who unflinchingly tell a tale, you will like this book. It adds yet another refreshing perspective not only to the race discussion, but the realities of war.<B>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very bright and proud of it.","review":"I'm pretty easy going until you go out of your way to insult me. I have a sailboat and over 100 books on sailing; how to, historical, anecdotal, and horrible. This one is the worst. There is nothing in this book that you cannot find in dozens of places. The author is condescending, obnoxious, arrogant, and boasts of his contempt for editing (bee fourwarnd).

In my humble opinion, I think Brite has a true gift and talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Touches Poppy!","review":"I picked up Drawing Blood because I had already read (and loved) \\"Lost Souls,\\" her debut. As I paid for it, I hoped it would be as well-written. It was better! Poppy somehow manages to be extremely detailed but still really relatable and understandable. The book follows Zachary Bosch-- a computer hacker on the run-- and Trevor McGee-- whose father murdered his mother and little brother when he was five-- to the small town of Missing Mile. Sometimes gory, sometimes shocking, but always painfully beautiful, this book is amazing. It makes you really glad Poppy Z. Brite didn't become a chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Must-Read","review":"To say Brite has a talent for drawing in a reader is an understatement. There are so many features about this book that normally would have turned me off (wait, there's a compliment in here, honest): I'm not real big on the drug culture, the hacker mentality frankly annoys me, and I'm not always very patient with lush, florid prose like Brite's. Yet I found this book utterly compelling. The characters are richly drawn, and manage to be both thoroughly messed up yet thoroughly likable at the same time (something very few authors seem able to pull off). The \\"conclusion\\" (such as it was) was a little confusing, but this fits better with the story overall than a pat ending would have. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good, if not better, than her first book","review":"Though I am partial to Poppy Z.

She is definatly a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"It's intense, if not so much scary. Brite is amazing with this kind of stuff, relationships.

I guess you're \\"right there.\\" Immediate creativity..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book does not reflect brite's talent","review":"this book doesn't start out well with the inner monologues of a 5 year old who sounds 30. yet, because i liked brite's previous novel, lost souls, so well, i hung on and trudged through. unlike the developed characters and plot in her first novel, drawing blood is a grave disappointment. its mainly lots of sex scenes, domestic violence, and drugs. there is no real story to draw the reader in. its not a book i would reccomend to others. with talent such as brite's, i was very disappointed to see her name on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cartoon life","review":"This book centers around the two boys whose lives are missing that special something..............trust and love. Trevor McGee lost his family in a brutal murder while still a small child and at the hands of his cartoonist father, he lived through the torments of his mind only to find himself forced to return to Missing Mile. Zach Bosch is a computer nerd with his own disastrous childhood behind him and now he's running from the FBI after being caught out with his hacking exploits.This book is wonderfully rich and varied with each character, no matter how minor their role is, being an individual that seems to live and breathe from the page. Admittedly the first time I read it I was decidely ambivalent towards it but after a break of 18 months I returned to it and this novel is simply amazing.If you've never read any of Poppy Z Brite's work then this is an excellent starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted","review":"With every book by Brite I read, I love her even more. This story set in North Carolina centers on Trevor who is revisiting the house where his father killed his mother and brother and himself, but not Trevor. While there, he meets Zach, a hacker on the run, and the two fall in love and face the ghosts in the house, and in their pasts, together. Full of electric sensuality and vivid horrors, the book increases pace the deeper one reads, further and further drawing the reader in until it's impossible to let go. This might be the most accessible of her books, but I have yet to read them all, so. If it's possible to live in a book, that book would definitely be written by Poppy Brite."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST INTENSE, ENGROSSING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!","review":"This book kept me glued to the page from beginning to end. I have read it many times and still Poppy's writing keeps my eyes attached to every word. She has a spectacular sense of how to write detail and her characterizations of Zach and Trevor make you feel like you've known them all your life. This is very similar to her charachters Ghost, Steve, and Nothing in her previous book, \\"Lost Souls\\", which tends to be toward the more horror genre side, dealing with vampires. \\"Drawing Blood\\" is about two beautiful boys who through the hardships of family secrets, abuse, abandonment, and murder learn how also it is possible to fall in love and be close to someone. Other books to look for would be Poppy Z. Brite's, \\"Lost Souls\\", \\"Exquisite Corpse\\" (a cannibalistic book, also with two men looking for love in strange place), her \\"Love in Vein\\"--volumes 1 and 2, and lastly, her \\"Swamp Foetus\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time","review":"I was bored and in a local bookstore when I stumbled across Drawing Blood. I read the back and bought it, thinking it would be another amusing... horror book. Boy, was I wrong. I haven't read a book this good since Anne Rice wrote The Queen of the Damned. The way Brite develops each character into their own roles in awesome, and the way she meshes each one into a perfect puzzle of mystery, love, and horror is absolutely unbelieveable. I was so upset when it was done because I never wanted it to end. Her style is great, so good infact, that I felt as if I was watching a movie instead of reading a book. The plot is amazing, so is everything else in the book. I strongly recommend this to anyone, regardless of what genre you like to read, this book is truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawling Blood aka Birdland","review":"Thsi book is fantastic!We get to vist Missing Mile again and met with Terry,Kinsey and Rj again!Steve and Ghost are only mentioned about three times for all you Steve and Ghost fans(I'm one myself).We get to see the story about the haunted house on Volin Road.We meet Trevor,a twenty-five year old who was the only survivor of the house,and Zach,a computer hacker from New Orleans who can't seem to love anyone.It's funny.(...)You get so involved with the characters,I'm warning you,that when so go to the parts with the FBI going after Zach or Zach's best friend Eddy,you skip cause you don't care about them,just Trevor and Zach.This book is really great.The only thing I had a problem was that Zach growing dreadlocks it the epilougue,when so far in the book his hair has been spikey.There is no vampires in this book,like Lost Souls.Nothing about Christian and co.But read it,it's fantastic,great,marvalous,purple proze as Poppy Z.

It is marketed as a haunted house story. The book contains, however, precious little \\"haunting\\". It hardly deserves to be in the book store's horror section. The book is more of sexual coming-of-age story, heavy on the eroticism. I suppose that this would be fine if this is what I paid my six bucks for. That story line, however, got old very fast. I finished the book only because I expected the \\"haunting\\" to start at any moment. It never happened. The shame is that Ms. Brite writes very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Horror Novel","review":"Although the book is fairly well-written, it certainly is not a good thriller or horror novel. There is very little suspense in the whole book. For the most part, the book is a rather boring character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"The smell of cyberspace","review":"Less vampiric than Lost Souls, Drawing Blood conveys a tale about a youngman with a dark past. Trevor is the survivor or a brutal familial murder/suicide committed by his father, Robert McGee. Trevor, like his father, is a writer of a comix called Birdland. When he gets to New Orleans, he meets Zachary Bosch, a computer hacker. They hang out in bars. Travor and Zachary have an unlikely monogamous sexual relationship (the author is female) that brings these two outcasts closer. At one point, they find their way into the cyberspace where they both face their pasts. Trevor meets his father and figures out that they share the same murdering impulses. Drawing Blood embraces all that was once very hip at one point with the body piercing set. She has obvious read William Gibson and John Shirley before setting out on this book. It is good. But this book shows that Poppy Brite is a better writer of vampire stories than just another cyberpunk follower."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"simple minded story just never takes flight. Homo-erotic sequences have all been done better and many times before.

I was really hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for people with open minds and a longing dark side.","review":"All I can say about this book is that it moved me. Drawing Blood was actually the first book I ever read by Poppy. I was lost in her words from the first moment I opend the book. I have never been much of a fiction reader but when I read Drawing Blood I felt as if I were in it. It hits pretty close to home, myself being from North Carolina. I wished there was such a place as Missing Mile . After I read Drawing Blood I went out and got Lost Souls and had the same reaction. I even Had vivid dreams about Birdland Trevor and Zach. Her characters have such life. They have real personalitys. The gay sex in this novel was done so great that it made me change some of my veiwes on love between two males. I highly recommend this book for people who are thinking about getting Into Poppy. Even though it is not her first book she ever wrote it is definatly a good one to start with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much...","review":"I'll keep this review short...i can't say it was a bad novel, but it just seemed to me as if Brite was trying too hard to be sub/counter-culture...it read more like a young adult, R.L.

I was in the mood for a good dose of horror and the reviewer at my local bookstore said it was so frightening and evil she had to throw it across the room to get away from it. Now that sounds like quite a read! The reality wasn't quite so exciting and here I am a month later. It soon became very long and drawn out with minimal horror. I was compelled to put the book down, but hardly to throw it across the room for it's evil attributes.Brite is an interesting writer and I might even give her a try again but this book just seemed to take forever to get any place. Her characters were intense and appealing. The story line was tedious but unusual. I would give this book a 2.5 on a good day.

It's as if Poppy z Brite looked into the souls of two young men, and wrote what she saw on paper. This books was hauntingly rich, and darkly disturbing. The characters were built so well, i felt like I actually knew them. Anyone who does not like this bokk, did not read it. Praise to Poppy z. Brite!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"When I first read this book some time back I found it original, chilling and a tight piece of work. Coming back to it now I can't help but find it rather tedious and at times naive. The storyline itself isn't the problem, it is the way Brite narrates that makes me cringe. Obviously fans of the book, and Brite as a writer, are not going to agree with me on the next point but I find she relies on stereotypes far too much and her characters, although displaying some degree of depth, are quite two dimensional. The love scenes between Zach and Trevor are particuarly excrutiating. The narration here is juvenile and it almost seems as if she is rushing to make a point and move on to the next scene as if she is reading the text not writing it. The scenes are not well crafted and this is the feeling I got from the novel as a whole. To me it feels like a novel written by a randy teenager who has no idea how to craft a three dimensional story and has drawn from every stereotype available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent","review":"I was pleased with this book overall. It was one of the first books I have read by this author. The book flowed rather well and kept me interested throughout. Poppy has a pretty good sense of describing things really well. I could litterly see myself in Missing Mile, NC living the hellish nightmare of that dreadful place. The story like others have said, has great character devolpment. The only thing I found disappointing was that the novel jumped back and forth between the characters a lot and it needed more to the actual haunting of the house...anyway to me at least. Overall this was a really good book, fast paced and well written. I will definetly check out other works by this Poppy Z. Brite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gay Horror","review":"Gay horror -- the story is perhaps not all too remarkable, mixing the main horror storyline with elements of cyberpunk (though mailbox-hacking with a 2400 bit modem - wrongly described in the novel as 2400 baud modem - definitely belongs to another era). The novel is well paced (I finished it within a day), and for the creation of, and contribution to, this new genre alone the author deserves five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I can't believe the excellent reviews this book has received from previous readers. I have just finished reading Drawing Blood and the experience has put me off Poppy Z Brite for life. I don't think I will ever try another book of hers.Why? It could be the paper-thin characters who were so hard to give a damn about. Or it could be the uninvolving non-plot that goes nowhere but takes ever such a long time to do so.The initial premise (a young man returning to the house in which the rest of his family were slaughtered twenty years before) is intriguing but all opportunities to flesh it out are squandered. And the desperately \\"erotic\\" sex scenes are just tiresome.I found this book languishing at the bottom of the bargain bin in my local store and although I only paid 1 for it, I still feel a little ripped-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Amazing!","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites!

These are five stories that make up a novel, and it is not always apparent that the narrator is the same exact character from story to story, but the truth and the powerful feelings of each story present a great unity. In each chapter, the narrator grows close to a Jewish person who he loves and admires (though he has been taught to despise them as a class) and ends up hurting or failing them. Sounds monstrous, but it is a wonderful book.I confidently recommend this book to anyone interested in modern literature and European history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am happy camper","review":"This is a great Seller.

I knew when buying the book that it was written for strict yogis who are not only vegetarian, but also don't eat foods like onion, garlic, or strong seasonings. Even though I am not this strict a vegetarian, I thought the recipes could still be interesting and tasty so I gave it a try. Big mistake. I consider myself a pretty good cook, but I had problems with every one of the 3 or 4 dishes I attempted. There's no way these recipes could have been tested. The Eggplant Quinoa was the last and absolute worst; it was barely edible. I threw most of it away, wasting valuable food. Feeling I'd given the book a fair trial, I promptly pitched it into the recycling bin as I wouldn't dare pass it on to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"great pictures! bad recipes :(","review":"i really wanted to love this book. the pictures of the dishes throughout the book are amazing. this book does have some great info on yogic diet and fasting, but as i made a number of the dishes in this book i wondered if they really tested them out. the directions sometimes seem to leave out steps and/or ingredients, which makes it hard to follow. maybe i've just been unlucky with the recipes i've chosen over the last 6 months, but the what i've made from this book has not turned out (and i'm not a novice cook). it really is too bad that the recipes don't live up to the picture that go along with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are not great - missing steps, incorrect portions, etc","review":"I 100% agree with the last reviewer. I really REALLY wanted to like this book and to use it everyday. I have had nothing but problems trying to cook with this book. The steps are incredibly vauge, the amount for any particular ingrediant is out of proportion. I'm writing this review after attempting the banana-nut tart on pg 108. First of all, the amount of left-over mix for the crust is unbelievable - I could have cut the amount of ingrediants in half. There is no binder, so the whole thing fell apart. And the filling is just the same! I am a very experienced baker and cook, and I am so frustrated that this isn't working out!

Unfortunately these recipes were not tested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagerly anticipated but disapointing","review":"I was disapointed in the book Survivor by Mark Burnett and Martin Dugard. I was hoping for more behind the scenes information and photographs, but the book, I felt was a melodramatic journal recapping the 39 days with very little new information or photographs. I would like to have had more insight on the selection process and much more behind the scenes information and photos. I enjoyed the show, Survivor, watched all the episodes, and read newspaper and magazine articles printed during the telecast, so very little of what was in the book, Survivor was new to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Round Two","review":"Mark Burnett deserves an Emmy for importing \\"Survivor\\" to American household televisions during an otherwise listless summer of(yawn)re-runs. Action, suspense, and deception ran as rampant as the rats on Pulua Tiga each week. Therefore, I was extremely disappointed after reading Mr. Burnett's book. If you've seen the show then you'll find a lot of detail and background lacking. If you didn't catch \\"Survivor the first or second go-round then you'll be left wondering what all the fuss was about. My advice. Save your money, pass on this book and wait for Survivor II - The Australian Outback to premiere after the Super Bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivor","review":"I was too disappointed by the book. The book is filled with many inaccuracies. Burnett is also quite harsh when it comes to the Pagong tribe. It is just surprising to me that Burnett thinks he can make an accurate description on the castaways personalities (without really knowing them). I found the book more annoying and frustrating than an entertaining read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Much Here.","review":"This book is supposedly based upon Mark Burnett's journal of his forty days behind the scenes of the first SURVIVOR. There isn't a whole lot of new information here and there are many typos. Everything in the book is filtered through the mind of Burnett, which has positive and negatives. Positive: readers are given insight into how Burnett felt about the players of the game (he had several favorites and there were a few people he didn't like at all) and it's interesting to see how those feelings may have influenced parts of the show. Negative: much of what Burnett tells is old news, it's as though he was trying to reach a different audience with the book than he was with the show and therefore tried not to offend too many people. The book is simple to read (I flew through it in a day) and fairly entertaining. Fans of the show may enjoy it and it makes a good primer for anyone who has never seen the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"T.V SERIES was AWSOME, but this BOOK was DISAPPOINTING!","review":"For the most part, this book re-hashed what we saw on the T.V. series of SURVIVOR. I was disappointed in the lack of off-screen details of what occurred with the Survivor cast. I found the book to contradict what I saw on the T.V. series a few times, making me wonder which one really happened. The few photos in the book added very little to the book, and many of the pictures seemed out of place for the chapters they were in. Surely not the book to read if you've never seen the T.V. Series, however, as a Survivor fanatic, I did find out a few tidbits of interesting information about the show. Only wish the book had provided even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark!","review":"This book is a pale comparison to the well done tv show.

I'd suggest fans of the show skip this book and enjoy the the t.v. version.I hope that the Survivor contestants can write their own books asap as the show is now a part of broadcast legend and their views would be very impactful on this show's place in television history. The book doesn't accomplish this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting companion book","review":"Right on the cover, it states Offical Companion Book of the Television Series....and it is an interesting addition. having watched all the series (I know, I should be professing to watch only PBS, not schlock) I found this book added to an already enjoyable experience. Most interesting to me was all the background of the actual production aspect of the show. I would have liked more information on the production crew...what kind of person signs up for that? The book also would have benefited from rewriting. It was written as the events unfolded...fleshing out the facts would have been a huge plus. In the end it does what it says it will....it is an addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"T.V AWSOME, but this BOOK was DISAPPOINTING!","review":"For the most part, this book re-hashed what we saw on the T.V. series of SURVIVOR. I was disappointed in the lack of off-screen details of what occurred with the Survivor cast. I found the book to contradict what I saw on the T.V. series a few times, making me wonder which one really happened. The few photos in the book added very little to the book, and many of the pictures seemed out of place for the chapters they were in. Surely not the book to read if you've never seen the T.V. Series, however, as a Survivor fanatic, I did find out a few tidbits of interesting information about the show. Only wish the book had provided even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little thin on excitement","review":"I thought this book would be a bit spicier than what can go on TV, but I found details and stories to be a bit thin. It was as though the book was an after-thought to the hit show; another piece of merchandise not quite up to snuff. Not a bad book, but I think it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is supposed to read this book?","review":"Anyone who followed the series will find it incomplete, inaccurate, and boring. Many key elements were given short shrift or not covered at all. The analysis of the personality of the players is at the level of astrology.Anyone who did not follow the series will not find out much about it here. Who are these people whose pictures appear in the book? No captions and no clues by placement. Much too little.The book ends:\\"For those of you wondering: every word of this book has been written on Pulau Tiga, as events occurred. Nothing has been added or deleted in hindsight, ...\\"If this had been in the beginning of the book, I could have taken fair warning and not wasted time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay read, but with little insight.","review":"I picked up this book hoping to get a different view of my favorite TV show -- in fact, that only TV show I watched for a great while). However, I was disappointed to find that Burnett was -- admittedly, somewhat predictably -- more interested in the trials and tribulations of the crew than in the developing relationships of the characters. The castaways are given a single descriptor that serves them throughout the entire book (Rudy: grump. Susan: redneck. Richard: gay.), and are hardly developed. Where on the TV show the characters were interesting and three-dimensional, on the page they are flat and boring. The book is littered with anecdotes from crew life, that, while interesting, hardly develop the story of the castaways. Perhaps the book would be a bit more enlightening with more emphasis on the character relationships; after all, this is supposed to be a book about the SURVIVORS. Isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a Survivor fan, this book is for you!!!","review":"This book is written extrodonarily well. The author wrote the entire book while he was on the island, kind of like a diary. It gives you the background of the 'behind the scenes' of the cast and crew. Everything from setting up while it was raining for the tribal councils to where NOT to go on the island, and why Jenna did not get a video tape in time. I was thouroughly impressed with this book. Like I said, if you were a die hard Survivor fan, or if you just watched it occasionally, You can get a good feeling of what it was like for the crew on the island, and alot of indepth thoughts from the author about the cast members. Get the book, you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of fiction, in my opinion.","review":"I'm very disappointed with this book. I strongly doubt half the stuff this book discribes actually happened. Weird stuff, such as Richard having gay fantasies about Sean. The author describes one of Richard's dreams about making love to Sean in detail... how was he able to know what Richard was dreaming? Because Richard told Sean about it? I don't believe it.There are other things... the author talks about how the Pagong tribe had no respect and were all phony. Mark Brunnet's personal bias against certain contestants makes me wonder if the show really was rigged, or if the producers did sway the votes to get the outcome they wanted. Either way, the show was entertaining but this book was horrible. Get Stingray instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring novelization with little inside info","review":"Burnett seems more obsessed with psychoanalyzing Greg (the only reason Buis acts up, Mr Burnett assures us, is because he's an insecure boy inside). Very little insight or unknown info (Sonja's lesbianism is not even alluded to, why Burnett chose Jenna and Sean to be ambassadors over the castaways' choices). The only revealing info is about Kelly's duplicitousness, but when Susan's speech is misquoted, bizarrely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Survivor Fan","review":"I've read this book twice. The style is a like a Diary. It is very detailed and gives you a great behind the scenes look. I would recommend it to any keen fan of the TV show Survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here at all","review":"This book is disappointing. If you have been wondering how Jenna and Sean were chosen as \\"ambassadors\\", what the challenges were that weren't televised, or where the raincoats came from, you will still be wondering after having read this book. We learn nothing new and the author's voice is one of all-knowingness that's annoying, at best. Too bad: it could have been a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have You All Got Amnesia??","review":"I'm not sure if anyone could have been anticipating the release of this book more than myself. Known around the office as \\"survivor.com,\\" I couldn't wait to take my preoccupation to a new level. At first I was very entertained, but as some of my favorite scenes from the show were recounted, I found myself leaping from my reading chair, sounding frighteningly similar to Kathy Bates from Misery, shouting, \\"What's the matter with you people? Have you all got amnesia?? That's not what happened!\\" Misquotes were discouraging to me, and the \\"dozens of photos\\" were a bit of a disappointment. I'll still love the book, just because of its' association with the most significant television event in my life. I just thought potential readers should ensure they've seen the real (at least in my world), more entertaining story on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to cash in on the Survivor craze","review":"Here was a chance to get to read about what went on that didnt make the air but Burnett blew it. The book is a quick read so i would say you should probably read it at your local bookstore instead of buying it because if you are a fan of the show, like me, then you will be disappointed by the lack of depth to island life. It seemed to me that they rushed this book because they know that many of the fans would want to read a behind the scenes book, too bad they didnt take time to proofread it because the spelling errors stand out. Hope they dont rush Survivor 2 like they rushed this book. The one thing that was nice about it was that you could read alittle more background on your favorite castaway, in my case SUE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Good Book","review":"This book by Mark Burnett gave me a different view about the first Survivor. The details given didn't give much more insight than the TV show, but I did notice that the story was told somewhat differently.One very small downer in this book is the number of spelling errors, not many, but it is a small hint that this book may have been rushed and not edited properly.If you haven't watched the first season of Survivor, this book does capture some of the moments, but the VHS or DVD of season 1 may be a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Read Only For Survivor Addicts","review":"However it needs to be at least 500 pages long to cover what I wanted to know. I read this book in 7 hours. The show lasted 14. And most of the book covers what one learns from the show.I've got to agree with others about the awful (perhaps non-existant) editing job and lack of pictures. For photos, visit the CBS website. But if you gotta know everything you can about this show, you gotta buy this book (and wait for the \\"gag\\" on the Survivor cast to elapse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...tell me something new","review":"As a huge Survivor fan I was looking for some new and fresh information about what went on behind the scenes of the show, what the producers thought about all the media hype during the show, and maybe some real insight into the contestants that we didn't get on CBS. Instead it's as if Mark Burnett just sat down, watched the show, and wrote a recap. Bleh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"As a big Survivor fan I eagerly anticipated reading this book and bought it as soon as it hit the stores. I was sure I would read it all in one sitting but it took me a week or so to trudge through it. I expected to find out all the inside scoop on what went on when we wern't looking. You know, all the \\"dirty little secrets\\". Unfortunately these insights were few and far between. The book was more or less exactly what you saw on the show. I had seen every episode so I really didn't get much from the book. This book fell way short of my expectations and I feel it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!!!","review":"OK, for the record it is a semi-decent guide to what happened on the island.That being said, the editing is HORRIBLE. Betweens calls of Susan Hatch (?!?) Kelley and Sean's job as a Neurosurgeon (thought he was a Nurologist) the innaccuracies and misspellings will pretty much ruin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't SURVIVE my expectations","review":"Highly touted drivel! Little new info on the show. Terrible photographs (what few there were). You'd think that for a paper- back book that costs over 15 bucks you'd get at least a few glossy color prints. My hopes were for new and interesting tid-bits.......yes...my hopes were dashed. Most interesting new info was the true location of the \\"Survivor Bar\\" that Chief Jeff took Kelley to. Guess I'll have to wait for any gag orders to be lifted to get the real scoop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typo-a-rama and very poorly written.","review":"I am an avid fan of the \\"Survivor\\" show, and I bought the book primarily because I have been in withdrawal ever since the first season ended. However, as I read the book I could not get past all the typos and fact inconsistencies. The fact that once the author refers to castaway Sue Hawk as Sue Hatch makes me think that he really didn't take the time to think this out. I appreciate the fact that the book is a collection of memoirs that was compiled as the show was being taped, and I can understand that there might have been little time for a well thought out format. However, come on! The word \\"competition\\" is not spelled \\"compeition\\" (p. 221), and this is just one example. Clearly a spell-checker was not used in this book, and there is no excuse for that. With all the millions and all the glory, I think Mark Burnett could afford himself to re-take some high-school English and get an editor with a spell-checker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me Survive","review":"I was really hoping for more of a behind the scenes kind of feel. I loved the show and was eagerly awaiting the chance to know about the things they could not show on TV. The fact that there are no captions for the photos is sad. The book mentions how \\"Chief Jeff\\" and the production crew want to make life harder for Pagong, but there is no explanation of how this is done. There is just not enough explanation all around. I have to say I am very disappointed in this book (but it was quick to finish at least) and am now eagerly awaiting the tell alls by Jenna, Colleen and the rest (although, not Richards). I will even wait 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURVIVOR - BEHIND THE SCENES","review":"If you are a true Survivor Fanatic, you will enjoy this book. Mark Burnett, writing in diary form, gives you a day by day account of the events on Pulau Tiga. There is some biographical info on the castaways (more than I knew from the show), as well as a look into the strategy each Survivor was using in an attempt to win. Burnett also gives info on what went on behind the scenes regarding the \\"challenges\\" and the production of the show itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although I have enjoyed Robert Adams earlier work, I am having difficulty seeing the photographic merit of this current project.If one reads the text with the explanation that Adams is attempting to show some of the destruction of the wilderness caused by a man in the areas that were explored by Lewis and Clark, then there is a context and a meaning to be had. But if you look at the photographs on their own, without any explanation of the intent of the photographer, they appear to be bland and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of Tree Stumps","review":"Boy, is this a waste. Perhaps an attempt to decry deforestation, this book is just a whole bunch of bad black & white photos of tree stumps. 100 pages of it anyway. Then there are 25 pages of wholly ordinary photos of some extremely underexposed trees and disjunctive tree parts.If the author wanted to make a statement he should have reconsidered publishing this book, since after all it was made from a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog's Breakfast","review":"Perhaps I have become spoiled by eminent historians such as Simon Schama, Martin Gilbert, William Manchester, Stephen Ambrose or Ian Kershaw, but I confess to not being able to digest this turgid piece of work. The author is so bogged down in a morass of detail that he looses any sense of the sweep of history. Names of people and places pop up like ducks in a shooting gallery, and promptly disappear without our having understoood why they were referred to in the first place. The subject is admittedly difficult, but the author is clearly not up to the task of sorting it out for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Trudell - A True Poet","review":"This is a sensational recording of some of Johns' best.

Retard after retard interrupting the concert footage and telling us what they think. Can I have my money back? All I want is the live footage, no commentary, no opinions.

When we added a half bath, we needed to consolidate and make it look nice. This system did the trick.

It's a good idea to include sorting bags, but I think another nice alternative would have been a rod on top and a flat drying area on the bottom. So if you just need a rod for hanging drying, there's cheaper items out there. But if you really need the sorting bins, go for it.PS it came in an amazingly small box....it wasn't stable until every last piece was assembled.

Unfortunately this product is not well made enough to do that. When I first put it together, it was a little wobbly but once I really tightened the screws it was OK. But now that I have been using it for 4 months or so it is loose again and tightening the screws has not helped. Also the wheels have a very hard time rolling on carpet or turning corners. When I try to lift the cart to get it over the bump between the tile and carpet, the wheels fall off and they are a pain to put back on especially with a full cart. The sorter is just one big piece but it would be much easier if each of the bags was easily removed so I could take laundry out of it without having to move the whole cart. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone. It is just not very easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea... BAD construction","review":"I was so excited to get this... It looked to be a perfect fit for my needs. A place to hang and sort all in one. It's only problem is that it is just not sturdy.

He spends no time talking about actually players, teams or the games they played.

The mellow remixes are rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know there's something missing","review":"I bought Guerolito after hearing \\"Heaven Hammer,\\" the remixed version of Guero's \\"Missing.\\" That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of \\"Missing\\" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape. That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, \\"Clap Hands,\\" is at least a good time. However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, \\"Earthquake Weather,\\" (here as \\"Terromoto Tempo\\") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other. \\"E-Pro\\" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely \\"Farewell Ride\\" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Orig","review":"I'm a big fan of Beck.

It's not because it's \\"dated\\" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dogs"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised","review":"Doris Day is/was a great actress, but when she tried to play a farm girl with too much makeup on, she looked so foolish that I did feel sad for her. In later years years, I discovered that she had been forced into playing in this series, due to financial reasons. Still, just seeing her is a joy, but not in this. She was middle aged, they made her play a role that was suitable for a much younger woman. Denver Pyle was good, in this, as were the child actors that Doris later abandoned.I have many Doris Day movies in my movie collection, she CAN act. In this, you can tell she didn't want to do this series, her acting is terrible, but who can blame her? Her late husband had stuck her with this lemon. Her attempts to play a younger woman than she was failed.

A wholesome series that produced laughs without relying on vulgarity or the use of risque topics. Good natured fun. Doris Day shines in her role and gave it her all even though the series was done under her duress. Cast and crew are top notch and the setting is wonderful. Denver Pyle was excellent as her doting father. Interesting to note that he was only 4 or 5 years older than she. You don't have to be a Doris Day fan to enjoy this series.

The examples are a bit limited in scope, but this is made up for by showing the evolution of a simple class through many of the OO techniques available in Perl. He shows you how to enforce strict encapsulation, but also tells you that you probably don't have to enforce this. Various inheritance techniques and tools are extremely well explained and illustrated. And of course he makes wonderful use of the CPAN resources, letting you know that you are not developing software in a vacuum; there's a lot of resources out there and he shows you how to use them to your advantage.Perl is not C++, it's not Java, and it's not Smalltalk or Eiffel.

It's also confusing as to why the author puts down western monsters just because their 'motives' are never exlained.

Adding to it is the fact that pages which could have been used to publish more information on the character are soaked up by silly chapters like \\"Godzilla as a Parenting Tool\\", and a chapter where paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter studies the beast as a dinosaur. Pretty pointless since the big G is a guy in a rubber suit that only vaguely resembles any creature that ever walked the planet. The synopsis of all of the films is good, but the behind the scenes sections are too short. Artwork by acclaimed artist Art Adams and others compliment the book, but there's too much visual in this and not enough factual information. In the end, this book comes off as more of a big fannish magazine than an exaustive source of information. And that's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Kong Ran Home to Mommy","review":"Kong ran away at the end of Godzilla vs. King Kong, G lived to fight in 21 other movies. Nuf said.

Come on!! ) This book is a pretty good G primer. My only complaint: Its not long enough! 144pages for an screen legend who's been around for since 1954! That's an insult to him(?) and his fans. Come on Toho/Randomhouse/Sony you can to better than that. Other than this, the original Art Adams illustrations more than made up for the lack of pages. Recommended. -2 points for brevity..

Here, as in elsewhere, Collins is an acessible poet, a funny poet, and, in some ways, the ideal popular poet. While is no Joyce Klimer, he is also not Charles Simic, not Anne Sexton, not Creely, and most definitely not a Charles Olson. Nine Horses is sentimental and essentially bloodless. Here Collins seems to let the subtle sublime of some of his earlier work slip more firmly into the realm of merely clever. As Collin's popularity increases he becomes poetry's Neal Simmon, or even, its Terry Pratchett. Admirable for moderns of clarity and wit, but ultimately artless. Perhaps, that best represents the taste of modern America.

I could'nt believe this was the same group responsible for psycho social and violent by design.Canibus album blows this away.I't was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"The things that made the last album great are missing here. 1. The beats aren't as great. 2. They lost an MC. 3. The great artists featured are gone. 4. the content is all the same.I didn't like the lyrical content at all to begin with, but the genius of the production made me want to listen. I still have Violent By Design in my heavy ratation. So now we have over a dozen tracks of Vinnie Paz telling us how crazy, mad and anti-semetic he is. And it's not counterpoint to Jus Allah who's style made Vinnie sound more impressive. Before, where Vinnie changed his flow from track to track, now it's all the same. An MC screaming over a track, not flowing well with the music, talking about offensive subjects on beats that aren't ground breaking. Doesn't sound like a good CD to me. And it won't to you either. If you like Stoupe's production, go get the Canibus' CD \\"Rip the Jacker\\" Produced by Stoupe and you'll hear better rhyme skills, better content and an overall better CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mothership has crashed and burned.","review":"Psycho-Social is probably in my top 10 played CDs over the past 5 years. I really, really liked Violent By Design. I finally got Visions of Gandhi the other day, and what a waste. All the songs sound the same, and Ikon has really regressed with his raps ... he went from arguably the most out-there (in a good way) musician, in company with Sun Ra, George Clinton and Dr Octogon -- now he just comes up with lame raps about how tough he is and 5th grade insults about how much he hates you. **YAWN** Do yourself a favor and skip this and go get the Psycho-Social CD by these guys, and remember the days when they were still worth listening to. The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is for the beats, which these cats always do well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is utterly sad","review":"Okay, you may have seen a review I posted a few months ago singing praises for this CD. Please understand, after literally boycotting radio b/c of all the monotonous garbage they play (of all varieties, though pop is starting to attain a bit more substance, but that's never really been my thing), \\"Visions of Ghandi\\" seemed like a breath of fresh air. However, after a few months the CD started to get a little tired. Thought it's not as corny as the stuff on the radio, the blatant homophobia, religism, and tired violent hip-hop cliches make this a rather lackluster performance from Vinnie. Moreover, Stoupe has seemed to have fallen off as well. You may offer your rebuttal on this one, since there are still those out there who adore his beats, but I have to say, \\"nuh-unh!\\" Judging by the content on this particular joint, it is safe to ascertain that Mr. Paz has fallen into a state of intellectual catatonia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love JMT","review":"I really like this cd, with its amazing production and hilariously disturbing lyrics, but by far the standout track for me is \\"Nada Cambia.\\" I cannot imagine a more raw/funny flow. I can listen to it in any mood - if I'm in a good mood, I laugh at lines like \\"I hate anyone and anything who embrace you/ who f*ckin raised you/ you a f*ckin disgrace/ come around here and you get bucked in the face...\\" especially when combined with the light, floaty sounds of the production by Stoupe. And of course if I'm mad, the song really fits my mood. Overall a great cd, but I can understand how if you take Vinnie Paz seriously, you can be offended by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paz and Stoupe are Back!!!","review":"All i can say is, WOW! Once again Vinnie Paz and Stoupe created one of the most interest and entertaining albums of the year, with many guests, inlcuding the one and only Canibus, also Kool G Rap, Non-Phixion, and the list goes on. Stoupe's beats just get better and better, he once again proves, in my opinion that he is one of the best producers ever. The entire religious theme to this album is great, and gives the entire album a sort of spiritual feeling. If you like nothing but raw and hardcore rap music, then go and cop it, Visions of Ghandi, one of the best albums of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 is closer, but still dope","review":"some fans love it, some hate it. if you look at it as a jedi mind tricks album, it doesnt beat out violent by design, and would be average. but as a album compared to the other [stuff] out, its fantastic. Jedi mind tricks is stoupe the enemy of makind (producer) and vinnie paz. Stoupe is the best producer around, period. (just check out canibus' rip the jacker) and the beats on this cd are crazy. their so many layers to the music, you'll hear something new each time. vinnies lyrics are indeed less intelligent than before, and more violent, but hes still enjoyable. the guests make the album even better, with non phixion kool g rap outerspace rass kass, etc. every song is listenable, i high suggest getting this and rip the jacker, their the albums of the year. be sure to check out the 3 bonus tracks 2 minutes after the last song..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Crap","review":"This album is horrible. that's all i have to say.

Vinny paz was once a talented mc, now he is just poor and more like 50 cent with each new release.

Dunno what went wrong, hope jedi mind tricks don't become another group who start amazingly and then trail off into a self destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same!!!","review":"jeesh! if they could just come up with some more topics of general interest rather than plowing the same old ground over and over and over and over. you get the idea. some really interesting beats n samples.the music was fresh but the text was mighty tired. try Peanutbutter Wolf or the World Famous Beat Junkies. maybe M Boogie fer a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"These guys are more or less always on top of things.All they had to do was put in a few more classic \\"J.M.T.\\" beats and a few less \\"Deliquent Habits\\" beats and this would have been perfect. Don't get me wrong \\"Deliquent Habits\\" are great but Jedi Mind Tricks don't need to be ripping off a style that's already been run into the ground (ie - boring ol spanish beats). If they came up with some new and interesting spanish beats, then that would be cool. But they didn't so now we wait and see what the next one sounds like.Anyway go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Smash","review":"Another smash hit by JMT, this time with the help from Non Phixion, Canibus, and others. Once again Vinne Paz(a.k.a. Ikon the Verbal Hologram) rips up the scene with his ultra violent vocals, and Stoupe laying his wrath down on the track. This album is a must have addition to any JMT fan. Their are some really raw tracks on this album, stoupe incorporates many samples from old gangster films, and some spanish music to keep every track pure to the street, he even takes samples from Max Payne the video game in one track, which I thought was a nice touch. There are a few downs to this album which make it not quite as good as their previous LP Violent By Design. First of all JMT is just not the same without Jus Allah(Former Member), Stoupe Kills several of the tracks with his raw ability, and personally I just think Canibus is wack lyrically. Otherwise this is an album all heads should have, cop this S*** right now! Also peep Canibus - Jack The Ripper(produced by stoupe)"},{"rating":"2","title":"raw hip hop","review":"Just got my preordered copy of Visions of Ghandi, and it is phenomenal. Many thought that this album wouldn't compare to Violent by Design because of the departure of Jus Allah. But this is more versatile than VBD and I believe has a better overall feel. The only thing that is disappointing about this album is the lack of Army of the Pharoahs guest spots from Esoteric, Virtuoso and Bahamadia. The new guest spots are just as good from such bangers as Non Phixion and Outerspace.Stand out tracks:Tibetan Black MagiciansKublai KhanRise of the MachinesAnimal RapThe Wolf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paz is the problem","review":"I don't know what happened to this group. Psycho-Social is one of my favorite discs both lyrically and musically. Stoupe still proves he's one of the best producers in hip hop, but Vinnie Paz's violent Muslim rhetoric has got to go. I have a hard time believing the man who once rapped \\"I chose to be enclosed and I fold too, like origami / Comprehend the theory of reflection like Parmatma / In the epic Sanskrit history of the world like Mahabharata / Praise to His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\\" is now only capable or writing drivel like \\"I'm like Mussolini, I rule with a iron fist / I stab you in the bladder with a dagger and watch you die in piss\\". Time for Stoupe to step out on his own and start working with some worthwhile MCs.My issue isn't really that they're violent, it's that there's no creativity behind the violence. And he seems to have lost all semblance of flow, he really just shouts now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy","review":"Sorry but JMT did not live up to my expectations on this album. Track 4 and the track with Canibus are the only tracks that are honorable. It is as if they did not spend quality time on it at all. You compare this to \\"Violent by Design\\" and I gurantee you will see what I am referring to. No Apathy, Jus Allah, Tragedy Khadafi? C'mon now...when you get all those heads laying down complex mind boggling lyrics you can't loose. Overall I will still always be a JMT fan...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Well, I'd say all of these songs are well constructed, dope lyrics whatever... but wth? all the basslines sound the same or what?

The beats are WAY too Flamenco, and Ikon, I just definately don't see him as a \\"thug\\" or \\"killa\\". That's all he raps about now. What about Psycho Social album? I'd rather Ikon be a f---in nerd than a \\"thug\\". This album sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You'd Expect From These Cats","review":"If you have never heard JMT, you might like this disc more than loyal fans. But as someone who's been listening to JMT for a while now, I gotta say that I was disappointed with the lyrical maturity of most of these songs. Granted, JMT's never had the tightest lyrics, but still, VP falls seriously short on most tracks. Especially when he's gotta go up against some of the best beats I've heard from an underground album in recent months. In fact, the beats are so dope on some of these songs, you almost wish that VP or any of the guest emcee's weren't rapping over them. It's as if the album is torn between mediocrity and excellence. \\"Blood In Blood Out\\" & \\"Animal Rap\\" have some of the best Stoupe beats I've ever heard. Nevertheless, they're still not good enough to keep this disc from heading toward the bottom of the pile.Mr. Oat says, too f---ing bad, cause I was looking forward to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happend to jedi mind?????","review":"yo, remember when jedi mind was dope? yeah, me too. this album is weak. the beats are a really bad example of what stoupe can do and vinnie paz needs to get his teeth knocked out for spitting some of the worst rhymes i've heard in the underground world in the past 5 or 6 years.if you're looking at this trying to decide between this and violent by design you're in a bit of trouble. first, violent by design blows this out of the water. second, violent by design is a little dated and unless you had it like 7 years ago you're probablly not going to be nearly as into it now as you would've then.vinnie paz basically can't rhyme so don't even bother picking anything up aside from violent by design."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these shoes","review":"These shoes are very beautiful.

I've been to many many shows since then, but none compared to this one - especially since it was a venue intimate enough to allow them to sing a cappella and unmiked in front of the stage (My Sweet One). These discs brought it all back to me - I felt like I was there all over again.

The product is horrible. It is filmsy like it is made out of some cheap plastic.The Karabiner is poorly designed, the clip part is a cheap piece of plastic that doesn't clip very well. You can go to a dollar store and buy an actual metal carabiner for $1 and it will perform better. Which is what I ultimately ended up doing.The pulling mechanism for the earbud is decent. However,the diameter of the product is too big. It is closed to 2 inches wide. It has this white outter rubber material which easily gets dirty. The cord is too short. It only pulls out from the earbud end. I wish it was retracble on both ends.My general dissapointment with the karabiner and casing should not be confused with the excellent sound quality sony gives us as usual.

However, if your local college offers Brazilian portuguese (and you have the time), I think it would serve you better and may also be less expensive.

It has been 7 years since I spoke the language (and even then I was not extremely fluent tho' could hold a conversation, understand, and picked up the accent). I have started to begin learning it again. But, the tapes don't give you the immersion that you can get from a classroom setting where, if you advance enough, you are forced to think in the language...not just repeat memorized phrases...and you usually have a lot of classmates who grew up using the language. The tapes don't teach you (nor do they profess to, I believe) how to say a completely new phrase using the words you've learned....that is, how to translate what you want to say in english to what you want to say in portugues.I don't think this series is worth [very much]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"This tv only worked for three weeks.

So maybe after extended use and having burned all of the paint off you can eventually use this as a grill, but for now I use it as a support for heating water or cooking in a pan. But since I bought it to use as a grill and to cook food directly on its surface (like the product description says you can) its not what I thought I was buying.

Very boring.Second, the author attacks a few of the commonly known oddities and unexplained phenomena of evolution to ultimately conclude that the entire theory is fatally flawed. (The author says that evolution is not even a sound theory.)Third, maybe it was me, but it felt like there was very little evidence presented to support ID. The one theme I felt like I read over and over was this: if scientists cannot explain it, and if it seems too complex to have evolved, it must have been created by some \\"intelligent designer.\\"There are better books out there on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, old, redundant","review":"It's all the same gibberish as is out there, adding nothing to the conversation.

Wells is a skeptic with integrity - he rightly rejects arguments which have no evidence and does not pretend to have all the answers.

Ann Coulter, on the cover of the book, recommends its purchase by saying \\"Annoy a godless liberal, buy this book.\\" David Limbaugh, another far right conservative, gives a recommendation on the back cover. As a progressive liberal and ID supporter, I find it offensive that ID is often marketed to the most right wing of conservatives.

To be honest, it makes me even laugh that there's a diatribe. How can anyone believe in evolution is beyond me. You would think that, if random mutation and natural selection got us here, by now millions of \\"intelligent\\" scientists would have found the cure for all the diseases that afflicts bodies created by \\"stupid\\" random mutations.

It's explaining complexity we have evidence for (the universe) with complexity we have no evidence for (the designer) and stopping there instead of going on to provide an explanation for the designer itself when the existence of an intelligent designer would demand at least as much explanation as the universe it created.

As with all armor vehicles, compromises were made.While more mobile than a truck, a 1/2 track is more expensive and not as mobile as a tank. However, the Germans led the way with this concept. This book traces the history of the one of the most infamous of all half-tracks. It has many very crisp, detailed black & white photos, line drawings and descriptions of the many varients that were made of this useful vehicle. As with all German weapons, demand far exceeded supply.I really like the fact that the authors compared the U.S. M-3 half track to the German half track.

The sound is timeless, good produktion , songwriting and singing very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe South Classic Masters, a collection of favorites and hits.","review":"If you are not familiar with Joe South, this album is a great collection of hits and fan favorites. Joe was a singer/songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia who wrote beautiful songs from the heart, that also reflected the times and tumult of the Sixties. The music scene in Atlanta was exciting and vibrant in the Sixties. I grew up in Atlanta, and I was a working musician in Atlanta during those great years. I had the good fortune to meet Joe South around 1968-1969 and was always impressed with his talent and humility.This CD is a great introduction to Joe South and his songs. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice overview of an eclectic, prolific pop composer","review":"A handy 12-song summation of the hippie-era recording career of songwriter Joe South, a twangy, soul-drenched pop genius who wrote a remarkable string of smash radio hits, ranging from Lynn Anderson's \\"Rose Garden,\\" one of the defining moments in the 'Seventies countrypolitian scene, to the thunderous hard rock anthem, \\"Hush,\\" which put the band Deep Purple on the map. South's own versions of these songs are markedly different than the hits -- his \\"Rose Garden\\" is cluttered and compact, while his \\"Hush\\" is wildly funky and fun. Also included here are \\"Games People Play,\\" a top Pop hit for South himself in 1969, as well as \\"Walk A Mile In My Shoes,\\" which was one of his few actual country entries, and several lesser well-known gems from his back catalog. It's more rock than country, but still funky and down home, and worth checking out to see how these great songs found their genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of his best known hits","review":"If you are a casual fan of Joe South this is a fine purchase. Some reviewers stated the sound was not faithful to the originals on LP(talk'n bout you and me - and the games people play). But I personally found the sound quality to be EXCELLENT. Great music from Joe South. I even love the picture of J.S.on the cover and the cool late 60'S/early 70's shirt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent early Carl Weathersby performance","review":"This recording captures Carl Weathersby's stinging guitar during his early tenure with the Sons of Blues"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for beginners","review":"I found the book to be just a tad above the level of those true confession magazines, intriquing to me as a teenager but not sophisticated enough to be of interest to me as a mature adult.

In those transes she would have \\"dialogues\\" with God which her sisters recorded, thus the title. Catherine was used by the Pope to be peacemaker between warring cities and as such she was a Papal apologist, meeting with nobles and dignitaries throughout Europe, a different role for a woman of that time. As mystic she would dialogue with God about the church, the pope, priests and recieve counsel that are recorded in the \\"Dialogues\\". The prose is instructional, not exhortive in nature. It is not a book that one reads expecting to come away uplifted and enthused, rather you will recieve sound direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reciever, especially for the price","review":"I have been using this receiver for about 3 or so years. I have no complaints except for the lack of HDMI inputs/outputs which were not needed when I purchased it.

I am currently running a 5.1 Polk Audio package RM6750, and I am truely impressed by the quality and loudness of the setup. I have a decent sized living room, and have had complaints from my neighbors on it being too loud. I am very happy with the product and have had no problems. As for the other reviewer, he may have a faulty unit, I have never heard a fan noise and I have pretty good hearing. This unit will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine with a major drawback","review":"I'm sure this receiver is just fine for watching movies etc., but if you do any sound design work and need to pay special attention to your audio, avoid getting this guy. This receiver has a fan inside of it and ANYTIME the receiver detects a signal it starts spinning and making VERY distracting noises. When I even listen to small sound snippets, the fan still spins. Why?? It's not like this would cause the unit to overheat... Don't even try disconnecting the fan because the unit will detect that it is no longer connected and it will reset itself. So... if you like the sound of your audio accompanied by a whirring fan, then this is the receiver for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide to Florentine food","review":"Miller's book was our primary guide for culinary experiences on our recent trip to Florence. It didn't disappoint. While the section on restaurants is reliable, albeit somewhat tilted toward eateries in the Oltrarno, the real value of the book lies in pointing the reader to the better bakeries, markets and gelaterias around town.

Look at the others when planning your trip, but take Miller with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Are Not Enough!!!","review":"I found this wonderful guide while preparing for my return to Florence this past Fall for more research on the sequel to my novel,The Giuliana LegacyThe author's helpful and concise reviews were amazingly accurate in every case. Moreover, she helped us to find wonderful restaurants, cafe bars and wine bars that will be much-loved favorites for years to come. There are fabulous tips on restaurants in every price range, but we especially enjoyed the small inexpensive local spots we might never have found on our own, like the charming and delicious Casalinga in the Santo Spirito. We returned there again and again, and once home, wished we'd gone there every single day of our all too short stay in Florence.Ms. Wise Miller, the words \\"Thank You\\" cannot begin to convey our gratitude for your splendid little book.

The prose is sharp and funny and nicely complemented by the author's hilarious pictures.The best compliment I can pay to the work is to say that I wish I'd read this book when *I* was thirteen and coping with the painful fact that my best friend and I had grown apart.

Sadly, Latin-America is not part of the high-school programs in history. In college, hearing this for the first time , you need the students to grasp the countries one by one not in a bird's eye view style. Otherwise, they are left at the end of the semester with the same amount of knowledge they came in, and if they remember something just from the book it would be very very fuzzy.Therefore, this survey book confuses more than it teaches.

The more you win the lower you score. Atari Technitions, in my opinion, know about this and give you the run around when you ask for their help.

The installation also puts (w/o any option to decline) one of those \\"Free! One month of NetZero\\" icons (wow, I hate those!), including an executable file that you have to search out, since deleting the program won't remove it.I find this sort of requirement objectionable (not to mention the advert) on something I paid for, especially when it's not on the box, and not in the installation documentation. It's especially irritating when it's on a game that kids play, and when the advert for NetZero is slipped in.

In the mean time, I bought a new computer and when I installed the new copy it didn't run on my new puter. I emailed Attari tech support and got the usual run around.

This is possibly the most useless TV tool and/or calibration tool that has ever been marketed. It is about as high tec as a plastic pair of 3-D glasses and about as useful also. When you buy a calibration disc you are not interested in someone's singing career or her \\"cutsy\\" expressions about calibration. This really is a disc that explains the 4-5 basic components of TV calibration whilst leaving the viewer hanging at the point where more info. is necessary. It may be helpful to someone who has not owned a color TV in the last 45 years but otherwise there is no value added. It is certainly easy to use because there is nothing really to use. Absolutely terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the simple minded","review":"This DVD is okay. It does what it advertises, but there are much better calibration DVDs out there. This DVD doesn't contain any audio calibration, which is what I also wanted. Some of the calibration on the DVD is too subjective for my taste. I really thought the music video at the end was rather pointless. If you're a guy with a short attention span, this DVD will probably work for you.I found that \\"The AVIA Guide to Home Theater\\" DVD was much better. The AVIA DVD provides much less subjective calibration. It contains audio calibration. It contains suggestions on the types of cables to use, and other helpful suggestions for setting up your home theater. The only downside of the AVIA DVD was that it wasn't widescreen, unlike this widescreen DVD, but in reality the widescreen video is only useful if you're too blind to notice that your aspect ratio on the TV is causing circles to look like ovals.Personally, I thought this Monster/ISF DVD was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has got to be something better.","review":"Don't waste your money on this.

As one reviewer pointed out, I would not lend or recommend this DVD to my friends. The setup is so basic and limited as to be a waste of time. I did a better job of adjusting my settings without this DVD than with it. It helps you adjust a whopping four settings: brightness, contrast, tint/hue and sharpness. Wow, all the settings my 1975 Philips console TV had. They needed to make a DVD to show me how to set the tint so that people don't show up green? Don't even ask about the \\"music video\\" on here.

The Makita turned out to be a pleasant surprise. New, light, powerfull and an adjustable shield (wish I had one on the B&D)to direct the grinding dust and sparks away from the operator were the immediate highlights. The Makita is of the quality that I've become accustomed to using other Makita products. It also has a spring loaded on/off trigger with a lock on if you prefer.

Of course, I had heard of Knapsack before, but had never checked into it until I finally got this CD. I kept on playing the first three tracks over and over and then listened to the rest of the CD. The vocals are suprisingly good and you can feel the emotion, along with some heavy guitar riffs and punchy drumming. Decorate the Spine is one of the my favorite songs, especially when the drums kick in during the second verse. Of course, you can easily listen to this CD all the way through since the songs are that good. I found Heart Carved Tree to be depressing, yet the lyrics and the vocals combined with the guitars make it still a pretty good song, grief and all. Overall this CD is awsome. Knapsack been getting a lot of playing time in my stereo, and I doubt it will see a changing of the guard any time soon.

Now I don't. Say what you will about the book--though I found it to be very helpful--but you can't argue with the thousands of people like me. The sad thing about some of the critics writing reviews here is that they're not willing to give people the freedom to change if that's their desire. If someone wants to change, let them.

I have had many gay friends, and still do. There is every reason, scientifically, anecdotally, and casually to accept the fact that some people are born homosexual and that any attempt on their part to deny it or change it is going to result in frustration, anger, and neurosis.This book begins by making the Biblical argument: it's wrong, so don't do it. Therefore, any reader will realize that what is to follow, whether it is the rhetoric, the \\"evidence,\\" the \\"science,\\" or the rationalization, is all going toward the desire to prove a \\"conclusion\\" that the authors have already reached.Silly books about serious subjects can do nothing but harm, and this is a silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, silly, sad book","review":"Thankfully, most Christians do not share these authors' sad, self-loathing view of the Bible and of being gay. The REAL, original texts of the Bible don't condemn homosexuality at all -- in fact, they never even MENTION it. Therefore, there is no need for serious, sincere Chrsitians to be \\"cured\\" of being gay (as if that were even possible). Luckily, this kind of pretentious, hateful, exclusionary, bigoted Christianity is in the minority. As a serious Christian, this book embarrasses me. As a human being, it fills me with pity for its authors. I can only pray that God will show them the truth and the errors of their way before they do more irreparable harm to innocent gay Americans struggling against the bigotry of such so-called Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could it this book 0 stars I would.","review":"I am quite tired of the kind of old concepts that are spread around in this book. This is not done out of love but out of total blindness. Following what is written in this book will not lead to freedom but more misery and who needs that? Life is hard enough as it is without someone who is gay being forced to hate themselves, to hate who they are all because of a book that was written thousands of years ago and has been passed down to so many hands it's not even the same book.

I saw the book and my stomach turned. I actually read it to see what it said. It was filled with page after page of lies about gay men and women. It was horrible, they linked homosexuality and gay figures with every negative thing imaginable and blamed it for basically any problems of the past, present, and future.

Because the book uses religion and a a person's sexuality to act abusively.

This book does none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"great way to continue self loathing and ignorance","review":"This book is rediculous and what's more depressing is the fact that people find this book helpful.

Francis and Clare articulate such an incredible vision of what it means to enter into the mystery of Christ. Perhaps the most splendid account in this collection is Francis' words to Brother Leo on what constitutes true joy.

It was written in the early 90's when sound Iguana dietary needs were still being re formulated.There's probably still allot of sound advice in the book, just weigh it with up to date information like Melissa Kaplan's Iguana's for dummies, or James Hatfield's Green Iguana The Ultimate Owner's Manual.

It's free and there are hundreds of other Iguana keepers to talk to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extensive reference for Iguana owners","review":"This book is not an iguana beginners book, but an advanced reference in learning more deeply about the physical and behavioral aspects of the green iguana. In having owned 2 iguanas, there are a lot of interesting facts and trivia to learn about these magnificent creatures. The information in this book takes you a step above simple ownership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the screen!!!!","review":"The camera it self is very nice, i loved it while it lasted.... which is where the problem is. I had this camera for one month before the screen in the back cracked. There are many other people who have also had this problems and it is expensive to fix. For some reason the protection of the screen is very weak and needs to be upgraded for this camera to really be worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not predictable","review":"I have this camera and am taking it back tomorrow.

I've been trying to figure out if I am not setting something correctly and have given up.

That is, it's definately aimed toward the pot-smoking community. Being an avid non-smoker(marijuana anyway), I still enjoyed this record. Violent J takes the place of the Dorothy character from the origina Wizard of Oz book, Monoxide Child from Twiztid plays the Scarecrow, Jamie Madrox from Twiztid plays the Tin Man(or Tin-Tizzy as he refers to himself), Blaze Ya Dead Homie plays the Lion, while Shaggy 2 Dope plays the Wizard. The story unfolds almost like a book, each song another chapter into the twiztid world of Oz. If you enjoy any music put out by Psychopathic Records, this is for you.

This is exciting, filled with emotion, action and rich detail. A great addition to the world of the Farseers and Liveships, and it's great to see the series converging."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW....","review":"I awaited the release of this in paperback after having read the Farseer triology. I won't wait for the second book in this series to hit paperback. As soon as it is out in hardback, I will be buying it.This book lives up to everything I hoped it would be. It is a fluid continuation of her Farseer trilogy. Reading the Farseer trilogy is almost a must to get the full dynamics of the emotion Hobb weaves in this book. I honestly tried to \\"ration\\" this read. I simply could not do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book, but not where to start","review":"This is a fantastic book. Laden with all of Hobb's characteristic intrigue and angst, I could not put it down. However, Hobb's editors have done readers a disservice in the way they chose to market these books. Although this is the beginning of a trilogy, to fully enjoy it you should have read six books previously.First, the Farseer Trilogy, starting with Assassin's Apprentice, which gives you the story of Fitz's life to date. Failing to read this trilogy will seriously impact the reading enjoyment of Fool's Errand.Then, the Liveship Traders Trilogy, starting with Ship of Magic. It is not utterly essential that you read the Liveship Traders trilogy to understand this one, but this trilogy contains many spoilers, and it seems a shame to waste the reading enjoyment to be gathered from the Liveship Traders trilogy by reading them out of order.Finally, enjoy this trilogy. It ties together many of the threads left hanging in the previous two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see everyone again","review":"I stayed up until 2:00 in the morning to finish this book. It was so nice to get back with Fitz, Nighteyes, and the Fool. I really missed them. Robin Hobb rehashes some of the happenings from the Assassin books which was a good thing for me because it brought back the memories. I think one would miss quite a bit in the Tawny books if one did not read the Assassin books. I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitz STILL a big baby.","review":"Like a stalk of grain in a high wind, our silly protaganist still goes any which way the wind blows in this follow-up to the Farseer trilogy. Seems the only decision he's made all on his own was to hide out for years (like a big baby.) Years have passed and due to lack of any other human interaction besides another kid, Fitz remains insecure, impressionable, and easy to lead around by the nose as always. Soap-opera style interactions are also far too cheesy and predictable.Oh Hobb. You wrote 3 outstanding novels with the liveship trilogy, but this Farseer thing is atrocious. I won't be reading the rest of this trilogy, or anything else Hobb has written. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of stuff, with scattered good things","review":"One damn thing after another happens to Fitz, fifteen years after the end of his previous adventures. Neat low-tech survival details followed by romance-novel gushiness seemingly designed to pre-empt the slash writers, some court intrigue, action scene, action scene, character self-torture, action scene. Dangers pile further and further on Fitz, but the whole thing is past-tense, so you know something amazingly convenient is going to get ratcheted in place just in time....On the plus side, you no longer want to throttle the main character for his endless tortured internal conflicts---there's a _new_ character who's _worse_. Also, what could have been a simple Good Guys/Bad Guys scenario is nicely complicated (here's a hint: what if ACT UP turned really nasty).If you have a lot of free time, this is less of a waste of it than your second hour of web surfing, but more than your first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"Spoiler ALERT!!!!!I loved the Farseer Trilogy, and really liked this book until 3/4 of the way through. If youve read it you know what I'm talking about. The death of Nighteyes. Hobb took the best character in the whole series and killed him off. I'm so pissed off that I'm not even going to finish reading the rest of the Tawny Man series. A big F U to Robin Hobb for screwing up something that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Nonsense!","review":"I was shocked by how poorly Fitz's story has played out. The characters irritate more than interest and the plots are severely lacking. For some real fantasy, read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire or Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. This book is drivel. Plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"changing time","review":"To say that I was eager for this novel to hit shelves was an understatement. I did not wait in vain. Hobb managed to age Fitz while still giving everyone the scarred, battered young man we'd grown to love.The development is nothing short of marvelous. This book will have you shaking your head, laughing, and wiping back tears with empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters and plot, but poor pacing","review":"When considering the Tawny Man series as a whole, it is an excellent conclusion to the story begun in the Farseer trilogy. However, the Farseer trilogy was the better written half of the story.The Tawny Man series suffers from a lot of laborious reminiscing and build-up. The pacing of each book is not the best, and you'll find large stretches where the story plods and you find yourself wishing you could skip ahead to the end.The strength of the Tawny Man story is that it finishes the story of characters you have come to know and love. You find yourself caring enough that you make it through the slow parts and come to a very satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up finds a new angle","review":"As a follow up to a sucessfull series, this novel has managed to find a new angle to approch old and well known characters. While it may be possible to follow this book without haveing read the farseer series, I do not sugest it. The joy in this book is as much in how Fitz looks back at his old life fifteen years later, as it is in the specfic plot of the new book.The book takes place fifteen years after the last time we saw Fitz. He is living with his step-son in a small costal farm, when his old life comes back to reclaim him. How he decides to face this new crisis will agian shape the fate of his nation.This novel reads well and seems very short for its four hundred page leangth. Overall it is not as good as the first books, but is still a quality novel worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the decisions were unrealistic","review":"I understand a building of plot needs to occur, but this was really unrealistic. The moment they KNEW that the prince was there and that there was obviously a plot. 2000 soldiers should have been sent for and surrounded the area and all people should have been arrested and questioned. There is NO POINT to worrying \\"what people might say\\", you take the prince back and punish all people involved. It would have been a good lesson for the other nobles, burn down that castle, kill all the cats, and strike that noble family down. Drag the prince back home and make him stay at Buckkeep until he smartens up or is king and can't leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"i couldn't put it down","review":"Ah, the familiar characters, the interesting plot twists, and the enchanting way Hobb has of telling her story. I could not put it down, and I don't regret it. This was definitely a book to savor and when I was done... I can't wait to get the 2nd book in this series. My bf and I are eagerly waiting for Dec. 2nd, when Golden Fool will come out in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read Farseer Sequell","review":"Pete Hanlin {Hickory Creek, TX}I was discouraged at the conclusion of the Farseer trilogy (being unaware of the Tawny Man books). Once I discovered this continuation, I was delighted to find the same quality of writing continues on through this series. Although not usually a fan of the fantasy genre, these books now rank in my top 20. Farseer should be a pre-requisite read, but if you are a Farseer alumni, I can not fathom why you would hesitate to continue on this excellent literary journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the Return of the Farseer","review":"After what were less the less than thrilling Liveship books, I finally got back good old Fitzchivalry Farseer. Robin Hobb has done an excellent job of painting the picture of the life of solitude that Fitz has made for himself and the pull that his former life has on him. While not a whole lot happens in the span of this novel, it is none the less important to the development of Fitz and Dutiful. The insights provided to further explain the Fool's character are especially fascinating and I can't wait to dig even deeper in the next two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Adventure","review":"I bought this book after reading many good reviews on it and the author. It was no disappointment. Well written and well developed. Even though I had not started with the first three books I quickly was swept into the story. I have but one negative point on it: At the beginning the story the sexual encounter was not needed. It was evedent of there relationship before what was described though I thank the author for not diving more into the scene. Besides that I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoyed letting a new world unwind around them becoming engrossed in the life of this unlikely hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Hobb Rocks","review":"Robin Hobb's 'Farseer' fantasy novels are great. They are original and fresh, not knock-offs of other fantasy worlds. They are character based and contain a unique and compelling perspective on the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good...","review":"I read the Farseer Trilogy and jumped right into these books. It is a testament to how good they are that I read all six books one after the other without a pause. At the risk of sounding sexist, I will say (again) that female fantasy writers seem to have a knack for evoking an emotional response in me that I don't find elsewhere. And Robin Hobb is, so far, the best of the best. I was so wrapped up in these books and these characters that they became one of those sign-posts that mark periods in life for me. Very human, very believable. Cant' recommend them enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"I agree with the excellent reviews about the discussion on Aaron Copeland. However, the performance is NOT full orchestra (where are the brass that add so much to the emotion of the music.) It wouldn't be so bad IF there had been any indication that this was an arrangement (ballet?) with a reduced orchestral content. No mention is made by Maestro Thomas or the written descriptions associated with the DVD. I have played this piece in several different orchestras but never this arrangement. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely CD.","review":"Mendelssohn's early death robbed the world of a great promise-still his music shows an astonishing maturity of emotion for one so young.

The widest ski which would fit into this rack must be under 70 mm at the tip. My narrowest downhill skis are wider than that, and I am not even talking about all-terrain or powder skis. A wider pair of skis would rest on the bent tip of the hooks, which may over the time damage the skis. One could perhaps use this rack for cross-country skis, but forget about it if you need a solution for downhill.I bought it and had to return it cause it is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"My husband & I were looking for another DVD when a clerk at Walmart told us about this movie.

I guess the military taught him well. He made a bomb in his backpack in less than 30 seconds without opening the backpack. I may watch this movie again to figure out how to do that one. His parachuting concealing abilities are uncanny. Somehow he manages to hide the leg straps from everyone then they magically appear as he jumps off the building.

That scene gave the movie some hope, but it is terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This movie is simply not convincing.

The only thing the makers of this movie tapped was a keg. Then they got drunk and made the pedestrian mob/car accident chase scene. After that the hangover sets in and \\"Most Wanted\\" becomes a terrible movie. Keenan Ivory Wayans is not a hero. This movie made me cry. I cried because it was so unclear how Keenan was able to hide a parachute in his police disguise. Does the police disguise come with a parachute? I am going to find out. The movie never ever tells you. In fact the disguise is only a hat. But it is a smart hat because it fools the bad guys into thinking it's a police hat. That's because it acts like a police hat. Keenan can't act at all, so the hat is smarter than he is. So I have to call people now, while I am in tears, trying to figure this out. Do not buy this movie, don't even steal this movie. Throw this movie away."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAST WANTED PIECE OF CRAP!!!","review":"This is one of the lamest and stupidest movies in all of cinematic history.The plot was predictable and boring,while the action scenes were no better than the plot.The jokes were lame and Keenan Wayne is not an action star but a comedian.Was this movie made in a week?STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Framed Honorable Convicted Marine...","review":"In a mission Sergeant James Dunn (Keenen Ivory Wayans) disobeys a direct order from a superior, which results in Sgt.

Dunn's relocation a group called Black Sheep, with similar background as Sgt. Dunn, rescues him during the transportation, and they are sent on a mission to assassinate a man who is a traitor. However, this is just a front for the actual target, the first lady. Sgt. Dunn is framed for the assassination with his finger prints all over the sniper rifle and Sgt. Dunn's future seems to be very dark. Most Wanted is an action film with poor dialogues that forces the story along and with characters that seem contradictory to their real nature. In the end, Most Wanted provides a flat cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"The film used some technology that was exploited one year later in \\"Enemy of the State\\". It contains mystery and suspense interspersed with action. The more-than-one subplot presents some unexpected scenarios and keeps one's interest up to the finale where it all comes together nicely. DVD has basic features, menu of play/scenes/bio/setup with an added extra of being able to watch the movie with only the soundtrack playing. You'll probably want to turn on subtitles for that. Good quality video and audio with no noticeable artifacts."},{"rating":"2","title":"bald everywhere","review":"Most Wanted Feb 18 2013Good action movie thriller. Keenen Wayens is good.

I'm happy for these people for the benefits that it has given them. No one however, discussed what you can expect in the way of \\"music\\". Actually, as the title suggests, this is not music, but \\"sounds for meditation\\". Each selection is indeed as they state \\"Pure Tone Scale Technology\\". What that means, is that each selection is one of seven \\"tones\\". So for the chakra tones, you get 2 minutes of one uninterrupted single tone. The first selection is 12:23 minutes of these 7 tones, one after the other. If you think that this will be a benefit to you, please buy this CD. Personally, I expected something to help carry me through my meditation and this was a bit too monotonous (mono-tone) for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great disappointment¡¡¡","review":"This book really frustrated me.

The first rule of the plan is to eat a high protein breakfast. For me this has to be at 6:00 am, since I have to be at work very early, and I am never hungry before 9:00 am. However, I dutifully ate the breakfast that I didn't want. The plan requires A LOT of protein. A \\"fist-sized\\" serving of protein 3 times a day adds up to a heck of a lot of calories. I just couldn't do it without being uncomfortably full. And I started piling on the pounds in no time. Ending every day with a potato, which I usually wasn't hungry for, hardly helped my waistline either.The nightly potato DID cure my insomnia, so there may be something to Ms. DesMaisons' research. But I am starting to question the trend of labeling every bad habit as an addiction. A lot of people have had success with this program. I gave it my best try, but I don't think it's for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can change your life.","review":"I've read *all* the books and tried so many \\"diets,\\" but never found one single program that was able to make a lasting difference in my life and weight.

She states in the book that this is not high protein but then she turns around and tells you to consume about 1/2gram of protein per pound of body weight! Neither of these diets concern themselves with the dieter getting proper nutrition. Without consideration for the body's nutritive needs, neither diet works in the long run. Ms DesMaisons claims to a PhD in her self described \\"first degree ever awarded in addictive nutrition.\\" Both of these titles are from the almost non-existent never-heard of internet Union Institute. The catch phrase alone, \\"addictive nutrition,\\" is itself an oxymoron. Any serious health practioner (in fact anyone with common sense) will tell you that what's addictive is not nutritious.

To portray ALL ranch life as abusive and unequal is highly offensive to this native Montana rancher's daughter.For another, more equal, view of Montana ranch life, I suggest \\"Growing up in Paradise,\\" by Helen and Edwin Nelson with Arch Wagner.

However, the 1/2\\" lockring then broke when I was tightening! I was using a screwdriver to tap tight and it broke in two. Of course I kept going and finally after tweeking and adjusting I got everything set how I wanted. Turned on the circuit breaker and it did not work....I went back to the manual and went through the troubleshooting guide and the unit did not work. It seems like the manufacturer spent all the money on the remote sensor and bought the cheapest lighting base. Having recently installed two motion sensors I can say this one is questionable at best.

The protogonist, a beautiful Chinese maiden, was in love with a young American Officer at the onset of the Chinese Civil War in 1948. Fate would have them drifted apart and each had to endure the sadness and cruelty of life. They crossed each other in 1958 during the Que-Moy War of Cannons that dragged US into the China-Taiwan conflict. They finally reunioned twenty years later on the small island Que-Moy again. This is the island that Communist China bombarded with nearly half million shells in 1958. They were determined to rekindle their love affair not knowing that a larger political conspiracy was brewing around them. The tragic ending would bring tears to your eyes. If you are interested in the triangular relationship between the US government, China, and Taiwan, then this book will give you the answers. This is a must-read for the China fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"informative and dull","review":"While the book contains a trove of interesting historical details, which could have been woven into a compelling narrative, the narration would be, I think, jarring to native English speakers and it's hard to assess the novel's merits without taking that into consideration.

Nickelback has a mix of Fuel, A Perfect Circle, and Three Doors Down but still doesn't carry one recycled quality in its bones. It is an alternative rock band with a VERY original sound. Although there are only 11 tracks to this album, every one is a GREAT song. I have had this album for a couple months now and I still jam to it almost every day, beginning to end.

I heard Leader of Men and Breathe a few months before they started getting radio play and I knew this band from Canada was something to contend with. Little did we know silver side up was going to be a massive pop/rock success, and bring nickelback into everyhouse hold, from teenage girls singing along, to 20 something metal fans rocking to the cruching sounds, to Mom and Dad finding something they like as well.Highlights from this album are Breath, Leader of Men, Old Enough, and Worthy to Say.For first time fans (hearing them on ALL THE RIGHT REASONS, or THE LONG ROAD), you might not like this right away, but it will grow on you quickly.

The next day I bought their album wondering if it would have as much energy as the live show. The answer, HELL YEAH! All of the tracks (esp. Leader Of Men and Breathe) are great songs in their own right and the way they transfer from slow to mid-tempo to hardcore metal is flawless.

The animation seemed terrible, especially for a Gonzo show. Frankly, I was very disappointed in this show, especially after all the build-up expecting another amazing Gonzo series. But, sadly, Gonzo really let me down. The basic plot (if you can even say it has one) is really just an excuse to show too much fan service, mech battles (totally uninteresting btw), and gun fights that make no sense. My fav character wasn't even a main character, which just goes to show how much they developed the lead characters. Anyway, this series was a big let-down, and I would only recommend getting it if you're into fan service (which I'm sure most of you are, lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple review...","review":"Anime checklist...1.Boobs (check)2.Serious Heroine (check)3.Goofy damsel who always gets into trouble (check)4.Bossy chick with big boobs (double check)5.Robots of some sort (check)6.Fan Service (do you even have to ask?

Tracing the journey of a tribe stripped of its ancestral land, the children in the refugee camp prepare for a national music competition. Details of their personal lives are revealed, along with their passion for music. Any music lover will appreciate this film, and all who strive to overcome hardship will identify with its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Dance Uganda","review":"Planning a trip to southern Uganda. This fairly recent documentary gives an insight into both rural and urban Uganda. While our trip will be medical based and this film is education based, it appears to capture both the stable southern part of Uganda and the less stable northern part. It's basically a African \\"Hoosiers\\" type of film, about a music contest rather than basketball, with a kind of happy ending. We'll watch again after our return to see where the film maker's bias's were. It's not a travel film suitable for small children as the interviews are nauseatingly verbally graphic. It fits the mold of 40 percent uplifting versus 60 percent depressing genre of modern documentary films."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.","review":"What can I say? This movie was incredible. I was so attached to the three children is centered around--you really get to know and love them. The film work is awesome as well. The story does a good job of both showing how the conflict has deeply affected them, but also of how they continue to live. The narrative style is awesome as well, because unlike most documentaries in which you watch once, are informed, and never have the desire to pick them up again, War Dance is a story you can watch over and over. This is an absolute MUST see, particularly if you are interested in learning more about the war in Northern Uganda, but even still if you don't know a thing about it. The stories of the children are incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Sombering","review":"The cinematography of Africa and war torn Uganda is beautiful, amazing, and saddening in \\"War Dance\\". It serves a a bleak backdrop for an enlightening film set in a refuge camp where a group of children, scarred by civil war, learn their tribal dance to compete in the national dance competition.The most heart-breaking and genuine moment of War Dance is when a former child soldier confronts a captured rebel soldier about why he (the soldier) participated in kidnapping children and indoctrinating them into becoming children soldiers. The bravery of that small child and the empty soulless response of the soldier were the most powerful scene's in a film full of them. I highly recommend this film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War Dance","review":"This was by far, hands down the best documentary film I've seen. The content needs to be brought to the awareness of all people in possesion of a TV/DVD player. The cinematography and editing was beautiful and amazing. It looked and felt like I was across the other side of the world there with these beautiful children. The stories of the children presented from their perspective in their own words will move you to tears and simply must be seen to understand and feel what they have suffered through and experienced. What I loved most about this film besides the stories, the people, the music and dance, is the message of hope and healing that is possible for these children with a little help from people who care enough to do something."},{"rating":"2","title":"a glimmer of hope","review":"I have worked in conflict areas for 10+ years and rarely find movies that are both positive and actual accounts of real life...the directors did a marvelous job portraying a people brutalized by war who have found normalcy and hope. The music and dance are fantastic, of course, but the kids...they are truly remarkable. People have always asked me to describe my work and the people I come in contact with...difficult to do...so I've started giving this out to friends and family as a taste of both the absolute horror and wonderful sense of humanity and hope one finds in war/conflict. Well done!! Would recommend even for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resilient Africans","review":"Documentary films are not often sought out by movie goers or at rental stores as they are often so two dimensional, informative and then possibly inspirational or provocative. This film is all of that and beautiful, tragic, exhilirating, and even triumphant.I have seen many films over my life and I would consider this as one of the best. I will never forget one of the lines in the film when a child from the war zone of northern Uganda gets the opportunity to go to the capitol Kampala with their school music group and says \\"I can't wait to see what peace is like\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be your best","review":"The movie documents that atrocities of the Lords Resistance Army's atrocities, murder, and violent attacks of citizens of North Uganda. A small school converges to bring traditional and creative dance to a festival of over 5000 students. Pantago does not win the grand music award, but they do bring home a trophy, for the first time in the communities history. The movie has a lot of dance, music, color, and energy to offset the sadness of war. We can not look at war with cold hearted distain. Instead, we must feel the suffering and empathize with the innocent victims of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"References, NOT Allusions","review":"While this book has many interesting tidbits of information that may make their way into writing, they are most definitely not allusions. At best they are simply literary REFERENCES and therefore this book provides little beyond what you would find in a typical encyclopedia entry about the keyword. Who was Ahab, Frodo, Medusa, etc. Where is hell, olympus, or Narnia. What was manna and so on. Unfortunately, the examples follow the same pattern. Whereas an allusion is indirect and subtle, the examples in this book are direct and explicit references to the keywords (ie \\"He was crazy like Ahab,\\" instead of something like a subtle quotation from Moby Dick suggesting the character of Ahab). I got this book mainly for the examples in order to see the different ways allusions have been used, but all the examples are simply examples of literary references, not allusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Nancy Drew Book","review":"The characters are: Nancy Drew a detectiveGeorge Fayne a detectif too,Ellen Mathieson a professor, Pamela, David ,Keith are all students of professer Mathieson,Censtier, Solo,and Jules.The story takes place at a market, an art stoteo,an apartment,and Paris.Nancy,George and Pamela are sitting at Pamelas favorite cafe wen all of a sudden they hear the squeal of braks and the blair of a trucks horn.
