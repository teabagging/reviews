This is the kind of movie that you invite friends over to watch, to have a few beers with, and to gather around and take turns making jokes about, laughing at the movie every chance you get.This is a cult movie in this respect, make no mistake about it. Like most such movies, it is not for everyone's taste. However, if you want to watch something that you can laugh at freely this is the perfect movie for you.Among the highlights are a paper-thin plot, terrible acting by all concerned, a corny sounding narrator, plenty of skin, and a lot of gratuitous violence. In other words, this is very nearly the perfect movie for me. It is also almost perfect as silly entertainment. I recommend this to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even with free VOD credit. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!","review":"This was absolutely horrible! The storyline was just stupid and accompanied by a very annoying narrator. If you want it for the nudity, there were only a few times with any topless women, and even then they weren't very attractive. Honestly, there was one woman who I thought was a man until she took her top off. Don't watch this, I beg you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much effort does it take to find ecstasy?","review":"Fair, at best.This runs under 80 minutes, a good 10 from a scene with a nurse dancing on a table, while the narrator blah-blah-blahs about how twisted and sado-masochistic these broads are. Are they really maniacs, and do they find ecstasy?Half the time, I was saying to myself \\"when are these sado-masochistic broads going to show some gory, unadulterated action?\\" The movie has its moments, but the narrator spells way to much out, a little too much telling and not enough showing (bordering at insulting).No, this isn't as good as \\"Rabid Grannies,\\" but okay for a cheap thrill. It's not as gory as one would hope, but not bone-dry for that matter.No, these nurses did not find ecstasy because even the annyoing narrator admits that they are bored. I admit, I was bored too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Frames","review":"I've seen better frames at the 99 cent store. These not only look cheap, they feel cheap.

Waste of money. Buy something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Amazing Ever!","review":"This acrylic frame is just fantastic. Incredible really, the way it displays what you place within it, as if there's nothing between you and the two-dimensional inserted likeness - as if the medium is nothing but air. As if you could reach through the transparent plastic and touch the flat depiction produced by thin overlays of sprayed paint, tiny droplets distributed at the sub-millimeter scale, with no interleaving plastic medium (except when the frame is held at a forty-five degree angle with respect to the sun such that a glare produces an oblong oval, undulating when said frame is held in hands of even superior stability).Overall, I regret this purchase least among prospective non-purchases made or un-made on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched 81/2 X 11\\" frame","review":"The plastic frame isn't very expensive, but I really don't like paying for something that has a scratch already on it. I didn't notice until I took out the cardboard backing and thought it was part of the plastic. Unfortunately, it was a 2\\" scratch that is very noticeable when you have a white background. Since I bought this for the classroom (no glass) it will do, but again, I don't like paying for scratches."},{"rating":"1","title":"not standard of quality I am used to in this product","review":"I have purchsed this type of frame at a local art supply shop that is no longer carrying this item. The surface for mounting the picture on was divided down the middle with an open seam in the cardboard frame-filler. Normally this surface would have been a solid smooth sheet of cardboard. Divided, means it undercuts the quality of the surface of the photo/poster or in this case, our grandchild's art work. I kept it because I promised him it would be framed and on my wall today. I would NEVER purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear Box, Should've Been Called Cheap Box.","review":"As soon as I opened the package I was disappointed. I was imagining done thing a little less cheap looking. The back of the frame is NOT plastic as it seems, it is cardboard & cheap cardboard at that. It didn't stand up well, it was flimsy, & looked awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched, scuffed frame","review":"I don't blame the seller for this, as the frame was packaged and obviously new, but the inside of the photo frame was scratched and scuffed. It the right light, it looks terrible. Note also that the frame is clear acrylic on the sides, and not black as seems to be indicated in the photo. This is unattractive on a desk (what I bought it for) because you can see the paperboard insert through the sides and on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"\\"The frame that started the company over 30 years ago remains one of MCS top sellers. Built with quality and care to protect and display your treasures for years to come.\\"WRONG. First of all the picture showing the 4x6-inch frame makes it appear to have a black border or that the sides might be black but they aren't which could be workable but the description above states says this frame will \\"protect\\" your treasures... WHAT? How can this plastic, totally clear frame protect my treasure when it has poorly made cardboard backing? And the cardboard is so cheap that it tore the first time I tried to remove it. So sad. Maybe I'd feel better if I'd paid $1.00, Hey, that's what I should have done - gone to the dollar store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear box frame","review":"A clear box frame is nothing special. This one was high quality. Fast service from the vendor. Always a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke of a frame","review":"Don't be sucked into this deal. The backing is barely thicker than a piece of paper, so it doesn't support the frame which is heavier. Bought in hopes to give as gift. I'd be embarrassed to give or even display. Skip this offer. It just means work for you to return, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design for cardboard insert.","review":"The box frames by MCS consist of a clear acrylic five sided box with a white cardboard box inserted from the back.For the smaller size frames than the 16\\" by 20\\" frame the design is quite elegant. A photograph may be simply mounted on the front of the cardboard box which is then inserted into acrylic box, for a clean looking presentation. The cardboard box, with holes in the back for hanging, is designed so that any edges are hidden from the front and sides.The 16\\" X 20\\" frame, however has a different design for the box. There is a junction of cardboard going across the front of the box, and complex cardboard junctions on each end of the box. Rather than having a clean \\"instant\\" (like the smaller frames) presentation a user must make a number of aesthetic repairs to the cardboard box before mounting his photograph.It is hard to understand why MCS chose the very awkward design for the cardboard box insert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, inexpensive frame that never goes out of style!","review":"I keep a collage of my son's school pictures on my wall, starting with a preschool picture, all the way up to present, which is 10th grade.

Shipping charges crazy..","review":"I needed to order 24 frames for a special project. The 24 frames were about $90 as expected.However, the shipping was $495! That's not a typo!

I realize these frames can be delicate so require extra care, but $7 shipping per $4 frame. No thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine -but beware shipping charges","review":"The items purchased were fine, and delivered promptly. Just what I was looking for.

These boxes are about an inch deep, so it fit the t-shirt nicely. I'm sure documents and pictures would be even easier to frame. For the shirts I had to come up with a creative way to keep the backing on the frame. All in all, I'm so glad I didn't spend tons of money on shadow boxes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith Hayes at Her Best : Being Funny and Irreverant","review":"Judith Hayes has done an excellent job of presenting the absurdity, contradictions, and irrationality of religions in general and Christianity in particular. And she does so in an informal, down-to-earth fashion that makes reading enjoyable. She also briefly shares with the reader her journey through religion to where she is today, a freethinking humanist. Truly, a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good, short study of christian beliefs.","review":"This book is good for beginners. It does provide some adequate criticisms of christianity, but, at times, is too emotional. As a scientist, I am logical and must be emotionless, and prefer books that are the same. Mrs. Hayes does know what she is talking about, and writes with just a touch of sarcasm. Perhaps the last chapter should have been the first chapter. This is not a scholarly book for serious study, but for light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disapointment","review":"From its title I supposed that this book would show what gods other than the God of Abraham have to offer, and how I might avail myself of their services.

Shadows go in different directions. Light where shadows should be.Flag moves slightly w/o being touched, apollo 15. Mitchell saw stars on the way back from the moon, he wasthe only astronaut to do this. Sidewalls of the LM were the thickness of two sheets of aluminum foil, about .006\\".Impossible to get through the Van Allen Radiation Belts w/o physical damage or death to the astronauts.I have looked at lots of Evidence on the moon landings and to me it was Fake, all Fake. thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of details.","review":"This book tells the story of how Apollo was made from the people in the ground point of view. The book is full of details of the history, and also full of characters (that some time are difficult to remember). But after all it made me live the history that I never lived and kept me reading for hours (even if I know how Apollo 13 ended).So I think this book is a must read for space enthusiast.The only thing I would criticize is that it begins too slow and finish too quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A band of unknown guys accomplishes the impossible.","review":"This story will pull you in and make you feel part of the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"the last word","review":"I am new to apollo and I decided this book should be my way into it. It is a carefully crafted and sensitive piece of writing but its strength is not in the unearthly technicalities but in explaining the earthly politics - this was the biggiest and best pr stunt since the pyramids and is unlikely to be surpassed for hundreds of years. I personally enjoyed the description of the nasa contract management regime and the role of the driving force in the shape of a person, Joe Shea, in this case. This book has to be in the top ten along with the Bible, complete works of shakespeare etc, but if you want a shorter 'rocket-powered-read' and like to read about crazy technical stuff - Ben Rich's Skunkworks is in a class of its own. In fact some of the craziest Lockheed stuff must have been going on at the same time as apollo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Institutional history of the space program","review":"Highly readable and highly original account of the institutional origins and development of the US space program, focusing on the leaders at NASA, industry and the government, and their key contributions. The account is the perfect complement to histories of the program told through the lens of the astronauts, auto-/biographies of key players, and accounts of technologies. A must-read for anyone interested in Apollo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Details","review":"I haven't even finished the book yet, but I wanted to write a review asap, because I don't want other people to miss out on this one.This is by far the best Apollo era book I read. Even the roles and computers of the Mission Control Center are described into detail. Very indulging and historic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive!","review":"I found this 'history' very comprehensive. Like all others on Apollo certain areas receive deeper treatment than others. I found it heavy going in parts but it is good value for money. A pity it was out of print for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was looking for a technical insight into the incredible engineering marvels required to send a man to the moon and this book delivered. The analogy of standing an aircraft carrier on end and blasting it into space really puts into perspective just what an accomplishment this was. I'm thankful for a book like this that can bring the wonder of the Apollo program to a generation like mine that didn't have a chance to live it.The only time I found myself skimming pages rather quickly was during political commentary. I mean, I understand that it was also an incredible feat to get American voters to support this type of expenditure in the 50's and 60's. But the book lost me a bit when talking about the politics. Then again, that may be telling of how we take for granted these types of huge government expenditures today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this spearmint toothpaste!","review":"I never realized how much I hated toothpaste until I tried Tom's of Maine spearmint toothpaste. I am hooked forever. This stuff rinses out of your mouth. Not like most toothpastes on the market where you have to rinse and spit, rinse and spit and still can't drink orange juice or coffee. With Tom's, you brush, rinse and you can still go to the kitchen in the morning and drink coffee or orange juice without gagging on the combination of leftover toothpaste and citric acid/tannic acid. I don't think I will ever try another toothpaste again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toothpaste","review":"Tom's of Maine makes quite the toothpaste. Granted, the taste isn't a real knockout at first, but once you become accustomed to it, you will never want any other toothpaste. This toothpaste rinses clean and leaves no aftertaste like your standard toothpaste. Also, my mouth feels almost as clean as it does after a trip to the ol' dentist. I don't get that with all of the other brands out there.Another thing that this toothpaste has going for it is that the makers are doing something friendly for the environment and the customer. I don't mind plunking down a little more change if I know part of it is going to a good cause. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those tree-hugging hippies, I just appreciate nature a little more than the average joe out there. I'm also tempted to try Tom's of Maine's anti-perspirant, since most of today's offerings leave me a little red and irritated in the underarm region. Heck, I guess I really am a sensitive guy. Awwww.

However, I don't think that was the main thrust of the book. The sisters, their lives, and their secrets were. The murder was simply the catalyst. It is interesting to see how these women pull together, and pull their lives together. I was struck by the idea that every child in the family sees their family history differently. It made me think about my own childhood, and how my siblings remember what I remember.My only real problem was with the father. In order to do what we ultimately must believe he has done, he must have been, at best, a fool. He was an MD, too, which makes part of the secret more unbelievable to me. Suspecting what had happened, and then having it confirmed, I just hated this character and so had some trouble with those who were motivated by love for him. It's a small flaw, though. The book just isn't about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Last Dance","review":"Absolutely wonderful! I could not put it down. This is a tangled web, magnificiently written, of a family and their struggles with life's decisions.

I don't like authors who assume their readers are too dumb to catch on. Once I figured out the secret (only a short way into the novel), I skimmed the rest only to confirm my guess. Everything I had predicted would happen did.

Although you could possibly take some ideas from it and it is fun looking at all these amazing cakes, some of them are so far out there (like a chess set or leather doctor's bag) you better be a really skilled home baker with a lot of time or a pro.

The fact that the name of this book includes the phrase \\"The Life of Dizzy Gillespie\\" is a shame, or sham.

If you're looking for a great jazz biography that is full of color, try the Louis Armstrong \\"An Extravagent Life\\" book. I read this approx. 600 page book twice just because it is such a colorful story about a jazz musicians LIFE.

That was after 250 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable, painstakingly researched bio of jazz giant","review":"Shipton's biography of Gillespie is the first to reveal that the famously married Dizzy had a child out of wedlock.

We now find them thicker, rougher, and they irritate our baby's bottom like all the other wipes. Did Pampers change the chemical formula? Did they change the wipes themselves? What a shame.

For us, what caused a problem was the change to include citric acid. As far as I can tell, you now can't find a Pampers wipe that doesn't contain citric acid, which causes our kiddo's skin to turn bright red (which is quite painful). We switched to a Huggies senstive wipe which doesn't have citric acid. It's not as good as the old Pampers Sensitive, which we hope the company will choose to reintroduce.So, if your kid suddenly starts reacting badly to wipes, it's worth checking the package to see if something has changed.

The Huggies can torn on half if you want to. (But they don't rip while you're using them) These Pampers are tough, and if you manage to tear one in half, you're left with all these scratchy, stringy fibers on one side. Ugh. Not a pleasant experience... imagine how a baby would feel. They are also VERY dry, and I have actually found them to BE irritating to my own sensitive skin.

Fastway without David King, really? No disrespect to Eddie Clark but without the outragous range of David King,, the band is not the same. As a bad Fastway is sooo overlooked for true '80s metal band. Eclipse by the \\"Hollywood Metal Band Scene\\" (i.e. Motley Crue, Ratt, Cinderella, etc) the bands true \\"energy\\" was never really appriciated. What made Fastway a great band was not complex guitar riffs that Eddie thinks are so important, but just the way they played as a \\"group\\". Infact, none of Fastways music was really complex at all, just good 'ol rock-n-roll basics, what made it special was the energy of \\"the group\\".

Certainly not the Fastway that I saw as support act for the AC/DC - 'Flick Of The Switch' tour. Now,that was incredible! 'On Target' is merely Fastway in name ONLY.

This album sounds like it could have been the sound track to a cheesy 80s high school teen flick - tons of keyboards, almost drum machine-sounding drums with tons of bad echo effects and just plain bad vocals. The focals are thin and full of sing-song pop harmonies. I'm sorry Fast Eddie, but this album has absolutely no redeeming value...NONE! I just want to make sure I have made it clear that this album is horrible on it's own. It does not need to be compared to other Fastway albums to be considered this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A commercial flop","review":"How can a man say that Fasyway was better without Dave King?

It's only on there with a screw and the screw stripped right out of it. I have tried super glue with the screw and it just won't stay on.

I also found the product to be easy to put together, which is a plus since none of us wants to have to wait for the hubby to do it!! I liked it, until I tried to attach it to our kitchen chair, the starps that are supposed to hold the seat to the chair do not stay tight at all, you just have to give them a little tug and they will loosten up. Afterward my hubby tried for an hour to get the straps to tighten, with no luck.

This seat is great for that because the tray and lap straps can come off and be used as just a booster seat. I wanted a seat that I did not need to strap her into so she could climb in and out of the seat herself. This was the only one I found that had a bump in between the legs that wouldn't be uncomfortable for a child her age. I feel that the bump helps her to stay put. My only gripe about it is that the back support comes out of place at least once a day, but it easily snaps back into place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I had a bad feeling when I first tried strapping this to one of my kitchen chairs and I couldn't get it real tight.

One of the restraint straps that go around my child kept coming out of the back of the chair. It wasn't holding him in anymore. Finally one morning a restraint strap came out again and he flipped the chair by leaning sideways. He ended up upside down on a tile floor with the kitchen chair and booster on top of him.

I fell for the scam that Epson printers save money because they split up the RYB color cartridges.

It shouldn't cost me what I pay to fill up my tank with gas, or what it costs for a month of cellphone service for one phone, or the price of w wireless-N router, to put INK into my printer.

Because for the same price I could have gotten these ink cartridges AND TWO black ink cartridges at Costco. Oh well. Live and learn I guess. Also, because there wasn't anything wrong with the product, the cost of the return was on my nickel. So, needless to say future purchases will be from, did I already say, Costco?

Oh, note that if one cart is out, then the printer won't let you ignore the error and make a emergency print; even if you have plenty of black and just want to do B/W. You're stuck until you fork over the money and get that other cart replaced.I am going to cut my losses and toss this CX6000 in the trash, I am so disgusted.

Lamb of God is making some of the best metal out there these days, I would rate them as definately top 3 modern metal bands. Some of the best drumming in recent years. All members of the band were able to showcase their talents while not individually taking over the album, and overall, just great f*ucking metal.

Randy is using his high-pitch screeches more than ever! So what parts of Randy's vocals sounds like Metallica, it's groovy as hell!

Anyway...This is an excellent album. Any one of these songs would fit right in on Ashes, which is fine because Ashes is in my opinion the best metal album of the new millenium. So far Lamb of God has changed their sound somewhat in either 2 or 3 stages starting with the more death metal style \\"Burn the Priest\\" era and progressing - however this, as aforementioned fits in well with their current and understandably established new \\"Ashes\\" sound.In sum, you either get it or you don't.

They absolutely shred live. I saw them with Shadows Fall (another upper echelon band), and they destroyed everyone there. When I think of pure metal, LOG is one of the first bands to pop in my head.This album isn't as good as Ashes of the Wake, but it is about on par with As the Palaces Burn. However, there are some songs on here that push the boundaries of what anyone could reasonably expect from them, and leave you wondering just how awesome of a career these dudes will have.

I read the reviews of this album, and they were good. And even though when I gave their earlier stuff a listen I was as bored with them as I am with Linkin Park, I still got the new one. The vocals are stupid. Really. The songs are completely unmoving. I really, really tried to like this. And even though the guitar is very good, very strong, the songs are very unoriginal. There are truly good moments on this album, I agree, but this band is NOT the great band people claim they are. They are not distinguished. They aren't even easy to like a little bit because of the stupid stupid vocals. Truly annoying. They butcher every song. Lastly they sound like they are just regurgitating metal cliches in every song.

Hope the quick change works so I can make up for my lost time figuring this knife out. Rediculous that there are no instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"I have one of these Stanley Sheetrock knives, and I love the thing. It is so much easier to use thatn the old ones you have to take apart, and the really great part is the blade storage area. Granted the clip for the blade storage is prone to break, but usally only if you drop it off a ladder. I've had mine for about nine months now and it still works like a charm. The only real drawback with the knife is that when you are cutting insulation, the little rope cutter will grab the insulation and rip it while you're cutting, but, for my money that's a small price to pay for all the help it is. It would be nice if Stanley would put one on the market that doesn't have that rope cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure this is a fine knife, but","review":"I'm sure this is a fine knife, but it's a puzzle.

There is an EXCELLENT review by a customer (C. Pearson) who had the same problems that I experienced. He went above and beyond and returned to his review and posted a video on how to load / change the blade on this knife. I thought it was just me, but was glad to see that many people had the same problems with this knife.

Its treatment of Native American and White Settler relations is refreshingly honest and extremely well documented.Simpson's West River brings to light many exciting, thought-provoking, and poignant stories of the American West that have not made it into our traditional history text books. The more I read about them in this book, the more I wished that I had been able to learn this side of history earlier. They are great stories and an important part of our country's heritage.Simpson's unique style of writing also makes you feel as if you are hearing the stories being told by the people who lived during the time. And his careful documentation is equally impressive.I would recommend this book to anyone - especially those who are interested in the forgotten stories of our western history in the great plains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Fall","review":"No matter how dark her characters are, Anne Stuart always succeeds at making you love and care about them. But she came close to failing with Richard for me. It was his arrogance that did him in. So damn sure of himself and it only infuriated me that...well, he had a reason to be. The heroine pretty much was puddle in his hands. All the damn time. I just wanted to scream at her, get a grip! Be strong!Now that I got that out of the way, this book was entertaining.

This is pretty much the mood of this book. From the minute Cass, a single young woman arrives in her father's apartment with a convicted murderer is inside, her reactions in this story are simply not believable. Later, Richard (the convicted killer) walks out from a meeting with Cass and a team of lawyer. He stands up and orders Cass to leave with him. She jumps out and runs after him hand in hand (I think). This story has too many frustrations, mostly concerning the actions of Cass, to really enjoy. This story has no spice, no warmth, just a young woman falling for all the traps a strange man sets for her. Pass on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the only book I have ever read back-to-back.","review":"\\"Follow me\\", is not just a book, it is an experience with Jesus.

Granted, I had figured that the alleged killing shown at the end was fake, but it was a very unconvincing scene.To give credit where it is due, the people who made and distributed this movie did pull off a major coup by marketing \\"Snuff\\" as the real deal. To get the media to talk about it, and to have law enforcement investigate it, did more to \\"plant asses in seats\\" than anything the movie's makers could have dreamed of.For the record, local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies have conducted exhaustive investigations of snuff films, and have found no proof of their existance."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to rig the lottery","review":"A nice short little novel that you can read in 2 days time. Not perfect. I'm not a huge sci-fi buff, and there were parts of it that bugged me, mainly the way it seemed very 1950's (when it was written) even though it's set in the year 2203. For example, women still have a fairly subserviant role to men, everyone smokes (even on airplanes) and drinks scotch at work. Nice to know that in the future we'll be able to smoke and drink scotch in the office! None of the characters are ever fully fleshed out (though Dick seems obsessed with describing all the female character's breasts) and their behavior is sometimes unnatural and unexpected, but overall an entertaining book with a nice little twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"After assembling the frame with my picture inserted, (and I was very careful to ensure the clips were snapped into place because I was very exciting about hanging an art print I received for Christmas), I was trying to hang it on the wall.

The novel is not very well written, filled with pedantic, prolix and baroque passages, as Miller struggles mightily to find his voice. Miller fans will find this work quite interesting, as it is another variation on The Rosy Crucifixion. However, this book is definately not a good place to start your journey through the works of Henry Miller, as there are many better places to begin (Tropic of Cancer, Air Conditioned Nightmare) your journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Thule 690 MOAB","review":"I was hoping to find a product description which listed the width of the hooks.

Being an extreme fan of jazz piano trios I've collected many great albums by Evans, Jamal, Peterson, Corea, Jarrett, Tyner. Mance was never in the same class as some of the innovators but this album is very refreshing and tastefully done. I think that it has a perfect mix of laid back as well as more intense pieces. Many albums have tunes that I want to hear and some I'll skip. Not so with Junior's Blues. It's one that I can put on and listen straight through and thoroughly enjoy. Mance may not have the prodigious technique like a Tatum or Peterson but he's got more than enough to express and communicate his feelings. I'd recommend it to most people and if you are a fan of jazz piano buy it now.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the dubbing is very sympathetic to the original, for example, none of the names have been changed (my two cats were a whisker away from being called Minoos and Jakkeposse) and at least they all have European accents!The only thing I would say is that the American title \\"Undercover Kitty\\" is awful, what's wrong with just sticking with the main character's name Minoos?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Living Plant for Small Environment","review":"Brussel's DT0117ALW Hawaiian Umbrella Tree in Water Pot Bonsai: I received it as a gift from my daughter.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with what Altissimo does here. Nevertheless, as Altissimo knows, the military must provide interested members of the public with free copies of these same military recordings - albeit, perhaps, in a different order and with different cover art. Indeed, the law that guarantees all Americans free access to these recordings also allows Altissimo or anyone else, for that matter, to make unlimited copies of these songs - because they cannot be copy protected!

Dr. Romanov is clearly brilliant and his pose method very good way to speed up your pace and reduce injury. However, this DVD was nothing more than video of him doing drills. It does not go into his Pose method and how to do it. I was pretty surprised to tell you the truth. If it were lower price like $19.95 I could see buying it as a reference DVD to see how to correctly do the drills, but $49.95 is highway robbery in my opinion.If you are looking for DVD on how to run injury free and run faster, buy the ChiRunning DVD.

If you are not used to plyometrics then it will seem difficult. I tried this before actually using the \\"real\\" insanity and I'm glad I did. The workout is very similar and unlike Insanity you don't get water breaks it really is fast and furious. If you've done Insanity it's a lot like the PureCardio workout. Also like the real Insanity workouts there is not much of a warm up or stretch so I recommend maybe a light jog around the block before starting and taking it easy at first. It's not impossible exercise but it is a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've done Insanity, Don't waste your $$ on this","review":"I've done Insanity. Loved it. Just tried F&F.

At 47 and with hormone changes messing with my metabolism, the Insanity workout is giving me what I want - intense compacted cardiovascular workout, core strengthening and abs. It's the first workout that does all three for me. In addition, there's no fancy steps or routines - just good old fashioned conditioning! I feel like I'm a football player warming up for a game. Finally, I've challenged myself to go further with this workout than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity is just that...it's insane.","review":"I thought I was in pretty decent shape, until I popped in this DVD. The warm-up had me sweating & breathing hard. I absolutely would recommend this workout to anyone who wants a quick yet vigorous cardio workout. The only downside is the poor camera work (really, beachbody?) but that doesn't effect the workout you get. Absolutely intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense 20 minute workout","review":"I've been considering the Insanity workouts for some time now, but wasn't sure I'd be able to handle them. This DVD was a perfect opportunity to see what the workouts were really like--and believe me, this was tough! You will sweat in the 20 minutes, but it's a good challenge and you will feel like you've accomplished something when you've finished(unlike some other 20 minute workouts). Great instructor as well--I may have to buy the full series after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $25","review":"This video was ok.

There are oversized people that like to stay fit too or stay at a steady weight. I m that population, now as I get older I want to be more defined and get rid of belly fat, I cant do it with these kind of videos if your not showing my population how to get firm especially in the speed that your producing.

However, I am pretty sure he shot this video in his bedroom and made the workout up as he went along. His backup guy, although ripped, seems incredibly out of shape and can barely make it through the 20 minutes. If you buy this, keep your eyes on the female assistant. She actually seems to be trying. If you go all out, it's a good little workout... but don't expect Insanity quality! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Money and Buy FUll Workout Instead","review":"Save your money. There is only one workout and a bunch of advertisements on the DVD. I subsequently bought the Insanity full workout because the 20 minute workout was not really useful other then as a demo.

Another note, it helps to have completed p90x before any of the Insanity workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"I should have read the reviews it's just a bunch of advertisements.

It starts out with a few warm up exercises and then there are really only about 13 minutes of actual \\"workout\\" cardio.

The 20 minutes will fly by and you'll sweat for sure!!! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product as advertised.","review":"If you have done Insanity before, I think you will really enjoy the Fast & Furious version. I finished my first round of Insanity around Christmas. I was debating if I should do another round but I found this version and thought it was perfect, given that it's only 20 minutes long. I usually work out in the morning before work, and sometimes I'm running late due to the length of my workout. So I ordered this version and I loved it right from the start. Don't think because it's only 20 minutes you won't sweat, you certainly will! Most - if not all - exercises will be known to you if you have done Shaun T's videos before. You'll do a quick warm up and stretch too.The only reason I gave it a 4 start rating instead of 5 was that when I opened the package and saw the thin sleeve I was disappointed. Honestly, $25 for one single 20-min workout is a bit pricey, but at least I thought the case was going to look a bit nicer. It's really not a case, just a cardboard sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my","review":"its hard an u sweat alot..but after a while it makes you feel good. an for days you will be sore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity Fast and Furious","review":"This is a good no nonsense workout.

I bought this because I wanted a quick workout from the normal 40 minute workout with the insanity system. I just don't have time with two kids, a wife, and a job to put in 40 plus minutes. Ends up being an hour if you lift weights. This is intense!! Big time and if you push hard, you won't finish the tape or the allotted times. But I like that, you have room to grow and get better. Lots of cardio and lots of abs. Good warm-up. I workout in the basement and the ceilings are low, does not allow me to do alot of the jumps and things, but I just do other exercises instead. Very intense and quite insane! If you are looking to extend your insanity workout or just want a quick but furious workout...this is the one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"Sorry to say as Im sure this is for some people but not for me.

I must say this workout does not let you down. He packs a lot into the 20 minutes you are working out. In the one month of using this workout along with other workouts I saw some results. Unfortunately I did not stick with it but am starting the workout regiment again using this workout and eventually I will purchase the full Insanity Challenge.

Since I have knee issues I decided to try this first instead of purchase the complete program. I'm so glad I did because I was really disappointed. The workout I think would be amazing if it were just a little slower or he went over the moves slowly once before picking up the pace. I had such a difficult time keeping up which made me frustrated and feeling like I wasn't getting the full benefits of the workout. After about ten minutes I stopped the DVD and put in something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast workout","review":"The description of this product is spot on. A 45 minute high intensity workout crammed into 20 minutes. The downside is that the audio could be much better, and sometimes the instructor stops telling you when to switch exercise moves so you get a little behind. My goal during this workout is to take fewer breaks than Shaun T and his sidekicks, as even they have to stop from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"insane.enough said.","review":"i started this work on monday. nearly died. only got ten minutes into it it was that intense. did on wednesday again. got through all of it even though i can barely walk because my quads are so sore. i love this workout. i can barely lift my arms. i can feel it working right away. i am a new college graduate trying to loose all the fat gain and i'm excited to see the results of this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I tried this video but I couldn't get pass the warm up.

After a few days most of the leaves were gone and at the 2 week point there was only 1 green leave attached. I gave it to a friend who also enjoys bonsai trees because I hated that it was starting to die. I can report after a couple of months of total TLC it has started to regrow some of the leaves.

The pot (each time) was a less-attractive brownish oval shape, so keep that in mind when buying a humidity tray to coordinate.

But when the tree finally arrived - it was the wrong tree, I received the Gardenia tree. The Fukien has the very tiny little white flowers which produce small red berries. The Gardenia has larger flowers (which I do not like). I was not happy that since there was a delay in the shipment of the Fukien tree - someone took it upon themselves to subsitute a different tree.

After a couple of weeks, they all started losing their leaves. Upon closer inspection it was evident that they were infested with some type of crawling mite, aphid or whatever. I quarantined them from my other houseplants which displayed no similar problems. My Fukien Bonsai are now void of all leaves --- since Brussel's Nursery/Amazon will not accept returns at this stage, I'm trying to revive them with TLC.I have notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture that this supplier is distributing diseased stock.

I returned it without problem for a replacement.The leaves of the second tree were dark and drooping. The soil was very wet. The leaves quickly began to dry and fall from the tree. I suspect there was some cold damage during shipment (6 days by UPS) or the soil was just too wet. Since I've read that the Fukien Tea may loose it's leaves, I've kept the soil moist and have been waiting for it to releaf. The small branches have become brittle, so there's not much hope.

Will be impossible since I've never seen anyone using Pentax, or less Samsung.Thats why most new to dslr companies fail.

It has a decent plot, solid characters, chuckles galore, and Pratchett's usual rapier wit skewering various social subjects. I especially liked his portrayal of an inept secret society.I'm reading the series out of order, so I had a good idea how this one would end already, but I'm not complaining. It was fun, for instance, to get introduced to later series mainstays as Carrot and Sybil, plus get a glimpse of Vimes before he cleaned up his alcoholic act. If you're a Discworld veteran, you'll probably enjoy these for the same reasons I did; if you're just starting out, it's a good intro primer.The only thing keeping me from giving G!G! 5 stars was the ending (re: the dragon) seemed a bit rushed and unsatisfying, but I also realize it did work out rather well and could have been handled worse.

The result is a fine, fine book that tells us more about the candidates and more about the politics of 1972 than any other available.Probably as a result of substance abuse, Thompson seems incapable of writing in any but the most charged and manic way, which is a refreshing change from the egghead drear that characterizes so much bad political writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic insider's tale of a demented campaign","review":"The Fear and Loathing for political junkies.

The positive aspects of this gun are great, so great infact that after returning my first one, I purchased a second. The second, however, had the same issues as the first. The piston rattles and occasionally dislodges. When this occurs, absolutely nothing happens when I pull the trigger. Shaking the gun violently seems to realign the piston. This process is extemely aggrivating, especially when straining to hold a board in place.My first gun, I thought to be a lemon. After my second gun failed in the same way, it is clear that Hitachi has issues to address. From a carpenter's perspective, I cannot reccomend this gun. It's flawed and unreliable.

This gun will drive Paslode \\"Roundrive\\" nails, which fit my Paslode clipped head cordless framing nailer-so I don't need to stock different fasteners. The only thing I don't like is that there is no hook of any kind to hold the tool when you need both hands free for a moment or two.

It also has Twin View where you can watch two programs side by side, with the ability to zoom in one picture. It also has Steady Sound that equalizes volume levels so the sound is consistant between programs and commercials. I play my PS3 on my Sony and the picture is so clear.

The music is lively and fun to listen to outside of the movie context. However, I was disappointed because some of the great musical moments in the movie are not on the CD. The end credits, the popular songs (like \\"I can see clearly now.\\") are not there, and the reference to \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" that you can hear during the magnifying glass sequence is not present on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suprisingly Great Score","review":"Having the movie based on a colony of ants, one would expect a more mechanical, crazy sounding score. Suprisingly, you get a more rythmic, electronic score with some very catchy tunes. The themes in the score are all great in their own ways. Z's theme is a laid-back, and calm. The colony theme is rythmic, crazy, and one of the catchiest themes I've ever heard. General Mandible's theme sounds, well, military-like and is played by some exotic instrument. Bala's theme is short but also serves its purpose. The score has a lot of energetic moments in the score and never loses that energy, even at the explosive ending. Not being a big fan of electronic/orchestral scores, I found this one to be great and enjoyed the electronic, Latin style in the score. I highly recommend this score if you like happy, energetic, catchy music. Its sound is unique and is a highly underrated score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"Ordered 12 & at least 1/2 were already scratched upon arrival, which was really upsetting since shipping them was expensive, & thus not worth the price.

Since was early southwest US summer when it arrived, the tree went outside immediately, in a shady spot. Later on it went into the sun, where is is producing flowers now. So long as it is watered daily, it's a healthy, slow growing little tree. Come fall, it will be brought inside with another black olive as these don't like temperatures below 50 degrees. These trees are so easy to care for and do so well in this climate that I highly recommend them for anybody in the southern part of the USA. Black olives, black pines and a couple of Chinese elms are the only bonsai I have that thrive in the full blast of mid-New Mexico sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure whats wrong?","review":"This is a beautiful tree. Perfect limbs, perfect trunk to height ratio, even had 3 bunches of olives on it, they died within a day, still its a very nice tree. Only problem is that it had lost lots of leaves during transit and continues to lose around 20 leaves every day. I have only had it for about a week or so and it will most likely be dead within the next week or so. Its sad, because it was such a nice little tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving advertisement!","review":"I received the bonsai in 3 days as promised.

If you feel that buying a kit, reading instructions, and installing something is hard for you, here is the advice from the book....

The book held my interest beyond Margaret's story in that it told a familiar tale from an unfamiliar point of view. Any student of Tudor and Stuart history knows the story of Darnley's murder - but usually events unfold from the point of view of Mary, Queen of Scots. Here, events are finally seen from Darnley's perspective. He still comes across as a thoroughly unpleasant fellow, but the reader can, at least, get an inkling of why he was what he was. I orignally considered this a throw away title, but it has earned a place in my Tudor library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Bingham bother?","review":"To paraphrase Erich Segal, \\"What can you say about a twenty-one year old creep who died?\\" This is the first biography of Darnley in the four hundred years since his murder.

I always felt that this CD show pretty clearly how influenced Green was by Charlie Parker. Greens playing is very focused and very very swinging, he has a great help of the piano player Johnny Acea, whom I never heard of before, but he plays very tssty solos. In my opinion Greens playing on \\"Mambo Inn\\" and \\"My little suede shoes\\" represents some of his most \\"boppish\\" playing. A funny thing is that on Ronny Jordans latest record,\\"A Brighter Day\\" he has recorded Mambo Inn, and his version is very influenced by this Green 1962 version, that is at least my beleive. I feel that some of the tunes might seem a bit outdated today, but still, George Benson has said that this one is his favourite Green record, that is understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant and the Potato!!!","review":"This is another Grant Green theme album.

In fact she just repeats this throughout the whole book. How many times can you read the same story before you get bored?? You really get to the point where you just want to slap her and knock some sense into her for being so stupid.I really dont know why I kept reading this book.

Many references to the way she feels she is \\"hot\\" and Sexy. She admits that even as a teenager she was only attracted to guys who were \\"buff\\" and gorgeous. Well, DUH!! What did we expect her to say' \\"I really wanted to marry a guy who is 130lbs soaking wet in his clothes, has tape on his horn-rimmed glasses, and wears a pocket protector.\\" Please give me a break! And to think this woman is a mother?? Of course some famous guy is going to take you to bed if you throw yourself at them enough.

Of course I wouldn't pay for it; it took me about an hour to read it in the bookstore. Jessica reveals herself to be the female version of her celebrity husband: egocentric, two-dimensional, silly cheerleader type who has nothing to offer but what's only on the outside. She has a penchant for using the \\"F\\" word and talks about their screaming sessions which I'm sure often took place in front of their daughter. What a good mom, what a good dad.

Specially when you are involved with a celebrity that is orfan of a mother, she needs to replace the sexual love that she gives into a little bit of maternal love and sexual love. When I read the book i felt very sorry for her way of expressing herself.

If you plan to shave large areas find something bigger or just use regular hair clippers.Overall I like this product, and think it does a decent good job. The blades cut well, but don't bite into your skin and the adjustements work fine. The adjustment wheel is a little hard to turn, but not a big deal. The shaver didn't work for me, but then again no electric shaver ever has. The fact that you can take it in the shower is a plus and it comes with a nice brush and decent sized oil bottle.For twelve bucks it's great - if the price were higher though I'd look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significant loss of blood...","review":"I've used a Philips Bodygroom for years without any problem, but I wanted give something else a try. I won't go into detail, but even used very carefully, this thing caused numerous cuts and significant loss of blood in an area that a man really does not want to see any blood. On other parts of the body it's just OK. I will be going back to the Bodygroom, and throwing this thing in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...not so great","review":"Here is the deal....I bought this so that I could trim my body hair. And yes it works, but not too well. It takes forever to do a large area like say your chest. Partly because it is pretty small, and also because it somehow doesn't grab the hair too well. But, saying all that, I am still keeping it as a traveling groomer. It looks good, it seems to hold a charge very well, not too many parts, and it comes in a neat pouch. So for touch ups, or doing areas like your sideburns, or your pubic hair, then hey..it's fine. But if you are a looking to trim your leg hair, it's going to take 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This is one of the worst products I've purchased in memory. As one of the other reviewers said it does not work at all if the objective is to get a clean shave, as opposed to buying this as a trimmer.

I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade.

I use mine during the day in an office so emptying the tank is not as bad as it would be if I used the unit for a bedroom or gameroom which would be unacceptable. The noise prevents me from talking on the telephone since it sounds like a jet engine taking off while it's running.

I used a shallow broiling pan and checked every hour or so (I left the drain plug out if I was in the room).Our AC went out and thankfully I had already ordered this. It did a wonderful job in our game room, where I huddled with my laptop, TV and Kindle waiting for the AC to be replaced. It will be used in the future for parties and guests who prefer a cool bedroom.As a back-up it is superb, as a stand alone in a humid climate a window unit might be better option.The price I paid was a steal and the price now is still a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"At first I was thrilled with this machine.

It's a joke. I gave it two stars for the free shipping and price before I tested it and compared to other units that my friends have. It really should be zero-star.The vent flap is of a flawed design, so semi-cool air you get drops right down to the ground regardless of flap position.The temp sensor was defective on my unit, automatically dropping as the unit ran, even as the actual room temp stayed the same. It was quite comical to have the unit tell me the room was 70 degrees when it was 92.The unit is noisier (air speed noise) than I would expect though to be fair it probably is as loud as the specs indicate.It did leak on me once, but only a tiny bit. Clearly it overflows before shutting off. I probably would have had more leaks if it had been working right and actually producing cold air (and therefore condensation).Do not buy this unit.

It was very humid this past weekend and all of a sudden I couldn't adjust temp, adjust fan, etc. Then I found out the remote made it work ok, BUT that's the night it dumped on the floor. So, what, I can't operate the unit properly and cool the room if it's too humid?? Call me stupid, but now I have to empty the water out of it?!?!

It fills with water ever 2 hours when it's really hot, and the plug is at the bottom of the tank. It's messy and difficult to drain, and of course, when you're sleeping, its like taking care of a toddler - getting up every 1.5 to 2 hours to drain the water out. I completely regret this purchase and would never ever ever buy this again. Completely pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive description - it is definitely NOT self-evaporating","review":"Read Renderer's review, it is spot on. Yes, the unit is working but it quickly fills up with water and then shuts off, requiring you to fiddle with a drain plug about two inches above the floor, which makes it difficult to get any reasonably sized pan under it. Going to try connecting a hose with a clamp to it, and hope for the best. And, yes, it is rather noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Meltdown","review":"Royal Sovereign ARP-1003E Portable Air Conditioner 10,000 BTUThis is one of the worst items offered through Amazon - and one of the few I've returned.

Balmer uses the fortunes of the Dutch Reformed Church as the benchmark for assessing the condition of Dutch culture as a whole. I am giving four stars because I would have liked a little more background on pre-1664 Dutch culture than Balmer provides. Nonetheless, anyone desiring to acquire a well-rounded understanding of Colonial North American history should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scholarship, illuminating narrative","review":"This book is a must read. It's well-written, deeply researched, short and eye-opening. Balmer shows how Dutch Reformed religion faced pressure from within and without that led to assimilation to English culture, which meant a turn to revivalist evangelicalism or the Church of England. How this developed, from the 1660s to the 1780s, is what Balmer tells in this book. It deserves a place on the shelf of everyone interested in religion in America and who is concerned about retaining a confessional tradition.

I have recently purchased both the Crane Shark and Penguin purifiers and am very satisfied with their functions! Do NOT purchase this unit if you are not going to be using it in an 8x8 office space (or smaller) as it will be fruitless.

I love the halting, intentionally metric performances he requires of his actors. I loved Glengarry Glen Ross and even Oleanna (despite its weak attempt to tackle the subject of sexual harassment) due to the jazz-like dialogue.This movie doesn't share that extremely stylistic component that says \\"Mamet\\". It's a pretty simple story and truthfully there's not all that much to it. But what I liked was the sort of ambiguous posture of the Winslow boy himself, along with an amazing, smoldering performance by Jeremy Northam. I don't know why this guy isn't more famous. He was the undisputed star of \\"An Ideal Husband\\" more recently and received like fourth billing. This is a lovely quiet movie and I recommend it both on its own literary merits as well as because Northam is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous Disappointment","review":"I am a fan of British film and like subtle humor and drama...but this! Well, first I should say that as far as \\"family friendly\\", this film is a gem. No profanity or any vulgarity at all plus a good story of 'right' triumphing over the system. But it was like the writers said, \\"hey, lets take out all the intense, dramatic, exciting stuff out and just show them the boring conversation.\\" Subtlety is one thing, but this films takes the anticlimactic cake. The actors, fantastic...the cinematography...excellent. The directing...whoa...you have got to be kidding!

Likewise 'Sir Roberts' courtroom speech was completely missed.Beg, steel or borrow the origianl VHS copy, and if need be go out and buy a VCR just to watch and enjoy this gem.

As a cyclist and huge Tour de France fan, I too was expecting another rehash of previous Lance books. Instead, I was treated to the most compelling, enjoyable sportswriting I've read since Stephen King's essay on Little League baseball. Coyle paints such vivid mental pictures that you can almost hear the roar of the crowd lining the roads of France. You will also be treated to a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at everything in Lance's life from his \\"CrackBerry\\" to Sheryl Crow. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put this book down. A \\"must read\\" for the legions of yellow bracelet-wearing, faux cycling fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal.","review":"My wife bought me this book recently knowing that I am a big Lance fan and secondly that I am an avid cyclist. I was surprised and delighted to read such a thoughtful and intense read about the world of professional cycling. It not only covers Lance's 2004 Tour, but the world of present day cycling: the good, the bad and the ugly. I am convinced more than ever that professional cyclists are the toughest athletes in the world and this book makes this even more evident. I've read both of Lance's books (liked them both), but the gritty writing of Coyle was refreshing. You probably won't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Book Yet on the Inner Armstrong","review":"I have read every book I can get my hands on about Lance. It's not that I've put him up on a pedestal, I just want to know how a man like this ticks. I race bicycles, too; of course not even close to the level of a pro. I know what it feels like to be empty on a climb or in a fast pace line, yet Lance can rise above all of that. Is it mental? Physical? Both? This book delves into all of this and much, much more. I picked it up and I can't put it down. It is the best cycling book I've ever read, including the ones that Lance wrote. Kudos to the author, I'm very impressed with the way he got so many details about Lance's life, training methods, thought processes, etc. You won't be sorry to read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inside glimpse of professional cycling","review":"Great book that really digs into the way cycling teams operate and the issues that riders face on and off their bikes.

Very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lance from an outsiders perspective","review":"Daniel Coyle knew nothing of cycling before this book, so the reader gets a new perspective of the sport. Coyle's details about the training regimen are valuable to all cyclists. But his take on Lance is skewed toward the idea that all of Lance's detractors have a point. Having seen hundreds of interviews and read both of his books shows Lance as a caring devoted person. Coyle lists complaints from far too many disgruntled employees and bitter journalists to make this a fair and balanced report."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not All About Lance, Good Insight into Pro Racing","review":"I just got into cycling last year. I learned a lot about the pro racing scene from this book. There are a lot of details you wouldn't expect, and it both humanized and glorified Lance. While it seemed factual and unbiased, it did seem a little vague about Lance's tainted blood tests. Obviously there is no hard proof or he would have been found guilty.Anyhow regardless of whether or not he did dope, which everyone seems to think all pro cyclists do or did, he still had to ride hard and ran a tight ship w/ the team. The organization necessary to run a team is amazing and outlined in this book. It is easy to read and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe anyone recommends this book","review":"For all the rave reviews - I thought this book was so much garbage. Lots of facts but no one seems to have taken any notice of the attitude and angles taken by the writer. The old 'subtly put down your subject matter, because if you can make them look bad, you can make yourself look intelligent' approach. This isn't even remotely an 'unbiased report' of the tour de france as presented.Wish I could give this book no stars. Unfortunatly I had to give it one to do a review.If you want a book on Lance, read his autobiographies, if you want a book on the tour, I'd recommend buying one from a writer who doesn't have so much to prove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Success and testosterone","review":"I don't know the specifics of Lance Armstrong's cancer. However, I assume that he became hypogonadal after treatment for his testicular cancer and is taking testosterone, which is an anabolic steroid. The average young male has a serum testosterone concentration between 300 and 1200 ng/dl. Most average around 500. If Armstrong were to take enough testosterone to keep his testosterone level at the upper end of the normal range he would, potentially, have a physical advantage over his competitors. He would also test negative for synthetic steroids. It would be interesting to know what his serum testosterone is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lance Armstrong's War:One Man's Battle Against Fate, Fame, Love, Death, Schandal, and a Few Other Rivals on the Road to the Tour","review":"I believe the book is insinuating that all Tour de France members use drugs.including Lance Armstrong. His book is fat in size but needs more conclusive evidence before hinting that Lance is using drugs. Lance Armstrong is so pissed at the French for the drug allegations that he wants to race the Tour de France an eighth time. Shame on the author for not giving Lance more credit. Further shame on him for not making Lance Armstrong the great American hero. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I'm sorry I bought it. --Tania Cole"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooooooops","review":"I guess it's time to retire this one to the discount bin. Although the writing is good, I have never like the subject: a man who left his \\"stand by your man\\" wife and children to love (and dump) a rock star. Perhaps the book needs to be updated with the stripping of Armstrong's titles, stepping down from his charity, and the loss of Nike endorsements.

Come to find our she has the previous version which she alread read. I also got her Tour de Lance which covers the 2010 Tour de France.This book only had some minor new content.

Dalton: get your facts straight","review":"J. Dalton: First question: did you even read the book? Didn't think so. Second question: why don't you get your facts straight? Lance did not leave \\"his wife and 3 young children to pursue a life more in line with superstardom.\\" He was already a superstar when they divorced, after having won five consecutive Tours. When she married him, he was a bike racer. When she divorced him, he was a bike racer. I do not feel sorry for someone that complains about having several houses on multiple continents, as the former Mrs. Armstrong has. Each house was more lavash than the last, I am sure. Boo-hoo for her. Lance did not meet Sheryl Crow until after Kristin and Lance had filed for divorce, so your implication that he left his wife to be with a rock star is simply wrong. Educate yourself, then you can at least have an informed opinion: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating Lance Armstrong's","review":"Great insight into the politics and nuances of bicycle road racing including not only interviews with Armstrong and his camp but also those of opposing players and team. Fast paced and engaging in the account of the preparation for and the actual 2004 Tour de France.Though Coyle had unprecedented access to the Armstrong camp, the account of the race and the competitors was reasonably balanced.

Where is War?","review":"This is not a terrible book per se. I enjoyed author's clinical and humorous take on Planet Lance, and professional cycling by and large. The bit on Dr. Ferrari testing LA for power/weigh ratio is particularly tasty.Why then only 2 stars? It is because of its misleading title.With a title like \\"Lance Armstrong's War...\\" one would expect juicy insider details on LA's training leading upto his 6th Tour title, and battling media on a host of hot button issues such as doping allegations, divorce, high profile law suits and etc. Instead, half of the book focuses on TdF's top contenders--Vino, Tyler, Ullrich and Mayo. I welcome these chapters, although they do not serve the main theme of the book. The other half feels like a collection of newspaper and web articles.The author/publisher must have put \\"War\\" in the title because it helps sell the book. This is disgraceful sloppy journalism. Fellow readers/cycling fans, don't be fooled !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicane knockoff sounds great.","review":"What else can be said - its on xtravaganza label, sounds like chicane produced it, so its awesome.

Doesn't lend itself to Nintendo as much as many other games."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"I got this game because I used to play tomb raider for the PC. Tomb Raider for DS is totally different. For one thing when you need to shoot someone your guns don't automatically lock on the target. You have to use your touch screen to guide where you shoot. Its not that bad but I would prefer it to be automatic. Also, there is no look feature for this game. There is one part in the 1st level where you have to jump onto a ledge but the ledge isn't really in the screen so you don't know where your jumping to. I had to go through it 20 times just to get the jump right because I couldn't see what the hell I was jumping onto. I haven't played this game very much because I get more frustration than enjoyment out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible!","review":"I cannot emphasize this enough; TR Underworld for the DS was fantastic, this game (Legend) is awful!!!!It's pretty much in full 3d. Which is a very bad thing! If you are jsut a little to the left or right, you will miss any jump.The save system is terrible, the stages are long and mercilessly unforgiving and buggy.The graphics aren't too bad. And there are more outfits than I thought there would be.The story is chopped up pretty bad, but at least they have the cutscenes from the main PS2 version.The part with you Lara is totally cut out, you just get to see a very short cutscene about it.I can't get past Japan. The level design is so glitchy.It's overall an extremely frustrating experience.

After 3 hours with Logictech support (that is phone time, not the many hours of waiting time!) and many attempts at setting privledges in the Registry, it still never installed. Logitech blames Microsoft, and it may well be true, but they should have a manual way of starting services instead of relying on automation. I am very disappointed that I never got a chance to even try the pen. If you do take the chance on it, be prepared to ship it back because it may never even install on your system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I bought this pen in 2008 when I went back to school for an MBA. At the time I was working on Windows XP and it was fine, even though the Denos software that was provided with the pen (in France) wasn't stable and flexible.Lately, I've had a new laptop which runs on Vista and despite the fact that I installed the updated version of the software (plus Vista patch), it is not working at all anymore!Each time I upload my notes the software crashes and there is no means to send them to Word, Excel or any other software or do any recognition of hand-writing anymore. So I'm left with pdf files of my hand-written notes, which is not why I bought the pen for (I could do that with a scanner!).As I bought 5 notebooks in advance in France (10 euros each, not found them in the UK where I live) I will keep using it but as soon as my notebooks are used I change my pen!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good or Bad, Depending on its intended use","review":"The title pretty much sums it up. I bought the pen because I was tired of spending hours each week typing up my notes (that I took in class). The problem with the pen (why I returned it) is that the handwriting recognition is a DISASTER. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I have the best handwriting in the world, but it takes some serious coding errors to interpret \\"this is a test\\" as \\"~de93, h;02\\".

Sadly, I have now returned it.The pen simply could not recognize my handwriting. I went through the \\"training wizard\\", or whatever it was called, to teach the software to recognize my handwriting. I wrote slowly and carefully and formed all of my letters better than I ever did in grade school. No matter. I was writing in block letters and the pen captured it as really ugly cursive. I guess it couldn't tell when I lifted the pen off the page to make the next character. The software said it could only recognize 48% of my characters. So, I couldn't use any of the conversion software to turn the images into a searchable word, pdf, excel, etc., and what was captured in the IO software itself was extremely difficult to read. Verdict: Useless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nu-metal thats actually good?","review":"Cold falls under the same category as Limp Bizkit, Staind, andall the other nu-metal stuff, but there is one difference.

I just picked this up today, I know a little late, but this CD is fantastic. The vocals are real emotional and the music is strong. My only complaint with Cold is that there recordings are too soft with the drums, bass and guitar, they need to capture the live/heavy sound that you hear when you see them...This is a great purchase if your a fan or a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely cold","review":"I am not a big metal fan, and usually prefer down to earth rock, but I make an exception for this excellent album. Cold manage to overcome a problem many metal groups have, which is unoriginal chords and manuevers, and manage to have powerful instrumental accompaniment that doesn't get in the way of the powerful vocal abilities that Cold displays here. And anyway, it's not \\"pure\\" metal.... loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"wow , i heard this band from searching the internet and thought they were going to be another angry rapcored band , but god was i wrong , if you like mellow music with meaning , this is it . Scooter's voice and lyrics are dramatic and you will have no choice but to fall in love with it . The guitar and riffs are trancing and either you will burst into tears or fall into a nice sleep from this album , I dont recommend it if your looking for Slipknot-Mudvayne music 2 hear . My favorite tracks are : She Said , Bleed ,No ONe , Sick of Man,Its All Good , wait no forget it , its all good . Buy the CD , don't burn it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool (No Pun Intended)","review":"This is a great CD but I got tired of it really quickly. The mood is very repetative but the rest is awesome. Especially his voice... comparable even to the greatest, TOOL, Cold is driven by a mad man with a \\"Creedy\\" kinda voice. Self Titled was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD i have ever bought","review":"I have been a music fan for a long time. I have purchased many excellent albums over those years. Little did I know that the best CD ever made was by a band so few have heard about. I am very picky about my CD's and I can say for sure this is the best CD I have ever bought. Scooter Ward has the best voice I have ever heard. The only person that can rival him is Aaron Lewis from Staind and even he can't come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold's Best CD","review":"Simply put, this is Cold's best CD. This is the CD that made me a lifelong fan. This is the CD that made me fall in love with Scooter Ward."},{"rating":"2","title":"As pleasant as a cartoon where everyone dies in the end.","review":"I think the funniest thing is that every band that Fred Durst has found so far is better than Limp Bizkit. Instead of being hip hop metal like the afformention LB, and straying away from the grunge influenced sound of Staind, Cold is more melodic, and if you ask me, pretty damn depressing. With tracks like \\"She Said\\", \\"Witch\\", and the acoustic \\"Bleed\\", Cold is a band that puts a big rain cloud over a sunny day. Most people compare Scooters' vocals to Gavin Rosdale from Bush, (the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked), Scooter puts a lot of depth and emotion into both his vocals and lyrics. And with \\"13 Ways to Bleed Onstage\\", Cold trades in their faster melodies for slow, dropped tuned depression. So if you have the chance to check this cd out, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold is very cold in lyrics but still good.","review":"Cold is a very hard at times very depressed rock band. cold sounds like staind, but they still have uniqueness to themselves too. Not much to say, a good cd, must have if you like this kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stained with staind","review":"It's true that Cold sounds a hell of alot like staind, but the reality is that they are better than staind so nobody cares if they rip them off. This cd is really great and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cold write good songs,but theres a lack of anything new here","review":"cold have allways been good at rocking hard,but most bands try and change their style as they mature,not cold.songs like\\"send in the clowns\\",\\"end of the world\\"etc,will definetley blow you mind, however some tracks come across as filler, hence only 4* and not 5*.if you like grunge(creed,stp,bush,foo fighters,staind etc..)you will enjoy this album,otherwise, stay well clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staincold?","review":"This cd is very good but they sound a little too close to Staind, possibly from touring with them.

Overall it's worth buying because their sound is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Views of Cold and its Mainstream Programing","review":"This is by far the best cd I have ever bought. You may also recongnize, like I did, that the lead singer sounds most like Staind's, Aaron Lewis. They both have great singing voices and they don't scream. I would definately recommend this cd to any of you out there thinking about buying this cd. COLD LIVES ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"13 WAYS TO FEEL COLD","review":"I still cant decide if '13 ways...' is any better than their debut or not? where their debut was a grunge album this has come in the mould of nu-metal and the darkness and heavy riffing of the debut is still very much evident here,tracks like 'she said,'no one' and 'same drug' instantly standout although other tracks 'confession','end of the world' and 'bleed' also make this worth parting cash for."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Cold is defintely one of the best new bands I have heard. I saw them live when the opening up for Staind/Godsmack in the spring of 2001. I had never heard of cold before then and they really blew me away. I was amazed by their music and lyrics. I got 13 ways to bleed on stage to see how I would like it. I was not disappointed. The album definetely rock. It's nice to have a really good heavy metal that has a high level of emotion like with cold. Bleed with aaron lewis of staind at the end of the albums is the perfect way to end the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"cold best to date, better than \\"year of the spider\\"","review":"Cold's first record, the self-titled one, was a bit too hardcore for me. no, it wasn't headbanging metal or anything like that, but at the same time, it was just a little too much. Cold's third album, year of the spider, had pop-star written all over it, and produced by howard benson meant it was going to be huge. I personally didn't like it. Think \\"14 shades of grey\\" by staind, with a couple hard-rockers to even things out. \\"13 ways\\" is right in the middle, neither too hardcore, nor too pop-rock, giving it the perfect sound. No, this isn't going to appeal to you head-banging screamo fans, but those of you who like hard, vocal driven rock without the pop edge should check it out. here are cold's best to worst in a row: 13 ways, different pain, year of the spider and cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold - 13 Ways To Bleed Onstage","review":"This was a terrible CD. The only song worth hearing is track # 1: Just Got Wicked. The other songs are clunkers. Don't waste your money on this. It's not worth it.

This album just does NOT cut it because I unfortunately bought THIS version instead of the explicit.When you're listening to the songs, you just can't help but notice the irritating edits they do on the cuss words.

Don't waste your money on this, if you really want a great rock album get Mudvayne - The End of All Things to Come, now THAT is a great album. The lead singer of Cold sounds [weak] trying to sound hard in a few of the songs, then again I'd rather try to listen to him trying to be hard than listening to his melodic mumbo-jumbo through most of the other songs, this is what I like to call [weak] rock. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Orbital Sander I Have Ever Owned","review":"I actually used this sander extensively last night to sand down some rough wall texture.

I found myself skipping entire pages of rhetoric just to keep from falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly edited, slow paced, uneventful","review":"The whole book is riddled with editorial errors. The errors are so obvious however, you would expect an author to know the simple facts Berberick stuffed up on. For example, Kitiara's surname is Uth Matar, not Majere. Several references in the war of the lance are incorrect also. That aside, Dalamar wasn't developed throughout the book at all. He was the same character from start to finish. All the battle scenes were boring to say the least. I felt none of the tension I usually do when reading a decent dragonlance book. Overall, it was a huge letdown. WotC should have got one of their more competant authors to write the story about one of Krynns favorites. Berberick was involved with desecrating Cryssania's name in \\"Tears of the Night Sky\\". She has done it again with \\"Dalamar the Dark\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phewwwww...","review":"I don't remeber much of this book because it's been awhile since I read it, and because I dind'tenjoyed it.

This book titled 'Dalamar the dark' centered more on the events transpiring around him than it did on Dalamar himself. As a long time Dalamar fan I found it very disappointing, it left me knowing little more about the mysterious elf than I had known before. A lot of things about this book disappoint me, but all that really needs to be said is..Dalamar deserves far better. Am I the only one that thinks that picture of Dalamar looks more human than elven, besides the ears of course ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would of expected","review":"I would of expected more in a story about Dalamar.

The language is far too whimsical and I'm sure that the book is designed to be a 'tip of the cap' to the poetry of \\"Beowulf\\" because it is set out to be the same - a good story told in prose. Unfortunately this is not the case and I think that someone should take hold of the reins in this Dragonlance saga and start getting back to the basics of good storytelling. And please leave the flowery language where it belongs - in Barbara Cartland novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"This is just another tale pumped out by TSR to make as much money from the dragonlance stories, the story does no justice to dalmar who is an iteresting character in the DL saga,the author wrote about him it seems after reading a review of of the DL books.

Yes, there are a few editing errors, but overall the book captured both the feel of Ansalon in the years before the period portrayed in 'Chronicles,' and got all the *important* details right!I think this is a fine addition to the Dragonlance line and a fine fantasy novel in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful..","review":"I'm a big fan of the series, and I was excited to read this book because I thought Dalamar was an interesting character and hoped that a good portion of the story would have to do with the time he spend in the Tower of High Sorcery with Raistlin (my favorite character). Unfortunately the book ends at the door to the tower. And getting there was truly painful. I usually go through these books in a week while riding the train.

John Weiss' \\"The Advanced Deer Hunter's Bible\\" is 190 pages of commercial endorsements thinly disguised as a book about deer hunting. Weiss doesn't even camoflage the advertisements with the old \\"I used Dr. Zook's Buck Dee-See-Ver and shot the biggest buck of my life!\\" Instead he \\"proves\\" the value of the products by quoting \\"experts\\" who just happen to work for the company that makes the stuff. There may be valuable information in there somewhere, but I was too disgusted to find it after wading through ten separate Name-Brand endorsements in the first eleven pages of text. My advice is to save your $10.36 plus shipping and handling or spend it on three issues of \\"Outdoor Life\\". That way, the advertisements are labeled and if you don't learn anything useful you can still read Pat McManus. I give this book one star only because zero isn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's heavy","review":"On \\"Angry machine\\", Dio is mainly going for the heavy (and slow), sometimes rather similar to the style on \\"Strange highway\\". Of course, Ronnie James Dio is a great singer and that is what saves many of the songs on this uneven effort. Everything isn't slow and heavy - there's a couple of speedy songs included and they are absolutely the better ones. This album doesn't have any song with so called hit potential, like \\"Rainbow in the dark\\", but it contains a more or less traditional ballad, \\"This is your life\\" (something Dio hasn't done since the Rainbow days) on which Dio is singing beautifully. Dedicated Dio fans will certainly find pleasure in this album, but the casual listener should get \\"Holy diver\\", \\"The last in line\\" or \\"Killing the dragon\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"not that bad","review":"this album is not as bad as people say. it may not sound like the dio that we are used to, but that does not make it a bad album. although there are many obscure and often confusing time signature changes, this does not prevent angry machines from being a good dio album. i own all of dio's solo albums, and there is no such thing as a bad dio cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the mans best work...","review":"This record isn't \\"bad\\" per say. It's simply very confused. I remember an Rolling Stone article in which they spoke to him on the issue and it was clear that he didn't want to give up metal, but he seemed confused as to what metal was at the time.This is the poor mans \\"Dehumanizer\\". Socially concious lyrics filled with bleak imagry and anger but lacking in something purely emotional at the same time. The riffs are heavy but plodding and few songs catch the mind. (\\"Double Monday\\" and \\"Big Sister\\" manage to be fun at times though...)This CD is pretty much a decent but forgettable effort from a man losing his direction. Not a great CD...but a bit more original for the man than his attempts to reclaim the fantasy realm on \\"Magica\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dio stuck in a rute","review":"Angry Machines is argualby slightly better than Strange Highways, but it still ain't nothing too great. Dio this time uses deeper, rawer sounding guitars, which is a good idea to try something new, but the songs are still slow and none of them really take off. I did respect Dio for trying something a little different (especially with his \\"un-fantasy\\" lyrics), but still the album isn't worth getting worked up about. Get only if your a Dio fanatic, because metal fans in general will be sorely disappointed. The cover art is great, but I don't get what it it and the title have to do with the album? Angry Machines? I don't remeber anything about machines on the album, but then again, I don't really remember listening to it. Still a cool cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIO LP #8 ANGRY MACHINES","review":"FROM HOLY DIVER- THE LAST IN LINE- TO SACRED HEART- AND THE MINI LP INTERMISSION.

Frankly I don't know what I did that made the dvd start, and when I tried to do it again, failed. The second problem is that even though there is only 1 and 1/2 hours of material on the disk, they used extreme compression, making the fast movements virtually unwatchable. Compression should never be used in sports or other fast moving subjects, as it obliterates any details. The \\"birth of an axe murderer\\" fight with Vanderlei Silva was very good to watch though, earning the disk a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I hate to criticize a book that is done by an aspiring writer but this one just does not make it. I'm surprised it's gotten such high reviews from others. Rather dull plot and poorly developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"city as character","review":"I admit it--I read for pleasure and like a great plot over flowery descriptions and fine language. At first, I did not buy this book because I thought that it would be full of such descriptions, since the author is a travel writer. However, the author weaves the descriptions into the plot, and the holy city becomes a character in itself. The book is a character study, but with enough tension to keep the reader turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The charaters stayed with me","review":"Contrary to some reviews, I did not find that the setting out shined the the character development, although their is not much of a plot. The setting and the turmoil in India that are featured in the book are mysterious. So too are the characters. While they are not all fully developed, the fact that they are not, made the book at the more compelling. The reader can almost feel him or herself as one of them. You would never really know a fellow guest in a bed and breakfast all that well during a short stay and that is just what Payne gives us. A partial view into the lives of people who pass like ships in the night. We may want to know more about them- but Payne leaves that up to the readers imagination. I ended the book wanted to know these people better. I have since thought about them. To me, that makes for an memorable reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Find","review":"I won this CD through a contest on my college's radio station. Having never heard of KBA, I had no idea what to expect of this album. It was remarkably good. The music has a soft melodious sound to it.

I listen to a lot of music, and am very forgiving, but this stuff is just plain aweful. And for anyone to dare and compare this band to Pink Floyd is like comparing a Cajun fried shrimp to a playful Blue Whale: There's no likeness except for the fact that they both have homes in water. This stuff is the pits. Please, do not encourage this group by buying their album. Perhaps, after a while, King Black Acid will lay of the dope and realize they have no musical talent whatsoever. Then, they can peacefully reaquaint themselves with the real world and grab hold of a 'real' job that will produce something of worth in this world. This CD is a mockery, a bad joke! To give them 5 stars is absurd. I can see giving Britney Spears five stars for her efforts because the girl has talent (even though I don't like her style of music). But to give these guys 5 is a crime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I love the guilt free pleasue Zoe's Whole Grain Energy Bars provide. That being said, this flavor is YUCKY!

My three year old passes up Rasin Bran, Cheerios, etc. and asks for Zoe O's (cinnamon) which she eats as both a snack and as her breakfast in the morning. My extremely picky five year old son hounds me every time he catches me eating a Zoe energy bar. Honestly, I have to sneak them or he won't leave me alone.

The peanut butter bars are not as good as Zoe's apple bars which are excellent.

Too bad, as these Zoe's meal bars should continue to be made and marketed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not edible","review":"I've tried these and the chocolate peanut butter ones. These aren't edible, IMHO. Strong vitamin taste with another bad aftertaste. Was incredibly hard to finish the box, I gave most away. The recipients didn't like them either. I also don't think the nutrient value was high enough to put up with that taste.I didn't mind the chocolate peanut butter ones, however, and even though they are waxy, the taste was tolerable (chocolatey coating offset that awful aftertaste) and all of these bars are definitely good as an occasional quick breakfast replacement or mid-day snack to keep you going. Filling."},{"rating":"1","title":"tastes bad","review":"Ugh. This has a bland, peanut butter taste with an unfortunate \\"vitamin\\" aroma.

My two kids (aged 6 and 8) love them so much that we've had to stop them listening to them at bedtime (which was why we bought them!) as they weren't getting to sleep! Too busy listening (and giggling!). The only slightly annoying thing is that you have to change cd's half way through stories. Not a big thing, just a little inconvenient is all.

Imagine my surprise when the media player stalled out at the end of not one, not two, but ALL of the five disks in the series. If she weren't such a fan, I'd just get my money back.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but I needed a cargo bag big enough to hold luggage for a family of six....and it did. We took a 1300 mile trip and did not have any problems. We did not have any rain, so I can't say how water resistant it really is. It was easy to strap down. We had to use 2 of the hooks with our 2004 Envoy. We checked it a couple of times and it was fine. NO shifting. Expect a lot of wind noise. Overall, I recommend this item. I'm glad I read the reviews and decided on this item instead of those expensive hard top ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Top Carrier","review":"The carrier did exactly as was hoped - we traveled 1600 miles and all was dry and clean when we arrived.

It started out waterproof, but by the time we got back home, you could see that the fabric was starting to deteriorate and you could easily see light through the spots where there was a lot of wear.It might work better for shorter trips, or maybe needs a more rigid tote inside. We had two smaller luggages that were well within any sort of weight constraints.It did stay on very well and hardly moved during the entire duration of the trip traveling at highway speeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and Durable","review":"I bought this for a 1000 mile trip through wyoming and colorado on a Pontiac Vibe. I don't have cross bars for my rack, so I secured this with an additional cam strap as suggested by other reviews. It didn't budge despite going 80 mph for much of the trip. My fuel economy went from 29 mpg to 25 with the bag full. When it was less full on our way back our mileage was at 28. We passed through 100 miles of moderate rain, and the inside of the bag was definitely damp, but this was expected based on other reviews.I love the cargo flexibility that this bag gives me, and it folds up small enough that I can tuck it away in one of the weird hidden compartments in my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Used this bag for a 5 hour drive packed with 90 lbs of stuff on top of a VW Passat Wagon. Easy to attach with only the side bars of the roof rack and very limited noise on the roads up to 80 mph.

Bottom line is for the money, this can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"I was a little hesitant to make this purchase because I honestly thought the bag must not be great because it was so cheap! Well, this bag is awesome! It was easy to strap down, and holds TONS of gear. We only used about 50% of the space in the bag and we had a pack n play, small stroller, and several small bags of shoes, towels, lifejackets and several blankets and pillows. The bottom of the bag is lined with a soft material to keep it from scratching the roof, and has some light padding as well. The straps are attached so you don't need to buy tie downs, and it even comes with clips so that it will work without a roof rack. We have crossbars on our rack, but you could have easily used this with just the two bar roof rack no problem. We did not encounter any rain, so I can not speak for the bag's waterproofing. Great bag at a great price, and holds a ton of stuff! Can't beat it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not stout enough","review":"has felt bottom to protect car roof which was nice. easily and securely straps to luggage rack.

The coating on the end points to stop it from scratching the paint is exactly what caused it to slip right off the roof of my car, slam into my 2012 Malibu trunk lid, causing $1200 in damage, fly off the back of my car into oncoming traffic, and then slide to a stop over 300-500 feet destroying EVERY piece of camping gear that was in it. I was devastated, and had to attempt to put all of my gear into my already over stuffed car to continue on my trip. Absolute waste of money. I double checked all the straps and tie downs before we left, and in the end it gave no warning, no shimmy, no vibrations..nothing. Just went poof off the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag!","review":"It's well made and waterproof. It served it's purpose well.

Folds up nicely and am sure I will be using it again. Trip was successful, nothing was damaged. Love it !! I purchase this through Amazon.

It tore along the seams, and in the bag were mostly clothes. However, until then the bag seemed pretty good, and was sturdy.My suggestion is that anyone who purchases this needs to assess how far the bag will be expected to go. This is not a heavy-duty bag, and shouldn't have much weight packed into it. Luckily I got a full refund on it, and the company handled the return very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"Fastened this to the top of a Nissan Quest. We were a bit worried about the straps. They just don't seem like they will hold the bag while going down the highway, so we also secured the bag with some bungee cords. Everything stayed in place. We filled our rooftop bag with duffel bags full of clothing, air mattresses, sleeping bags and pillows. We wrapped them all in garbage bags just in case of rain, but we didn't encounter any, so I cannot vouch as to whether or not this bag is weatherproof. It is a large bag, though. My mother was playing around with my twin 7-year olds and they all got inside the bag together and folded the top closed. I was shocked to see that they all fit inside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"We used this item in a recent driving vacation to Colorado from Texas. Loading our luggage in this roof top bag freed up needed space in our vehicle. It is easy to attach if your vehicle is equipped with a roof rack with side bars that the straps can be pulled under and around. It is amazingly large. We could fit one oversized piece of luggage and two average pieces of luggage in it, as well as some small incidental things. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I put the luggage in plastic trash bags and then put them in the roof top bag. It is water resistant, but not waterproof, so you must keep this in mind. We drove through a downpour in NM and did have some leakage. Luckily, the items that did get slightly wet were not damaged. Occasionally we heard some noise but nothing that was louder than the typical road noise. We are very pleased with this item and highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roof top bag","review":"The roof top bag is easy to handle and tie it to the roof bars.

The straps are secure but I plan to use additional 12' straps. The bottom of the bag is felt like so it should protect the top of the car. I do not plan on using the hooks that come with the unit - I will strap it down - no chances taken. The zippers and seams appear to be of good quality - I packed some items into the bag just to see how it will do. I did not find any issues.

We were able to fit 4 LG duffle bags, 1 LG emergency kit bag and all of our muddy clothes in a black yard bag in this one single roof bag, It all fits awesome. I also like that the bottom of the bag is very soft so it does not scratch my hardtop.

We tried to tie it up and tie it down but it kept on blowing back up and tearing more. Not sure if we ended up getting a defective one or if all of them are this poorly made, but it was a huge incovenience.

Was able to drive from central utah to the california coast with no problems whatsoever. Comfortably packed packed a family tent, camping chairs, blow up matrresses, sleeping bags, and pillows.

Overall, its great. I bet just casual rain and I wouldn't have a problem, but this was serious stuff so I am still giving it 4 stars.

We made it half way through Georgia when we were flagged by another driver to pull over (THANK YOU). Our luggage carrier was shredded! The zipper had come apart and the weather protection liner was shredded! What a mess! There black shards all over everything.

In the first movie, when he started growling while transforming in that flashback scene, it looked silly rather than frightening. I think it's because the way he's made up, his forehead is too big, and his face is scrunched up under it. He doesn't radiate power or danger but looks more like a brainy type. I don't know if that was intentional in the casting, but it's weird.Second, it's just boring. Although it was nice to see Tannis again, in his former glory. The plot moves too slowly, and the Victor chews the scenery with every line - always looks like his face muscles are about to pop out of his skin.I got to where Lucien is waiting for whatshername at the clearing and I simply didn't care anymore.

There is big budget action sprinkled in throughout the movie. The art style really sets it apart from any other movie, because its dark, blue and set in the medieval ages.

I really enjoyed the first \\"Underworld\\". Heck, it featured Kate Beckensale in skin tight black leather, so what's not to like?? But, this movie was so poorly edited, scripted, and poorly acted, even the lovely Ms Mitra could not make it watchable.Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. Even Blu Ray can make this watchable. The sound was really awful, and the transfer was so poor, the entire experience seemed as though we were watching a VHS tape version.Please believe me when I tell you this is the kind of experience that will have you writing to the studio with a demand to be compensated for all of the time you wasted watching this excruciatingly horrid flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better but was filled with plenty of action","review":"For all the fans that love Underworld and Vampires this will be an enjoyable movie. If you are a stickler on the little tings like me you will find some inconsistantcies in this movie and the flashbacks/stories told in the first two. They should not have used Kate Beckinsale as Victor's daughter. She could have been in the movie but she looked nothing like Victor's duaghter from the clips in the other movie.

I did enjoy this one,though. It details the history of the vampires and lycans, the feud that began between them, and how it began. It has great special effects with a passable story. There are holes in it, but it is interesting. It is a quick moving film. One minute you begin the film, then you are at the end.

This movie however, is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see Bill Nighy chew scenery. Michael Sheen returns as Lucian (the head lycan from the first movie), and the amazing thing here is they actually made him look younger in this, the prequel. Aside from those things, however, the movie offers absolutely nothing new to the story that's already been laid down in the first two movies, a fact that culminates in one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen, structurally speaking. The rule of thumb for storytelling is, the ending should be inevitable but unexpected. Guess what? You saw the ending coming, from about 2 movies ago. Skip this one, unless you desperately need to see Michael Sheen with his shirt off, or have a mad-on for watching Bill Nighy gnaw own every scene he's in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This product was labeled nearly new and it met to the highest of standards.

The special effects are very bad. They look like cheap video games. The fighting scenes are half baked. They don't look exciting, intense and real as the ones from Underworld 2.The only good thing about this move is the love between Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra. It provides a couple of touching scenes. But they are too few to make the film worth while.I prefer Underworld 2 because of the fighting and Kate Beckinsale.

So, I went out to find my own copy and I'm still blown away by it today. I've even given copies as gifts. The music is certainly relaxing and such, but what I most value from it is the spiritual magic.

It folds up so it doesn't take much room in your toolcase, and doesn't accidentally cut you or your other equipment (like every drywall saw on the market does). I keep a drywall blade, wood blade and metal blade in here, and it's handy for virtually any situation. For serious or volume cutting, you still can't beat a conventional saw, but for work in tight spaces, drywall cutting or the occassional cut when you just need a quick saw, this is a great addition to any toolbox.

Such sincerity and raw emotion as written and projected by Maria McKee is extremely rare, and I was thrilled to come across this release of \\"new\\" material. The one error on this album is the inclusion of \\"Sweet Jane\\", which didn't need redoing, and is totally ruined by the presence of Bono, one of the most boring and pompous \\"musicians\\" that continues to produce music today. He ruined that song for me. As for Maria and the gang, I MISS YOU!

The album is simply not as good as LJ's albums. Maria McKee's cowgirl posturing is off putting, and her screeching will make you beg for mercy. McKee is a great singer, but you'd never know it from this album. Everything here is a bit off kilter, if you doubt, compare her version of \\"Way's To Be Wicked' with Tom Petty's vastly superior original.

Other than that, its only saving grace is the Pulp Fiction reference with Elmer and Sam near the end- oh, and Bill Murray.

The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and \\"strutting her stuff\\" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities.

All are set in the fictional town of Port William, Kentucky, and all confront similar themes: death, honor, community. The story \\"Fidelity\\" is the most powerful, the story of a mountain man who, according to the most rigid interpretation of the law, kidnaps his dying father from a hospital.

It's a wonder how this unskilled MC even came up, or why the Wu would want to be affiliated with him. Throughout the album, he drops boring raps about crime in the city, in a bland, unappealing manner, which make the CD a chore to even listen to. On on the title cut \\"Heist Of The Century\\", La does spin an intruiging tale of robbing the government. As far as the beats go, there are a few head nodders, but only one track, \\"Shine\\", has a beat that's good enough to overcome La's lyrical impediment.

What's new in this recording is a kind of distance or objectivity in regard of these lieder, it's not a romantic version and that's what makes of it an even more tragic one. The phrases of Quasthoff accompanied marvellously by Spencer make us feel as we took part really in this freezing journey. I've got the chance to listen to a concert diffused by ZDF (Germany), where Quasthoff was accompanied by Maria Joao Pires. If somebody could tell me how to get in possession of this beautiful recording, I'd be a happy man, 'cause on this occasion I discovered my favourite baryton singer.

All the rest take a very baritonal approach - Goerne seems to want to be a tenor most of the time. Quasthoff has a completely different sound; rich in quality throughout the registers. Note that he is also singing the standard Peters \\"Low Voice\\" keys.Emotionally, this is also very satisfying. The craziness is not on the surface as with Hampson or (to some extent) Prey. In the last song, Leiermann, this a little disconcerting - there one almost expects the weirdness. But elsewhere, the approach is to grasp the musical core first, and then find the expressiveness in the words, not to tell an overall existential story.

I just couldn't tolerate the smell. Thus, I didn't use it. However, the shipping to return it would have been expensive enough that it wasn't worthwhile to do so, so I was stuck with it (Plus I had already had a bad experience returning something to Amazon.)

This NYC art-world thriller, which got much hype when it came out is nothing more than an insider's hackneyed paint-by-numbers attempt to hit it big as an author. There are so many clichés, I wouldn't want to waste the space listing them out. Ramus' insider status doesn't add much to this tired story about a crooked art dealer whose world crumbles when his master forger is unexpectedly slain prior to completing a Manet water lily fake.

It is refreshing to hear a band that still plays fast and melodic punk rock. (Every other band seems to be slowing down.) The best songs on this album are: \\"Dear God from me\\", \\"My life my way\\" and \\"Oh say I can see\\". Actually all 16 songs are good. There's not that much variation on this album though. If it had a couple of good slower songs I would have given it 5 stars. This is the only Backside-album I have heard, so I can't compare it to their earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Series","review":"I purchased this series and love it.

Kate Hill has created a refreshing world, or one that would be refreshing if the writing wasn't so stilted and childish.I was hoping for some erotica as promised in the description. There's sex, but it is clumsy and not arrousing. Hill has tried and failed at creating the necessary tension between lovers. Again, that is because of the writing.The plot is pretty straightforward, but there is really very little for the protagonist to struggle against. It's an unfair fight where one is completely assured he will win.The characters are likeable and diverse, but you get only the slightest outline of them.This book could have been lush and fresh. In the end, it felt like it was written by a teenager who was caught between My Little Pony and her emerging hormones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for...","review":"I give the book two stars because it's a creative idea and I really tried to like it but it's described as an erotic romance and the relationship has absolutley no tension or romantic build up, just sex.

It was the first one I picked up, and I let her keep the rest. After I found out who exactly I was listening to I rushed to buy the real CD. The entire Lockjaw album is upbeat and catchy, and is one you can listen to over and over. The harmonies are fun, and the band builds a solid backbone behind the girly duo.

I admit, I like Buck-O-Nine. I like Green Day. And believe it or not, I LOVE Rancid! I've even started wearing a Tim Armstrong-like mowhawk! But as for the Dance Hall Crashers, no. The song \\"Sticky\\" has the strangest lyrics (\\"Take the knife out of my back/clean the blade and put it back\\"). even a Slayer fan like me finds that weird, probably because it's being sung by a chick. The 2 girls definetly aren't fun to look at either. They're both extremely pail with dark red lipstick. Real female punk is Joan Jett, The Donnas, Patti Smith, you know, singing about rock & roll and boys and pissing and stuff and not songs about other girls with mental problems. To me, DHC's style has nothing to do with real punk. Now, since I like punk, even ska punk, I hope DHC sells well, but I wouldn't bother buying one of their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Sounds just like every other Disney CD.","review":"I agree with the former reviewer.

What is \\"Part of Your World\\" doing on an \\"exercise\\" album? This CD has a few of the classic songs: Ducks Dance Too, I Wanna Be Like You. But the name is misleading.

It's a lagitimate pilates tutorial that will really give you an intense workout (I was feeling it for days). I especially loved that this video was modern and beautifully made. So often, we get corney videos with bad music and an irritating instructor who talks too much! Not this video! All of the instructors were incredibly beautiful! The only thing I wish they would have added is an actual routine at the end that compiled all the dance moves learned together. Otherwise, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video.

I have come to trust these books as thorough, authoritative and helpful in planning and implementing trips. The Banff, Jasper & Glacier National Parks book is an exception and meets none of these criteria unless you sole focus is hiking. This book is for hikers and has little information for others. Furthermore, of the 280 pages of actual information, only 57 pages are devoted to Glacier National Park. Information concerning lodging, restaurants and other activities such as cycling is sparse. The few maps that are included detail mainly hiking trails.

Yet, I am sorry to say that this one is a real let down. The lay out is not user friendly. The print styles are very difficult to read.

I anticipated the arrival of The Illustrated Guide to Pruning more than any other. I felt that 300+ pages of pictures and explanations on pruning would serve as an exhaustive reference that I could use to fill in the knowledge gaps. I read the book in the course of a week. It was OK. There is LOTS of repetition. There was no a-ha moments...Arboricuture 4th edition by Harris, Clark, and Matheny touch on pruning as only a part of their excellent book. They are succinct in what they say and are able to transfer as much good information in less than 50 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased on Pruning","review":"i am very pleased to have purchased \\"An Illustrated Guide To Pruning\\". The book was written with very descriptive language that easily explains the correct way, time and type of pruning to perform.

Make no mistake about it, this is top-shelf electric blues with all of the ingredients Larry is known for cookin' up. The vocals here are from deep within this barrel-chested road-hardended vet. Larry croons with so much soul and heart, you may forget he is also the guitar burner here....you may but it's doubtful. Larry's lead work and arrangements are awesome as usual. Great for the musician and \\"joe listener\\" alike this music is layered with busy grooves & stops, background vocals, and funky bass lines, all supporting McCray's searing but juicy-toned licks, which he never seems to run out of.

Not just piracy, but real pirates. Weird, but well done. Hall really is a master at this sort of stuff, although this particular novels ends up getting very bloody, and the ending was a bit too bizarre and far-fetched for my tastes. Still, if you've enjoyed his other novels, this one holds up well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love Hall's descriptions of the Florida Keys.

This is probably one of the few pastas I could eat directly from the pot, without sauce or seasoning (not that I would, but I don't mind testing it while it's cooking....) It reminds me a lot of the fresh egg noodles I ate as a kid at huge family dinners.Doesn't disintegrate or get gluey, and doesn't get that weird bitter or nutty flavor some whole wheat pastas take on. Cooks VERY tender and not sticky. Lovely with all sorts of sauces, and we also just toss it with a little oil and some veggies.This pasta is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This book was of no use whatsoever.

I would recommend this book for upper elementary level and beyond. As an adult, I also found it quite interesting, especially as I'm on my way to spend time in Rwanda.

These are comfortable right out of the box and have a great cushioned feel. This is my second pair of this style. I bought the first last year in a mall store in a size 10, my usual size. They fit fine but, to me, feel a bit shorter than usual. I bought this pair from Amazon in a 10 1/2 (the mall store does not carry 10 1/2 but jump right to an 11).

It's heavy, yet operatic and airy. There are two distinct layers to each song Secret of the Runes: The driving guitars, and the orchestral instruments and operatic vocals. CJ doesn't sing much (if at all) on this album, which I like. On previous releases, the only thing I didn't like was his singing.This album is completely Nordic, which is fine, although I admit I liked the Egyptian themed releases quite a bit more.

I, too, first heard of Cibo Matto on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" last season in which Buffy dances to the wonderful \\"Sugar Water.\\" But it's the lyrics that make me crack up every time I hear them. \\"My baby horse is Jennifer / What a beefy hip!\\", \\"Let's eat carrots together, until...\\", \\"My mom says 'You are kinky!'\\" These are just some of the very strange lyrics on this CD...and that's just from one song. \\"Know Your Chicken\\" and \\"Birthday Cake\\" are also quite amusing. This CD is not for everyone...I can't imagine any of my friends liking it all that well...but it certainly is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Va Bene!","review":"Cibo Matto is quite a group! Excellent use of silliness (ie: subject matter), mixed in with the trademarks of hip hop: breakbeats, and sampling. Much respect for these two Japanese sistas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Know Your Cibo Matto","review":"Cibo Matto is great and something different, but in a [very] good way. I love the thick Japanese accent and the creative lyrics and I like how each song is different (something you don't get nowadays where all the songs by different artists sound the same).Sugar Water is a very poetic song. The chorus in Beef Jerky is hilarious and catchy. Know Your Chicken is one of the catchiest songs ever made. (The bass guitar in that song is awesome!) And who can forget Birthday Cake? The vocals (as well as the lyrics) are great! Le Pain Perdu is a very solid song and Articoke has great lyrics.One of the few quirks about this album, though, is the song Theme, which is kind of long and should have been the last song instead of in the middle of the album (in my opinion at least).But, overall, this album is creative, fun, something different and a VERY enjoyable experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, but make sure you're ready for it!","review":"Cibo Matto's first offering is unlike anything you've ever heard. This, for most of us, is the tag line for many of our favorite cds, a sure-fire 5 stars. And in this case it's true--but make sure it's for you before you buy.With every song about a different type of food, in every style (or uncategorizable meld)and tempo, in broken (hysterical) English, you get a cd of uncomparable energy, creativity and poignancy. Not every song is a silly melody of hysteria -- not every one is quiet, melancholy and deeper than first expected. The cd comes off as an experience, not as one or two good songs. To fully appreciate it, let yourself laugh at its incredible lyrics, scream along with \\"Birthday Cake,\\" and whisper alongside the creepy and mysterious vocals on \\"White Pepper Ice Cream.\\"Listen.Buy.Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I consider Birthday Cake to be an example of the future","review":"Some of us believe Rock N' Roll is dead. I believe it is just in remission. Birthday Cake has the energy and humility we need in our music. It's something we lost somewhere along the way.

The pad ...","review":"I really liked this heating pad. The pad was soft and flexible, and it was very easy and comfortable to wrap around my body. It heated evenly and consistently. The Auto-Off feature is also great. No more worrying about accidentally leaving it turned on. The control pad displayed a different color for each level of heat making it easy to use in the dark. All it took was a light tap to control the heat although I also found that it was easy to accidentally lean on the control pad and turn it off. A slightly depressed button would've made this product perfect. All in all, though, I highly recommend this heating pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

It has four temperature settings that you can adjust and you can apply either dry heat or wet heat (just spray water on it). Plus it's machine washable. Both my wife and I love it. My wife often has lower back pain, and she can tie this heating pad to her waist and sit in the sofa and relax. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've used this just about everyday since receiving ...","review":"I've used this just about everyday since receiving it. Working in the flower garden everyday has made it a must! I especially like the option of the different heat controls available. It doesn't get as hot on the high setting as most of the one-setting heating pads, but that to me, is a safety feature. I also like the Auto-Off feature. I'd definitely buy this product. It's an improvement over a lot of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nest Pre-School loves magical ride","review":"Unbaised, no... he's my dad.

The book deals with the subject of prejudice which is something I don't agree with. I think Tunes and Kneebone were treated very unfairly and Tunes is never fully believed.

I would recommend this book for readers between the ages of 11-14."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Skies the book that got me going","review":"I gave Dangerous Skies four stars because sometimes it doesn't have enough excitment, like when thier talking back and forth. The other parts are great, like when Buck had to find out who did the murder Rowlen or Tunes. It seems like sherif did it for a while, in my opinion.

One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out. One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it. The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that.

However, I paid what I consider to be a high price for this product because it claimed to have lemon/pepper in it. I thought the garlic base was a good idea and a good substitute for all the salt in other lemon/pepper seasonings. But I expected, from the label, that there would be the taste of lemon and pepper. If you like garlic, this is okay although not really that garlicky either. If you like lemon pepper, this won't do it for you. There is zero lemon or pepper taste in this product, and I have verified this with several family members. I only rated it even 1 star because you have to click on at least 1 star to put in a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decieving","review":"First, I was expecting that they would fill it up to the top, but apparently they filled it 1/3 all the way up.Shipping also cost about 3.50. about the same price as the product.

Some children have a hard time building things to begin with as they focus to have a steady hand...now add cheap components to the mix. Eventually, one will try to connect some parts together and the *SNAP* will occur leaving the child with two pieces instead of one...both of which are now useless.

The music will speak for itself just fine, and that's just the approach Talich has chosen. These guys are as good, technically speaking, as anybody but what stands out is how unassuming they are. None of that \\"look Ma, see how fast I can play\\" that we get from the Emersons. Anyway, this is the set for you.

Except that their touch is light and with barely any warmth, a complete opposite of the old school style of the Quartetto Italiano with lots of warmth and weight. The end result is that this is the most shallow, boring Beethoven quartet set I have ever heard; all the drama, fire and passion I expect from Beethoven's music is missing hear. The Quartetto Italiano plays relaxed but never without any fire in their music, and never boring. So I am not sure why some of the guys here rate this set so highly; perhaps they play this set by their bedside to accompany their sleep?"},{"rating":"2","title":"out in the fields","review":"the only problem I had was with the last song on this cd.

This album is indeed an excellent representative collection of his songs and reflects the sheer power of the man; consider the almost Punklike power of \\"Out in the Fields\\" and compare it with the overtly Celtic strains of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and the almost melancholy haunting tones of \\"Parissienne Walkways\\". The diversity of the music, the inherent feeling with which it is played and the clarity of his playing technique all contribute to a musical experience which is quite superior.This album is indeed a tribute to both Gary and his work and as previously stated is a must for anyone who appreciates guitar playing of this calibre.Roll on the next collection Gary !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very unhappy","review":"i want to return this product and finally got a return authorization number but the vendor will not answer my question before i return it.

Just a fantastic album, buy it!-Konkrypt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic black metal, reinvented","review":"Although this work derives its sound from the early works of Bathory, its composition adds a dimension to the experience through layers of internal harmony which sweep through otherwise straightforward and violent songs. The epic nature of Burzum is revealed on the second half of this work, however, where longer songs bloom into mini-operatic ascents into a consciousness that is larger than human. These are similar to a modern Wagner, in that the music is a medium through which an artistic narrative is expressed. Also of note are the raspy, squealing, sighing vocals of Count Grishnack which add an emotional dimension where most bands use a rigid monotone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varg: no, Burzum: Yes","review":"Ok, lets set my opnions before i review the album. I love MayheM, Euronymous is true a Black Metal god, and i hate varg for killing him, but i love burzum too, great music, very pure Black Metal. okey doke, now that that's out of the way, on to the album. well i decided to get this album because i wanted to hear some burzum, even though i dont like varg, and i wasnt disapointed at all. Varg is a very good song writer and he pulls off the One-Man-Band thing very well. theres a cuple of synth tracks and there good in there own way. the metal songs are very good. i especially liked \\"War\\" (does he say \\"This is.....wow\\"?) this is highly recommeded along with Mayhem - De Mystris Dom Sathanas, Bathory - Under the sign of the black mark, Just about any venom album, Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse, any Darkthrone especially \\"A Blaze in the northern sky\\" and \\"Translyvanian Hunger\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"No matter how untalented you might be, or how terrible your music is, if you know how to market yourself right and create an interesting legend around yourself, the kids will worship you.

I can't help but laugh every time I hear some 17 year old kid going off on how amazing Burzum is, Varg is the greatest of all time, \\"black metal begins here maaan!\\", blah blah. Please, Burzum is mediocre at best. And mediocrity has never been something that should be celebrated, no matter how much hype has been built up. If you want to hear some black metal worth listening to, pick up a Bathory CD and shut up about Varg's pathetic attempts at creating music. This is cacaphonic noise pollution for idiot hessian bigot teenagers to jerk off to, nothing more.

Just because Varg Vikernes killed a member of one of the greatest Norwegian black metal bands Mayhem doesn't mean his music sucks!!! He even played bass on Mayhem's \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\". And now, everyone pretends Euronymous and Varg were enemies. Of course, Varg should never have killed him and it's good that he's punished for it, but that's definately NOT a reason to stigmatize his music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I sent the wrong adapter plugs?","review":"I ordered two of these for our trip to New Zealand and Australia.

When I got mine back from the factory I was constantly putting my hand on it to see if it was running. It was just so quiet.This is one of the first items that I recommend for a chemically sensitive person to buy.When the box arrived all I had to do was lift the box off and plug it in. It was so well packed I was impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - fun for the family to read","review":"I have four children ages 11, 9, 7, and 5. The older kids and I would take turns reading the chapters aloud each night. Even though we are a broad range of ages, all of the kids and I loved this story. The character names are funny and each chapter was full of interesting and adventurous events. We are looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vantec NexStar External USB 2.0/Firewire Hard Drive Enclosure","review":"The product does exactly what is designed to do, and that is to allow you to take a 3.5 inch hard drive and convert it for portable USB use.It works very well and the only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars is the use of very small screws to tighten the enclosure. It wasn't a problem for me as my vision is very good but it could prove to be a minor problem for someone who doesn't have at least average vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This thing conked out on me and destroyed my harddrive pretty quickly.

For anyone who is familiar with Kenny's playing this album just reaffirms his reputation as having been one of the most talented and lyrical trumpet players in jazz. For anyone who is just finding about about Kenny Dorham \\"Quiet Kenny\\" gives a good idea of what to expect from this master: beautiful melodies, classic renditions of great standards, interesting original compositions, a soft, warm tone, and great accompaniment from Art Taylor, Paul Chambers, and Tommy Flanigan. The album includes the classic Dorham composition 'Lotus Blossom,' pretty versions of 'Old Folks,' 'Mack The Knife,' a haunting \\"Alone Together,\\" and great playing throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be replaced","review":"This is one of Osprey's oldest Men-at-Arms books, and is in dire need of replacement. The book never addresses its topic--the soldiers of the late imperial legions. The first half of the book covers Hadrian's Wall. The rest of the book discusses the archeological remains of armor, helmets, and swords. This book contains no discussion of the actual soldiers, battle formations, campaigns, tactics, historical antecdotes, or anything along the lines of what has become standard for the Men-at-Arms series. \\"The Rebuplican Roman Army, 200-104 BC\\" is hands down one of the best Men-at-Arms titles I've ever read, this book however is one of the worst, and I think a new one should be commissioned more along the lines of the former. For a better discussion of the soldiers of this period (and much better full-color plates), I recommend \\"Greece and Rome at War\\" by Peter Connonlly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Army from Hadrian to Constantine (Men at Arms Series, 93)","review":"The product arrived in good condition and pretty quickly at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portfolio","review":"The product arrived in a timely fashion and is exactly what the description said it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I've seen just about all of Dolph's movies and this one is definitely one of his best.

Sharing his work with the uninitiated can be a bit tricky. Some people may be initially turned off by his distinctive voice or the stark production of his solo records. I found this record is a great introduction to Mr. Cohen's work. It is very musical and Mr. Cohen creates a warm performance. The backing group (Passenger) fleshes out the songs in many interesting ways not present in the solo recordings. My wife loves the violin work on the record. That being said I would not call any performance here my \\"favorite\\" version of a song. Mr. Cohen's solo records offer the strongest emotional impact, but as far as being able to throw a Leonard Cohen record on in the car without the rest of the occupants mutinying this record fits the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"So beautiful, you'll get the chills!","review":"This record is a stunning debut from two of Austin's most talented young songwriters. At once emotional and subdued, the songs float around themes of secret passions, unrest, and always the encroaching shadow of death. The arrangements are sparse and pure, and the lyrics are dreamy and poetic. Definitely check this out if you like Belle & Sebastian or Nick Drake...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cancerous love songs","review":"These songs are so painful and true...

From 1975 through 1983 Basie reached his marvelous maturity with the best big band which ever existed. Although he needed mechanical aid in getting to the piano he needed no help from there on. We are talking Mozart genius at this point. However, most do not know that a DVD exists of the same gig. While the sound quality is not the same the insight into the internal dynamics of the band are displayed before us. Drive from Butch Miles, the rock of Freddie Green and the exciting, wonderful Al Grey stand out but the interface is visually apparent for the entire band. Look at Basie's face with a classic smile. He's having fun! The whole band is having fun! The result is remarkable. Buy the CD and buy the DVD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashtray Babyhead \\"Kicks\\"!!!!!!!","review":"As for the title....its a pun that my frined made up since they r now known as the kicks.

About the cover, I have never seen any jeans jacket as ugly as this. I don't think I can wear this jacket outside my room. About those posters, I don't think they were the work by artist or desginer. I don't know why the editor put these photos into visionaire. I can't get any good feeling, any subject or any style from these posters. As a whole, I don't think that is design. That is a box of posters. What is this degsign? How can I look at those posters? Open them, one by one and then put them back into the box! This action like a fool. Compare with #30.

It's just another example of how you give a couple of idiots some money and a camera and they try and reinvent the horror movie genre, the story is lame the effects are amature at best, and the acting is so bad, i felt like I was watching a bad high school stage producting of Night of the living dead, skip this movie please!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover might look great but...","review":"The truth to be told, this is just pure crap from beginning to end. I bought it because I thought the cover looked great and thougth the movie would live up to it as well. Boy was I wrong!Its intentions was to give me a scare, but it had the total opposite effect. After 15 mins, it nearly put me to sleep. The acting is poor, the editing is laughable and the special effects are mediocre at best. These actors do not even put the slightest effort into making their characters believable and it makes me think that I did better at the school-play as a 14 year old. It's that bad. Our house got hit by the lightning halfway into the movie and removed all electricity, and as much as it was bad having our tv channels screwed up, I was relieved not having to keep watching this utterly stupid movie.My advice to you: Avoid this and spend your money on something better. Even the silliest movie I have with big Hollywood names is better than this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little horror film!","review":"I rented this movie yesterday and really enjoyed it! It's moody and spooky and has some great scares but it also has an intricately plotted story -- something that is sorely lacking in many horror movies these days. It stars a cute blonde actress named Tatum Adair who is very good in the film and successfully pulls off a wide range of emotions. The movie also features some great locations and effects and a spooky little girl who really creeped me out. If you enjoy low budget horror movies this one is pretty fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOGGY GHOST STORY","review":"THINGS GOING AGAINST THIS MOVIE:1. Gregory Lee Kenyon who plays the sheriff was in the even worse DEMONICUS.2. Jay Woelfel practically did EVERYTHING in this movie: wrote, directed, did the score, edited, casted, etc.3. Aforementioned Kenyon was also credited as \\"grips\\" in the final credits.4. The movie's plot is so engimatic it doesn't make sense.5. Timothy Prindle DOES look a lot like Lorenzo Lamas, but can't act nearly as good, which is bad because Lorenzo's not very good anyway.6. Poor Azure Sky Decker (as the twin girls) is probably the worst child actress I've seen.7. The meager special effects are pretty bad even for a low budget movie.8. It's just not scary and it's too long.Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cover!","review":"That being said, there is only one other thing of note to credit this movie with. It contains one of the fastest \\"off with the dress\\" in history. The door to the backseat of the car had hardly closed when, \\"whoop!\\", up and over the head it came and out they bounced!! It was all downhill from there, however, with a complicated and ridiculous \\"plot\\" (I'm still confused), laughable special effects, and poor acting. I thought the little girl who played the twins was cute, however, but can you believe she was actually reading her lines from a cue card in certain scenes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a B movie! It's a C.","review":"This movie created a new class of bad. As a lover of horror films, I have enjoyed many low budget films. As hard as I tried to find something to like, Ghost Lake is perhaps the most amateurish, poorly acted movie I've ever seen in this genre. Their budget must have been really low. One car played numerous different roles. Most of the actors never changed their clothes. They stood in the rain for hours without a drop of water on them. The so-called ghosts looked like Halloween costumes from Wal-Mart. As for the acting, it was like watching a 5th grade school play. In several scenes, the actors would just get angry for no apparent reason. I'm not exaggerating. This movie was just plain horrible. How it ever made it to DVD is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've all got it right... AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers, which is pretty easy with this one since this movie is so totally bad that it is almost laughable (if it wasn't so painful). Whatever you do, do not spend a penny on it. I accidentally just rented it for a second time (I guess I forgot that I'd seen it before - I think that was my brain trying to spare me from the post traumatic stress of having seen it previously). If you enjoy movies that are so bad that they are good, you'll still hate this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

First and foremost, it has been credited with \\"inventing\\" the American Ghost. The book deserves a great deal of credit for this alone.It is also the story of a man in what we might refer to as \\"midlife crises\\" today. Bored with his respectable existence, he has fun and takes solace in a holiday outside of his behavioral norms. He has middle aged man thoughts- about his wife and a younger attractive ghost woman, that are realistic (to the extent of the propriety of the author) and enlightening. A true triumph of the work, however, is that it does this without becoming so maudlin that it is suitable for an English class.Finally, it is a comedic book, that is entertaining and worth reading.I recommend this book, but the reader needs to be prepared to judge it in the context of its day- and from that perspective it is truly remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Humour Standard","review":"'Topper' is best known perhaps from the Cary Grant movie version. It's a good movie but I like the book even better. The characters delight, particularly in terms of Cosmo's retaining his decorum, in the warmth of Marion's dead-but-still-sexy presence. Anyone who enjoys humourous novels has to put this one on their reading list. Few recent humour novels are as funny as this classic from decades past, but there is one I know of, entitled 'Rastus Reilly', and I recommend that book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the TV show","review":"and i very liked the show too !!. i remember seeing this book in the private collection of a professor at the university i worked at. so i took it home without his knowledge and read it. it was a very good read. light hearted but with a pleasant sadness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overview of Over priced","review":"This single is actually a pretty decent single but it is more or less resembles a domestic Released two track single...

The book provides a good solid foundation in using and applying various SolidWorks drawing and detailing options along with developing various templates and sheet formats.I like the command approach used by the author.

Unforunately if, like me, you are an experienced SolidWorks user requiring a reference book to refresh your memory occasionally on rarely used commands it is very frustrating. There is no index, so after reading it from cover to cover all you can do later is to search manually for the item you know is in there somewhere.

I won't give up too much info. on the book, but wow. The story is touching, the humor is so witty that I found myself dropping the book as I fell to the floor laughing, and best of all the characters are real. The book tackles important issues which are often left untouched and overlooked by most authors. It couldn't be better if she tried- Peters writes brilliance with paper and ink in Keeping You a Secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I was extremely excited to read this book, but I must admit, it was a bit of a let down. I finished the book in about 3 or 4 days, and that was during the work week. It was too easy of a read, meaning that the story itself was simple, predictable, and had no depth. Cece was a big Mary-Sue and a lot of the time turned out to be rather annoying. I'm a lesbian myself, but she took pride way too far reminding me of the \\"fema-nazi\\" feminists. All for it, but please, tone it down. I was expecting much more of this book and it let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I read half way through the book and then had to start skipping ahead to finish. I like that the book deals with the issues of self realization, coming out, and the pain of rejection, but everything was just too extreme. From the reaction of Holland's mother, to Holland's unwaivering and unbelievable teenage conviction, everything was at the far end of the spectrum. However, the character of Cece was by far the most unbelievable thing in the book. I also couldn't believe that Holland would come out to a mother who was so controlling. She would have been able to guess at the reaction she would get from such a controlling person, so why wouldn't she just lie until they were caught (by her mother) or until she moved away from home? I have read other books that have dealt with teen lesbianism and I think this one was just too dramatic. I also didn't feel much passion between the two, unlike in books such as Annie on Mind or Patience and Sarah. Worth reading if you're a gay teen though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Great Read","review":"So this book wasn't the most literary or most unpredictable lesbian read...So what if it was a 'high school' novel? It was fabulous nonetheless. For everyone who's ever come out, every LGBTQ person who knows what it means to have the support of their family and what they are without it, every woman who's ever had a crush on a girl, everyone who's ever fallen in love, questioned their future, or questioned who they really are...this book is well worth a weekend spent curled up with a cup of coffee, a donut, and the Dixie Chicks on the radio.

Peters does a wonderful job in capturing the issues surrounding coming out for young people, and deals with them courageously and realistically. She delivers a story of one girl who is supported by her parents and another who is disowned. One girl who is openly and comfortably gay, and another who is closeted and dealing with her newly-realized sexuality. These girls find comfort in each other as they deal with internal and external forces. If a book like this had been available 20 years ago, I might have made different choices in my own life. I might even have my own pre-teen daughters read it.The book is well-written, thoughtful, and easy to read.

I'm now a sophmore in college and I have to say this is still my favorite book to read. It's easy to get attached to the characters in this book and you feel for them and want to know what happens to them after the story ends. Just wonderful, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best!!!","review":"an amazing love story, i was completely blown away. i totally recommend it to all of our lesbian youth. this book shows the bitter reality of coming out to parents about being gay, but also shows that there are places to go if turned away."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I'm a teenager myself and before reading this book I was seeing the kids like Holland and Cece get bullied. And by the 13th chapter I confronted the bullies at school and it turns out some of them were gay too!I finished this book in 2 days. And all day I'd be thinking of the characters, the story line, what would happen to Holland and everything about this book. Peters did an excellent job and i can't wait to read her next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, mediocre writing","review":"The themes in this book are important for all people to read about (weither you are gay or straight), but the writing in this book is mediocre at best. The story is a compelling one, about two girls who fall in love at highschool, and have to help eachother through the homophobic world they live in. The writing however is not very compelling. It seems rushed, and the main charicters are very two dimentional in all areas except their sexuality. The book seemed to be overly moralistic, and to be trying too hard to get a message across, which distracted from the story-telling aspect of the book. There are many other books available that deal with the same themes in a much more thorough and enjoyable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"I bought this CD mostly on the strength of Radney Foster, who helped discover and produce Georgia. As a huge Radney Foster fan, this sort of endorsement was all I really needed, so I went ahead and just ordered the album. I should have known better. Although she may be very talented, most of her success has been from the song-writing end of the spectrum. In fact, the lyrics on this album are outstanding. But I can't help but think that on the good songs she's written in the past, that she's had competent co-authors to cover the instrumentation. Because on this effort, the music itself is uninspired, and limp at best. It takes more than clever words to craft a good song. I walked away feeling that Georgia, for all her talent, should have worked with some more writers for the content on this album, or stick with songwriting in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Nice Shock Images--But No Direction","review":"Bentley Little is no masterful literary writer. I think that's clear. But, after reading \\"University,\\" \\"The Ignored,\\" and \\"The Walking,\\" I see that he has some good stories and some frightening, if somewhat unoriginal, images. The problem with \\"University,\\" however, is that Little throws out all these interesting plots, but he fails to bring them together in the end. \\"University's\\" first half is nice and suspenseful, I'll give it that, but by the weak climax, the story blows up with the campus. This novel steals too much from \\"The Shining.\\" So do yourself a favor and stick with Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the typical Bentley Little","review":"I had read the mixed reviews before purchasing and reading this book, but I felt that if it was Bentley Little, it had to be good. Now I know that many of the reviewers were right and I was wrong. This book is nothing but a terrible conglomeration of gore and sex. The plot is weak, many things are confusing or unclear, and it appears that Mr. Little attempted to make up for the lack of significant plot by filling the book with very explicit sex and unnecessary gore. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Usually I can't put a Bentley Little book down. This time I had to force myself to finish it. Save your money by not buying this book; buy another one of his books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a bad thing","review":"The fault with this book is that it blows any sort of fear and interest out of the reader's mind before the storyline has even had time to set itself up. Instead of carefully leading us along, hinting at terrors and secrets to come, UNIVERSITY sucker punches you at the start, and simply continues to bludgeon you over the head with an over-done orgy of blood, sex, and evil. The theme of \\"all-powerful evil\\" in horror and suspense novels has been written right into the ground...and this book just doesn't have anything else to offer. By the way...the next time a horror author thinks he's going to surprise ANYONE with a cliched ending where the evil presence (or whatever)somehow survives, leaving us feeling like a tremendous waste of time just occurred--do us a favor, and unplug your word processor before you ruin what might be a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little...","review":"What can I say, it's Little.

I like how each chapter switched with each character. Then you get to see how UC Brea affects the student body in different ways. Anyway, I got this whole thing planned out. This could be a movie and I got this great soundtrack for it. Maybe I am not as sophisticated as the other reviewers on this page, but I think this book is definitely worth reading. It sure beat listening to teachers in class"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, badly handled...","review":"The King quote and the favorable reviews had me anxious to read this, but the story just doesn't pan out. The evil starts to manifest itself with aberrant sexual behavior and torture, and then...just does the same thing over and over again. It's a one trick pony. And the characters, oy! Gifford Stevens, the professor of comparative literature and high explosives (!), is nothing but a cypher, a plot device, and the others don't fare much better. Key plot points happen off-screen, mainly because Little either couldn't explain them logically or didn't want to take the time. And the little epilogue at the end, and the heroes' reaction to it, was especially annoying. In all, not quite as bad as THE MAILMAN, but that's not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second and last Bentley Little book I'll ever buy","review":"I bought this book and The Store (also by Bentley Little) at the same time. Based on the reviews I saw here, I had high expectations. After reading The Store, I posted the first negative review that I have ever done on a book (although I have yet to see it posted here). Unfortunately, the excessive violence, sexual perversity and lack of ANY meaningful content were not isolated to Little's book, the Store. If these two books are any indication, it must be a plot devise of the author.So, I am posting my second (and hopefully last) bad review in the hope that it will lower this book's overall rating and give someone pause before wasting their time and money on this drivel. I would say this is junk food for the brain, but that's an insult to junk food. The WORST book by Stephen King or Dan Simmons would be a far better purchase. To sum it up, it may not be the worst book I have read so far, but it's definitely at the bottom of the stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bentley Little is unlike any author I've ever read.","review":"He has an amazing talent.

It shall stay just as it is, as if the photographer walked in unexpectedly) is interesting, and because the models are the ones who dictate what they are going to do, and not Mr. Morgan, there is a spontaneity about them which is great and some (but very few) are intensely erotic because of their honesty.However, how find to rhyme or reason for selecting a large group of them out of focus, to show movement? Its looks more like the photos taken by a friend from school who does not have a clue about how to graduate the speed of light in the camera.

Simple to make basic cut and paste edits. Filtering lacks the sophistication of more expensive products making its less than adequate if you are converting scratched vinyl records or older tape cassettes to CD. I used this product in conjunction with Diamond Cut Millennium (a much more robust product designed for vinyl restoration) for seven months. The program documentation states that changes to your operating system may cause the program to inactivate your registration and stop working. In my experience, this happened and the re-activation process built into the program did not work. If this happens, you will find there is no support for this product. Repeated e-mail efforts over a three week period produced no results. I was forced to replace the product with Goldwave which seems to have a few more restoration type features but and is slightly more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this program and expected to have a complete program, I subsequently found that the program lacked key elements to function correctly, I needed to purchase an mp3 encoder update to use the save operation for my music track costing and additional $14.99, I subsequently attempted to purchase the en-coder upgrade online, Magix.com took my credit card information and thanked me.

The rest was just a big disappointment,Silly and awful acting,Very long and boring periods between the action. Terrible script.

Most of the scenes seem like they were cut off midway in between the conversation. Plus several scenes seem forced as if the character had no purpose to actually be there talking. There were a few scenes that just did not need to exist. The acting was terrible but I believe that was in part due to poor directing. I just think the director was in over their head not knowing how to get the right amount of emotion from his actors to create the right feeling or mood from the scenes. A very interesting film but all together just awful.

Giving the benefit of the doubt, and thinking the leak was a QA issue rather than a design issue, I managed to exchange it for the exact same model.Well it's been 4 months since I got the new one, and this morning what did I notice? Yup, a leak. The tank was full yesterday and this morning it's 2/3's full, with a pool of water on the table that holds it. Luckily, no damage was done to the floor either time.I understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then, but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time, well then, it's just a cruddy product.Stay away from this aquarium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Sound...Same Creativity.","review":"I have been following Cursive and most of Tim Casher's side projects for a while now. I'm very impressed with his willingness to risk his band's reputation with a great disparity in sounds from album to album. While mostly garnering praise from loyal fans, there are a few (along with some newbies) that cry foul by citing works of previous bands. I don't deny the possibility of influence, but I think there is definitely an additional creativity and passion put into the music that at the very least is admirable, if not evolutionary.This album is a giant leap into a different direction as far as sound. Whether it's forward, backwards, to the right or left...you can be the judge. In my oppinion, it's just as great as any of their other albums and if I had to describe it...I would say it's a blend of older Cursive, Good Life(his other band), Rocket from the Crypt and a splash of just plain \\"newness\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment after many great albums","review":"Cursive is one of my favorite bands and I was looking forward to Happy Hollow. It's a dissappointment. The album abandons the kind of pop core that Cursive specializes in, perhaps to pursue a more sophisticated and complex sound; the result feels more sophomoric, and the album is more plodding and less melodic than any of their others. Another oddity is Tim Kasher's voice, which sounds smoother and cleaner than in the past. Perhaps he's been taking singing lessons in an effort to preserve it. The sound is odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Ugly Organ","review":"Ugly organ by Cursive has to be one of my favorite albums ever. Each track is not only well excecuted, by each of the tracks fit a sort of 'mood', which they retain from the the first to the last track.Happy hallow is still an amazing album, but i feel that one or two of the songs (Mostly \\"Bad Science\\") just take away from that \\"mood\\" kasher tries to convey in Happy Hallow. Many of the songs are still very good (At conception, Hymns for the heathen, Retreat!, Dorothy at Forty) but then you have those one or two songs that just kill the perfection of this album.Pick up Ugly Organ if you dont have it before trying Happy Hollow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've lost interest in this band altogether","review":"Oh my gosh, this record sucks! I can honestly say that I didn't even really care for \\"Ugly Organ\\". It had a few okay songs, but for the most part, it would have worked better as an EP. This, on the other hand, should not have even been written or released. It's the most boring and cliche record this year (second only to the new Flaming Lips). I kept hearing that this was a \\"return\\" to older stuff, since thier cello player left. Not the case at all. It's seriously time to go back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSHIP SONGS FOR ATHIEST","review":"Engaging and enchanting music. Confussed and completely wrong-headed lyrics...

I regret I ever bought this.Again, don't buy LUVs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"work fine but strongtly scented","review":"If you're used to the less-scented products like Pampers aloe or sensitive wipes, these might be too strong for you. My baby doesn't get diaper rash as easily with the Sensitive wipes but these caused rash more easily, so I will be switching back (for my 4 month old). For my 2 1/2 year old, these work fine, but I think they are too strongly scented- especially if I want to wipe his face. I think they are comparable in thickness and size to Pampers wipes. If you aren't picky these should be fine for your needs. Not thick like Huggies, and not as wet as pampers wipes as other reviewers have mentioned- they are sort of in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for baby wipes...","review":"I have to say that I was very disappointed with these wipes. I went with this cheaper brand, figuring there wasn't much anyone could do to mess up the manufacturing of baby wipes--boy was I wrong. While they have a pleasant baby powder scent and a soft texture, there's little more they offer. They don't clean well at all. I have to use at least 5 or so wipes to clean my baby's bottom after a bowel movement. As I mentioned, they are soft, but they're almost too soft. I would liken them to a wet toilet tissue consistency. They tear apart very easily; therefore, they are very inefficient at cleaning. I gave them two stars because they do smell great, and of course, they're cheap. But do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on the good stuff. You'll use fewer wipes, and will probably spend less in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy wipes","review":"I just tried these wipes bc of the good price, but not worth it.

The huggies brand wipes are much more cloth like. With these you end up using more than you would with a thicker wipe. Too bad amazon doesn't sell the cloth like wipes as refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I read some negative reviews on these wipes, but decided to try them anyway. They aren't as thick as Huggies or Pampers wipes, however, when I reach for the wipes, I typically grab a couple at a time, no matter the thickness. I guess I have a phobia of getting anything gross on my hands. So, I figure if I am going to use two wipes at a time rather than one anyway, these being slightly thinner is okay and more economical. One or more reviewers said these weren't very wet; it is very easy to add a bit of water to the container of wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this.","review":"Having studied flute, I was excited to hear the new repertoire being hailed as an \\"instant classic\\" . . .after all doesn't the CD cover say \\"these compositions have become staples of the modern flute literature?\\" Well, give me a staple remover. How something becomes a staple within a year or two is beside the point. The music is repetitive, the harmonic language cloying, the orchestral colors almost non-existent. (I know you have to write lightly to showcase these solo instruments, but enough celesta already!) You hear a heavy John Williams influence throughout . . .unfortunately the influence does not take seed to produce an individual vocabulary.

Listeners who prefer their contemporary music to sound like nails scratching on blackboards should stay away; this music is melodic, memorable and thrilling. Liebermann fits so much variety, beauty and lyricism in these works that I found myself listening to this release over and over again.Galway's performances are spectactacular: any flautist will recognize the superhuman level of the playing. The big surprise is the piccolo Concerto: no-one has ever made a piccolo sound so fluent, full bodied and IN TUNE.This recording is a must for anyone interested in wind music or the music of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have","review":"I am a piccolo player and the Liebermann piccolo concerto was the first major work that I tackled on this tiny instrument. I have never gotten so many compliments on playing one piece of music as I did with this concerto. The lyricism in the first movement gives way to a furious middle developmental section then returns to the calm or the first themes. Some of the reviewers seemed disappointed that is contains \\"movie music\\" influences. Well not gonna lie- it does and I like it for that- as does the audience. I performed this 30 minute long work on my senior recital and afterward my friends were in disbelief that it lasted that long because they enjoyed it so much that time lew as they were listening.Kudos to Sir Galway for a wonderful recording. Anyone how is studying any of the works on this album should make it part of their library. The orchestra is conducted by liebermann, and unlike other Galways recording the tempos are not at light speed and true to what Liebermann envisioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God, why?","review":"If this is the finest of American flute music, as one reviewer insists, then the flute is in some major trouble. Seriously. If you enjoy listening to this garbage, then you should do so secretly - as a guilty pleasure. I mean, come on...this music is the Florence Foster Jenkins of the flute world. (Not to say that I don't have a huge affinity for FFJ! Check out my review on her CD.)The recording quality is okay, ensemble is ok at best, soloist is tired and a bit sloppy for my taste. Nice tone, but that's about it. No color. No shape.The writing is juvenile. I think I know something like four people who wrote like this in high school. They all adored the 'Moonlight' Sonata and listen to N*Sync. There - now you have my two cents.

On their home turf, The Living End are incredibly popular. They are relative new-comers to the American scene, though, so they rarely get the headlining acts which they get in Aussie. But, don't worry, they will. Chris Cheney's voice is NOTHING like Johnny Rotten's. Chris has an amazing voice which is actually much more similar to Brian Setzer's. While the band might sound something like Sublime to the untrained ear, TLE is more than just a three chord ska band. They are a Rockabilly band (though they really transverse all musical discriptions with their excellent follow up, \\"Roll On\\").

I have never listened to the original Prime Mover album, but if it was half the quality of this disk, it was great material.In his earlier AD material, Livgren's exuberance over his rebirth sometimes overpowered his work. Gone was much of the subtlety that characterized his best Kansas material. By the time Prime Mover was created, he gained that subtlety back and he's put together some really good material here.Stand outs include Children of the Shadows, and Wandering Spirit. The remake of Fair Exchange, Kansas tune, is first rate, as are the new songs, Incantos and Out of Opus.New Kind of Love, a new kind of song for Livgren is the only tune that rubs me wrong.

The sound and singing are excellent and the tempos seem to me ideal, neither as brisk as period performance versions nor as broad as most earlier recordings or even later ones like those of Bernstein or Giulini himself in his 1991 rerecording of the work. The performance is, by turns, powerfully passionate and intensely devotional. It is a performance where everything comes together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...orginal?..no...[bad]...YES","review":"Okay I'll admit it... I used to be a Nu Metal fan back in the day...and I actually used to like this CD. (I have no idea what I saw in it). But I started getting into guitar and things and I noticed how talentless much of these Nu Metal and mainstream bands really were. Flybanger is just another example of that. Nothing is new here, just the same old band trying to make a spot for themselves on MTV or radio. If you are going to listen to Nu Metal i would suggest Nothingface, as they are one of the few good ones, whom I like. (Tool is another one). But I would also suggest bands such as Opeth, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Slayer, In Flames, Dream Theater, Soilwork, Meshuggah, God Forbid, etc. But that is just my opinion... I hope you choose to buy one of those band's CDs, instead of [this CD].

It frightens me to think people will buy this and assume this is what SM about! While some new and 'wannabe' Male Dominants will probably get off on Sir John's writings, I found most of this book highly disturbing. In fact, I was so disgusted with it, I didn't even bother reading the last two chapters.If you want to really learn about SM, buy a book like Screw the Roses or SM 101 or the Loving Dominant, but stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is dangerous","review":"I was briefly involved with \\"Sir John Q\\" many years ago, until he crossed the boundaries of safety and frightened me away from him and the \\"scene\\" forever.He did not respect \\"safe\\" words in the end, and is more emotionally damaged than many of the women he describes in the book. I also believe that some of the book is sheer fantasy.That said, much of my experience with Q was exhilirating and exciting and the first chapter especially was an intelligently written and eye-opening look into the BDSM scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book that is a series of \\"essays\\" about one Male Dominant's SM experiences reads more like adolescent fantasies than an actual SM book. Frankly, several chapters were very disturbing to me and seemed to border on nonconsensual activity. To each their own, but it frightens me to think that some might actually beleive this is what \\"real SM\\" is all about.The author delights in doing very heavy SM scenes with emotionally damaged women and bragging about it. The only reason I rated this book one star is because there weren't any lower ratings.This book might be good for occasional \\"one-handed\\" reading, but it's definitely not instructional material."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dominant's ego trip","review":"Unfortunately I was not as impressed with 'Sir John' as he obviously is with himself.He may or may not be describing real events, but it seems he has a talent for finding unstable and damaged women and treating them unsafely with little real emotional connection to most of them.He may seem like the Dom of some people's dreams, but the reality is this collection of tales lacks depth and while he expects the reader to be impressed, he falls short of what most responsible Dominants are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid.

Are we supposed to admire him for doing things like hanging a woman off the ground by her hair?I've met some \\"dominant\\" men who say that they admire this book and so far they've all been creeps. It seems like the kind of book that certain men who hate women want to be true, but I think that that is wishful thinking.If you want an actually clueful source of information about male dominant female submissive BDSM, try \\"Screw the Roses: Send Me The Thorns.\\" If you want to learn something about Female Dominant BDSM try \\"The Sexually Dominant Woman\\".

How in the world can you write an entire book on SM and not mention a safe word even once? My advice for femsubs is very simple. The more a potential maledom partner tells you that he admires this book, the faster you should run away from him.There are a whole bunch of knowledgeable, ethical, clueful writers on SM out there including Pat Califa, Dossie Easton, John Warren, Catherine Lizst, Guy Baldwin, Joseph Bean, Lady Green, Philip Miller and Molly Devon, Jay Wiseman, Christina Abernathy and Race Bannon. While I have my favorites among them all are much better than the self-proclaimed \\"Sir\\" John."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scary Guy","review":"I wish this book were a work of fiction, rather than a collection of real events. Sir John came across as a dominant who hadn't done his homework. He seems to take advantage of women who are not in this best of mental health, and worse, he practices very unsafe BDSM. I was stunned at his leaving submissives alone for too long while in bondage, at his non-use of \\"safe words,\\" let alone practicing safe sex, and for not really knowing what he was doing when using a variety of instruments.That said, if you like a sadistic dominant, you will probably like this book. If it had been just a sexy S/M novel, I would have enjoyed it more...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for anyone desiring to learn more about S/M","review":"The Q letters is quite possibly the worst written and most unrealistic presentation of S/M in a non-fiction form I have ever encountered. From the first lovingly written vignette describing his first rape to the seemingly endless parade of emotionally unstable self destructive women that grovel at his feet, the Q letters reads more like a disturbed adolescents wet dreams than a serious presentation of the S/M lifestyle. Despite seemingly accidental intermittent accuracy regarding scene practices (sandwiched between raging misogyny and the obligatory orgasm count after every one sided encounter) the Q letters is far more damaging to the understanding of this form of sexuality than it is educational, despite its common use in academic treatments . And perhaps its worse offense, it is a boring read, no mean feat regarding the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendly fire","review":"had been looking for this book for some time, remember seeing the movie years ago. good price and quick delivery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average bars overall","review":"Out of the three persons from my friends and family who have tasted the bars nobody liked the product. They all were asking me: \\"Where did you get this stuff from? It is awful.\\" The bars are really average or even below average as far as the taste is concerned. The energy value apart, the only positive thing about the bars is that they are not very sweet. But my understanding is the the food (bars including) is supposed to be at least a bit tasty but not only a 'filler' for your stomach. Definitely I will never buy these bars again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well done novel for children and adults","review":"This story is a beautiful work of fiction. In the true Scandinavian writing style this story is one which is not limited in the age of the reader. Also following in the Scandinavian style the settings are nondescript, so as to be able to happen anywhere in the world.The story is both well-written and well translated. A wonderful story where a child learns to become both more self-sufficient and to rely on others.

It is a wonderful read and one which is appropriate for children of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some wonderful stories, some not so great","review":"As with all short story collections, this is a mix of some extremely good and some rather tepid stories.

This engaging compilation published matrimony tales were carefully chosen by Rea Wilmshurst. The readers will surely enjoy this work since wedding bells will be ringing from one story to another. A mix of romance and funny, sharp witted characters make this book simply loveable. Even the mischivieous twins, Johnny and Sue, in 'The Twins and a Wedding' both were cute and adorable and helped a young woman and her gentleman to set aside their arguments and get married. The stories were written in many styles and I simply adore stories from children's point of view as demonstrated brilliantly by the author in 'The Twins and a Wedding' and 'When Jack and Jill Took a Hand'. A must keep for those who believe in weddings and ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good short stories","review":"Warning! Do not read this book if you are depressed about your relationship. It is filled with lovely, touching stories about true love. This is most assuredly a book for hopeless romantics, not cynics.

It's very rare that a band's first album is their best. You're usually younger, less experienced, and haven't mastered your instrument yet. These guys are great in regards to their instruments on this debut record, but I think they hadn't mastered their songwriting skills yet. The vocals are okay, but Trevor really steps it up on the next record. I think \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" is where Unearth really found their niche. They wrote great songs, shaped their sound into something powerful and forceful, and displayed incredible musicianship. \\"The Stings of Conscience\\" is great jumping-off point, but don't expect to be wowed right away. There are really only a few songs that I think can come ALMOST close to the quality of the stuff they've done since.

It isn't until Toby and his mom move to Idaho and Toby discovers, via the Internet, who his mother really is. I have to admit, when I found it, it was sort of anti-climactic. I also felt that the book ended rather strangely, with the author trying to wrap up all the loose ends and loose realism that way. If you're looking for a book about a family on the run, leave this book in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unahlig Haefyr","review":"Varg's metal albums excel not through technical complexity, but rather through the arrangement and combination of atmospheres and haeenfyr. On this release, actual \\"songs\\"--musical arrangements with refrains, full arangements, and lyrics--are not in the majorty; the ambient/noise/instrumental pieces are very dark and obscure, while the heavy metal tracks possess a distinct floating/drone quality. Individuals seeking wild guitar solos and fancy drum limes are advised to search elsewhere (Yngwie Malsteem, Morbid Angel, etc.). Each track is an essential piece of the whole; I strongly suggest that this album be listened in its entirety without interruption. Unlike many other albums, it is not composed of several songs that can be appreciated independently and placed on mix cds to be listened to while driving to the local gas station to buy cheap beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"As it once was...","review":"This is my favorite Burzum album, it also was the first one I bought which may have led to that. After hearing about Varg's church burnings and his general hatred against churches as most of them are build on the sites of former pagan holy places, I decided this was a band I had to like.The music surprised me, Varg's tortured screams combined with strange harmonics and dissonants give this whole album a haunted sound. This would be the ideal soundtrack to a horror movie if it was to be unnerving, haunting and slightly paranoid.If you like the dark rawness of this album, you may also like Troll's drep de kristne (murder the christian). Although less raw Troll manages to create the same atmosphere of depression and darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Memorable.","review":"I'm a fan of Burzum, but this album is the one that just does not grasp me.

The two discs that I own are the RCA 1994 compilation \\"THE BEST OF\\" and the Varese Sarabande 2004 compilation \\"THE VERY BEST OF 1964-1967\\". I must say I am quite fond of this folk group.As this CD includes the ablum \\"It's a happening world\\" and 11 bonus tracks, it's a very generous offering. But to listen to the whole CD from the beginning to the end is a rather excruciating and schizophrenic experience. One minute it's folk, next minute it's sunshine/Baroque pop or surf rock. Similarly, the vocal harmony often switches from four-part folk-rock to multi-layer Beach Boy and/or the late Beatles without any warning. Track 17 \\"Animal\\" is a great example of what goes wrong: the group is trying so very hard to sound \\"hip\\", it ends up sounding like a caricature of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walls of Jericho - A Day and a Thousand Years","review":"In the tradition of super-fast, abrasive hardcore, Walls of Jericho is at the top. Packed with high-energy beats, and those always pleasing abrupt starts and stops, it's the perfect album with which to feed, or purge some agression. The best part, though, is the vocals. Candace (the lead singer) has a voice and style unheard of among female performers of today, and if you ever get a chance to see them live, you'll be even more convinced of this. Save for the fact that they have a female singer, though, Walls of Jericho doesn't do a lot that's \\"progressive\\" or \\"origional\\" like you see with bands like Botch or Refused. Overall, though, this album is a necessary part of anyone's hardcore library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-fest...avoid Mystique DVDs - pale knock-off of Peach and Hot Body","review":"I've seen a couple of Mystique titles and concluded that I've seen enough. They are generally very mild and feature babes that, while cute, are too \\"everyday\\" for me.This dual title DVD features cute girls getting \\"nude\\". The problem is that's all they do - nude up and stand there (photo shoot style). Instead of other DVDs where the babes get sexy with bump and grind stripper action, this one features the girls just posing for photos - snooze. This gets real old real quick and you'll break your thumb of the FF button. To make it worse, there's NO PINK AT ALL.Yes, they're are some exotic locations and its well-shot, but goes nowhere. It's made even worse by boring behind-the-scenes, meet-the-girls type fluff - i.e. TALKING. I don't care, just show me some *ss!Get a (probably cheaper) Peach title instead.

However, after using it only a few times it began to fail; it would speed up and slow down and was completely useless. I figured out that the belt inside had stretched out.

The big issue that I have is that it must be thoroughly washed off afterwards. I have sensitivity to so many things and even at first I had no problem, but it developed and can cause an itching and burning until compltetly rinsed off - sometimes that can be a hassle. Just a warning. Even if it is water based, there can be other chemicals or ingredients that a person can develop a sensitivity to.Contains glycerin which is frequently a cause for irritation, makes it taste better but not worth the ensuing problems.Contains parabens which are known cancer causing agents.Go natural with ingredients, carefully and informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY MISLEADING","review":"There is a problem here.

It's something you don't always chat about freely, but is incredibly important- you don't want to have to over-think it as a couple, you just want it to do its job so you can focus on enjoying your relationship. Having tried a variety of these products, I have to say with full certainty that this is the best of these. I have not had a product that is so easy to clean off, comfortable, irritation-free, and effective. I would definitely pay more for this brand- it also lasts a long time, and you do not have to use a great deal of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe its just me","review":"I am biased to the natural thing. I have been subject to this out of necessity and have decided that excessive natural lubrication (saliva) is a better method than any. My GF and I used both silicon and Astro before deciding that nice breaks in between was a better solution than either. If I had to chose I would say go with Silicon and wash well after, but if you can avoid them then avoid them both. The dry feeling that is felt after is unbearable. If you go long periods of time and you absolutely need lubricant, go silicon.

I would rate the Astroglide product as one of my favorites and one I keep coming back to. My wife is over 50 now and while she still enjoys sex, but we do sometimes have a lubrication issue. The problem with the other lubes is they tend to dry out and become very thick especially on the outside where exposed to air, sometimes within 5 minutes of use. The worse I have tried is the Kroger Brand KY, felt like we had velcro between us.Astroglide is very runny and water like which is one of the reasons we actually like it. It tends to stay runny and resists thickening when exposed to air.

That's 110 minutes that was cut which is a big rip-off.

The solid blacks are newer, and the black rubs off on the bottoms of my feet. My other pair, though they have black bottoms, don't do that.

After wearing them for an hour I could feel the bottom sole design on my heels when I walked. Now I feel the design on the soles everytime I wear them. And the lack of heel cushion makes for almost no shock absorbtion when walking. If you're only going to be walking on sand, these will be fine.

This book sums it up. Childish is the best way to describe the writing. On the one hand, it's very \\"Dick and Jane\\" in many respects. On the other hand, the adult characters were written as if they were 8-12 years old in adult bodies. Naive is one thing, but many of the characters seemed as if they were arrested in childhood. The dialog is clunky and yet too simplistic. No emotional depth.

In my opinion, the orchestration and the way it is incorporated into Hybrid's music to this day still stands out as beautifully as it did the first time I listened through it. Not only is every song fresh and filled with energy, but gorgeous and intelligent all at the same time. The only way I can describe this album is that it gives off almost a silky, futuristic vibe. Often times fast electronic music (in any sub-genre) feels stupid, and is only fit for clubs, if even that. But this music rises far above that and still manages to sound brilliant. To add to how wonderful this CD is, the bonus disk is not just a \\"Bonus disk\\"-- it is basically a standalone album itself, being 74 minutes long. The first 6 tracks are all live, and all great. Thankfully the crowd does not interfere with the sound or feel of the performance, I rather like to think that it adds to it.

I have never been happier with a CD purchase!Hybrid is a truly innovative group with some magnificant tracks. Unlike other electronica artists, the songs they produced have distinct melody, as well as remaining true to the techno-genre. The trackfs featuring Chrissie Hynde (including \\"If I Survive\\") are all wonderful! Again, unlike other artists in this field, each track is very distinct and has a lasting effect.This was the CD that turned me onto the electronica, and since then, I have bought dozens of CDs throughout all the sub-fields (trance, house, etc...), but \\"Wide Angle\\" is still the best of them all.

It was she that initially drew me to purchase Hybrid in the first place. Remember Julee from her two solo albums, \\"Floating Into The Night\\" and \\"The Voice of Love\\"?

The ability of hybrid to fuse housey-breakbeats with orchestral influences is amazing, and this is one of those CD's that has stayed in my CD player fairly frequently over the last few years...Buy Wider Angle because of the equally good 2nd disc...Purely magical stuff, don't waste your time reading my review, go out and buy this cd!!!!Top songs: Snyper, Finished Symphony, High Life, If I survive, Kill City (2nd disc), Kid 2000 (12\\" Version on the 2nd disc)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of orchestral and electronic","review":"This was my first Hybrid CD and has become one of my favorites in short order. The blend of traditional orchestra arrangements with electronic textures and great beats is a powerful mix! It's probably not the correct term to use, but I like to call this \\"intelligent electronic\\" because it goes so far beyond the usual four-on-the-floor 808/909 kick drums with frenetic D&B snare. Instead, the beats are creative and, when the music calls for it, aggressive. Similar artists, in my opinion would be BT and Shpongle -- at least in terms of taking a strong sense of musicianship and arrangement into the world of electronic music and not relying on the equipment to do all the work. Very creative stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Every once in a while, you come across an artist or a song that you just cant stop listening to.

Ive been listening to almost every genre of electronic music over the past 10 years and This album sits at the top of the list of my favorites.

He gives you an understanding of his characters like no one else I've ever read. All of his characters are flawed but he makes them compelling. If you want predictable happy endings don't read Pete Dexter but if you want a book that you can't put down and a completely believable story, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter at His Best","review":"This novel is a gripping page-turner about the psychological demise of a twisted man in a small southern town.Paris Trout, the paranoid Shylock to the black population, kills a young black girl during a fit of rage over a perceived welch. He is convicted of murder but remain free because of bribery and legal appeals. The effects of his actions on his attorney, his wife and his wife's attorney, along with their interaction, make for a compelling story. It is dark and mysterious and, as Paris's madness becomes more evident, so too does the true nature of those around him.Particularly interesting are the characterizations of his wife, Hannah, and his lawyer, Seagraves. This is a novel that will take you for a riveting, dark ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising disappointment.","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer from Yuba City. After finishing this novel I was also surprised that it had won the National Book Award. Although I agree with other reviewers that the depiction of complacency by the Cotton Point citizens with respect to Paris Trout's deeds was well done by the author, I did not find the character development, the writing or the plot to be above average. The National Book Award and glowing reviews this novel received set my expectations higher than the novel could meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"due to problems of tone and syntax, not to mention good taste...\\"","review":"I have to say, I had high hopes for this novel. But it is so tortuously over-written, it is hard to keep a straight face. There are all kinds of little leaps of logic and lapses of grammar not related to the speech or private thoughts of Southern characters in the story (to which one can give wide latitude). The first decent scene is the viewing of the body of young, innocent Rosie in the hospital--a hospital that seems about ten times larger than such a \\"small town\\" would possess. Just not edited at all, it seems. Very poorly written. So poorly, it gets in the way of what could be a decent, if standard, story of crime and racism in the American South circa late 1950s."},{"rating":"1","title":"College sophomore work","review":"The author's kills off the only interesting and likable character early in the book.

Texe Marr's obviously hates life and this world and chooses to cope with his anger by publishing books venting his anger.He savors every moment describing how the world is going to end and everyone he hates is going to meet a horrible death.

I didn't not expect any dramatic revelations and was just enjoying one of the rare opportunities to see a major production documentary that was devoted to chess and the best player.From the practical side, I know that cheating with using computers is the main reason that Internet Chess is not a multi-billion dollar business. As a player, I believe that the majority of the players on the net are honest. However, I doubt you can ever get rid of this notion \\"what if\\", once it gets in your head! Even at the regular tournaments, players are now searched, watched and ... the number of complains is on the rise anyway.You can make your own conclusions after watching this movie. I wasn't looking for an answer, I just wanted to enjoy the very well done movie and seen familiar faces (chessplayers) and hearing their comments.I think every chess player or a fan of the game will enjoy watching this movie at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Over!","review":"I bought this movie to share with my 3rd-5th grade Gifted Students who are learning chess this semester.

The story is a great story to hear, but the video does not do a good job telling the story. The games are not covered in enough detail, one by one building anticipation. The producers use a whispering narration which is difficult to hear at best, and continually annoying. This could have and probably should have been a great DVD but it isn't, and it comes down to production: camera shots, music, uncomfortable face close ups, and a lack of game commentary and coverage. It is still interesting as the story itself is a turning point in history, but it could have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you screw up a documentary on such a great subject?","review":"The producer of this movie took a great subject and created a documentary with a horrible sound track and constant anoying \\"scary movie\\" type effects. This movie would be a great study for people wanting to learn how not to make films. It's almost like it was produced by someone who just got movie editing software for the first time and was going overboard trying to see what they could do. The most enjoyable clips in the movie were scenes taken from new casts and 3rd party sources. Someone could make this move 100% better by just editing out the sound effects and music. A little Bach or Mozart could be inserted over the existing sound track to make the film more watchable. The story of the match can stand on its own and doesn't need cheap tricks to manipulate the audience into seeing the chess match from Kasparov's point of view (a nightmare)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Chess Players","review":"A driveling film that should've had 2/3rds of it edited out.The usual moronic style: Shaky cameras, five second soundbites from a whirlwind of talking heads, \\"spooky\\" music, anti-corporatist agitprop, conspiracy theorizing...Hey, here's a conspiracy theory: Some fool we're supposed to take seriously states that IBM made \\"billions\\" out of the match. Maybe they gave the neurotic Kasparov a few million to lose?Hey, players: read Pandolfini's book on the match. I'm not a great fan of Mr. P, but it's a move-by-move Chernev-style annotation of the six games. Quite interesting and taught me, at least, a bit more about the game.Anyway, K lost the match, and serve him right. Deep Blue didn't win it.Karpov would've crushed DB: Play the board, not the man/machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing...","review":"To start off, I am a chess fan and player. I have been putting off renting this video for a few months and finally broke down and rented it. I thought it was going to be boring and poorly done. I was surprised that it went beyond my expectations.The film documents the recollections of Kasparov's journey during and after his encounter with Deep Blue. If you know about this match, then this movie would probably be worth your time just because it provides a lot of insight into what went on behind the scenes. The director does a great job of creating a workable theme throughout the film. The director uses the Turk, again if you don't know what this first \\"computer\\" program was, you just might not get the point of the theme.Anyways, I enjoyed the emotion, the clever theme, and even the odd background whispering every so often. I have a strong feeling that people with no chess interest would give this film a 1 or 2, but I give it a 4 b/c I love chess and it is a solid documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game Over - Kasparov and the Machine - DVD","review":"Very interesting DVD for any semi-serious chess player: a viewer could understand better psychological aspects of the game and financial sides of a big tournament. I like the story, and it was real fun to hear Kasparov's commentaries. There were some irritating moments though: 1. too much \\"whispering behind the scene\\" by a narrator; 2. too much fragments of old-style b/w movie about chess-machine; 3. the famous DEEP BLUE has been shown just in a locked box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not read another book by Nicci French","review":"Boring, Boring, Boring...It was hard to get past the roughsex.

I spotted a number of inconsistencies, such as Alice pouring glasses into a sink then saying \\"I stood up.\\" Perhaps she pours into the sink while seated, who knows?

Instead, it's a story of very modern peoples, and only passing references to the artifact of the title. There is one section, late in the novel, giving a better idea of the nature of these scrolls, but just as a tiny glimmer was shown, it is ripped away revealing nothing of interest.This novel has a decent story on its own, and if you want political intregue with the Zhents, this has some value.

Instead, we find a discussion--a bit too rambling, at that--dedicated to assertions and observations I have found better said in others' work. In fact, I feel it necessary to note that a great deal of the discussion owes much to Thomas Moore, whose _Care of the Soul_ more clearly argues in favor of the God as love concept, something never directly addressed in Ms. Gilliam's book.The latter is but an example of some of what's in store for readers of _How AA Failed Me_. The problem, to me, does not necessarily lie, however, with the author. I contend that the editors have culpability.

I've since started going to meetings that focus on working the 12 steps exactly the way the book Alcoholics Anonymous outlines, not through Hazleton, the 12&12, some rehab's idea other the multitude of other misguided approachs that leave WAY too much room for interpretation. I actually did what the book Alcoholics Anonymous says and have since recovered. I used to the same way she did; confused, discouraged and resentful. Unfortunately most people are unaware that the directions on how to work the 12 steps are outlined in the \\"big book\\" so they buy supplemental guides etc.. which fail many people. I feel sad that the message of AA is construed and that people like the author become misinformed and fail then air their resentments and add to the problem of misinforming others about the program and AA's fellowship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't give up on aa","review":"I feel this book is very unhelpful to those considering a 12 step program. The \\"limited confines of the herd mentality of aa and other 12 step-programs\\" is completely in your OWN mind.AA is the most freeing of recovery programs; aa DOES NOT limit you to anything except a desire to stop drinking. There are NO rules, ONLY suggestions. Take them or leave them, but if you do decide to follow these suggestions i promise you will not regret it.If you are in a 12 step program and still miserable ask yourself these questions: do you have a sponsor? if you sponsor yourself you have a fool of a sponsor. how long have you given aa? it takes time to heal.I hope that this book does not discourage those seeking recovery to shy away from aa.

You have to find one that fits your personality and comfort level. This book is another attempt by an author to justify her need to drink and justify it with 279 pages of backup. You either want to stop drinking or you don't. If you want to continue drinking \\"moderately\\" don't get involved with AA. Don't cleverly bash AA to justify your thirst and take credit for being someone's salvation. I am currently sponsoring a recovering alcoholic using AA, Hazelden, and other literature, this book being one of them. I tell my sponsees to read with open minds. Pick what works and leave the rest.

While I found Marianne Gilliam's insight into the failures of AA's program to be honest and refreshing, I was disappointed by the \\"spirituality\\" emphasis on the polyannish approach of \\"love is all that is needed\\" to find, and maintain sobriety. I did not expect as much of a \\"self-help book\\" that this turned out to be. I would recommend this book (especially to women!) to anyone looking ABOVE AND BEYOND the \\"AA/12-Step\\" approach to ANY addiction. I agree entirely with Marianne's foundation that AA/the 12-Steps are indeed, a FAILURE at encouraging sobriety, sobriety maintenance, or independence of thought, or action. As for the rest of the book's postulating about \\"love\\", it's what has worked for Marianne, and she invites you to use it if you think it can work for you, otherwise, you are welcome to choose your own path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrary to the title, AA did work for Gilliam","review":"The title of this book, no doubt written by her editor-publisher, implies failure of the 12-step program to bring Gilliam the inner piece she desired.

She is full of extreme tunnel vision, narrow minded and offers little to show for her alleged achievements. It is more a self serving endeavor than a mechanism to offer a view of various options for a broad range of people suffering from alcoholism and substance abuse. Repeatedly she says what did not work for her in Alcoholics Anonymous and never mentions the myriad of successes in AA by folks who are atheists, agnostics, feminist, professional and intellegent thoughtful people. Her use of stats and numbers are dubious at best. It was a worthless endeavor, except as a story of one woman's visceral angry response the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and tons of self endulgence.

Quite a number of pages have entire portions of text cut off, leaving the reader to wonder what they're talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is she or isn't she?","review":"An extremely thought-provoking book. The author has done extensive research into what must have been quite a talked-about case in pre-Civil war New Orleans. The legal back-up is heavy and the quotes from men of the law are jaw-dropping to those of us in the 21st Century.The author does make one misstatement--perhaps because he is Australian. He states that Lincoln freed the slaves. This is not true. The Emancipation Proclation freed not one slave--it was the 13th Amendment, passed after Lincoln's death at the end of the Civil War.Other than that, this story is a well-researched glimpse into history and an America that is hard to recognize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, great tale!","review":"This is a tale to ponder. In \\"The Lost German Slave Girl,\\" author John Bailey captures the heart and spirit of ante-bellum New Orleans. At the center of the tale is a very white-looking slave, Sally Miller, (aka Salome Muller), someone with a unimaginable and unexplainable background.Supported with court testimony from three separate trials beginning in 1845, the last of which made it to the Louisana State Supreme Court, Bailey tells the tale in a way that will keep you reading well past bedtime. Factual information surrounding slave dealing, Creole society, quadroons and octoroons in ante-bellum New Orleans and the complexity and depth of encoded Louisana state laws (i.e., the \\"Black Codes), deal with these issues in amazing ways.Some reviewers have given away facts to the story which I will not do. Read this book to find out for yourself then make your own judgment. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary story","review":"I often think that I've read and heard enough about the history of slavery in the United States. After reading this book, I must admit there is always more to learn. While some may argue that \\"indentured\\" is different, I'd like to see that debated with those in history who lived their lives as an indentured slave. I found this book well researched and written, telling much more than the story of one slave, and exposing the tragedy that all slaves endured . This is a valuable work for anyone who wants to learn more about this history of our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ante-Bellum South and the Legal System","review":"John Bailey's study of Sally Miller, the Lost German Slave Girl, provides readers with more than a case study of a particular legal confrontation. Bailey uses the Sally Miller case to describe legal structures surrounding the slavery system in America's ante-bellum South. The story of Sally Miller is in itself absorbing, and Bailey presents it with the narrative skill of a master story-teller. More than this, his text analyzes different approaches taken in other jurisdictions to questions involved in slavery: how are slaves to be controlled, how to describe variations of slave parentage, how the ante-bellum court system worked to support the \\"peculiar institution,\\" while at the same time recognizing that slaves were a peculiar type of property. Students of history, students of law, students of the US Civil War all would find this book a valuable addition to their reading lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the movie coming out?","review":"Truly, this book would make a great movie of the courtroom drama type. If you enjoyed \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil\\", you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Universe","review":"This is a great read.Baily gives us a story worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster - a story about a young orphan German girl sold into slavery and the legal efforts made by New Orlean's German community to set her free. The story has many exciting twists and turns.As good as the story is is Baily's account of Louisiana's case law concerning slaves and redemptioners (indentured whites). The law is familiar and strange. Familiar because we know the legal procedures; strange because the law we learn about treats people as property.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"passed the class","review":"this helped her pass her classes because it was that good!

The problem is that it is impossible to know what is real.For example, when talking about the euro, they say that by 2003 \\"pesos, francs, and marks had become things of the past.\\" That is, Messrs. Pommeranz and Topik confuse pesos (used in several Latin American countries) with pesetas (the vanished Spanish currency). A superficial mistake, no doubt, but one that any well-informed student would avoid making.

There's quite a bit of information here with 15 chapters and over 230 pages. The game starts out quietly in the Giuoco Piano with 1 e4 e5, 2 Nf3 Nc6, 3 Bc4 Bc5 then BAM!! 4 b4!?. This unprotected pawn thrust attacks Black's bishop begging to be captured in order to open up lines of attack. All the greats have played it since the 19th century. The book also shows variations where Black declines the free pawn. In the right hands The Evans Gambit can be a dangerous weapon.If you plan on taking up this opening, I'd also suggest becoming familiar with The Two Knights Defence (Black plays 3...Nf6 instead of Bc5). White can play 4 Ng5 with a double attack on Black's f7 pawn or employ the Max Lange Attack (4 d4). All 3 variations are fun to play. Who says the Giuoco Piano has to be boring?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous pencils","review":"Length:: 0:50 MinsThese have become my go to pencil when creating ATCs (artist trading cards). I was using basic cheap-o colored pencils and wasn't impressed at all, and so was using mainly markers, i.e. Sharpie, Prismacolor and Uchida. I found a great deal for these and so I decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did. I truely love these. They're soft and blendable, and I can add layers of color for vibrancy. On most of my ATCs, I use a combination of Coloursoft, Sakura micron (for outlining), Sharpie and occasionally Prismacolor now. I also purchasedPrismacolor Premier Colorless Blender Pencil, 2 Pencilsand they work well with these. The key is to blend in a rapid motion, as to heat up the wax so it will blend. If you don't want to purchase the blender, the white colored pencil works as well in blending and lightening colors as well. I really can't brag enough about these and I'll let the video do the talking. Absolutely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft pastel pencils","review":"I love these pencils. Basically, they're soft pastels in a pencil form, if you are familiar with those. I am very impressed with the intensity of the colors and the ease of blending.

The story is very original and filled with symbolism.I definitely recommend reading it. I gave it 4.5 stars, rather than 5 because I am extremely picky about what I consider a 5 star book. The only qualm I had with this book was that the romance seemed a bit shallow. It was based almost entirely on a fate they seemed unable to escape, and instantaneous sexual attraction. The sexual content is a bit mature for teens too.Aside from that, I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I have read this book over and over again.

If you got rid of all the mushiness and actually made it tasteful, the rest of the book would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and misogynist","review":"The problems with this book are myriad. Here's a short list:1. It doesn't really make any sense, mostly because the character development is practically nonexistent. Likewise, the background is just sort of sketched in. It's not that it's confusing, it's just that neither the characters nor the plot really end up driving the action. There's no underlying logic to why anything happens.2. The sexual politics are hugely misogynist (and even worse, sometimes operate under the guise of feminism -- for another example of what I'm talking about, see Sex and the City).3. It's badly written and boring. I forced myself to finish it, but I didn't care what happened, and in a few months, I'm sure I will have completely forgotten I ever read it.For much better books for teens and young adults, check out Pamela Dean, Margaret Mahy, Maureen Johnson, Cynthia Voigt, Libba Bray, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, or even, for a junky yet romantic read, L.J.

There was something really original and unique about the book that i just can't put my finger on- but it worked well.

But it does manage to tie many many plot lines together effectively. And Clare is a great character, believeable and non-cliche like so many characters out there. Thumbs up for Mark!

He asked for his own set of these blocks for his birthday. Even the older kids (8, 9 years old) at his party were intrigued by the fun of building with these unique blocks that hold together; especially the blocks with wheels, and the little animals. Very nice storage container, too! This is the perfect toy for a boy or girl, aged 3 to 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Our local library had a set of bristle blocks that were amazing. I had never seen or heard of them before, but my then 2-3 year old son loved to play with them after story time, so I decided to get some for home. Well, this product was more than disappointing - the pieces just would not stay together at all. I don't know whether it's because they are softer and more flexible or what, but nothing he built would hold together, in fact most of the time it fell apart before he was even finished building... what could be more frustrating than that??? No one at our library could remember the brand/ make of their blocks, but obviously they are not all the same. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay together","review":"Our boys love blocks - all kinds. We were thrilled when they received these from their grandparents but were quickly disappointed in the usability. The blocks won't stay together.

The clasp on one side fell off the first time it was opened. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battat Krinkles","review":"The kids (2 and 4) love these blocks, there is a good assortment of shapes (and enough wheels for 2 cars!), the people are sort of unneccesary, but the kids still enjoy playing with them.

The Witness is a powerful story of a man who lived up to the finest ideals; of another man who tarnished what everyone thought were finest ideals; and of the terrible pressures created when a person refuses to yield to pressure to compromise his ideals in order to allow someone else's life to run smoothly. We sometimes hear of someone with the courage to adhere to ideals despite terrible pressure but seldom hear about the side effects on people around the main actors. Wheeler presents a troubling account of the effects on others, especially the family of the main character.This is a tour de force. When you have read it, look up Wheeler's other works.

It has an unusual consistency, in that it looks and feels like a gel, but has sufficient hydrated silica to have the slightly gritty, polishing effect of most pastes.The taste is excellent: minty and fresh, yet not medicine-like or excessively artificial, while the anticavity and antigingivitis formula are widely praised in consumer publications (and by my dentist, as well.) As a bonus feature, the 7.8 ounce packaging offers an especially good value for Colgate Total on a price per ounce basis (and one of these tubes lasts a very long time.)I am a devoted fan of Colgate Total, which is available in several formats and varieties: there is one perfect for everyone.

We spent over $100 on this a few years back and now we will have to replace it since it won't print a darn thing.

The HP PSC 1315 photo sharing progrm (Snapfish) required RECIPIENTS of photos to log in (even my daughter refused). Yesterday was the end, as the HP PSC 1315's malfunctioning (after one year) caused me to spend hours of my time trying to fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling the software. It would not reinstall successfully, so I uninstalled and am junking the machine. Until recently, the print quality was pretty good, but the quality has been going downhill recently. After not using my Epson Stylus C60 (about 5 years old) for a year (as the 1315 wouldn't allow it), I tried it today and, although it needed new ink cartridges, it worked perfectly.

Needless to say it doesn't work. Now I am not a mechanical genius but I still think that if one installs a printer cartridge incorrectly it shouldn't cause the whole printer to fall apart. I can't afford $100 a year for a printer. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality...even for the price","review":"I purchased this HP all-in-one over a year ago.

This one prints and scans ok for the low price BUT if you're a Mac user, beware. I use OS X, and the printer worked, but when I tried to print from a Classic app (Photoshop 6) I got an error message. When I contacted HP support I was told that they don't support Classic and that I would have to reboot and print from OS 9 if the app wasn't OS X native. A real pain, as I use Photoshop a lot but have no real need for the upgrades. I think this information should be on the box, but it wasn't. Instead the copy says it is OS X compatible.

And, while I adore \\"Night of Delusions\\" and \\"The House in November\\", Keith Laumer's finest novel was \\"A Plague of Demons\\".The action is first-rate, the science fiction concepts are solid and well-thought out...and exciting. And the story continually expands, like an onion being peeled in reverse...much as the Lensman stories of Doc Smith did. Bravais (the hero...and I do mean HERO) seems to be investigating a minor matter at story's beginning.

The \\"Mood Version,\\" as arranged by Mark Ayres, has already been heard in a slightly abridged form, opening and closing the soundtrack CD of \\"The Greatest Show In The Galaxy,\\" and many video fans will recognize Keff McCulloch's light \\"Latin Version\\" as the tune which opened and closed the various \\"[insert Doctor/monster name here] Years\\" videos.

Simply a perfect CD for relaxing, when you want a mix of quiet music and old fashioned quality of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, old-fashioned entertainment","review":"Kristin Chenoweth puts loads of personality into everything she sings (and does). This CD is a treat for anyone who likes a bit of Broadway. Some of the songs are upbeat and sassy, some are quiet and beautiful, and many of them tell a story. There's a wide mix of timeless classics, unfamiliar favorites, and new songs that sound like they were made just for her. (\\"The Girl in 14G\\" is hilarious, and requires a range of talent that not many people could handle.) The orchestra is first-rate, as is her singing (and her tap-dancing, which you can hear on the first song). The clips don't do it justice--you'll have to buy the CD and enjoy it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can see her in her voice!","review":"Once you have seen Kristen Chenoweth in action (check out YouTube) you know not only what an extremely talented musician she is, but also how fabulous she is at acting out and conveying each piece to an audience.

I wasn't sure at first it was her until I heard her sing it live and it was amazing. With great remakes like \\"My funny Valentine\\" and \\"How long has this been going on\\" you have songs that get stuck in your head, but you also have songs like \\" If you hadn't but you did\\" which is a great song that is faster which applies to a lot of guys ( not all, but some).

The book starts with little Lilliane and her unfortunate hamsters, and then moves on to a first date story, lost and new love(s) e.t.c. I think that as the title suggests, this is what can be found in several of this books stories. Lessons of life, through experiencing losses, searching for love, discovering her sexuality, asking herself...In the meantime, the reader is enjoying marvellous stories,with sketches who are simply made by a complicated and skilled cartoonist. Although as Franson states in the book, she never meant for these stories to be published, (and this fact only comes to show they are personal and frank), i am very happy friends convinced her otherwise. It is one of the books i am more than happy to have run across, and Franson, a cartoonist i look forward to see her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor shipping resulted in damaged product - twice","review":"The company that ships this product broke down a box and used this to ship the pizza peel, held together with a couple pieces of tape.

Beneath the layers of headphone sounds are catchy and intense rythms whose meaning is at times lost in the music, which isn't always a bad thing.With the new EP, you wish they would hurry up and put out more. Songs like \\"Centipede Eyes\\" and \\"My Friends Adore You\\" show their growth as quite ingenious studio workers, who I can only imagine put to good use their Dreamworks cash. Their music is often the kind you might hear at a fun little party where everyone is laidback but energetic, no airs are put on, but they want to lay out some good sounds. The power of their guitar work can be much more truly appreciated live, where they are currently out with The Dandy Warhols."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice extension of debut album","review":"A little more straightforward indie rock, with less drum machine/synth flourish than on I Become Small And Go. Still, it sounds great, very well produced, with lots of atmosphere.

In this latest release, his mixing talent is in full form, but his tune selection misses occasionally. For example, the first CD's opening track, \\"Hacker\\" by Anthony Rother is an incredibly weak opening, cheap sounding electro with a weak bassline that just doesn't fit in with the rest of the CD. The other misstep I can remember is dropping the Roland Clarke \\"I Get Deep\\" acapella where he did, he did a great job with that on Annie Nightengale's show a while back where it fit in perfectly with some Plump DJs track, but here, the lyrics in the song cut in with \\"Electrofunky\\" right while Roland is saying something, not smooth Tayo... Other than the few quibbles I have mentioned though, it's a solid release with great mixing and deep, phat basslines.

I also enjoyed how the story sucks you into a whirlepool of adventure and another world so that you can put yourself in Lucy's shoes and walk her path in the story. I recommend this book to people who love adventure, a little humor, and who aren't afraid of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important, Interesting Look at Marine Environment.","review":"Scientist Rachel Carson (1907-1964) writes lovingly about the sea in this award-winning 1951 effort. Carson describes what we knew about the sea at that time, and makes the underwater world come alive with her heartfelt descriptions. She mentions the threats to the environment (particularly from pesticides), and readers may want to become preservation minded merely from the author's descriptions. Sadly, much environmental damage has occurred since she penned these pages. Some say this book is a combination of literature and science; others find her style a bit thick. Either way, these words come from the heart, and this book should be of great interest to students of marine and/or environmental biology. Carson also wrote two more best-sellers on the sea (Edge of the Sea, The Sea Wind) plus Silent Spring, which spurred the ban on DDT."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest American books","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever.

Moisture content is consistent but poor... most cans are as dry as Vegas in August and only one had a hint of moisture (maybe Colorado in summer?). The flavor is fairly consistent but to be a \\"chew\\", the cut is decent size overall but far from perfect. I'll finish these cans for the flavor and forget the variables and likely keep the cans to shred some of their Teriyaki flavored jerky in the food processor that they sent as a sample to place in the cans. That was tasty in \\"stick\\" form and the way jerky should be served! Overall, not very happy so would have to give it the thumbs down...

I am a teacher and read the original to a class and every child wanted the book. I ordered them copies from Amazon in the UK and the children were very disappointed with the new names, etc. They loved the book, however, and most of them read their copy many times and/or their parents read it to them. The four stars is for this edition, not the original. If you can get a copy of the original (used) I highly recommend it. There are some things in the original that I would recommend discussing.

But for some strange reason Enid Blyton books are not available in USA, so had to order it through Amazon.I liked the fact that this book has the the 3 faraway series combined. Makes it easy to store and less books to take care of.The only thing that disappointed me are the changes in illustrations. The older or the original illustrations were much better and so real.

It was too small to bring into his own home, so he went looking for a new home where it would fit. Someone lived in each home he came to. He was hungry along the way. By the end of the day, he ate most of the apple and was able to fit it into his own home. We like the art. The stories are simple and cute. The cutouts also add a little something. In this book. The cutout on each page makes it look like he is looking into a hole, then when you turn the page, you see who lives in the hole, and you see it from their perspective- inside their home looking out at mouse. My one complaint is that the cover fell off this book during the first read. It was listed as new when I bought it, so maybe the seller had it stored in a less than desirable spot, or this book just has poor binding???"},{"rating":"2","title":"So, so cute, and fun for young preschoolers","review":"I love Petr Horacek's illustrations - they're big, bold, colorful, and sweet- they feel almost like children's own drawings. The mouse in this story is very sweet. He's looking for a house to fit the big apple he found, but he keeps nibbling until at the end, he finds the \\"perfect fit\\" - his own home! The young children I teach really enjoy this story, and \\"figuring out\\" why his old house is suddenly just the right size. This story is also nice for Fall when preschoolers often are learning about apples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos to be useful","review":"I am an orthopedic surgery resident. I have used this book during our academic conferences for 2 years and have become extremely frustrated with it.It is filled with errors--and not just negligible spelling or punctuation errors! Too often there is a typo (I presume) with the wrong bone/wrong tendon/wrong direction. Furthermore, the technical descriptions of operative procedures is absent or lacking.While it is a decent book for review of general concepts if you know enough to recognize the errors, I do not feel that it is dependable enough or deep enough to use once I enter private practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice pictures but many errors","review":"This is the required reading for the hand lectures for our plastic surgery teaching conferences. This book has two very strong points: (1) the chapters are organized in a logical fashion and written in the same style making for an easy read(this book was written by a single author) and (2) all of the chapters have plenty of excellent figures to illustrate the concepts.That said, this book is chock-full of errors including formatting errors, grammatical errors, spelling errors, and factual errors. The formatting, grammatical, and spelling errors make it rather difficult to understand and annoying to read. The factual errors are very misleading and sometimes difficult for someone early in their training to weed out.All in all, this book has the potential to be a great hand text in its future editions, but I would not recommend the current edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CHOICE WAS A MISTAKE!","review":"Peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture.

After doing a lot of research from reading reviews, these sounded like a great buy. I expected a lot from Sennheiser - but the one review that said the bass response is terrible, is right! I was very disappointed. The treble is too high and the bass is almost nonexistent. They sounded awful. I am not a fan of Apple's ibuds at all, but they actually sounded better.Sony's earbuds at the same and lower price have better EQ range and sound better, though the cords do disintegrate after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"I purchased a pair for my Nano about eight months ago, based on the strong recommendations in the media and on this page. Although I was somewhat disappointed that the improvement over the Ipod stock earbuds was negligible, I chalked up my inability to hear much of a difference to the damage to my ears caused by standing in front of a bass guitar amp (at full volume) for several years... I use my Ipod about 6-8 hours/week while commuting by bus and/or train. The right earphone has failed - fortunately I kept my stock earbuds.

As most people who bought these I was looking to upgrade the sound quality of my ipod. But, these disappoint. I had previously bought Griffin Ear Jams that have a little plastic piece that goes over the ipod earphones earbud and you mount the little rubber pieces on them. For $15 I thought they worked well which is why I bought the Sennheiser which worked on the same principle.In short, the Sennheiser don't sound any better than the Griffins AND the Sennheiser doesn't come with a carrying case. This is a very bad omission because the rubber pieces fall off the earbud so easily. After having one fall off (but, luckily, I found it) I started putting them in a plastic baggy.I would definitely not recommend these Sennheiser, instead get the Griffins.Good luck,Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"PEOPLE BE CAREFUL !!","review":"I ordered a pair of Sennheiser CX300-B expecting to get the real deal only to find out that I had been totally ripped off !!The name of the seller is \\"BESTELECTRONICSDEAL\\" who shameslessly sent me a cheap knock off of the original product.Be careful not to buy from these dishonest seller which by the way is also selling the \\"Creative EP-630\\" brand that look just like the Sennheiser's.Go figure,right?.These people even have the nerve to enclose a copy with some photos of their cheap replicas warning you which one is original and which one is not! can you believe that?Bottom line is:take your hard earned money and buy from any other seller but \\"bestelectronicsdeals\\"..and please alert others.You have been warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, no longevity","review":"These are the first bud headphones I ever bought. They were to replace the oh-so-crappy-sounding default iPod headphones. I bought 'em from Tiger Direct (big mistake) and they have a no returns policy short of the items being defective.After screwing around with the rubber parts that cover the headphones and go into your ear, I finally got the hang of them. The problem is, after 3-6 months some of the wire covering got a hole in it. Not sure how, because I'm pretty careful. But within a few weeks of that, the headphones were hanging by the actual electric wire on the inside and predictably stopped working.So the sound on these things is great.

I had been using a $20 pair Phillips earbuds. Decided it was time to upgrade a bit, but these sound awful, I will never use them and J&R Music will NOT accept them for a return. There are two basic problems: (1) the sound is flat at the lows and mids and without depth; (2) they distort easily. I just don't get how these are as popular as they seem to be.

They sound great for an inexpensive set of earbuds. I have never listened to any of the higher end earbuds but with sound like this I don't see any need to.The Bad : I typically use my iPod when I am doing yard work and these have a tendency of not staying in place and I have to adjust them often to keep equal volume and sound in each ear. I tried changing to the larger adapter foam pads but it didn't seem to make much difference. Sennheiser also makes a set of earbuds with a wrap around wire that holds them in place better. I would only recommend the CX300 for anyone who is going to use them while doing lower movement activities and the type with the wrap around wire for more physical activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound! Not for everyone.","review":"Could not maintain a good fit in my ears and they would fall out frequently. I do not want to trash the product because they do have a very nice sound. However, they do produce a \\"cable bounce\\" noise, which will not work well for runners. The other feature I did not like is the offset cable, which allows you to run one earbud cord behind the neck and keep your player in your left breast pocket. Nice idea, but I found it to be more of an inconvenience (personal preference)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earphones for the price","review":"I just got these in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised when I hooked them up to my iPod. MUCH better and WAY more comfortable than the stock Apple earphones. I lucked out; the middle-sized rubber flanges fit my ears perfectly. I'm sure I could get better sound from expensive, over-the-ear headphones, but for my purposes (lightweight, portable, and sound-blocking) these are fantastic. I would say to anyone that you have to play with the EQ settings on your MP3 player if you have the option, as I found the bass on these to be SO good that I had to switch to a vocal-booster setting. All in all, these are great earphones for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds","review":"Great performance for a fair price.

These earbuds delivered with everything I was expecting. The sound quality is excellent, the bass, volume and the one qualifying factor that I bought them for, sound blocking. I would have given them a perfect score but the only thing I don't like about them is the \\"J\\" style cable.

The bass is a little loose and can stand to be a little less distorted. This was improved by adjusting the equalizer on my iPod.

Just moving my head slightly creates a loud rustling sound in my ear.I am ordering a pair of Shure EC2s right now, maybe I'll have better luck with those.Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is \\"buzzy\\", but tolerable","review":"The buds fit well and do block out noise. However, it seems that some of the blocking is due to a persistent buzz (or hum) in the background. I didn't use the earbuds for quite some time so too late to return. I tried them on a desktop, laptop and MP3 player. The least buzz was with the MP3 on a plane.Would not buy again, but maybe I just got a lemon. They come with different size earbuds so you get a good fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great.","review":"You cannot beat the price for a closed ear headphone. the thing that I did not expect out of this (and presumably all closed ear headphones) is that I can hear myself. I hear my breathing(I breath lightly, I am not a wheezing ex-smoker). Sometimes I think I can hear my heart beat. All of this adds to more background sound so I have to turn up the volume.Other than my own breathing, these headphones are great. They have the best bass response of any earbud I've used.

I changed the size of the bud that goes in the ear to where it was a rather tight fit - and - problem solved. My opinion of these went from a 1 start out of 5 to a 5 out 5.To get the awesome sound that these ear buds offer you MUST have the right size bud in your ears.If there is any wiggle room for the buds when in your ear you will get terrible sound. I have a feeling this is where many of the negative posts have come from. I am telling you, once you get the ear buds nice and tight in your ear, you will get the high quality sound that the Sennheiser name is known for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own a pair.","review":"They are quite fantastic actually. I believe that the people who are giving negative responses may just not be comfortable with the in-ear design. When they talk about \\"buy this or that\\" they usually mention products that do not use the in-ear design that these do.This was my first time trying the In-ear design and I love it. They're fantastic for walks, they can provide a movie-theater experience on my laptop while my wife is watching T.V. or vacuuming.Don't pass these up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! Almost shelled out for the Ultimate Ears!!","review":"I'd been waffling whether to get the Ultimate Ears super.fi 3 Pro's, or the 5 Pro's. I'd listened to a pair of UE 3's a friend of mine had picked up and thought I might like the UE 5's since they supposedly have more extended bass. Luckily, I wavered long enough for these cx300's to come out. Man, am I glad I waited!!I'm not gonna snow you and tell you they'll replace my Senn 595's....but they'll get more than their fair share of usage. I've had these 2 weeks now and I'm continually amazed at the sound. Although, at times I think the bass is just a tad much, the cx300 is smoother across the frequency range than I anticipated. And, they amply block out the server stacks (and the boss!) that I sit next to at work.I whole-heartedly recommend these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Shure","review":"I bought these for my husband.

The deciding factor for me was the color on these(silly i know). Man, am I glad i'm so shallow. I love these things. They are very slick looking with the black pod's, and the sound is better than I had anticipated. It does take some experimentation with the 3 different size rubber \\"things\\" to get the perfect sound for yourself though. Also the un-equal wires to each earbud are actually a great design, think about it, you wear the pod on one side or another so its always closer to that one ear.In summary, very sleek apperance, great sound, great design. Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser CX 300B In-ear Monitor Black","review":"I purchased these headphones for my Ipod Nano. I am very happy with them. They are a significant upgrade from previous headphones I have used in the past.What I like best about these earphones are the comfort and style. I read a lot of reviews on many different brands, I found that people had a lot of concerns about the comfort on these items. These earphones fit like a glove, also the length of the cord is a perfect fit, not too long and definately not to short.As far a sound goes, I guess I had different expectations. Since I was spending more than $10 for earphones, which is what I averaged in the past. The sound is good, but I guess I expected a little more.I would recommend these earphones, they are a great value for $60 or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buds for the buck","review":"My first impression changed after these got a little time on them. . One reviewer said that they were great after break in. I agree and gave them an additional star after the break in I think they are very good. Excellent for the price. Another reviewer mentioned the annoying cord, I agree but if you run the right cord on the back of the neck it works fine. That's how it is supposed to route. Without the eq set on my notebook in itunes they could be a little muddy sounding on some overly warmed songs. I like to hear things loud at times and after rolling off some of the lows and a little adjustment here and there they are indeed very good. I tend to be ruff on them and if you are a little careless with handling, I wouldn't bother spending a lot more money just to get a better sound. If you lose or break them price wise they are easy to replace. I consider these comfortable, havin good noise cancellation and a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for low-key activities.","review":"The sound on these ear buds is fantastic. My only issue, is sweat. When I sweat, either they always fall out or the little hole in the rubber gasket gets \\"clogged\\" giving me the \\"pool ear\\" feeling. But for just kickin' back or just on the move you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds!","review":"These do sound a lot better than my sony ex-71. You can really notice a difference after burning in (breaking in)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best earbuds for the price","review":"These CX300's sound amazing with great cord quality. The cords won't break down like Sony's.My piece of advise is to use the largest ear inserts! By using the largest size, you make your ear nearly airtight and the bass you can hear is DEEEEP. Its incredible. For the longest time I didn't try the largest size because I thought they were toooo big. I was wrong.Use the large!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These earbuds will give you a headache","review":"I used the reviews(all positive) on this page to decide to purchase these earbuds. My Shure E-3's are busted and felt that this technology must be safe with a company as well regarded as Sennheiser. Not the case these buds they are comfortable but that is were the praise stops as far as I am concerned. A test of my favorite music rendered these earbuds unusable for anything but heavily distorted rock and roll. Any music that relies on vocals sound sibilent and thin. Test these out before you commit or just stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed and I returned them","review":"I wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my Ipod.I saw some good reviews and this brand has been known always for great headphones. Bought these and was shocked at the terrible sound quality. Yes, the sound is clean, but TOO clean. The highs are too high leading to tinny and over-brassy sound. Voices have too much hiss. There is virtually no low end bass of any type. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 pairs in a row died on me in months","review":"[update] I've now had FOUR sets in a row and they have ALL had exactly the same problem. Thankfully there is a 2 year warranty and Sennheiser does replace them, but my warranty is almost up and I'm about to send my current set back again! Seriously, don't waste your time.[original review] I had these for about 3 months before the sounds went out in the left earphone. At first I liked them - the sound is good, but the earbuds are too big (even the smallest of the 3 sizes included) and so it's hard to get them to stay in my ears and the cords are tacky (as in sort of sticky) so they tangle extremely easily. I've just sent them back to Sennheiser (at my expense) to hopefully have them fixed as they're still under warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought these expecting great sound, but they just didn't deliver. There was absolutely no bass whatsoever,, and I tried it on a partable Walkman CD player with a radio, a Mini Disc recorder an iPod and my home stereo, as well as even in my TV set, and they all just sounded bad. I will say they were very comfortable though, so if you don't care if there is no bass and the sound is kind of tinny, they are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible fit","review":"I had to return these (very easy -- thanks, Amazon!) because they were just terrible. They did not fit my ears at all; they wouldn't stay in for even a few seconds. I tried all of the different sizes, and none of them worked. I would not recommend these earbuds at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design","review":"First off, the sound quality of these earbuds is indeed pretty good. However, the cord design totally offsets that value. From reading other reviews, it appears as though the right earbud cord is longer than the left so you can drape it behind your neck? I can't find anything on Sennheiser's site about it. But I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a good thing. It's very awkward. The cord material is very rubbery so there is a lot of friction and grab. If the cord is draped on my bare neck and I turn my head to the right, the rubber cord pulls against my neck and pulls the earbud out of my right ear.Just because of that alone, I'll probably stop using these. They're just a pain to use and are very awkward due to the different cord length."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality headphones at a good price","review":"For an extra $10 these headphones are much better than the Sony earbuds. The bass is great and the clarity of the midrange and highs are crystal clear. I like the behind the ear and short cord so it doesnt' snag like the two pair of Sony's I've previously bought which ripped out of my ears. These are very comfortable and stay in your ear with the right size rubber adapters. It is noise cancelling even outside with cars going by. There is nothing negative I can say about these headphones especially with a two year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"A little tricky to put on if you are not used to wear earbuds, but after you have them on the difference is clear.

Excludes external sounds so well, you'll forget the world is out there. Nifty product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these earbuds","review":"These earbuds have the worst audio quality I have ever encountered. The highs were thin and tinny, the midrange was average, and the low end was non-existent. I followed Sennheiser's instructions/suggestions but nothing worked. I was past the date for returning the item, so in the end I gave them to a friend who wanted them. I replaced them with a $10 headset which has far superior quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I'd hoped","review":"Based on the reviews, I was really hoping these earbuds would sound good, block out external noise, and fit really well. I was wrong on all counts. They were worthless for wearing while jogging, as they kept moving around inside my ear canal. I even tried the different size rubber tips to try to get them to fit better, but no luck. I found that they sound OK when sitting still, but the audio quality is best only when they're all the way in, touching the eardrum and that was tiring.So I put these in a drawer and went back to my Apple earbuds. The way they fit in the ear is better, and even though they don't sound great, at least they're consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the bass?","review":"I returned these earbuds after a few days as they certainly didn't live up to my expectations. The cons are pretty universal to all inexpensive earbuds but I expected more after reading the reviews. If this is what you can afford, then go ahead and buy them - just don't expect high end performance.PRO: ComfortableCON: Sounded like tin cans - no bass at all unless you press on them constantly; Sounds from cord touching anything are amplified"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleaseee Don't buy these.","review":"I bought these headphones for $50 dollars but please read this review and don't waste your money.First of all ask yourself why do you need noise cancellation. This is definately because you don't want to hear outside noise when you are travelling and here is the problem with these. These are great sounding ear buds if you are sitting idle but once the wires start to move (e.g. if you are travelling) then you will clearly hear distortion in your ear. Plus you can even hear the wire move around and I swear that you won't be able to wear them for more than five minutes. ( The noise of wire moving nauseated me and made me vomit)Do yourself a favour and don't buy these.If you want noise cancellation go for full size noise cancellation headphones or at least don't buy these ones. They are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"APPLE IPOD NANO Owner","review":"I read the reviews and expected something awesome, but was completely dis-satisfied. I did not get a deep base sound using any of the ear adapters, the only real difference was the Treble. But since I like Bass, I'm returning them for a refund. I also switched between the EQ settings on the NANO and could not get a better overall sound from them. The sound difference just wasn't worth the $55 bucks. Also, the wiring is unbelievably cheap, unlike the IPOD cord which is a heavey duty gauge, cut even and hangs down without any effort, these are thin and were all curled up from shipping. Maybe it depnds on the shape of your ears, and the type of player you are using. If you buy them, make sure you get a return policy just incase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was sold fake stuff","review":"I could not rate a real set of ear buds as the SOB sold me some fake ear buds. icursed him and sent them back at his expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"LoFi ear buds","review":"I own a pair of HD-595 and purchased a pair of HD-497 as a gift for my brother.

Try removing the rubber cover, they sound cheaply. The worst thing is the mids, badly distorted. Changing the rubber cover may help a little bit with the bass, depending on your ears but mids can not be corrected.I was afraid of the fake products, so I purchased them directly from Amazon.

Maybe I expected too much from some $50 earbuds, but after reading all the user reviews I thought I was going to get a great set of earbuds. The sound always sounded \\"stuffy\\" and not very clear; really didn't seem to matter what I did to the EQ. The fit on these is OK, I could really never get them to get a nice fit no matter what size fitting I used. The worst part is that my left earbud has no sound now at all and this is after very infrequent gentle use for 3 months. UPDATED...

These are keepers! However, a few words of advice and caution:1) In order to experience the deep bass that they claim to produce, you must achieve a tight fit. To do this, you must use the largest ear-fit-rings that your ear-holes will allow.2) Achieving a tight fit (effectively blocking all outside noise) has side effects ... cable movement and chewing is heard through the ear plugs.On a scale of 1-10, the bass is an eight. I expected deeper bass, but this is pretty good.The midtones are great, and the highs are sharp (maybe too sharp).Like I said, for the price, you'll find none better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good quality, comfortable to use","review":"Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I was, however, a little disappointed with the sound quality.

This is the second pair of these I've owned (the first pair I lost), and I must say I have yet to be disappointed in their audio quality.One item of note is that when you receive your earbuds, switch between the different size pads to find the one that best fits your ear. If you use pads that are too small, you will get ZERO bass response and if you use pads that are too big, you will be uncomfortable.I only have one complaint about these earbuds, and that is the cord. For whatever reason, when I'm wearing these and the cords rubs on my shirt, I can hear it in the music. To prevent this, I usually run the cord under my shirt to keep it from moving around and that helps.Otherwise, for $40, I really can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"real good sound","review":"The sound is really very good, way better than I expected considering the cost of these. The earbuds are better than some selling for twice the price, but still not a great fit and not hours-long comfortable.For the price, I don't think these can be beat. These may not be \\"the ultimate\\" but they are pretty good, and at this price I can go anywhere with them and not be paranoid about losing them, they are easily replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound","review":"I bought these without listening to them, and was pleasantly surprised at their sound. They block a lot of exterior noise, and provide rich, full bass and clear mids & highs. For an in-ear headphone I am continually blown away. Especially nice in my race car or an airplane, they block a lot of the droning background noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright","review":"Bought them based on the reviews, let them break-in, but still too shrill/bright for me. The Sony 51's, by comparison, need more high-end clarity.On a tangent, if you think your iPod earphones is bass heavy and lacking in the highs, make sure they're oriented correctly in your ears. That makes a world of difference!

I didn't buy it on Amazon, it was a LOT cheaper where I got it, so LOOK around. This unit is VERY heavy. I have a two story condo and getting it upstairs was really difficult, but I managed. Unfortunately the window is too big and I had to add cardboard to the window kit. It is really nice that you can roll it around though. I was surprised by how big it is, but it works great and even though it's quite loud I am able to sleep with it on. Cools quickly too.

That's why I can't give it more than 4 stars so far. I have read enough to get an idea of what reciepts to save and, when discussing tax issues with fellow landlords, I've found quick answers to all our questions so far. And, I, who am somewhat tax illiterate, even understand the answers I've found! I have to read this book - I've purchased a lot of books on landlording and real estate investing and read most of them but still have no solid idea about how I'm going to deal with my taxes this year (first time rental house owner this year). I know this is a very necessary read for me but, who wants to read about TAXES?? - what a bore!!

Reading this book helped me really understand everything in depth, and pick up some deductions I didn't know about.As a landlord, I think its important to have a solid understanding of how taxes work, even if somebody else does your taxes.

A lot of the deductions need paper work to back it up. Some deductions you can use prior to the property is being rented out. The book is easy to follow. I make minimal from my rent, so it does not make sense to get an accountant to do my tax. This book gives a good overview and some nice advises. Some of the deductions it mentioned is harder to claim using turbo tax. It's hard to find the appropriate forms. But it's not this book's problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comprehensive, but would you read it?","review":"I am a landlord and I had a lot of tax training because of my profession. So I find the book pretty comprehensive and easy (for me) to read.But for the average landlord, would you spend 10 hours reading this and try to understand and remember all the details? Or would you rather someone else do it for you, like your accountant (by the way, I am not one, so no conflict of interest there)? Thus 4-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read","review":"I'm a beginner landlord and I found this book easy to read and comprehend. Tax books are not the most exciting of reading material, so I'm only 1/4 of the way through it, but I have learned so much from it so far. I bought the book at the end of the year to prepare myself for taxes. I wish I bought it sooner, because there is many deductions that I could have taken. But it's a little late in the year now and the reciepts were trashed, so I loose there. Great book for first timers and I will probably need to refer to this book as I move into the next tax year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy description for simple things, wasting time reading it.","review":"This book should be reduced by half in size.

It had to be laser for the increased accuracy, usability on surfaces, etc.2. It had to be wired. I wanted to avoid the headache of batteries with wireless mice if at all possible.3. It had to have a simple button layout. I didn't want a thousand buttons whose functions I'd never use.4. It had to be relatively inexpensive. Bang for the buck.Of the few finalist mice that fit these criteria, Logitech's Rx1000 stood out. With mostly positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.Two weeks of solid use later, I'm not the slightest bit disappointed; the mouse feels solid and accurate, looks slick, and performs beautifully.

My main gripe with the previous mouse was that it chewed through batteries like crazy, so I searched for a corded one instead since they are basically free to own.This mouse is smooth and accurate. I haven't had any trouble with the pointer jumping around like a few reviewers said nor have I felt that the mouse was too small for my hand (average male hand size). The 4th button (button with magnifying glass) serves as a back button if the setpoint software is not installed which I would recommend as I found it useless and later uninstalled it.I am giving the mouse 4 stars because I do find the clicking to be a bit noisier than my old mouse (although I've gotten used to it) and the scroll wheel is relatively hard to click and noisy when pushed. Overall it is a good laser mouse for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Corded Laser Mouse","review":"Got this so I would have a back up mouse for those times when you are working on your computer (installs and such) and don't have wireless capability yet.

Some of these songs work better by the real artist who originally sung the song. Pat Green and Cory Morrow not bad singers I have seen them live here in Texas and they can put on a show pretty good. But this cd is just not good and is I'm just not hearing it. It sounds something from two guys singing about Texas and everything in Texas. These guys like to drink alot and we can all see that.

While the Bible is (as all Christians believe) inspired by God, it was written in the context of the times and talents of the writers. Understanding this does not diminish the \\"faith aspect\\" of the Church and Paul's writings, rather it serves to enhance it. That a tentmaker (in a part of the world with diverse cultures and peoples was inspired to impart a message of universal meaning for all times is remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satan will like this one","review":"Attacking the inerrancy of Scripture is one of Satan's most poisonous tactics, in the war against Jesus and His people. The thief comes to steal, people. The author seems to question everything that's fundamental about Christianity; the Resurrection, the divinity of Christ, Paul's conversion. Perhaps Mr. Wright has not actually encountered the Living God? Don't let the biased \\"scholarship\\" of this book diminish anything about your relationship with the Risen King of Kings, Jesus Christ. Only those who endure to the end will be saved. To the author: Tell Satan I said \\"hello\\", when you're greeted to eternal punishment in Hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy!","review":"A.N.

He picks and chooses what he wants to believe so he can make up an imaginary Paul, very different from the Biblical Paul. I bought this book thinking I could get some more information on the Apostle Paul from other historical sources besides the Bible.Instead I get a man using the Bible for a book, when he does not even believe the Bible.REPENT VIPER! Repent and accept the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, inaccurate scholarship","review":"Wilson uses the Bible to flesh out his portrait of Paul.

The flow of the book is constantly interrupted by meaningless tangents that contribute little or nothing to the whole picture.It's History 101 class all over again.The author is in the habit of using the Bible as a credible source of information when it supports his assertions, and then discrediting it as a source when it contradicts his assertions. It is quite clear that the author is knowledgeable on the subject, however, he needs to remember that educated guesses are not facts. Historical study dictates that one must gather information from different sources to get a clearer picture of the past. However, this author goes a bit too far. Constants based on variables may work with economics, but not with history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this book 0 stars...","review":"This book was disappointing. I found the topic of an analysis of Paul's character to be intriguing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this book that would lead me to a better understanding of Paul than before I spent time reading it. What I do now know however, is that A.N.

He seems to look at Christianity with questions that deny their goodness. Was he a Christian himself?

That would have been an interesting read to a Christian such as me.

The book discusses Paul and it discusses first century living; but Mr. Wilson's attempts to connect the two are through fiction, or worse - wishful thinking. Mr. Wilson offers several footnotes throughout the book to show the reader authority for his assertions and to lend credibility to his work. However, when it comes to the purported subject of the book -\\"the mind of Paul\\" - the book wholly lacks in supporting context or authority. There are leaps without logic. Others suggest that you read the book with a grain of salt.

With hundreds of adjectives that slant Paul's character to a lying (if not dumb) man, Wilson ultimately fails to look at his main character without subjectivity. For instance, the author's choice to apply \\"Luke's cosy picture of Paul\\" (68) hardly allows the average reader to fully see the unbiased portrait of that character. Rather, most readers will put away Wilson's book and simply say, \\"I guess they're all liars...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilson's Apostle - Not worth the price","review":"This is a really bad book.

She was beautiful and brash even as a young teenager, and lucky not to have been kidnapped already. Another memory: one winter day in the mid-1960s I was motorcycling in Spain and happened to pass her family's mansion at Jerez, surrounded by scary walls. I rang the bell and asked about her through a mike, but a rough voice told me she was out and to get away from the gate if I valued my life.

It's classic noir: gritty, grainy, inner-city dirty sets and some great clipped dialogue. Add it to your \\"noir\\" collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the Center for Disease Control See this One","review":"OK, good movie, nice script, excellent directing and outstanding acting. What more could you want? Well, in the case of \\"Panic in the Streets\\", a little more respect for the audience. Let's see, the point is to find everyone who came into contact with a man with the plague who just died. A vast manhunt goes out etc. etc. etc. All well done and you'll enjoy the developing suspense. However, remember how an epidemic spreads. Was it really enough just to locate the several men in question? What about Blackie's girlfriend, Zero's wife, Poldi's cousin, etc, etc, etc. Once again, I deminish a good movie by taking it too seriously. Oh well, if you don't make the same mistake, \\"Panic in the Streets\\" will be more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Timeless Classics Panic in the Streets [1950] [Remastered]","review":"The Timeless Classics DVD is a low-quality bootleg. The picture is all messed up and looks like a VCD. It even scrolls text across the screen when you start it up telling you who is responsible for \\"ripping\\" the film. Unfortunately the Timeless Classics bootleg has all the reviews copied from the Panic in the Streets (Fox Film Noir) page, which is the version to get. Not looking quickly I just thought that the so-called \\"Remastered\\" version was a new release.

Even though it does have a beginning, middle, and end, it does not involve you in the characters really. Hardly any character is empathetic they are just a bunch of mean people that stand around arguing with the police. Jack Palance featured on the cover has a lessor role. The movie moves too fast to give you a chance to get involved. The idea is so single, \\"the plague\\", and has little else to support it. Oddly the illness is put on the back burner to the mouthing off of the police and military doctor which is not interesting. I can see that the script had many of the important film elements but it did not jell. This is the type of movie you shut off before you get to the end then you sell or throw away. The marketing on the front cover is all this DVD has to offer but the famous name Elia Kazan on the cover does not improve the contents at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"The obvious plot-line is the plague in New Orleans. But, I have always seen it as a sweet love affair between characters of Barbara and Richard. Irrespective of the 'Panic in the Streets,' life goes on! The cast is superb; Walter Jack PALANCE is the epitome of the psychotic 'heavy' (watch his mood swings that happen in a second or two!) -- Zero Mostel as the cowardly hanger-on; Paul Douglas as the straight-shooter cop out of his depth.The CENTER, however, is the marital contract between Widmark's and Geddes' characters -- never so endearingly portrayed on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DIRECTOR WITH THE GREAT FOX STYLE","review":"WIDMARK as the Navy (I think) doctor, PALANCE as the gangster carrying bubonic plague, the NEW ORLEANS locations, the screenplay and story, the direction are great.

In this you actually hear musicians who can play their instruments and posess the talent to communicate the blue collar experiences and hardships of the time they were writing about. In the song Not Fragile you can hear the precursors to Grunge and Alternative rock that came 20 years later. In their words and sounds you can hear the gears crunching and the beat of some very coarse emotions that can be felt by anyone who has gone through bad times. The songs seem to have been born from some of the earlier blues influences and depict a rough life with few luxuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"School of E.

After research, I discovered, the CD recording was a cast recording without Vivienne and Harold as they were not available. In there place was Jane Froman and Dick Beavers.

This recording is old and stale. There is nothing here that departs from what you've heard from them before with the exception of the tracks \\"20th Century Girl\\" (the one redeeming feature of this album) and \\"Tout, Tout Pour Ma Cherie\\" (an abysmal failure...). The remaining songs all sound like you've heard them many times before in superior versions.Where \\"Happy End of The World\\" was a leap forward for P5, \\"The Fifth Release\\" is a step backwards.

Visually stunning but there is very little to show how the music is produced.Camera work is very distracting, changing scenes every second.About 5 minutes in total of the program shows how the pianist produces this magic.If you are a fan of Lang Lang's playing then I recommend you buy a CD of the concert rather than the DVD.Surely the reason for a film of a pianist is to see how he/she makes the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"musical genius","review":"I can only be in awe of his pianistic skills.

If you have Lang Lang Live in Vienna, don't expect the same level of satisfaction. This performance was at the London Round House festival which was intended to spread classical music to non-classical music fans or rock concert goers. Although his piano performance is good, the visual background (a la music video) is very distracting. It surely will disappoint many classical music fans.

The cover is the best thing about the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah's Wife?","review":"La Pucelle is not well served here. This is a pretty mediocre, superficial treatment of Joan's life. Gordon brings a novelist's flair to what amounts to a somewhat stream-of-consciousness extended essay. Gordon likes Shaw's play, SAINT JOAN, and you can see how Shaw's view of Joan's voices/religious identity clearly shaped Gordon's perspective. Stick with Regine Pernoud's various books on Joan, which are superior in every aspect to this flawed offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to impress you with her English writting skills","review":"Poorly written book by an English professor that seems to think showing off her English writing skills, fancy words and drawn out descriptions, is a good thing. She also does a poor job of presenting the life story in a believable, well laid out manner. She seemed to jump back and forth from what seemed like a well researched, true history of Joan to a fictional extrapolation or imagination of what people dreamed up to make Joan a appear as a famous person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedtime story","review":"Gordon is a devout Catholic and a skilled storyteller who ducks the criticisms of history snobs by describing this modest work as a meditation, rather than a biography. The book is an account of the lives and legends of a medieval teenager, who either did or did not hear heavenly voices, and who was either a brilliantly intuitive military leader or else a glorified flag girl.Gordon's credulous tone is aggravated in the audio version by Mari Devon's breathy interpretation. Devon treats the listeners like small children, giving her high-pitched voice feigned expressions of amusement, awe, and despair. 'After THAT, JO-oan was known as the MA-AI-AI-D of Or-lay-OHHHHNZ.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very brief and sometimes even boring!","review":"Even being a brief book, the writer accomplished the hard task of turning Joan's life into a sometimes boring narrative. Anyway, if you're looking to start knowing the basics, this is a good book to start.The chpater at the end where the writer spent time writing about dramatization in books and movies about Joan's life is utter useless, in my opinion is totally desnecessary and the worst part of hte book.Also, do not expect detailed accounts of the battles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a biography","review":"I might have enjoyed this in an essay or under the auspices of \\"relections\\" (again, essay),but no matter how you dress it up, and no matter what you call it, a biography this book certainly is not. For a great and serious short new biography, see Siobhan Nash Marshall's : Joan of Arc: A Spiritual Biography. I may not agree with Marshall's final analysis but she's an excellent storyteller and knows how to weed out a story. She also knows how to take a strong stand, express a point of view but at the same time stay out of the story--something Ms. Gordon may learn from--at least when attempting to write a biography. A \\"biography\\" is not about the author's ruminations, reflections & \\"meditation\\", it is about the author's subject, and that subject's life and legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a question of credentials","review":"This book does not turn out to be what I thought it would be, namely a memoir about the influence of Joan of Arc on the novelist's life. As such it would have been interesting. What we have is a derivative work with unreliable scholarly apparatus. Gordon is an interesting writer whom I have read with pleasure, but regretfully I have to say that the ten or so Joan of Arc books she drew on for her \\"Joan of Arc\\" still make better and more reliable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanciful and opinionated","review":"I am not a big fan of Mary Gordon's work, and, although I tried to approach \\"Joan of Arc\\" with an open mind, within the first few pages I realized her usual pattern: Fanciful conjectures, strong (and to my mind, incorrect) opinions, generally sloppy thinking. Ironically, Gordon may be a good choice to write this \\"biography\\", as Joan is a controversial, poorly understood figure, distant from us in that medieval world so different from our own. In my judgement, Gordon has produced a book that is also controversial and difficult to understand! Two things do come through, though, that even Gordon cannot obscure: Joan's unwavering faith, and her glorious love for the Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"And where is the biography?","review":"This is not a biography but a sort of reflection on Joan of Arc's life that gets a bit too romantical, reiterative and tedious after a while. I thought I was buying a biographical work (i.e., serious research, extensive sources, facts, and the like), so I was very disappointed. For those willing to learn more about Joan, I recommend Regine Pernoud's entertaining (and also scholarly) \\"Joan of Arc: By Herself and Her Witnesses\\". At least, you'll be spared the Jean Plaidyish stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Since I listened to the unabridged version, I continued through the end.

If not, then you will probably be disappointed. Clearly, in so short a book, one doesn't expect to find excessive detail, but very much was missing from this book. Add to this a dullish style, and there isn't much to redeem the book.The bright sides of the book were the sections on Joan's virginity and the review of how Joan was potrayed by various authors and in various films. But this is not enough to make up for an otherwise tepid book.I don't think the book measures up to the others in this series that I have read to far on St. Augustine and Mao Tse Dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"I received a message with an attachment I can't open","review":"I am trying to contact you about your attachment sent to my email which I cannot open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly girl","review":"Gordons' introduction betrays her lack of direction, the thrust and falter that aspires to the spirit of but does not match the \\"meditations\\" of the others in the series. The language frequently breaks down into ungainliness (words repeated in a sentence as if a coffee break intervened, neither aural flow nor theme sustained) and errors such as speaking of Joan's gender (people have sex, their names have gender). Does not compare well with Hardwick's Melville (tough standard), or say the hard focus of Deus Lo Volt, the excruciating endoscopy of the crusades. Not that Joan is altogether absent. I would like to have Saramago do a Joan. Or even Monty Python, to clear the air (\\"always look on the bright side of the fire\\"). Give me irreverence over pietism any day. Saramago's intrusions are challenges; Gordon's are impertinences. Monty Python rubbishes our retropections; Gordon turns them into hot flashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great High Octave Guitar Jazz","review":"I have been a fan of Ottmar for a long time.

Damon's voice is excellent and holds it all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, The Bad and the Queen: Mostly Good","review":"I bought this 1) because I was following the career of ex-Clash bassist Paul Simonon, and 2) I was convinced by all the rave reviews the album was receiving, including several best-of-'07 lists...It was not what I expected; I was not familiar with Blur's work, so I was expecting a more punk/reggae-driven, Clash-like sound. But I do enjoy it, with it's dreamy quality, and an intensity that builds to the intense final track. It's grown on me each time I've listened to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Bad and The Average","review":"I read a great review of this in a magazine and ordered it. THe article kept emphasizing beats and the way it was described sounded a bit more like electronica or housey rock.

Snooze alert! I will keep it next to my bed and listen to it while I sleep! After repeated listens it simply is missing the 'stuff' that made Blur and The Verve so great. Hey, it doesn't have to be 'in your face' noisy or loud, I would prefer mellow but make sure it has a pulse! As a note, Blur has always been one of my favorite, most promising bands to come out of the UK. Gorillaz continued with this that energy. I can say the same with The Verve and The Clash, so what happened here? People who rate this a buy (Alternative Press, etc.) are doing so simply to sell the record. This will in be the $5 bin in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooring","review":"I was really hoping this would be good. Dude from Blur has been on a creative streak and now he's making and album with the bass play from the clash and Fela Kuti's drummer. But alas, it sounds like the boring, moody, skip-over tracks on previous Blur albums. (Think \\"Death of the Party.\\") Some folks may really be into that stuff though. If you're one of them you'd probably like this. All I know is played this album aloud ONE TIME at work and four people told me to turn it off.

(And if you don't catch the references and jokes at once, the editors provide a sizable glossary at the back). I could have done without the wordy introduction, but considering the attention garnered by the films lately, it's understandable. The text is presented in facsilmile, something I like very much - a good book benefits from a few nice pictures, and the ones here are simply and beautifully drawn, including two color plates. This also includes a first draft, and Tolkien's outline for a sequel, which make for interesting comparisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, ugly, and excessively smelly","review":"Do people care if it's patchwork leather? Absolutely. Most aren't rude enough to mention it because they're not the ones who have to wear the thing. When I received mine, the patchwork was a rude surprise not mentioned in the advertisement. It looks as if pieces of scrap have been sewn together. That's exactly what has been done. I'm not against scraps, but I don't enjoy my patchwork quilts in leather either thank you. The coat fit terribly and smelled absolutely atrocious. The new leather smell isn't very attractive to begin with, but I believe some excess sent must have been poured onto this coat. It was unbearable. I have never had that issue before. I donated the coat to the local high school drama department the next day. Given the price, I shouldn't have been such a fool and at least it was leather. I would still give it one star for that, even if zero were an option.

The author seems to cover every aspect of remote viewing but the instructions seemed a bit to rushed for me. The book did not dive into the science of remote viewing, so unless you have read lots about the human bioplasmic body, such as books on chakras and auras, you may not get as much out of the book as you could have. Also some of the stories are repetitious. Not a very well edited book. But it does seem to cover a bit of everything pertaining to remote viewing, and has lots of how to instructions, quick as they are.

Good sections on RV technique, that may or may not be fully grounded in experience and study, intermingle with preposterous accusations against MI5 in the UK and against the business elites that Rifat believes control the world.Rifat's bibliography is a puzzle. He doesn't refer to excellent sources that one would expect him to have used, or that he ought to wish to recommend to readers, and yet he cites Wittgenstein and Chomsky who are way off the subject.I don't find Rifats \\"scientific\\" explanations for RV, RI etc plausible.Where I suspect he is at his best is giving a relatively diverse set of protocols for types of mind-reach activities...but the weaknesses of his text detract greatly from those strengths.He seems more concerned to advertise or brag about his capabilities than to educate."},{"rating":"1","title":"For purely entertainment purposes only!","review":"Rifat makes some amazing claims about super-duper secret soviet psi research facilities that, apparently, the US wanted to get intel on but couldn't.

He did cite the Freedom of Information act as a vehicle for collecting the data on these programs; however, he never mentions what documents he found. There is a problem here. Most of the \`good stuff' is still classified so it isn't available under the Freedom of Information act.I'm not sure how it's related but he somehow meanders onto various gov'ts use of Microwave technology to control the population - supposedly the soviets had satellites beaming us all into submission.

Parkinson's examples of boardroom behavior and decision making, or lack thereof, are extraordinarily and frighteningly accurate. I found it amazingly funny, easy to read and retain, though a bit dated given the time which has elapsed since it was originally published. On a personal note, this was one of the first books that my father gave me to read in preparation for life. Also included in my father's reading list for life were The Peter Principle, Yes, Minister, and Aristotelian Ethics.

I was emediatly impressed with the intensity of what seemed like every single track on the cd. The guitar is crunching and does not repeat too much. This leads to one of the really great qualities of nonpoint, which is their rhythm changes. These rhythm changes are what makes this cd so great, mostly because, without them this cd would probably [not be any good]. besides the crunching guitars, he can also really play, ripping out some impressive solos. the drums are remenicent of the great vinnie paul. The whole sound on this cd is like SNOT with really soothing vocals in the middle of almost every song."},{"rating":"1","title":".....","review":"Its no that nonpoint are a bad band or untalented, but its just that there is absolutly nothing new here.

Right! The exact same thing I've heard over and over again from faceless new metal bands that will be on where are they now by 2004. This CD is no exception. Nonpoint are not unique in any way.

I was really looking forward to hear more songs by them. But then came the day that I bought it, and I regret wasting my money. Don't get me wrong...the music isn't bad... just the decision they made on their style. It was good for one of their songs...but not all of them. Every single song sounded like the previous one...and I think I would have liked it a lot better it there was a differentiallity in the tracks. So...if you want a cd that will have the exact (literally speaking) sound in every track...then this is the Cd for you. But if you are sane and you want some diversity in your music...then don't waste your money on this. It's like spending [money] on a Cd made entirely of numerous wanna-be \\"What a Day\\" songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine RATM with NP's vocalist... can you say \\"w00tastic\\"?","review":"I got this CD after hearing Tribute, and I must say it is worth a lot more than the 12 bucks I paid. The vocalist sounds good when loud and soft and the lyrics are great and sometimes even catchy. The music is heavy, but never repetitive or irritating and is quite innovative, especially in DoubleStakked. It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because there aren't any truly amazing tracks, and all but DoubleStakked and Tribute use the same format, but there's really no bad songs. It's a shame that Rage Against The Machine never got the chance to hear this, because they could have learned a lot, such as the fact that a good vocalist and good lyrics are important. I'll definitely be hearing future works by Nonpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonpoint is what new matal is all about!!","review":"I have to say i heard Nonpoint recently at Ozzfest and then the next day i went and saw them at St. Andrews and both day i was astonised at their music ability.

Just like the band insolence many people will not give this record a chance just because its r apcore but people should give it a chance. T his cd ha s everything a good rapcore cd should have, melody, hardcore screaming, and it is quite light on the rapping. This is more of a straight up nu-metal cd rather than a rapcore one.

Which means that part of the cup is resting ON your ear which makes the aforementioned tightness even worse. I don't have huge ears by any stretch. Finally, the bass on the 205's was nowhere near as good as the 202's. I just returned the 205's and decided I'll just order another pair of 202's..

Also you may find them a bit tight at first, but within a few minutes it was fine. Now though, the headphones are acting up. Sound quality is basically gone. I had these since March of 2010 and had no problems until today (June 9th 2010). This is how I found out.

Of course, he has written some really dreadful stuff too, so this recommendation comes from someone who is a critic as well as a fan. Kingsbury's parody & refutation of the ideas in the Foundation Trilogy is also fun. However in End of Eternity & Foundation's Edge Asimov himself criticized & refuted those ideas.

It was very frustrating to use. First off, it's very hard to use if you are just placing it on the ground. Although it's hard to tell from the picture, it's got an L shaped base that's meant to mount on a bench. If you use it on the floor, the cutting surface is at an angle. Also, I found I frequently ended up cutting into the plastic of the box. The wallbase I was using was too tall to fit in the box upright, so I had to do the 45 degree cuts using face cuts. The saw would really squeek on these cuts. I ended up buying a better Craftsman miter saw, and only wish I'd done so sooner.This miter box might be alright if you just have to do a few cuts and want to save money, but if you have to do any significant amount of money, save yourself the frustration and spend your money on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost completely useless","review":"Too small to use for tall baseboard or crown molding. The plastic bends during sawing and the saw cuts into the plastic. The saw is so short that you can only move it back and forth about 2 cm, so each cut takes forever to make. This is a total piece of trash, and will just cause you to go out and spend more money on something that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic junk","review":"Pins would not even hold 1/4\\" thick Baseboard trimm.

The saw, when fully inserted into the slots, can still tilt on multiples axes, so your cut ends up being as straight as you hold it. Also there's a lot of play in the plastic itself--it bends.It doesn't sit on a flat surface. The plastic cuts. The saw is what you would expect of a freebie thrown in. A disappointment in every respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise. So much disappointment.","review":"I was very happy to find this combo since it was exactly what I needed. However, it is almost unusable since the thin plastic moves around so much while sawing. Saw does not seem to bite well either. Took surprising effort to saw through quarter round stock. A lot of thoughtful touches went into this which makes it all the more disappointing that the execution is so bad. Returning for something of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, poorly designed miter box","review":"The saw that the miter box comes with is a decent handsaw, but the miter box itself is useless. The edges of the box bend when you are sawing. There are wide grooves in the bottom of the box that seem to be meant to prevent the saw from wrecking the bottom, however they cause splintering in the wood. The guide holes are too wide, allowing the saw to wobble. Moreover, the saw is too short for the width of the box, so 45 degree cuts are very difficult. The lip on the bottom make it impossible to use the box unless it is placed on the edge of a bench, but even then it is unsteady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...","review":"It is cheap, not worth any kind of money.

It's a cheap product and it shows when using it. The plastic body of the mitre box is quite mediocre and flimsy. The saw is serviceable, but I've had mitre saws in the past that worked much better than this. The clamps are pretty worthless. I recommend paying more for a better combo. I'm surprised at the drop in quality of these Stanley tools, but they are being manufactured in Asia these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars for junk","review":"I used to buy Stanley stuff for years but the fact they had the Chinese stamp/mold \\"STANLEY\\" on a worthless POS miter box like this one makes me pause on buying anything else from them.

Im sorry to say, it's weird. And I've never written a review of any book before so I don't mean to be rude, but these stories are just way too abstract and so far from the point. Most of them don't even tell what happen in the relationship but rather what happened in the girls mind. There are a couple worth reading but you could just thumb through it on the shelf. If you're looking for a good cry or laugh, this book won't give it to you. This book is simply filled with a lot trying to be too good writers instead of just telling what happened with the realtionship.

This book will help you become more aware of nature, as did the several courses I took at Brown's school in the early '80s, but I have since become very skeptical of much of what Brown has said and written.

I am a lot more satisfied with Soul Caddy, because it comes with a very wide variety of songs from punk rock (Irish Whiskey, God Is a Spider) through classic swingers, (So Long, Toots!, Big Swing) a tender love song (Saddest Thing I Know) rock & roll (Diamond Light Boogie) to an even metal-like song with very negative lyrics (Bleeding Ceremony).

I suggest you to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth It!","review":"Well, my fiance bought me Soul Caddy after I raved about Zoot Siut Riot, and it was well worth his money!

Steve's lyrics are great :) He is truly an incredible songwriter.... The songs all hit me in a different way, all associate with some aspect of life. Even if you were a swing fan and live for their swing stuff, you will find something in this cd that will (hopefully) open you to the rest of thier songs.

The game is very buggy and there is nothing intuitive about the controls. You are only allowed one character per server, and the servers have a limited number of people allowed on at one time.

It centers on porn stars and the porn industry, and the people profiled are most vapid and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's inability to make note of their deficient qualities and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; however, as Sheehan appears incapable of judging anything or anybody which is indicative of many an academic nowadays. These types concentrate on being \\"tolerant\\" and \\"non-judgmental\\" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else.

As for the movie itself, it's pretty good, aside from taking some minor liberties with the historical record. Inadvertently it's also quite revealing in regard to what American cultural attitudes were like in the era when this picture was made (1940).

Finally I figured it out! There is a lot of dialog in this book. The characters throughout all spoke with such eloquence and grace, something that they all should not have considering their ages and backgrounds. This really bothered me, even Chase said things that were not appropriate for a 17 year old boy living in the mountains. Godwin did use some nice imagery, however, and I found myself reading to find this type of language, not to get into the story and plot which was rather flat, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Godwin has written a treasure of a novel. She writes hauntingly of the struggles of everyday life, marriage, family, career and most profoundly, of God. Her theological musings are food for thought and bear revisiting time and again.

How often do we find a novel about the efforts of several characters to be good people, and do good in the world? \\"Pastor Margaret\\"--intelligent and attractive yet down-to earth--is an extraordinary woman I would love to meet. This book is not perfect. The boy Chase does not ring true, Grace is too weird, and the plot seems contrived in places, especially the fire in the church.

The author keeps referring to the next millenium in a foreboding tone, but at the end, in regard to that particular story line, I was left with a feeling of \\"so what?\\" Too many unlikely happenings, too many deep dark secrets that are really neither, too many unbelievable characters: simply, too much of too much.

The characters are very thin. You begin to dislike Margaret, because she can love someone so unappealing in personality as Adrian. No child as disturbed as Chase can suddenly become so engaging. The plot twists are too easy to foretell. If you are a Jan Karon fan, you won't be disappointed--romance, church happenings, orphans, and the expected return of a long lost parent in a small North Carolina mountain town. Sound too familiar?

In \\"Evensong,\\" Godwin seems to struggle too hard with her narrative and characters in an obstructive, over-written, authorial self-consciousness.I shall remain a Godwin fan, however. Out of her imagination, or her unconscious,(?) arise some secondary, wonderfully, obnoxious female characters, which she kills off, or does she integrate them?

With one exception, the tools are quality pieces that are set in a nice case using quality foam (not the cheap large celled foam).The pin remover (the blue device on the left in the photo) is not of great quality. It works, but I doubt it will last as long as the rest of the kit. On one of the watches, the pin remover started to flex before I was able to get the pin out. In this situation, you'll have to tap the pin out using the hammer and pin setter or buy a better quality pin remover (which I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Repair Kit","review":"I paid $36 for this product.

The threads on the pin pusher look like a five-year old's toy. They are exceedingly coarse and sloppy loose. It is possible to remove a pin from a watch with this tool, but a thumbtack with a small point would likely be better. A single turn of the knob moves the pin-pusher about 1/2 inch. Shame on whoever built this and on whoever is selling it! The pin pusher itself wobbles around like spaghetti in a high breeze. There is no way to lock the watch band in place and why in the world there is a stage to move the band beats me--it's about as useful as a mesh gas can. If you're absolutely desperate then buy this--it is possible to use it to remove a pin from a watch link if you've got lots of time, patience, steady hands, and eagle eyes. Otherwise, keep looking--one of the other tools has to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"James","review":"I bought this item to remove some links from a Tag Heurer watch.

John Hammond is a great blues guitarist, and a very good singer.Didn't they listen to this CD before they released it?Except for the passing novelty of hearing some of Tom's (deliberately) incomprehensible growling translated into english, this disc has very little to offer.You know that sensation you get when you hear a really great song performed as elevator music?Bingo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your cash and buy the originals","review":"I bought this CD fully expecting to really enjoy this since I love Tom Waits's music and I enjoy John Hammond's guitar playing.

The songs have a dark, smoky, (even spooky) late-night feeling. Hammond's delivery wisely doesn't try to imitate Waits' distinctive vocal style, and he makes these songs his own. This is the kind of performance you rarely find with cover material - Hammond not only plays these songs, he inhabits them. There are no weak tracks, although I have my favorites: 'Heart Attack and Vine', with those wonderful guitars lurking in the dark; '16 Shells...', where Hammond's vocals somehow conjure up a slow hip-hop groove (to my ear, at least); the gritty gospel-blues of 'I Know I've Been Changed'. This is highly recommended stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"What a loaded CD. Every track cracks with a rumblin', gutsy sound that hasn't been heard anywhere for quite some time . . . it's perfectly produced, and wonderfully and extraordinarily infectious.

Having recieved the book, I wish I never bought it. To start with 2/3 of the book is about java, optimisation, a poor section on JDBC and some networking stuff that you can find anywhere else. The remaining of the book is a general discussion of Java and the last chapter (Ch 15) is about a simple 3d engine (jist 3D)which is pretty incomplete. The book has many incomplete code snippets and no games in sight which is surprising when the authors have been around the game development forums for such a long time.The book seems to be a poor attempt in discussing games development in Java. More like an attempt to cash in the market demand.If you are buying this book to learn about Java and 3D, then there are better books such as -Developing Games in Java- by Brackeen which has good explanations about various aspect of game development in java.My advice is that dont waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also found it disappointing","review":"I also found this book to be disappointing. I would also agree that the author sees it necessary to discuss the techniques involved rather than talk about a technique and then present the code for that technique.I bought this book on the basis that it was going to be \\"practical\\" programming, i.e techniques and code, but all i found was a long winded discussion on the topic. The author does show that he has a great knowledge of java game programming but it is poorly presented to the intermediate java programmer, and not recommendable to beginners.Do not buy this book if you think your going to be getting involved with code, rather, buy it if you do not know what techniques are used in java game programming, and wish to hear a discussion on those techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, if uninspiring","review":"This is not what you'd call a highly literary work.

Basically, you're supposed to yell things like \\"ka-pow\\" and \\"BAM\\" every third sentence or so until you've recaptured your comic-reading childhood, or possibly run out of recognizable sound effects and are confusing people on the subway by shouting things like \\"krkrkROW\\" a \\"bzzRANG\\" every 30 seconds.If the previous paragraph made you laugh or recall specific examples, buy this book.

It is incredibly addictive and will bring hours of gameplay. However, it cannot be streesed enough that this is not an easy-going game. Never in my entire life of bloody shooters have I seen a game so deserving of the rating of MA. It shows certain simularities with Rise of The Triad and Dark Wars with its gory humor (severed heads can be kicked, mimes destroyed). Compared to other titles of its era, such as doom, rott, and duke3d, it has at least twice the amount of violence of all three put together.

It has several sections - including a classical translation and a modern commentary for the main body and each of the moving lines, a character genealogy interpretation for each of the 64 hexagrams, and a poem for each of the hexagrams. Invariably, one of the sections for my specific reading will speak directly to me. I am continually impressed with its accessibility and most impressed with the poems by Zhao Xiaomin, who obviously has his fingers on the pulse of the I Ching. I am surprised it is out of print.

I didn't recall learning about this bit of history, and now I will look further. The word \\"schmaltz\\" comes up in at least one other review (one of the higher rated ones from 2004), and I agree there was too much of it.

Based on a real-life story of Capt. Ted Lawson, and is considered very accurate. Lawson lost his leg after crash landing in China. Went on to fly P-51's after the war.

It's a real piece of history -- The Doolittle raid on Japan using B25s from the carrier Hornet.These are the films that were on early TV when I was a young boy in the 1950s. By today's standards, it's not a violent film.It is a tribute to a group of men who went on what could have been a one-way mission to strike the first blow at the Japanese Islands -- shattering the island nation's feeling of being untouchable. It also shows the bond between the people of China and US Airmen -- and the risks they took to aid US aircrews.Most people have never seen a B25. It had 2 engines and a crew of five. It's payload was light; and with the extra gasoline they had to carry, their bomb load was reduced. The B25 is a very cramped space -- and it's difficult to appreciate how cramped it is from a film. There are still a few flying today -- maintained by those who appreciate these machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring Tale of True-Life Heroes","review":"There's no question the film is framed in a very straightforward, literal way, and that the characters are somewhat hokey All-American stereotypes.But I think to dismiss the film as simplistic is mistaken. Soon-to-be-Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo includes some deft concepts of collective responsibility and moral tension, including not just the passage on civilian casualties, but also the exchange where the soldiers agree that that they don't hate the Japanese people.I would also recommend this disc for the special features -- a great short on bad movie etiquette, a vintage cartoon about a bear air raid warden, and a superb 15 minute documentary on the loss of the SS Normandie."},{"rating":"2","title":"thirty seconds over tokyo","review":"wonderful movie arrived very quickly and in good condition will diffently purchase other movies in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic classic World War II movie","review":"This is a classic World War II movie that continues where the real classic movie Air Force leaves off.

The soloist ego is sent packing and each part and solo is honed to fit the tune. The result is fun, exciting and refreshing- unlike any recent fusion recording.

If you have an interest in Latin American (especially Mexican) politics or economics, this is the story straight from the horse's mouth. The book is also valuable because, unlike North American and European politicians, Latin Americans tend not to write their autobiographies/memoirs and tell their stories themselves, so one is always left with so many questions about their decisions and their actions.

Meditation, be it Jewish or of any other denomination, requires more than just a few guidelines to avoid falling into the klippah of pride, distraction, guilt, and doubt. To place Avram Davis at the same level of Kierkergaard, Schopenhauer, or Spinoza is truly out of reality in terms of understanding the profound philosophy upon which Jewish Mysticism is grounded. This book is less than a \\"Chicken Soup of Jewish Mysticism!\\" If the purpose is to get a basic, good understanding of what Jewish Mysticism is all about, try Gershom Scholem, and from there move to others.

And now he's on the next \\"Amazing Mazes\\" book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Book of Mazes","review":"I got this book today and my 3 (almost 4 year old) son finished the whole book (80 pages) in one day! He LOVED it! It looked a bit easy at first but I thought it might be more of a challenge as he went along. I guess he was more advanced than I realized and my only regret is how quickly the money was used up. I'm planning on purchasing the next maze book in the series. On a side note, this was my first Kumon purchase and although they are more pricey than books without color, I think they will be worth it for certain activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Marvelous Mazes","review":"This book is pegged for children ages 3 - 5, and that seems about right. My three year old son had a blast working these delightful (and sometimes challenging) mazes. There are 80 mazes in the book, and there is a certificate of achievement at the back of the book.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age Appropriate -- He loved it.","review":"The book itself is paperback but it's a hard paperback so it's able to withstand a little more punishment from icky fingers. The mazes are age appropriate, our four year old nephew was the receipent. He's a maze lover and this book is full of mazes galore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"We got the Upper Case Letters book first and the kids really seemed to enjoy going the work. They really love doing this book. It's more like play then school work for them. Our \\"I can't do it\\" 4 year old doesn't want to put it away! The progressive hardness of the mazes is so gradual the kids don't have trouble transitioning through it. The patterns, colors and characters are VERY kid friendly and easy on the eyes. The whole Kumon system really has me impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like old school horror buy this.","review":"This is an old school horror movie that I saw on HBO as a kid. I paid a pretty penny for it on amazon, but it was worth it. Great stories, good acting, good horror. This is back when people use to put effort into there movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror in life!!!!","review":"When I first heard about this movie, I was wondering about the concept of the film. When I saw this in theaters, I came away very, very pleased. This was a different take on the horror genre. I saw it as the Horror of living life!!! The stories were thought provoking, but Clarence Williams IMHO stole the movie with his \\"the stuff\\"!!! The movie will make you think. Think about your life, and how to change it if you are doing wrong, or being wronged.A must have in your DVD collection!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was a classic when it came out.","review":"Four stories inside of the story. Clarence Williams III is great, no other actor in the world could have played that part better than him.This movies has real-life truthes that wll make you think. and after you watch it you'll want to own it.Who is Mr. Simms? I love this movie. One of my top 10 horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great funny twist of a horror movie!","review":"A four story movie filled with racism, abuse, police brutality and violence in a super natural twist.

I consider this to be a true classic horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"A primer on what's wrong with contemporary American fiction. Okay, you're from the South, but that doesn't make you a good writer. All surface, prose pyrotechnics and slick phraseology...no real characters, story, plot or substance. Reads like a compendium of the worst of college grad student family blues MFA program pap. Faulkner, Hemingway, John O'Hara, Cheever, Flannery O'Conner...even contemporaries like T. Coraghessen Boyle outshine this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Collection of Southern Stories to Miss","review":"As a former fiction writing student of Mr. Phillips, this book gives me new insight to his often repeated words of wisdom, \\"Write what you know.\\" I must agree with another reviewer who said that these stories might be more enjoyable if read seperately, grouped together they provide us with sense of dread and a complete picture of the inescapable life of Richard. Most of the stories were printed seperately at first as short stories in magazines and they lose something if read in chronological order.Still, My People's Waltz showcases the extraordinary talent of Dale Phillips and his slant on the Southern fiction writer. The stories each draw you into to the characters' lives and force you to care for them, while the sad humor attempts to lighten the underlying message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haw River Genius","review":"Dale's book, from the word go, is astonishing. His control of of craft is clear. By this, I mean that he understands character's nuance, plot's highs and lows, Bill Harrison's \\"what is obligatory,\\" and, most of all, the holy necessity of knowing what is holy. Here, find selves with hands thrown from windows on the way to the outer banks. Find crooks and painters and would be horse shoe throwers. And find yourself, caught up in the dazzle of brilliant fiction. Buy this book. Or I'm out now, looking for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My hubby has always been a CARDS fan and never owned slippers! :)","review":"Seemed like a no brainer, and he wears them and he likes them!!!!They are comfy and they run a little large, but great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd","review":"This is the best cd that The Keynotes ever made, God truly whispered in their ears and gave them the best songs and lyrics to be recorded and these songs will capture your whole heart and capture your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Quality Fine","review":"I bought my copy of this set through Amazon on Dec. 7, 2006, and it is fine. I have no problems with wow or focus, and my equipment is also quite good. I think this is a highly recommendable set, taking both performance and sound into consideration. The tempos are on the relaxed side, but everything is beautifully balanced, executed, and miked. The packaging is also attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this pressing","review":"I have Sanderling's other set of Brahms and like it very much. This one has wow and is very much out-of-focus. Very disappointing. (My equipment is first-class.) I'd like to hear from someone who has a clean copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, sticky pages","review":"Excellent book, but came with several pages stuck together which, needless to say, ended up damaging the book as soon as I tried to separate them. Other than that, pretty good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable banal plot","review":"The love interest is so thin, so predictable. The plot is too implausible: it's so easy to find the bad guy, but so hard to eliminate him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear","review":"Bad movie about bad movies, made by bad people from an unfortunate time in underground film. Enough with the glorification of the losers around Warhol's 'Factory'. An inch deep by a mile wide unfunny misogyny. Knowing you're unfunny doesn't make it alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had this book for a minute.... put it down.. and picked it up","review":"I am so happy that i decided to finish this book. I started it about a year and a half ago. Moved and misplaced it. I found it about 3 months ago but I had started reading other books and after reading a dissapointing book recently (won't say any names lol ) I decided to give it a chance.This book was good. I was surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starter Game for 3-4 year olds.","review":"I got this for my daughter for Christmas who just turned four in November. Overall I was hesitant about buying the leapster 2 and a game I am not into giving children video games so young. However, I needed something that could keep her entertained at Church until the Children would go down for the Children service. The game itself offers five differant games there is only one that she can't quite get the hang of yet. I think as she grows though she will learn that one also. She loves the game where she gets to cook the recipes shes earned and enjoys \\"cracking\\" the eggs. Its a fun game but not so over the top that she vegetates with it all day which was my concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"leapster games","review":"I don't play this game myself - My child with autism has many of the cartridges for this game and likes them all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is a greast game for the leapster.

This particular game has allot of educational value to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest of Horrors","review":"Sarrantonio is a fine horror writer. This collection of his best short stories is excellent. Take a dash of Bradbury, a little Charles Addams, and blend with Sarrantonio and you have a great moody and haunting blend. This is one to read on a crisp October evening with a cup of apple cider at hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and satisfying","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. A good short story is like a miniature masterpiece, without a word out of place. This collection is chock-full of them. The story-within-a-story that binds them all together is imaginative. I also felt that all the stories were unique, not merely a rehashing of someone else's ideas. Each story kept me guessing, the way good horror should. The prose is clean but lyrical. I highly recommend this compilation if goosebumps are what you crave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment For This Fan of His Novels","review":"I am always happy to locate an Al Sarrantonio book. I have truly enjoyed his novels. This is his first collection of short fiction. I had to read it right away, but I wound up being disappointed.Short horror fiction is often far mor intense than horror novels, but that is not the case with this collection. At best the stories are odd. Usually they are just dull. I found myself reading the stories in hopes of finding the gem in the collection. There was none. This was very odd as I could relate to many of the characters.All in all I have to say that fans of his novels may want to pass this collection by as the stories within bear little resemblance to his longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak don't waste your money.","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. Definitely not worth the effort to read it. the best stories in this book are sub par at best. Just read a stephen King book you have not read yet if you want a read a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT waterproof!!!","review":"My daughter lovs music and received this as a birthday gift.

We are still trying to dry it out, hoping to revive it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Nights","review":"This is a very entertaining book but the editing was quite poor. The author is very clever, but he has set up some impossible situations i.e., one side will have 17 pieces, etc. In the first 11 problems, I found four such mistakes. It may be that this has been discovered by the author or publisher, and the book is out of print for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice powder","review":"THe product arrived exactly as explained and has a very nice aroma.

It lacks any detailed maps, and doesn't contain a subway map. It also doesn't have any photos which would have been nice. It does however, offer the lowdown on how things really are and makes for an interesting read.

Tried the Blue one more time with the same result. Google \\"blue dog food diarhhea\\" and you'll see that this is not an isolated incident.

Not one of the programs in this book would actually work on a CNC machine. Plenty of codes are missing or misrepresented. Where is tapping...Hello??? There are plenty of CNC simulators for free on the internet that take proper cycles, even subprograms and macros.Valentino's book is far better. Smid's book is great.

Implausible even if it did reflect reality in China, which it does not. There is a real danger that because it so blatantly mis-represents the reality of orphans, Christians, and the Chinese government, that some will conclude that the well-documented persecution of Christians is also a fairy tale.

I liked the positive view it gives of adoption. I may even add it to my collection (I watched it as a rental). However, the production values were low, and the acting wasn't very good. The plot details were not very true to reality in China. The Chinese do face terrible persecution, but this story was not very believable. Some of the situations in the movie are a bit confusing.

I spent a great deal of time in Paris and this book was absolutely indispensable. On the inside covers are maps of the Metro system and the greater-Paris area RER (train) system, so you can peek in the book while you're on the metro or train without looking like a confused tourist. The book itself has an index of all Paris streets and major buildings, which leads you to a section of maps broken down \\"par arrondissement\\" (by district). The book is compact enough to fit in a small purse (and is sturdily bound so you can toss it in), but contains a wealth of information. To top it off, the color scheme is attractive and the typesetting is top-notch. This guide is the ultimate - it's useful when you're there, it'll be beautiful on a bookshelf when you come home. If you buy a fold-out map or something other than this guide, you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"The maps in this book have very small print.

They are never dull. Instead of emphasizing dates and facts, they explore the motivations of these people who left the comforts of England for a forsaken wilderness with grim survival prospects.The Colliers have a clear understanding of the Puritan theology and worldview.However, they seem to assume that the Puritan worldviews on the sovreignity of God and man's sinful state were unique to their times.This is a great readable history for fourth grade through adults.Note: This is part of the Drama of American History serieswhich begins with exploration of the New World through modern times. The Colliers have many books to their credit. James Lincoln Collier is best known for his award winning juvenilefiction title, My Brother Sam is Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I originally looked at this book because it had information on something that I was interested in -- propagation. However, I am now a little bit wiser.The reason this book is disappointing to me is only 1/3 is related to general care of cacti. The other 2/3's of the book focuses on common species of cacti and how to take care of that particular species. I also find this to be inaccurate, because care of species also depends a lot on what type of environment you put them in. My recommendation is if you are looking for a book on how to care for cacti, look a little bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Strings\\" a two-ballad wonder","review":"I bought this album out of loyalty to two songs Richard Rodgers wrote for this show, the title tune and the opening and closing song, \\"The Sweetest Sounds.\\" Both aregreat.

I don't know what happened to other reviewers--earwax in their iPods?-- but take their idea of \\"No Strings\\" as a great Rodgers score with a BIG grain of salt. Most of the other songs are completely forgetable (following Hammerstein's death Rodgers may have thought he could compose the noodly sort of lyrics that his partner was cranking out toward the end of HIS career, but Mr. Rodgers was, in this case, wrong. Some of Hammerstein's later simplicity actually gets by [\\"My Favorite Things\\" from \\"SofM\\" is an example], but Rodgers' own \\"comic\\" or light lyrics STINK).

Jim Hutton went on to make the Ellery Queen Mystery series for TV.The video quality of the DVD is not good. It looks like it was made from an old VHS video tape.

The retractable iPod tray is especially cool. The sound quality is good and will fill a 20x15 kitchen with nice full sound. The only negative is that the iHome has very limited control over your iPod. The unit controls the volume and will skip to the next/previous song, but that is all. If you want to change Playlists, or search for a specific song/artist, you have to do it on the iPod itself.

Reviewer Anthony Leigh said it quite well: \\"This unit will only pick up 4 of the strongest FM signals, none of which are stations I normally listen to.\\" So after a few months of fiddling with the antenna, I am going to remove the device and give it away. It's just taking up space at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to cooking PodCasts while cooking","review":"I love iHome IH36W.I've been searching for a solution for my iPod, and finally found one. I initially looked for an under-counter radio for my wife to entertain her while cooking. Then I found this. It's a great way to listen to PodCast while working or sitting in the kitchen. It sounds pretty good, charges the iPod while playing it, and have a decent FM tuner.The few minor gripes I have with it are:- it's bit conspicuous, thicker than most under-counter radios- when docked inside, the iPod audio has a clicking sound (amplified harddrive noise)- There is not much iPod control on the front panel.- there is no wi-fi to download the PodCast :)Installation was fairly straight-forward but you do need a power drill and 1/4 drill bit to get the job done.Overall, I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I'm looking forward to years of podcast listening pleasure from this little radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound!","review":"I picked this up expecting to take it back because I didn't think the sound quality would be very good. I was surpirsedto find out (maybe I didn't read the box) that it also has radio, TV, and weather stations. Neat!!The sound is AMAZING! Is this what those Bose radios sound like? They call the technology Reson8. I call it great! It sounds as good as my big stereo, but fits under the cabinet. I haven't installed it there yet. I'm worried about screwing into the wood.

The radio antenna is not the best- I have to find the sweet spot and keep it just right. However, once it's just right the stations I frequently listen to come in clear.I considered getting a sony brand without the ipod function because I was originally worried about the sound quality from this unknown brand.

But the reliability is awful. I bought it for my husband and he has had it nearly five years and in that time it has had two major failures. On both occaisions at least 3 functions completely packed up and the sync between digital and analogue became distorted. The first time it was supposedly under international warranty but I ended up paying for a replacement (at cost) of the internal unit. The second time I've been billed GBP 142.00 with a statement that the warranty wasn't valid. It was bought an an approved outlet and repaired the first time at one so I'm a bit miffed. Even if I could have made my case more convincingly to Tissot on the warranty (too busy to bother) I'm disappointed overall with the product. To fail once might be considered unluckly but to fail twice suggests a poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Please consider the following before purchasing. I purchased this watch from Watchgrabber on Amazon, and after 4 months the watch began having significant problems. For example, the digital display stopped working, the hands no longer responded to the touch function, and after a few days stopped altogether. Now perhaps I should have realized, but there is NO Warranty if you purchase this online (usually). Therefore, there is a definite possibility that you'll have an issue with your watch and not have it covered. I have been quoted at 210.00$ for repair...Awesome. Hopefully, my watch was just a lemon and the product is normally high quality. Nevertheless, I recommend getting some sort of warranty on this, before buying. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T EXPECT IT TO LAST","review":"Mine lasted all of 30 months. Was repaired in the first 12 months under the warranty and then died again after 30 months.

Maybe it's because I've read others that are far better: The Visual Handbook to Building and Remodeling, by Charles Wing, and Building An Affordable Home, by Ruiz. Both these books contain far more specific info. Building on a Shoestring includes such priceless advice as: \\"comparison shop.\\" \\"The more bells and whistles you opt for, the more you'll pay.\\" Even when info. is good, it's too vague, like \\"limit the amount of plumbing pipe you have to lay.\\" How?

Marlitt, who seems to have been forgotten in the 21st century, but who was a good writer of romance novels with social commentary woven in. This book is the story of a German factory owner who comes into an unexpected inheritance and finds love, the joy of the simple life, and quite a bit of rural conservatism and social snobbery, at the end of the 19th century in Germany. The characters are interesting--for example, the bailiff is used as the personification of the resistance to the change in the membership of the social elite from those having no real employment to those who own a factory or are otherwise employed. A very pleasant read, with some beautifully descriptive language about weather and nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke","review":"I was very happy with this product until it inexplicably stopped working 3 months after the 90 day warranty ran out.

This unit often causes my iPod to freeze up, one of the speakers has stopped working, and I never know if the alarm will actually play from my iPod or just beep.

She witnesses an attack on a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) outside Terry's bedroom window, but he agrees to report it to the police as if he saw it so that their relationship will remain secret. His story (and the film's) begins to fall apart until eventually he is on the run for crimes he didn't commit.With \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" writer/director Curtis Hanson would later show that he is capable of crafting top-flight film fare, but he just doesn't make it here. The script is too far-fetched and the character's actions become increasingly implausible until the over-wrought, unconvincing conclusion. The decidedly low wattage of stars Guttenberg and McGovern doesn't help either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with their service!","review":"The movie came on time and in good shape.

It was hands down my favorite book as a child and I believe that the moral in it helped build a moral character into me. I never saw any violence in the story, just thought that when you said the magic words you fell asleep - magically. I am 21 now and still have a soft spot for the story, and will likely read it to my own children someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesom book","review":"Awesome book.

This is one of the coolest coffee table books I've seen. Coulter has an amazing eye reminiscent of fashion giant Terry Richardson. And yet his style remains his own. His shots are hot, edgy, gritty, fresh-his angles, backdrops, colors, props. Each spread brings something new, yet maintains the Coulter stamp. Some represent strong heroines in charge of their sexuality, others depict vunerable lolitas. Are they being exploited? Or do they like it? Yeah- they like it. My favorite spread is the one at the Maklaryn-those are so cool, worthy of any Euro fashion mag.

In addition to having 2 songs from 2 previous releses, this contains a demo for their upcoming album, \\"Emergency and I\\". Now, unfortunately, this particular title is out of print. However, the new one is coming out really soon and the stuff i've already heard is magnificent, combining drum machine technology, jangly guitar melodies and beautiful vocal harmonies.

It includes favorites like \\"Hold 'Em Yale\\" and \\"Jack 'O Hearts,\\" as well as some more rare tales including an early Runyon piece where a prototype of Runyon's typically uninvolved narrator actually plays a crucial role in the storyline. The stories within and the excellent introduction (which sheds much more light on the author's life than any other Runyon collection) make this both a perfect introduction to Runyon's Broadway or an excellent addition to a collection. Damon Runyon is often forgetten when the time comes to list the great American writers of the 20th century. His unique style of prose is truly entertaining, and he evokes any emotion from the reader at will (\\"Little Miss Marker\\", for example will force you through the whole spectrum of emotion).

On this album, Marques explores his emotional and sexual side throughout the album's 11-tracks. From the slow burning feel of Sex With You to the pure honesty of Everything, Marques offers up everything we've come to expect on a typical R&B release. Listening to this this album seems like it may be an attempt to outgrow his reputation as a R&B pin-up boy. By titling his album, \\"Naked\\", Marques is coming off more as an Usher/R. Kelly lothario. I give this album just 4 stars because it's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"SINCE YOU'RE NAKED....YOU MAY WANT TO MODEL....","review":"Since you want to be naked....you may want to get into modeling cause you obviousaly are out of musical talent.

First and formost that Naked video was an absolut blantant knockoff which is probably the only reason why this immature I'm trying to showcase my growth as an artist song is even getting spins. If you want to show some growth first of all come with something original and stop trying to copy everyone else. Copying everyone will not keep you relivent very long.

Definitely the best R&B album from a male for the year 2005 (for now), it has it's twist and turns. The album starts out with the hit \\"All Becuase of You\\" (not to be confused with \\"Because of You\\", released of the MH album.) From here, the album takes a rather \\"R&B'd\\" turn. With songs like \\"Sex With You\\" and \\"Marriage\\", both lyrically unstable, but vocally efficient, you feel alot more sexy with Naked than MH. The song \\"Naked\\" is obviously THE best song off the album. I also took note of \\"I Wasn't Ready\\" and \\"Cheat\\". But to the real point.... MH SOUNDS REALLY CLOSE TO MJ. That's right the king of pop Michael Jackson. Listen to songs like \\"Something Else\\" and tell me you can't hear MJ in it- I bet you can't. Either way, this album is a good sophomore effort from good ol' MH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual, Seductive, Romantic","review":"The way this guy sounds is so sexy.

Don't get me wrong, I like slow jams if they have substance and meaning to them. These do not. It is sex this, sex that. Just too repetitive.

I read 2 of his books Ham on Rye and Post office. I really enjoyed them. I had great appreciation for the writing style and the stories. However, this book threw me a little. It just seemed to drag and the same things kept happening; old ugly man meets really hot young girl. They screw, fight and break up. The first couple of times were interesting then it just got tired. You really didn't need 200+ pages for that sort of plot to keep happening. I have to say there was really nothing to take from this book except an old dirty alcoholic womanizer. The shock factor was gone after the first 100 pages. So I say give it a read if you want but I wouldn't say it was anything to compare to the first 2 books I have read from Bukowski."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was Terrible","review":"I can't express my disapointment strongly enough.

It is true Bukowski on every page, easy to read and direct. It is one of those classic works that shows each and every one of us how dirty, depraved and perverted this world truly is, which is why I will always be a Charles Bukowski fan. He holds nothing back and refuses to censor the truths of the world to comfort those that are easily offended or upset. The critics who always lurk and downgrade Bukowski are the same people who hate themselves for living in their own self made bubble.

Quite hilarious, although, you need to have a stomach for it, a good sense of humor, and be open minded. Did he repect or care about anything or anyone? I'm not sure he did, but that is what makes it so funny. Not recommended for the easily offended or today's politically correct. Why couldn't we have read this material in school?

I asked him what he saw in it. \\"I've been reading good books this summer, so I thought I'd read a sh---y book.\\" He couldn't have said it better. This is a study in depravity, endlessly repetitive and written in a sixth grader's prose. That this book is praised so universally on this site is a reflection of the sick society we live in. Try reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" a short, transparently clear book that celebrates what is best in human nature rather than what is worst. Isn't the point of life to make ourselves better persons? More sensitive, wiser, more loving? Bukowsky will take you in exactly the opposite direction. The difference between it and pornography is very slight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great one by the Buk","review":"While this book had some very funny moments, I'd hardly recommend anyone read it.

Women, by Bukowski, is perhaps the most engaging. I'm not going to say the best, as I've dabbled in some of the \\"great books,\\" but it drew me in, and as far as fiction's concerned, it's a winner.

The life that we can't possibly imagine. Most of us simply go through life without even a hint of Chinaksi (I'm convinced he is no different that Charles himself) in our lives. Those days that do have a little Bukowski in us we remember for eternity.In Women, Bukowski writes about a ugly old man who has gone unloved for too long. But a change comes over this lonely man as he begins more and more relationships with women. His irrational thought makes any real person laugh and smile. He speaks about them, with them, with a complete disregard for everything, except the reader. He knows how to make the common person laugh; at his incredible optimism, and his look on life. Chinaski may in fact be a lot like our shadow. Those of you who have seen Fight Club, might know all about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bukowski was a real man","review":"I read this book by suggestion of my older sister. I thoroughly enjoyed it. In my opinion, Charles Bukowski is one of the few writers of his time period who was not afraid to tell it like it is. He talks about the harsh reality that we all face, without holding back. He does not strive to make the world a fantasyland in which everything is happy and wonderful. I am a woman, and I am not at all offended by this book...it is the sad truth that most men would love to live such an existence as he did. Bukowski admits to his feelings, and shares his deepest fears with the reader. No other author of the time had enough ..... to do that, and not many, even now, do. I am sorry that Charles Bukowski is dead...the day he died, we lost a great and honest man...I would have loved to have met him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Who'd Wanna be This Obvious","review":"\\"Hey, look at me, I'm Charles Bukowksi! I am the sleaziest man alive!\\" I actually like the man's writing, but this book is simply terrible. If you consider this novel \\"telling it like it is,\\" you are a pathetic old man. To quote the great Isaac Brock on Bukowski, \\"Yeah, I know he's a pretty good read, but, God who'd wanna be such an as...le?\\" With this book he moves past the good read part and entirely into the latter description. Vulgarity alone does not make good writing or interesting reading. This book leaves all the sublety and humanity out.

C. Bukowski is one of the best writers of the century. When I read a book, the first sentence is very important for me. This very sentence invites you inside the book and you can see if you'd like it or not. The expression of the age and loneliness in the first sentence carried all the book. The book is really fantastic. Sometimes I felt \\"how couldn't I find these sentences to write, I felt this exactly before...\\" This book is a must for a reader, who wants to meet a writer beyond all form and literal rules. He really can tell, he knows the real love and how to live it, has no time for \\"construction\\". If he was alive, I am sure he had much more to write.

But what REALLY struck me about this book were the insights he suddenly obtained into his relationships with women. Been there, done that.Anyway, I was secretly racing through the book for its loose attitudes toward sex and women, then toward the end of the book a true denouement started to take place. I suddenly started underlining the book like crazy. I saw what he saw. He started to question why he was hurting so many people, and why he couldn't focus. Then he changed.

Rather than tall tales, these might be \\"broad\\" tales, as no one could get this drunk and this waylaid so consistently--yet it's all so funny you willingly follow the main character to back-alley bars, in and out of low-rent rooms, and anywhere a willing--and drinking--woman beckons him. True tasteless entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of novel","review":"I read this novel for a book club. It is a little too tedious for me with all the repetition - get drunk, get a girl, get laid, get rid of girl through manic behavior, etc. After a while, it become boring.

And he only had a chance to compose in his spare time. Still, he was a fine symphonist. Others may remind us that Borodin was one of \\"The Five\\" great Russian nineteenth-century composers (Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin, Balakirev, and Cui). I prefer to think of Borodin as member of a more exalted group, namely the ten great nineteenth-century European symphonists (Beethoven, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Berlioz, Borodin, and Berwald).This CD has a fine selection of Borodin's works: his impressive second symphony, the well-known \\"In the Steppes of Central Asia,\\" and orchestral excerpts from \\"Prince Igor,\\" including the famous Polovtsian Dances. The works are very well performed, and I certainly recommend this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to Borodin, but...","review":"...the truth is that once you listen to it once or twice, that's about enough.

This book got high marks from the other reviewers, but in my opinion the marks were for what it teaches about \\"work flow\\" and team work. If thats what you are looking for then great. I ranked this book based on its worth for teaching about the software.Overall it is verbose, wasted much valuable time and not a good teaching book (not to mention typhos). If you are looking to learn more about Dreamweaver or Fireworks or Flash or Freehand, this book is not for you. Better to spend the cash on dedicated books even though you may spend more in the end (but you will likely learn more thoroughly too). For me this book has not been a good investment of time and money.This book is probably better suited for those that are working as a team with the different skill sets and interested in figuring out how Studio MX can fit in as a tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I pre ordered this book as soon as it was listed expecting to get four nuts and bolts books in one. This book is more about project managing a website than it is about how to use the tools in Studio MX. There are 12 pages about the history of typography alone. And although I don't generally mind a few rough edges, this book clearly went to press before it's time. It is packed with annoying grammatical errors and bad typeset. In fact, immediately after a 2 page diatribe on the misuse of single quotes, there is a sentence that contains 5 double quotes. To my knowledge, they should always be used in pairs.It appears as though the authors set out to write a Studio MX bible in a short amount of time, and when they fell short on material, they resorted to writing about their life experiences instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Stewart:20th Century Masters-The Millennium Collection","review":"I am so glad I found this CD through Amazon.

It doesn't matter whether you think you have strongholds in your life or not, you will find this book a wonderful companion to your Bible.

This book is the cure. During seasons of \\"pruning\\" it is so important to have the Word to hold on to, but often it is hard to find that certain scripture.This book rides with me to work almost every day. When the day goes awry I take out the book and spend a few minutes during lunch praying through a few of the scripture prayer examples. They often take on new meaning during those times! I begin my afternoon refocused, comforted, and ready to face the truth.

In fact, it began with the Jews praying the psalms around the clock. It is called the Lectio Divina or the Divine Office. It has readings from the Bible for different hours of the day. It is meant to immerse us in God's word and move our heart into a rhythm of \\"praying without ceasing.\\"I am a convert to Catholicism from the brand of Protestantism that Ms. Moore participates in. I appreciate her ideas, but I find that nothing quite matches the beauty of praying the Divine Office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Beginners At Best","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is a pseudo faith message that lacked any fresh or revitalizing insight. Only for a beginner at best. Many christians are serious about deliverance and breaking strongholds, something this book seems remiss to address. If you like books that are superficial and shallow, this is the book for you. If you feel otherwise, look further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Prayer for Parents Who Are Busy","review":"Beth Moore's \\"Praying God's Word\\" is written for busy people who yearn for more intimacy with God, for a deeper and fuller spiritual life, yet are tied up in a life of knots. Moore helps us untie the knots with God's help through the Bible and through prayer. This book is for parents who are too busy to pray. You will find her written prayers a bit clumsy at first, then find joy in stepping along these well marked ancient paths back into the presence of the living God. For another book for busy parents on family spirituality, look into THE BUSY FAMILY'S GUIDE TO SPIRITUALITY (Crossroad, 2009The Busy Family's Guide to Spirituality: Practical Lessons for Modern Living From the Monastic Tradition)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is a wonderful book to use as a daily devotional or when you are trying to pray and don't know where to start. Beth Moore has done all the hard work of finding scriptures appropriate to what she refers to as \\"strongholds\\" - addiction, idolatry, unforgiveness, etc. She has written prayers from these scriptures in a sensitive and humble manner. So often when I am troubled, I don't have the patience to search scripture or come up with my own prayers. It is very comforting to have this book on my Kindle app to help me pray through the problem. I use the prayers about belief and idolatry as apart of my morning prayer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Was the Editor?","review":"This is a potentially useful book that is ruined by errors.

When newly widowed Allison Rhodes discovers a secret about her deceased husband, she turns to her longtime friend, Jase McGraw, for a place to re-group.While Jase is willing to let Allison stay as long as she needs to, he's more than a bit concerned over the effect she's having on his closely guarded heart and his resolve to not get involved with one woman.Life has a way of turning things around, however, and through a series of events, both Jase and Allison come to terms with their mutal attraction and their inner demons that prevent them from acting on that attraction.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish everyone in America would read: The American Cause","review":"This book is amazing!

Although there are a couple of well-known groups represented here, this disc contains mostly one-off singles from the Pye label circa 1966-1969. All in all, a very tasty sampling of the swirling musical colours from this evanescent era. General grooviness abounds with outstanding tracks such as The Uglys' \\"Quiet Explosion\\", Scrugg's \\"Lavender Popcorn\\", and The Montanas'\\"That's When Happiness Began\\".

Although Brenda is under-rehearsed and not in the best of voice, much of the fault of this third-rate CD lies at the feet of the producer(s) and the label. Horrendous sound glitches throughout, bad mixing and editing; just a really amateur effort. One of the worst \\"live\\" albums I've heard in awhile, and there have been alot of them over the years.

I finally realzed that the concert was autio only with still photography. What a total waste! Dont get me wrong I think Yes are one of the best bands on the planet. When I buy DVD's of a band I expect them to be in concert with interviews as an added bonus.

Fellowship of the Ring is 3 hours on one disc. They could easily have put the video of the concert on the second disc. At least the audio should be able to be played in standard CD players...will we see a separate release? I give it high marks for the effort, but the gems here are only for real die hard fans...but the rest is nothing that most any fan hasn't already heard.

Only in the dvd player. While it's playing, it just shows still shots of the band. What a waste! They could have easily shown the concert on one disc and had all the interviews on the other disc. But for some reason, they didn't do that. Also on this dvd, the interviews are only from current band members. You won't see people like Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, or Bill Bruford anywhere.

I thought it was well worth it.As far as the concert goes, there is one. However, I guess they didn't want to put three discs in the set. That's how many it would've taken to do the interviews plus the concert video. So, to keep it down to two discs, they used still photos from the concert instead.

The battery discharges at an amazing rate and the reaction when picking up calls takes a bit too long.In short: don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"I have dealt with other Motorola earpieces and this is by far the best. No problem with volume; I can hear everyone fine as well as them hearing me. It is small and lightweight. I love how it tells you how charged it is by the color (red is completely dead, yellow is halfway there, and green is good to go!). It fits comfortably on my ear and does not fall off (as my Scala earpiece did). It connects well with other brands of phones. Worked great with my RAZR in that I only need one charger for both devices. I recommend this earpiece to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"H700","review":"I like it. Its small. Sound is good.

It is very small, lightweight, and easy to set up and use. I use the headset with a Samsung Blackjack. I am able to hear clearly and the device is sufficiently loud to use while driving. I have asked many callers whether I can be heard clearly and everyone responded positively. I purchased this item because state law requires a headset be used while driving. The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase. I also thought the price was fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works it works great","review":"I am now on my second device, and I am about to return it because of problems. Let me elaborate. I purchased this item locally. It worked wonderfully for two weeks, then died. I returned it to the store, exchanged it, and the replacement died in the process of making the first phone call with it. I am going to return it for a full refund and take my money elsewhere.I am disappointed in this model. Motorola has a solid reputation, but this model seems to have problems. When it worked, it worked very well, and I was very pleased. I just cannot endorse this particular product. Some seem to be having great success with it. I wish them the best of luck and may their devices never fail. I am washing my hands of this one, however.Thank you for reading.

That's right, Motorola expects you to completely replace an item that you paid $100.00 for two years before. I called motorola who basically told me I was SOOL and go buy a new one.

Easy to use with the on/off mic boom. Everyone I spoke with on land or cell said I sounded like I was in a box. Even outside the car. Noise cancellation was great. Seemed to help eliminate the non duplex conversation which occurs with so many Bluetooths that I have had. Unit did not last very long. A couple months at most.

When I'm trying to call out, I must repeat the prompted information several times, & often just pull over in frustration to fish out my cell phone. As for reception, it's really sketchy. Once in awhile, callers can hear me, but most of the time, I'm shouting into the thing while driving or walking & end up having to terminate the call early. I've awarded it one star on the strength of the handy boom which activates it, but otherwise, this is a DUD.

I cannot understand where the positive reviews are coming from on Amazon. Paid reviews? I've seen suggestions that there are counterfeit versions of this, but we bought ours from Amazon so I doubt that's the case. Other review sites seem to echo our terrible experience with this very cool looking, but very useless, headset. I really wanted it to be usable, but it has an electrical hum and no one can hear me or me them, which sort of defeats the entire purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still works after laundering!","review":"I love this headset! It's small enough to fit in snug jeans, and with the boom closed it doesn't turn itself on. Unfortunately I left it in my jeans when I did laundry and was distressed when I took the jeans out of the dryer and found it in the pocket. It didn't turn on and I assumed it was dead, but being an optimist I plugged it into the AC charger. The red charging light came on, and after charging it worked like new - and it was clean! It fits loosely over the ear and I've had no problem with it falling off, even though I have long hair. I can walk away from the phone into another room before the static starts. I hear others clearly. The reason why I gave it four stars is because at times others tell me they can't hear me clearly. Their reception usually gets better if I fiddle with it. Mostly people don't tell me it's a problem so I assume they're hearing me fine. I will definitely buy this again when the time comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"The H700 headset has very poor reception.

I used the device and drove over 30 miles in the Dallas area, the entire conversation was broken. I used the device in my home, full bars on my phone, the phone in my pocket, and have the same broken word conversation.The H700 has been in the trash for weeks now, and I don't think I'll purchase anything from amazon as I think everything is factory defect/reject and your company is selling junk that no knowing people will purchase.Tom Schultz"},{"rating":"1","title":"bluetooth headset Motorola - H700","review":"This was purchased through another company from Amazon.

I've been through 4 different headsets and only one worked with my phone. You should be able to go into a store or online and buy a headset that is supposedly compatible with your phone, right? I guess not, because it never was and I never got a real explanation as to why. I have a new model of a Samsung phone, which was listed as compatible with this headset. So why didn't it ever work? If the headset was more than one foot from my phone, the reception got fuzzy. If it was more than 4 feet away, it didn't work at all. What a joke! I just want my money back but Motorola wants to keep replacing it, which means I have to pay to post it to them, wait several weeks (at which time I have no headset to use at work), then get finally receive another useless piece of crap.

It was as though there was nothing on my ear when I first tried it on. Pairing it to my phone was easy.Unfortunately, the sound quality was terrible. There was a continual annoying hiss, but even worse, the headset had static to the point of completely obliterating some of the conversation. When I asked a friend to use the headset to call me on my home phone, his voice was muffled and indistinct. Perhaps this was one bad headset out of a wonderful product line, but if all the H700s are like this, I would say look further.

I was shocked to see that not only were they not genuine Motorola Headsets, but they were an awful knockoff at that. They never worked and they never took a charge. They are dead and useless.

Sure it was cheap, but so it is the quality of the call.

Also, this bluetooth set's power socket is the same as my RAZR V3m phone, so I can charge each device with one charger at home and in my car. That's a huge plus for me. The HS850 has a different power socket, as do a lot of the newer Motorola bluetooth sets. Also, the sound quality and range is great for me at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works alright, but doesn't do what it claims","review":"Well, it works alright if you are inside and the phone is right in front of you. It does not get the claimed 30 ft range, not by a long shot, I'd say it gives you about 10 maybe 12 feet. The noise reduction sucks. It does not block wind or people talking in the back ground. I can't say how it works in the car because I do not own a car and I do not drive. I can say that it does not work while riding your bike, even if you are riding slow. If you happen to live in a windy area and want to use it outside, forget it. It works alright in quiet areas and that is about it.

It doesn't have any problems pairing but there is constant static and interference. It's practically useless. Only when you put the phone right next to the headset is when its clear. I paired with both my cell phone and ps3 and both experienced unusual distortions. After googling it for a bit, I came across the Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook and it matched nearly every single counterfeit criteria. I, then, tried contacting the seller to return it but they've ignored all of my requests. So either they know its fake and won't give you your money back or they don't know its fake and they have extremely poor customer service. My advice... do your research before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll keep trying.","review":"Just don't like it. EXTREMELY uncomfortable in my ear.

The fold down speaker turns on the bluetooth which is a nice feature. And the price was right. But then again, you get what you pay for. I had a Motorola H375 and the sound was exactly the same. You think Motorola would have gotten it right by now. However, I did have a Motorola H505. It had excellent sound but the earpiece broke off. I bent up a large paperclip to replace it and it worked better than the original earpiece. (Put some tape on the paperclip, it can be a little rough on the ears.)

I had qualms about getting a headset with such a short boom mic, but I have no problem driving on the highway with the sunroof open. Callers say that can hear me without a problem. High-winds can be a little problematic unless I shield the mic boom, but that's the case whether I'm on a headset or using the phone directly.Note that I have version B of this headset. I've heard that others with the original version have had problems with sound quality and noise cancellation.My only complaint is that it seems a bit more fragile than other headsets I've used in the path (like the behemoth logitechs) but so far its stood up to weeks of abuse being tucked into pockets or haphazardly tossed in a backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola H700 Headset","review":"I purchased the Motorola Headset after receiving numrous complaint regarding the sound quality frmo the Jabra BT500 headset I had been using.

The Motorola H700 is small, lightweight, and paired easily with my telephone. I highly recommend this headset for any user who depends on a mobile telphone. The only minus is the battery life seems to be short. 3 to 4 hours before requiring a recharge. This is probably good for most but I have to \\"feed\\" the headset at least once a day.

I use the wireless H700 much more than I used the wired earphones both at home and in the car. I like the voice dial and the Sprint Voice Command service to make the connection and I use I make more calls due the extra convenience. I added a Contact called Voice with the phone number of *, which then connects to the Sprint Voice Command list I uploaded earlier. I sounds kind of geeky, but it saves me from entering lots of phone numbers that I may only need occasionally.

Back when I purchased it the retail was $129, I got it on sale at $80. Over the two years I have owned it I have used it on two cell phones, no difference.For some reason on rainy days it is very clear, otherwise the person I call has problems hearing me.

I also found out the people I had given them to as gifts had given up on them because they wouldn't pair or connect and after looking into it, it appears they both have a bad connection between the boom and the earpiece. The 10 months or so when mine worked it worked pretty well which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.

The range is not an issue for me as I use this either at my desk or on my belt clip. Although, I did happen to have it in my car while I pumped gas the other day and it works well there also.

The third earpiece worked fine, however; I'm very happy with the H700 I have now, especially because I have to drive so much for my work (earpiece wires tend to get tangled after a while.)

However this film is very biased and on several points inaccurate. Ex. Epidural use is linked to teenage drug abuse and suicide. Really. I personally had a completely natural birth, I share a family bed, breastfed my son for 17mo, and use cloth diapers.... And even I by the end of this film wanted to punch that man in the face.

I made it further than my husband (almost to the end), but we still turned it off early because we were so frustrated and annoyed with the husband/filmmaker! We are opting to have our baby in a birthing center and definitely support a more natural approach to birth, but I agree with the other comments that say the filmmaker's attitude towards hospitals was ridiculous and over the top. He seemed so hell bent on making his point that by the end of the movie I was not sure I could even trust some of the information given. Even after the hospital staff saved his baby's life, all he could do was complain that the nurses wanted to hold her too much! Gimme a break! Yes, there are reasons to be informed and skeptical towards birthing in a hospital, but the way he portrayed hospitals and the people who work in them got to be pretty offensive.

Sorry that your baby was sick and that you had to go to the evil hospital that charged you $21K for a week there. What a puke fest. And yes. I've had a baby.

The film makers of Pregnant in America are inexperienced and the film is difficult to watch on a technical, as well as a cognitive, level. The narrative and narration is slow and frustrating.

Plz.","review":"If the goal is this project is to truly empower women, perhaps the director would respect female intelligence enough by presenting an unbiased piece. This excuse for a documentary relied on the voices of only carefully selected \\"experts,\\" and I often found myself left wanting cold, hard statistics. In addition, the personal experiences of the filmmaker and his wife only served as a 25-minute distraction rather than an enhancement to the documentary's thesis. Next time, sir, respect your audience to present facts with journalistic integrity.

However, I could easily look past that if it weren't for...The father creating this film is narcissistic, aggressive and puts very little of his wife into the film. She's the one having the baby, yet we get precious little of her perspective. It's all about the father, who is rude and self-absorbed.Friends, we all know the medical side of childbirth in this country is often behind the times, compared to other countries and pro-natural research. However, treating medical staff like evil villains does nothing to improve anything. I've known several OB/GYN's and hospitals who are adamantly for natural childbirth and respecting the Mother Nature. There is no need to make sweeping assumptions that all doctors are crooks, which is essentially what this film does.The comment at the end about \\"managing\\" the NICU staff...

She was in pain and wanted medication and to go to the hospital and he wouldn't let her. Their baby couldn't breath and he finally allowed her to go to the hospital. He even flat out says \\"It was my decision to make.\\" Like the mom had no say. And then he STILL blames the docs and makes them out to be evil.

However, any time you need to use your wipers they leave a white streak across the windshield that doesn't disappear for a second or two. At night, the streaking catches all surrounding light and is blinding. It's like someone flashing their bright lights at you every time the wipers go across the windshield.

She flees to Los Angeles with the murderers in hot pursuit because the drugs they are after are hidden in her car. Eventually she meets up with the soap opera star of her dreams and complications follow.The best thing I can say about this film is that Renee Zellweger looks pretty and that the story held my interest somewhat. But instead of laughing at the supposedly funny parts, I just opened my eyes in amazement about how stupid it was. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are cast as the murderers and their racial stereotyping was insulting. The rest of the cast did the best that they could but the material was just plain silly. This film was nothing but a time waster. But sometimes that's all we want out of a film, something mild and innocuous.

But what a total disappointment, a major waste of actors, crew, talent and money.I'll give credit to efforts of Renee, Morgan Freeman, et al. to do what they could to carry out a wretchedly implausible script. Freeman, especially, shines. He is truly a great, simpatico actor, for whose character in this non-epic one can almost feel sympathy.But the rest of it you can put back in the can. Chris Rock, especially, disappoints. He is a brilliant, pushing-the-edge comedian on HBO. But here he's just another street-foulmouthed punk, a la Eddie Murphy at Murphy's trashmouth best (worst), like Murphy another self-inflicted waste of talent.Hollywood hubris, again.

I recall laughing about one thing, and one thing only. Nurse Betty was a stupid movie with a ridiculous plot, and I couldn't get into it. Morgan Freeman had an unusually extremely foul mouth, which made me lose a lot of respect for him. I expected the foul language from Chris Rock, but not from Morgan Freeman. Renee Zellweger played a ditsy and stupid character with such a ridiculous mindset. Greg Kinnear had a flat character as well. Nurse Betty lacked extremely. It is not a kid movie either. Its R rating is due to strong graphic violence, pervasive strong language and a muted sexual situation. This movie was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I should have remembered it was possible for a movie to have a well written screenplay and an awfully silly, plodding plotline. The basic concept behind \\"Nurse Betty\\" sounds great on the back of a video box, or a 30 second pitch - the perfect *black comedy* setup, which pokes fun at both the hollywood ego AND the losers who stalk the egomaniacs, who is in turn stalked by a couple of interesting hit men - but when it's on screen, the plot goes \\"kablooe.\\" The writing works, but it should have been a short story, and not a 90+ minute movie.

The DVD transfer, however was terrible. The color changes drove me nuts. I think this was done on purpose to enhance the film but it was done in very bad taste. I kept thinking there was something wrong with my new TV - it became obvious that the director kept messing with color and lighting from scene to scene. Sometimes the picture was perfect and stunning - most of the time, however, it was too red, too yellow, etc.If you rent this DVD - it isn't alien's messing with your TV - it is a very bad Film to DVD transfer and the director messing with colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me smile against my will","review":"I caught this on a Friday night, after a brutal week of work, and frankly was too tired to laugh; but NURSE BETTY had me smiling nearly throughout.

Greg Kinnear was also terrific, as was Allison Janney, who had all the best one-liners and a perfect dry delivery. The screenplay was constantly inventive.

In a mild Pulp Fiction ripoff, Freeman is another in a seemingly endless parade of philosophical hitmen, yet Freeman's hitman is so good and amusing that you forgive the farmiliarity. Rock shines as always and portrays a more amoral and violent man.The soap opera aspects are interesting, as we see how people use them to escape from staid, difficult existences.A scalping, a dash of romance, aspirations of nursing, and a nice depiction of ordinary folk combine to make this a dynamic film that manipulates endlessly, but you will forgive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what you are lead to believe.","review":"The painfully graphic violence carried out by the Chris Rock character throughout the show ruins an otherwise good (not great)movie.

I'm big fans of all the actors in the movie, but none of them, with the exception of Morgan Freeman, gave a satisfying performance. I got the feeling half-way through that they were trying to cram as much plot as they could in the movie, without making it longer. The resulting feeling is confusion, and I was so confused by the end that I've not recommended this to anyone. It's a shame, since it did have some really good parts in it.

I didn't; and deleted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Arthur but very slow","review":"The book was written well but I got very board waiting for something to happen. The main charter did not thing but complain and it moved so slow at half way through the book and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste!","review":"Wonder if it is possible for the Author to make the main character of this book look any more like an A**hole than he did. Have tried and tried to understand or possibly relate to him, but cannot! Already downloaded the book so will finish it, however can assure you will not waste any more of my time after finishing up the first in this series. Not sure where everyone else is getting all of the great reviews from, wonder if they read the same book I am reading? Seems that the alien in the story cares more about what happens than the human does, and the constant criticism of an entity that does not have an understanding of how things work, well again, great understand and caring from the main character. So again, since the first book is free, download it, however, in this person's HO, don't bother with the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough thought.","review":"Carver shows some talent in this book but it is spoiled by carelessness. For example, without giving anything away, the alien dies, gets better and dies again, each time without a word of explanation; and he has discovered that a comet is on a collision course with Earth but doesn't know which one or when! And the high-tech devices used by the hero are just too much like magic. I will not be reading Carver again till he gets better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak , shallow , not serius sci-fi.","review":"I am afraid it's all true. I bought the book without resarch and got what I deserved.The charecters were flat , even the protagonist wasn't convincing!The alien technolegy was bogus and totally unexplained , the alien himself was way too human-in-nature , kinda' cute - and that's not hard science fiction.I was'nt impressed by the chaos theory supposedly interlaced , and infact I made a conscious effort to finish the book.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"I loved this book. As other reviewers have said, it is a real page turner and a very entertaining read. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping to the end","review":"I love science fiction stories and this one was a great read. I found it difficult to put down as the interaction between the two characters controls the direction of the plot. But the written display of their communication on the page was not visually enjoyable to read and almost made me put the book down. There were sections on the story, such as when Bandicut took on new jobs, that seemed to have no relevance to the story, however, the relationship with Julie was enjoyable and could have been expanded upon particularly on the latter part of the story. The ending wants me to read the next in the series as we are left wanting answers to so many questions. The description of the final activity lacks detail and I fell that the reader is left wondering about the success of the mission; was Bandicut a hero?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-fi entertainment! On to Book 2!","review":"This book was great. The main character is John Bandicut, some kind of a land surveyor on Triton, a moon of planet Neptune. He encounters a very interesting type of alien that does not have its own physical presence in this universe. The alien takes up residence in John's mind, which is pretty strange. But the two have to become friends and work together as they try to figure out how to save Earth from destruction.This alien who, calls himself Charlie, is quite interesting as he tries to understand human behavior. I especially liked the scenes where John Bandicut is trying to meet or get close to women because this alien does not like females and the idea of sexual contact is just too gross for it to handle. \\"It is so... organic\\" he says. Very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Not Pull Me In","review":"This book came highly recommended from a variety of different sources. However it failed to move me as it moved my friends. I suspect part of this is due to the Doctor Who reboot, which I'm sure in some part was inspired by this novel (the novel came out first!). Having watched most of the new series I was already familiar with most of the content. Instead of feeling the excitement and awe of the other viewers, I felt like I was rehashing an old story.Though some of it was the characters. In Science Fiction I generally forgive stale characters as the setting tends to the real protagonist. I could not connect with any of the characters, they did not seem real to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geezus!","review":"Shame on ME! I didn't read the editor's review. I saw the name Ken Blanchard, reconized him from his minute manager series and thought it would be a good choice for my diverse group. IT'S NOT! Unless you are a fundamentalist Christian who wants to hear a constant barrage faith-based drivel and mind-numbing jesusisms - this DVD is not for you. I will give Blanchard credit for finding the handful of leaders who aren't greed driven. Hmmm, wonder what their employees think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend to watch it before judging","review":"I disagree with other reviews. I did expected it to be a different kind of a movie. And yes the graphics were not the best. But if you've seen computer graphics, then you'd say that they look good. As for the deaths, there are many cut scenes that don't basically show you how the people got attacked and murdered by the beast. And the wounds, cut off heads look cheap but not as cheap as in many other low budget movies. It looks unreal but it doesn't look that bad. The acting is actually not bad at all. The witch might some more practice in acting as a witch but as for other characters, I'd say they did good, but could do better. The movie gives away it's own atmosphere. I like the dark fairy tale. I'd say, there are good actors, actresses in here. I like how they've changed the tale. For the low budget movie it was pretty good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and the Beast A Dark Tale","review":"I was really disappointed in this movie but, again, it was my choice to purchase it. I have all the other Beauty and the Beast movies so needed this one to complete my set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and the Beast: A Dark Tale","review":"This Beauty and the Beast is a very different take on the well known Fairy Tale. The King is near death and needs an heir, as his son had died as an infant. This movie has lots of twists and turns involving evil relatives, witch, deadly troll, a horribly twisted and scared man in the woods and a beautiful girl named Beauty. However, nothing is ever what it seems. It eventually has a happy ending, with the message that goodness overcomes evil. It is not appropriate for teens or children, strictly for adults. It may appeal to individuals enjoying a darker type of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined...","review":"Wow...when I saw the trailer I thought it would be ok. The movie was terrible! The acting sucked and it seemed so rushed. I'll be re-gifting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Victorian Mystery Series","review":"This is a new series to me, and although this book is currently out of print I had it brought in by my library since it's the first book in the series. I enjoyed the story. Detective Cribb and his sidekick are quite unique and the setting is certainly so. It takes place during a six day foot race. These were apparently quite common in the Vicotrian age, where participants would go around a track inside a building for six days - totally 624 miles. They take time off for eating and sleeping (about 3 hours a night), but the winner is the one who completes the most miles in the allotted time. This is a pretty good mystery, and the hero is wonderful. Don't expect an Anne Perry, but the story is entertaining. I intend to read the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"good story, BAD hyphens","review":"This is an impressive first novel. The setting is both totally unfamiliar and engrossing. The characters are well-drawn. The mystery is . . . satisfyingly mysterious, although not very baffling.However, after paying nearly $10 for the Kindle version, I find myself constantly dis-tracted by un-necessary hyphens which ap-pear in the text in totally inappropriate places. This is a con-version issue and should not happen to any author's work that is being sold for more than a dollar. Changing the text size or the orientation of the Kindle makes no difference. So, to the author: 5 stars. To the person who converted this, no stars at all. This is entirely un-ac-ceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esta Vida magnifico","review":"Was at a party with a bunch Colombianos last week when they put on a video of Jorge Celedon singing Esta Vida.

This program made my computer crash causing me to lose some valuable information, which I was lucky to get from a few sources.

As a long time scleroderma patient, two considerations struck me: first, the book is depressingly reckless in the use of words like fatal and death. The overutilization of the negative image borders on irresponsible. Second, alternative approaches to treatment that have helped some people are totally dismissed. I would also add that the reader will learn very little about scleroderma as such from this book other than by gleaning from the examples. A much more responsibly balanced approach is taken in Maureen Mayes' \\"The Scleroderma Book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you noticed?!","review":"Have you noticed that almost all the five-star reviews of this book are actually \\"testimonials\\" copied from the book, itself?!

The Lancet, ranked by many as the world's premier peer-reviewed medical journal, has just published the results of the small but critical study described in this book. Two thirds of patients completing the 48-week trial were in full remission by the end of the study, with no deaths reported from either scleroderma or the therapy. I read SCLERODERMA after a friend, who knew she was dying, was told by her rheumatologist that there was no effective treatment for her disease; subsequently she went to see Dr. Trentham and this therapy saved her life.

I bought this book about a month before I left and skimmed it. It's a pretty small book (only 69 pages) and didn't tell me much that I hadn't already learned from talking to previous students, going to the group orientation, and over-thinking every detail (as I normally do). I can say that this book is very clearly organized and easy to follow. I just feel that the content is lacking. I would recommend this book if you are *thinking* about studying abroad and haven't done much research. Personally by the time I acquired this book I had done a TON of research and this information was all things that I already knew. I recommend Dowell & Mirsky's \\"Study Abroad: How to Get the Most of Your Experience\\" for those of you who want lots of information to be prepared for anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of David Ruffin:20th Century Masters","review":"One of R &B's greatest singers!

She is described as a mezzo but both here and in Boris Godunov (where she played the innkeeper) she sounds like a contralto.The choir here sings with better diction than in Abbado's Khovanshchina dvd.The only problem is the packing:There's no mention of who orchestrated the excerpts from Khovanshchina. (Shostakovich, I guess)On the whole, this is a perfect example of Mussorgsky's art (and Abbado's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, a vocal??","review":"It's not obvious from the description that this version includes a choir.

One of the suet holders had only one nail and probably should have had four nails, consequently, it fell off immediately.

It should be affixed to the bottom with a swing door on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This bird feeder is OK, but not very heavy duty.The Cedar smell is nice, but the construction is not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived broken in two places","review":"the product itself seems ok however with the way amazon packed this product i received it broken in two places///first time ever had this problem with amazon.com, very upset!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"The best pool book ever written.

Very comprehensive. Explanations, drawings are perfect. Perfect for training at home"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I've read a number of books on the game of pool. I was very impressed with the authors grasp of the game as well as his very apparent love of the game. He has obviously studied the art form intensely for many years. I felt that his realistic, open minded approach and access to many of the current greats of the game make his advice quite invaluable to the commited student of the game. Buy this book if you're serious about improving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"I strongly recommand this book to you if you are getting married. I understood of the main principle is God has to stand between you and your spouse in marriage life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled...","review":"This product is exactly what is stated in its name. Don't be fooled by what is in the full description, features, or think about the retail price. For \\"$182.50\\" I would expect a full faucet kit and not merely the trim, especially when the entire kit is now available for retail $221.90 (Dealyard $89.99). It is a misleading description of the item, and the quoted retail price is totally ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"I had this player for 3-4 mos. when it just started acting funny. That is resetting, turning off and finally the fuse blew. I was going to bring it to a shop, but I just ending up throwing it in the trash. I think Pioneer should compensate anyone who bought this dvd player. Since it seems, I'm not the only one that had problems with this dvd player"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem here...","review":"I have one too, with the same problem...It resets randomly, but not often. About 1 time in 3 DVDs played.If somebody can help, please do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until this player is fixed, STAY AWAY!","review":"This player looks good, plays well, an is in general well designed, but has one major problem. About 75 minutes through a movie the player will either reset, or pause without any means to restart other than start the movie over. This problem is with my player and my friends player (as well as the other reviews). It has been in the shop twice for months with no improvements. I have heard that it may be a software problem, but I see no recall from Pioneer. For now, stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is a great book. It shows the antiquity of Indian civilization. The book describes the greatness of vedic Aryans. Their knowledge of astronomy, mathematics etc. was amazing.It is about time, Indian history textbooks describe true history of India instead of biased history written by European historians. If Indians of present-day India would know who they really are, they will be proud of their motherland. Books like these can help them get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical fraud","review":"This book is an example of the worst kind of historical fraud. The \\"theories\\" presented are not just speculative, but plain ridiculous.
