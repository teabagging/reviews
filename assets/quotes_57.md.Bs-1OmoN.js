The new GeForce cards have 32 megs as well, so where is that other 16 megs that the Voodoo is missing?

With such a good subject, though, it's too bad that Arikha did not take the trouble to do a better job. The book is about twice as long as it should be, and we lose track of the forest in her minute, repetitive descriptions of trees. Moreover, Arikha apparently did not consult very many original sources, and instead mainly presents a re-churning of the secondary literature. Had she better mastered the originals, she might more confidently have been able to tell us what it all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this really be true?","review":"I'm a big fan of Errol Flynn and his wonderful string of adventure and western movies of the late thirties/early forties. I'm really disturbed by this book, labelling him a liar, a cheat and,worst of all, a traitor. A Nazi collaborator, if not a spy and gestapo agent. But the true measure of the man is in his movies. And I would like to believe that Flynn the actor had something of an resemblance to Flynn the man, just like it was darn near impossible to seperate John Wayne the actor and John Wayne the man. This book is not, as Highman claims, heavily documented, but rather the other way around. Flynn was an adventurer, alright, but he was certainly no Nazi spy. And just before his death, he was almost branded a communist due to his last, very awful, movie \\"Cuban Rebel Girls\\". Let's remember Flynn as a truly great actor. Whatever his shortcomings as a private man, they are shared by all of us. Flynn was one of the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"HigamBottom's Up!","review":"Another typical example of slandering a Celebrated person postmortem. The book is a load of Doggy-do. The author never allowed facts nor ethics to impede his need to jump on the \\"Make some dough by ripping a dead guy\\" modern bandwagon. Buy MY WICKED WICKED WAYS, or Errol Flynn: A Memior, or Errol Flynn: The Life and Career, or From a Life of Adventure, if you want to read about the real and Joyous, or even the real and not so joyous Flynn. I gave Higams book 1 star only because they did not have a lower rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is an absolute fraud.","review":"This is one of the worst biographies ever written about Errol Flynn. The book is an absolute fraud. The information is mostly from Higham's paranoid imagination that see a Nazi under every rock. The author also has misquoted his so-called declassified documents in order to weave his many slanders and lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errol is still a hero to me","review":"Charles Higham ceased to cumber the Earth with his mendacity on April 21, 2012, when he did us all the big favor of croaking. He left behind him a long list of gossipy biographies full of lies and half-truths. I became an enthusiastic Errol Flynn fan at the age of 14 in 1958, when there was a series of re-runs of Flynn movies on TV. I lapped them up like a cat at a bowl of cream. Flynn was still alive at that time. His pattern of sexual behavior hardly indicates the possibility that he was bisexual. As for the Nazi spy nonsense, this is so ridiculous that there is no need to refute it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untold?","review":"Or rather Made Up. Higham's book is fully readable, but it lacks truth. Higham is probably the proto-James Ellroy, who takes real persons out of Hollywood history and wraps them in fiction.This book is well written but that's it. The whole Nazi spy/homsexual angle has been exposed as a fraud by the late, great Tony Thomas. Do yourself a favor and borrow this book at the library if you want to read it.

Higham belabors Flynn's supposed homosexuality and status as a spy ad nauseum - and with very little, if any at all, fact to back the allegations up. Most sources, when they're named at all, are dead now so they can't be questioned; very few paper references are cited; and the book sounds much more like a work of fiction than an autobiography. A much better book is the newest one, Inherited Risk, by Jeffrey Meyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing lower than one star?","review":"It's a pity Mr. Higham didn't explore fiction as a means to make his living, as most of his writing seems to be comprised of mostly fictional accounts and very little fact. I truly believe that Mr. Higham intends, at first, upon writing a biography, but seems to get distracted somewhere between the last hit of whatever he's smoking and actually leaving the house to do any form of research on his subject. The Flynn book, if nothing else, is entertaining in its sheer fantasy alone...particularly the scene where Flynn flees the arms of his married lover and dives several stories from her window.

If he is sane, he could not believe this drivel himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obvious attempt to bend the truth - but why?","review":"It's been some time since I have read this book. At first, it seemed believable. However, the more I got into this book the more I realised it was pure hogwash. For a start, not one person comes forward to say \\"I had sex with Flynn\\".

I don't remember if I loved it or hated it, but I learned grammar. Sometime in the spring I saw a reference to this book. I teach ESL Level 2 of 6 and thought it might offer a more visual approach. I began working my way through the book. Okay, I must have liked diagramming (I like puzzles) because I spent long hours working my way through the book, diagramming the sentences and having repeated light bulb moments about the patterns and structure of English. I had no idea that 'yes' and 'no' were adverbs, but now I know and it makes sense. I am enthused at how my students have taken to this approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on grammar combined with sentence diagramming.","review":"I have read and used several books on diagramming. This book is the best I have seen so far. The grammar section at the beginning is thorough. The author even has a quick page on parsing. The text and layout make the book easy to read and use. Everything I have to say is positive. Diagramming with this book's help is an amazing method to see language as more than words thrown together.I also recommend Rex Barks for additional practice and another way to look at parts of speech. Everything a squirrel can do to a tree is a great way to remember prepositions. Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog makes a nice introduction to diagramming and discusses the history of diagramming, but doesn't really teach it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enough...","review":"Not as good as my Klipsch Reference Series Speakers but they sure sound great for the price.

There's about 1 per page, which is a serious problem.

Now I have to rotate and flip to get an even toast (meaning I have to babysit this thing to get a decent result). I have no idea if the blue lights on the settings mean anything because nothing changes (marketing gimick?). The dial for light to dark is totally inaccurate and never produces a consistent result.

It's surprising that its warranty was even valid for one year--what a leap of faith on the manufacturer's part! To start with, it never toasted evenly (as other Amazon reviewers have noted). The first part of the toaster actually to fail was the lever for lowering the toast. After three months it began to lose its ability to lock down. At more or less the same time, the aluminum cradles that hold the toast up inside the toaster started to fall apart. Once the lever failed completely, the toaster ceased to be a toaster.

Even with precision placement, the ejection of the Pop Tart sends it hurdling upward only to land wedged between the guide rails and the toast carriage. Once stuck a full cool down period is in order for a complete and safe removal. The toast carriage is not sufficiently wide to fill the width of the slot allowing narrow items to slip by. It's also designed for bagels, but don't cut them to thick or they won't fit. If you wanted your toast evenly toasted on both sides, then you better look elsewhere. The heating coils are definitely hotter on the outside than the center and this affects both slots. It has nice blue lighted buttons and they are great for guiding in small aircraft to you countertop. Another nice feature is the spark you get when plugging it in, and that's when it off. Glad to see they were able to get this to work on 120 volts rather 240 volts that's usually required for all these fine features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster 6331 toaster","review":"We bought this about 6 months ago and it stopped working around a week ago. The pop-up mechanism is very flimsy. Sometimes it brought the toast up when the cycle was complete and sometimes it didn't. We'll be looking for a different brand next time. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy!","review":"Owned this toaster for less then a year and it only toasts on one side, difficult to get lever to catch, cannot get toast out without fork or someother device!

If you turn it on, with nothing in it, you can see the elements and what they are doing. On the Bagel setting, the outer two elements heat up a lot (the directions say to put the bagels in with cut edge facing OUT, counterintuitive) and the inner elements heat up a little bit, a bit later. If you change the setting to Toast, guess what? The elements heat up exactly the same way!! There must be some reflective heating going on as well, judging by the degree of toasting when comparing the two sides. Bagels turn out toasted on BOTH sides, the cut side and the not-cut side. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"40-pages of screenshots and sparse, poorly written text.","review":"This is not a \\"book,\\" it's just a thin pamphlet. Its text is sparse and poorly written. I would be embarassed to have authored and released this title, if only for its abundant mechanical errors. Don't waste your money--add your $7.50 to the purchase of any of the multitude of legitimate Access texts available. If you only have $7.50 to spend on Access tutorial literature, you'll be far better off by just beginning to read the help files that accompany Access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and likeable","review":"This book is more entertaining and likeable than I expected. Jong's honesty is admirable. She readily admits she didn't become pregnant till she could afford a nanny; most celebrities pretend they raised their children with no help. I liked the essay Lolita at Thirty best and also her views on Jane Eyre are very acute. Her literary criticism is the best thing in the book. Surprisingly erudite and sharp. Her essay on Anais Nin made me want to read the journals which I never have. She's at her least appealing when trying to show how wordly she is , i.e. 'My Italy' where she does an awful lot of name dropping as if all the famous people she knows validate her own imporance. Her daughter, Molly, wrote an article for Mode magazine where she related how her mother's friend, Joan Collins, called her fat. I wouldn't be surprised if Erica didn't drop Joan, for all her cruelty, simply because she's a celeb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Feminist Ramblings","review":"It is very hard to follow Jung's logic. Her book jumps around like a bunge cord, never staying long enough to explain her unsupportable conclusions. Most distressing is her apologetic acceptance of the behavior of the President. In fairness, there are some amusing parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent place to start","review":"Several years ago I was introduced to this book in a college course on Judaism. I was very impressed with how helpful the book was in terms of providing articulate and insightful overviews of the subject matter. Finding the book so helpful in expanding my understanding of Judaism, I returned to it a few years later to learn more about Islam; I was not disappointed. Overall, the book is very good at providing the student with a solid foundation of knowledge on a wide variety of issues germane to studying each of the Western traditions - issues like how each tradition articulates its unique form of Monotheism, how each views its scripture, and how each approaches issues like ethics, religious law, authority, religious politics etc. In sum, the book is a great place to begin one's study of Western traditions because its very organization makes the unique contributions of each tradition, and its relation to the others, easier to comprehend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some books are not hight quality when they say they are.","review":"Most of the books I have purchased from Amazon are of high quality but one of them in particular was rated high and said it was in great condition and it is terrible.

All I could think for description would be to take an album of This Heat, Tortoise and June Of 44 and put them in a 3-disc changer having all those groups qualities playing all at once. Hughes' voice can be unpleasant and dry at first, but fits the atmosphere like a glove that grew on me.The follow-up release (\\"Trust In God But Tie Up Your Camel\\" on his Hefty label) was a bit better, however this record has plenty of character and easily dashes many of the contempary \\"experimental\\" indie bands of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks purpose","review":"So many poinless scenes thrown into one movie leave the viewer asking, what difference does it make if he plays basketball or just aimlessly wanders the streets?

I thought the silliness was funny at first but it was way over the top and got old very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining - like a train wreck","review":"The only resemblance to Shaolin Soccer is some of the cast. I still think the show should be called Kung Fu Drunk, because you'd have to be to follow this show.Jay Chou plays an innocent orphan, Jie, who is manipulated by a homeless loser. He develops considerable skill at basketball, while The Loser manipulates him and the press for his own enrichment.Too many scenes show The Loser making ridiculous faces directly into the camera, which destroys any immersion you may have been experiencing during the brief well-paced parts.Where Shaolin Soccer has character development that draws you in, Kung Fu Drunk has fuzzy flashbacks to earlier in the film to remind you what you were trying to forget.There's a bunch of scenes, and then all of a sudden 4 kung fu masters have a huge fight with everyone on the opposing team except for the 5 main players who still have to face off with the heroic underdogs and lose for the finale.What the heck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think this is pretty light in entertainment value.

There are tons of songs with those words in it that actually are offbeat and funny. this is just a group of guys who are copying styles perfected by Green Day and other great punk bands. A band like this gives punk rock a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor construction","review":"I purchased one of these units along with two TF-S10 speakers from the same manufacturer. Less than 3 months after installing the product the paint is already chipping off on the TFS-50. It has only rained one time and there are no sprinklers anywhere near the unit, so the paint is basically falling off without any provocation. When I inspected the unit after noticing the paint chips I tipped it slightly and a large amount of water came pouring out. Apparently it is not only not sealed against water intrusion but it also allows it to collect inside. Given the small amount of rain we get here it is surprising that any was able to collect at all. I attempted to return the unit for repair or replacement but the manufacturer insisted that I pay for the packaging and shipping. Given the size and weight of this object it is not worth my time to do this. I recommend avoiding this manufacturer entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just o.k.","review":"Only one of the 3 DVD's is worth having in this bunch.However,on that one(interviews with band members and Dave Davies,the ultra-heavy English accents of the speakers is difficult to understand at times.The other 2 DVD's duplicate the performances and the commentary of the other people on the discs is very much meaningless.Rating their hits and saying what millions of people have said millions of times doesn't seem very entertaining.I was not impressed with this DVD pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compilation","review":"Nice footage and interviews, many not seen before.

Agora (including Taipan newsletter), are the guys that use sharp copy writers and fictitious names and are catering to the gullable through mass mail \\"exclusive\\" offers. Stay away from it.

By the time I realized what each chapter was doing (about half way through), I merely began to gleem over the remaining chapters just to verify all was indeed a sales pitch of Agora Finacial services prior to throwing the book in the trash. Now I have never thrown a book in the trash, much less ever given an online review, however the book does not explain any \\"how to's\\", other than buying into Agora's services to obtain the 'how to' intelligence - I feel it's unethical to have to 'pay' for an infomercial especially without that issue being disclosed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended Infomercial","review":"The book has two interesting chapters covering the topics of demographic trends which will impact economic and geopolitical events. These chapters are similar in nature to Harry Dent's discussion in his book The Next Great Bubble Boom. In this regard, I would recommend reading Dent's book instead.The chapters describing the \\"hot trading secrets\\" are very qualitative in nature. Some of the \\"hot\\" secrets are obvious; others are less so. However, the book does not provide sufficient information for the reader to utilize the information in their trading activities.Overall, this book is, in my opinion, an extended infomercial for the (very expensive) newsletters offered by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"In a nutshell, he is just promoting his stock advisory services.

It's a touch suspicious as well that two of the four positive reviews come from Baltomore or the Maryland suburbs, Agora's and Taipan's home base - ask for some favors down at the Yacht Club, did we?I've been a happy subscriber to Taipan for years, and I've always liked Amberger's work.

Intertwining biography with philosophy works quite well in the case of Sartre. His style was that of sheer genius, analytical and brilliant, and he was an outstanding original thinker, building on those before him whose thought bore on his development of existentialism. The crucible of the twentieth century produced in him not only one of the great philosophers, but a man of great courage and independence as well. Existentialism has affected our mode of thinking to such an extent in the modern world, that it is easy to underestimate the genius of Sartre. I think that Prof. Strathern's entertaining and clever writing communicates not only the circumstances of his life and character but some of the real importance of this seminal thinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"This book merits no review. It is insulting to mislead anyone to think he/she can understand Jean Paul Sartre in ninety minutes. Most people do not have the intelligence to understand his ideas; those who do spend years thinking. It isn't pablum, and there is no clue if you don't have a brain.

Besides that I really don't like to \\"quit\\" anything, so I forced myself as painfully enduring as it was. The book club members weren't happy with it either, in fact we didn't even want to discuss it, which is the point of a book club, and that is pretty bad.The story itself had the potential of being a great story, unfortunately it was just so incredibly boring. I'm Sorry, I can't recommend it. I bought it because it looked good and the readers reviews were pretty positive, I wonder if we all read the same book?

When you get into the music mp3 features and other thigns, it just isn't to great for that. The sound quality isn't very good, and I wouldn't buy this phone if thats what your looking for..

Moreover, the characters weren't very authentic to me. Who was Lifee anyway, Florence Nightingale? I can't imagine a family taking in that many strangers. And, were things that easy for them?

Unfortunately, the entire plot of a cabal to overthrow the government of a fictional Caribbean island makes no sense.Neither does the counter-plotting by the husband-wife assassin duo they hire.Neither does the plot of the wife to kill her husband and then write a bestseller about it all.An ex-Green Beret appears and threatens to be a real hero for maybe 3 paragraphs, then turns out to be a worthless wuss.Read only if you're determined to read every novel Patterson has ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters.

This book was re-issued in the 1990s to capitalize on the success of the Alex Cross series. Although I'm a fan of Patterson's later work, I found this particular novel to be remarkably bad.There are so many things wrong with this novel it's hard to list them all. The characterization in SEASON OF THE MACHETE is thin to non-existent. The premise of the novel is absurd, and the rambling, incoherent plotline made for a confusing read. Ever read a book and have no idea what's going on most of the time? Or much less care? This is that kind of novel.In short, SEASON OF MACHETE is one the most painful reading experiences I've had in a long time.

As the end I was puzzled by this book and finally thought to look at the copyright date - 1977!

That is a very rare event in my life. The story was forced, disorganized and simply not good. The characters had no character and were very poorly developed.

So, it is one of the earlier works by the author, and it shows. Sloppy editing, a rambling plot that lacks cohesion, and one dimensional characters are some of the ills that plague this book.Still, the book has its moments with its many plot twists and turns. Unfortunately, these moments are not enough to make this story of two contract killers anything other than mediocre.Some dedicated fans of the author may derive a modicum enjoyment from this uneven, earlier work. A few may simply want to read it to see how much the author has improved since this early effort.

The other issue I had, was with the reader(Lou Diamond Phillips) personally, one of my favorite actors. I just could not visualize the characters.

Moral: try walmart of target first and get product immediately and for a much better price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Classics","review":"Being a strict purist when it comes to the classic nursery rhymes, I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. Not only do none of the songs sound like the original nursery rhymes, they all sound the same. Sadly, I found that the tune the artist chose became irritating after a few songs. Additionally, the songs do not blend well together. They come to abrupt end and then there is a brief pause or break in between each number. If you really want your child to learn nursery rhymes, you may prefer to order Baby Genius's Favorite Nursery Rhymes, (which maintains the purity of the original) or Bananas in Pajamas, It's Singing Time, A Collection of Nursery Rhymes (which incorporates some fun while teaching the nursery rhymes.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was not what I expected.

Kind of misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not worth what I paid.","review":"The necklace is MUCH smaller than I anticipated but still very cute. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions because it doesn't seem worth what I paid now that I have seen it in person. The chain is very delicate and isn't strong enough for daily wear. I'd recommend getting a strong chain if you plan on wearing this for more than special occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool necklace","review":"I bought this for my wife for valentine's day. I thought it was neat and she loved it too. Like others have said its smaller than it looks. I was expecting it to be small but in the picture it also looks thicker which in reality its very thin, which is what I think everyone is referring to it looking smaller. It still looks great, very unique to a normal everyday necklace. I am deducting a star for quality because a diamond fell out of it shortly after she got it and its not like she wears it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I got this for my girlfriend as a gift.

Well, there's no accounting for taste, but in my opinion this movie stinks. I found almost nothing redeeming about this, it's a lobotomized version of the original 'Dirty Harry'. The plot is a remake of the classic 'Laura'. There's no need or point in even expending the effort to enumerate the weaknesses of the film...it's bad (unless you like gratuitous scenes of girls jumping around in spandex body suits)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlanta gets the major city treatment!","review":"Burt Reynolds continued his love affair with Georgia's capital by setting his ultraviolent crime saga in the city of the South. The Atlanta background is only window dressing for a tale that could occur in any metropolis in the U.S.Reynold's directing is tight and he does well in the title role. Great support comes from Rachel Ward, Brian Keith, veteran heavy Henry Silva, Bernie Casey, Reynold's longtime friend Charles Durning, and the always reliable Earl Holliman.The film may not make any \\"best of\\" lists, but it is still an enjoyable cop drama, with exciting twists and turns, plus it provides an early '80's glimpse of crime in urban America.."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"dirty harry\\" goes to atlanta and bombs","review":"when friend clint eastwood showed burt reynolds the script for \\"every which way but loose\\" burt was said to have told him \\"your steping into my goodole'boy movies, if you make this i'm going to do \\"dirty harry goes to atlanta\\" well clint made his movie and burt made his. william dheil's novel served as a starting point and he threw in a little homage to \\"laura\\" just to make sure. what he forgot to do was make his mind up as to weather or not this is funny , action , drama , or spoof. it tries to be all and fails at each. a shot of action in the last 10 mins. does nothing to take the sting of how boring this film really is. i know some people love this one , but not me ,and the transfer is in full screen so even the stuido doesn't have much faith in this one . beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no widescreen?","review":"This is probalby Burt Reynold's best performance.

This is one of the best movies of its time, and Burt Reynolds is the reason. The casting is superb. Reynolds does an exceptinal job directing - probably his best effort in that realm. It is pretty violent, but the violence is not overboard considering the subject matter of the film. I have watched this film numerous times, and do not tire of it. The stunt work is outstanding; Dar Robinson was the greatest. This movie makes Smokey and The Bandit look like a joke. Sharky's Machine showed what Reynolds was truly capable of. It is his masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good storyline, with a strong supporting cast.","review":"Frankly, one of Burt's best. Burt Reynolds directs himself and a strong supporting cast in this story about corruption, romance, and a villian you will not soon forget. While on a stake-out Sharky(Reynolds' character) witnessess the murder of a beautiful woman...a woman whom Burt has loved from afar. The twists and turns of the plot are entertainingly carried out with the help of the Machine - Sharky's friends...a band of cops who all for one reason or another find themselves often at odds with the system.The movie has fewer laughs than \\"The Longest Yard\\" but less intense than \\"Deliverance\\". If you enjoyed either or both of these movies, you'll like \\"Sharky's Machine.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken handle...","review":"This might have been a great product but due to improper packaging I wasn't able to find out.

I placed the order on Saturday evening, and I received the faucets Tuesday morning. The faucet and sprayer were both higher quality than other similarly priced faucets at big box retailers.

I would highly recommend this faucet, especially for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievably good customer service!","review":"I purchased this faucet in May of 2011. It arrived quickly, looked beautiful and was just what I wanted. My plumber installed it and we were very happy.Last week it started to leak. The plumber came and said the leak was within the base and that, even if he could fix it, it would be so time-intensive it probably wouldn't be worth it.I went back to the seller through Amazon and emailed them about the situation this morning. WITHIN 1 HOUR I had a response - \\"new one on its way.\\"I don't have it yet, but expect I will by the beginning of next week.I could not be more impressed with the customer service. I wish it wasn't remarkable, that every vendor had this as their standard. But they don't, so I will celebrate and heap praise on those who do.If the part hadn't broken it would've been 5 stars - and then some. This is a very attractive faucet set (with sprayer) and the price was very reasonable.

I wasn't disappointed. It was fairly easy to install and looks beautiful in our kitchen. Washing dishes is easier with the height of this faucet, and the sprayer is quite strong. As other reviewers noted, the shipping was fast; it was in our possession within 4 days of ordering. One note about the sprayer-- it's a good idea to shake it out after using, as if you don't, a few drops of water will accumulate in it and can spill over onto your sink edge. Not a big deal at all, but that simple step can save you from having to go back and wipe the sink down if you're obsessive like me!I'm glad to have found this faucet, as I know we'd have spent well over $200 for something of the same quality at our local home improvement store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Functional","review":"If you are looking for a beautiful, well-priced kitchen faucet with sprayer, this is it!

So I read the other reviews for this product and couldn't believe that everyone had given it rave reviews.You can't beat the price either, which was initially what had caught my attention. I went to many hardware stores in my area to price comparison shop, but they all wanted twice the amount for this product. It's a great buy.It was easy to install and it works like a dream. It looks great with my sink too. The sprayer is amazingly powerful. I am so glad I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchen faucets","review":"I originally bought this product because it had good reviews and also the price. I was worried because my old faucet was much heavier. It cost more for the plumber to install than the price of the faucet. I have it for under a month, but if it lasts for a long time, than it was well worth it. Also, as they said, the sprayer is pretty powerful. If you can install yourself, than its definitely a great buy. The only reason I gave it four stars, because my old faucet had the hot and cold hoses attached to it, so we had to purchase new ones which the plumber supplied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Replaced a Moen faucet that was purported to be great. Well, wrong!!! This faucet is sturdy, so far very, very reliable and NO LEAKING!!!

Season Seven went downhill with mostly filler episodes, though Supergirl was a welcome addition. However, Season Eight falls flat on its face. No Lex+No Lionel+Pretty Much No Supergirl+a trashy Doomsday= the worst season of Smallville ever. This season, for the most part, moves at such a snail like pace that Days of Our Lives probably moves fast by comparison.From what I understand, Season Nine so far REALLY goes back to Season Six like quality. Perhaps the quality went up because of the writer's strike- the writers could sit at home and think of some good Smallville for a change. Regardless, you would do yourself a lot of justice to just skip over Season Eight and move directly to Season Nine."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Satisfaction Guarantee","review":"I love this product it came quickly and in perfect condition, and not to mention you cant beat the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Committed but dissapointed","review":"This episode was a dissapointing disconnected drama that made little sense. The villan was underdeveloped and the premise of torture for marital bliss was just wierd and almost uninteresting. the twist with Lois and Clark was really good but they didn't take it far enough to make it meaningful. Lois' excuse about taking off the finger monitor was a lame way to get her our of admitting she loved Clark. It all was a dissapointment for what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad for words","review":"My father owns an original copy of the 1930s superman comic book, and I grew up knowing how superman really became the man of steel. This series is not it. Perhaps when DC comics killed superman several years ago with Doomsday it allowed the producers of this show to butcher the true superhero legend.I lay awake in my bed every night crying because future generations will come to think that this is how the story is. It's so sad:(I keep hoping and praying that when the final episode of smallville airs that this particular clark will become a different super hero.

I don't know what's going on with Lana only that perhaps her contract requries her to still be on the show. Why is lex out of the picture - is he pregnant or something? I've not been this dissapointed in what was a solid creative show than now. Please tell me this is a guest director, or some sort of spoof that will be somehow undone by a time machine or something much more plausable than the action in the past two episodes.It hurts, like watching your child fail only you can't be there in any way to make it better other than resign and go watch Friends reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"Smallville was in excellent conditon and the selller did a fine job in sending it to me quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-flying superman is not superman.","review":"I was very disapointed in this season of Smallville, and actually the last season was somewhat disapointing as well. How can we be in season eight and Clark is not able to fly yet? I am tired of the constant bickering between Clark and Oliver.

If you like the whole boring 70 years of Lois and Clark, then you may want to watch this season or just buy Lois and Clark with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher.

But that is no reason to pan the season and the series.Smallville has to be one of the longest running live-action superhero television shows out there. Honestly besides Watchmen, this is all DC has going for it. ;) Smallville's use of recycled sci-fi actors makes me feel nostalgic and I enjoy seeing fresh characters even if they are for only one episode.They are doing the best they can with what they have, and I think it is worth the time to watch it.

If the writing team can't hold the standard/quality, then the show needs to end. Yet, why worry about a little thing like quality, when money is on the other end. Anyways, the 8th season rambled all over the place, and not one episode was great. There were a couple that were good, but that is myself being polite.

So there's no way the characters could be too dumb not to figure out what clark looked like with huge frames! Rosenbaum and Glover are gone, so this means we've got a middle school acting level on our hands. Stories are pointless...Tom Welling is 32! When does superman really come out!? when he's 40???? No, even if they do give us the suit their probably gonna turn it into something extremely inadequate. like give him a hood and a cape. leave the S logo out and the tights.

Nothing like the comics where doomsday fights superman to the death.Dream secuence with clark ripped in half alone was enough for me.

Four seasons one way, the next four with a new slim design, and now with that stupid and hugely breakable plastic sleeves that mess all the discs.Please, Warner bros people... be a little more respectul to the fans. After all, we pay your bills. Decide and overall \\"MANTEIN\\" the packaging of one tv show exactly the same from the first to its final season.

Miller delivers again with an in depth character study as well as, dare I say it, a entirely amusing episode . . . on purpose! Fans were introduced to Zatanna Zatara, wonderfully portrayed by Serinda Swan. Tom Welling and Erica Durance had dual roles. Erica played Lois and Chloe (who takes on the appearance of Lois) and Tom played ever growing Clark and a Clark Kent who is a normal newspaperman without the responsibilities of super powers.

The season ender to this show was abysmal and I really wish I could unsee it.No I won't buy the DVD, nor should you buy it as a gift for someone who watches Smallville unless they specifically request this season.

The writing's better.","review":"This was unequivocally the worst season of Smallville yet. Being Smallville, it had shining moments, like Legion and Beast, but the bad moments far outweigh the good. Every character gets thrown through the musical-traits machine multiple times throughout the season, and the season finale makes you wish you hadn't wasted your time.The big Doomsday showdown apparently warranted all of five minutes after an entire season of buildup and you're not even sure whether Supes was there to finish it till they spell it out in the tag. Oh, and Jimmy Olsen is really his big brother Henry. Cause brothers always have the same freaking name.

Also she felt that, as do I, that the Justice League needs to come out to play more. They are a large part of the lore of Superman. This season seems like it is becoming something like a One Tree Hill or some other teen angst tv show more then it used to be.Also, as others have stated the package design is terrible. Mine had SIX broken pieces of plastic and the whole bottom part where the bottom cylinder fits down was totally shattered. The first 4 seasons are great packages, after that the package has gotten terrible.I emailed the WB to let them know about my broken package but of course no response, as they already have my money I assume.So overall would almost give this season a three as it is OK, barely, but the package design knocks it down a star, so 2 stars it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Smallville started out with such promise. But somewhere along the way it got derailed. Maybe it was the repetitive nature of each episode. Maybe it was the hokey dialogue, 1 dimensional characters or uninspired plot lines. All three? I was hoping when they finally pushed him out of Smallville and into Metropolis that the show would get more interesting, but alas, that never happened. Unfortunately, this show is best enjoyed for free.

The thing they used to do the best, have four or five stories going on inside the big story, were gone. They couldn't even do one story well. If it is a bad this year as last, I hope they end it, and not torture knowing how great season 1-7 were.

The start of the season is good, with chloe's wedding, but after that episode when Lana comes back, it tanks.I have watched Smallville from the beginning and I greatly enjoy it. The acting and story-line is great. The biggest flaw in season 8 is Lex Luthor, or the lack of Lex. To me, Lex is an ancher of the show. You could ask anyone who the villin in Superman/Smallvile is, I doubt they would say Tess Mercer, they would say \\"Lex Luthor\\". I know that the actor who played lex (Micheal Rosenbaum) wanted out, but then you either get a new actor or possibly wrap the show up.Like I said earlier, season 8 is good up until the episode \\"Bride\\" from then on it really goes down hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get enough!","review":"Mike is a funny guy and this is a great DVD collection, nuff said!

This is a lively, chaotic and totally charming story of the rough and seedy side of Tel Aviv, where illegal immigrants are exploited for their labor by Shimi, a tough capitalist with a heart of gold. There are many pungent personalities, family conflicts, and a moral challenge to the protagonist, who learns to sell out his spiritual quest for a quick buck - at least for a while. A very Israeli take on itself, where everyone is always striving to capture some small advantage however they can. The acting is uniformly superb. Very funny and teaches more about contemporary Israel than fifty books about the Palestine conflict.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandbaby loves them!","review":"I bought these suction cup toys for my grandson.

It will stick for several seconds, then you can see it self release. We had better luck with the fascination station (this will stay most of the time), though we purchased the set so we could switch between the two to keep interest levels up. Part of the problem may be the texture of our high chair tray (Eddie Bauer), but we were also unable to get the cow to stick to the counter or our table.****Since I reviewed these toys, I have taken them away from my son because paint from the cow jumps over the moon scraped off while he was teething on it.

For us the suction worked just fine, but it was sort of moot since he was able to pull it off of the suction base and play with it. Either way, the music and sounds it produced really kept him entertained.Then two weeks later it stopped working. Not a sound, not a peep. So I pulled out my screw driver set to see if I could change the battery. Well, the toy uses triangle shaped slots in the screw head, so none of my screw drivers (slot, phillips, hex) work. So now I can't change the battery and I have a worthless toy (he's bored with it now that it doesn't make sounds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't stick & way too loud!","review":"We got this set for our 3 month old twins, hoping to entertain them enough for us to finish a meal.The cow doesn't stick for more than a couple seconds, and is top heavy so it hit my son in the head when it fell. It is a relatively boring toy, doesn't spin well, and it is way too loud, especially for a toy that is right in front of your baby!The other toy is better, but it also does not stick for long. Since it comes off the base, they can at least still use it and do seem to like it. The black and white part that sticks in the base is a nice size for their hands to grasp.

The \\"Donald Strachey\\" detective mysteries, (any of the four), or even \\"SAVE ME\\". These allow him to command the screen with a presence that is not unlike a young James Gagney!

This makes no sense until one notices that the few five-star ratings appear to have been made by the film's marketing department. The positive \\"reviews\\" have so clearly been taken from the film's promotional material.

I would guess that the idea of \\"novelizing\\" an actual event seemed like a good one to Cambor but in her hands this effort falls flat even though there are some beautifully written passages as in Julia's thoughts after the death of 2 of her children: \\"..the charm, the tenderness, the wit she'd always counted on, that her mother always said were part of her good character, had disappeared like so much smoke. She was left hollowed, fractured, parched.\\" What I'm saying is that Kathleen Cambor is a fine writer but her talents are not suited to this particular subject. What happens is, because there is so much exposition needed to propell this story, that Cambor's talent is squandered. \\"In the Sunlight in a Beautiful Garden\\" is a noble failure but a failure nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read David McCullough's book","review":"It was a long haul reading this book. So many fictionalized relationships, so little real 1889 flood material. Don't read this one--read \\"The Johnstown Flood\\" by David McCullough. The story of the Johnstown Flood of 1889 is fascinating. It is best portrayed by the Johnstown Flood Museum with its Oscar-winning film, the museum at the Flood Memorial Site, and the soon-to-open Heritage Discovery Center. Anyone with a bit of interest in the 1889 Flood and Johnstown's role in the Industrial Revolution should come visit us, esp. during Labor Day Weekend when we have the annual Johnstown FolkFest.

Oleksak, Johnstown, PA"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd drown in a flood before recommending this book","review":"When I picked up this book, I was genuinely excited at the prospect of learning more about the Johnstown flood and the lives of those who perished. My excitement quickly waned as I plodded through the first 237 pages with not so much as a deep puddle in sight. Cambor spends the majority of the novel developing several different characters and, oddly, relates each character's entire family history in an attempt to emotionally engage the reader once the flood strikes. However, the 10 or so pages that actually deal with the flood only mention most of these characters in passing. I'm guessing the author did a great job of imagining the lives of the real people who were effected by the flood, but the effort is lost on those of us who are not Johnstown flood historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Let's face it, when writing bout the Johnstown flood, the flood is the focal point. The attempt to develop fictional characters, and involve us in their pre-flood lives, falls flat. The characters are muddled and their interaction sterile. You just don't care. There is barely a mention of the dam and leaks and any threat of flood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start set the pace . . .","review":"Quite possibly the slowest book that I ever read! This book - featured to be about the Johnstown flood - is trying to tell too many stories about characters who you do not come to care about.

When the flood occurs, this devestating event barely gets a paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn ... this book put me to sleep!","review":"I had the bad luck to be stuck on a 5-hour flight with only this book. All I can say is that is was one of the better sleep aids I have tried. Acording to the summary in the jacket, it was supposed to chronicle the lives of some of the people who were devastated by the South Fork flood in 1889.What the blurbs and reviews fail to mention is that the flood doesn't actually happen until the last few pages of the book. Leading up to the flood, the reader is dragged through a few hundred pages of vapid, shallow anecdotes of the lead characters' lives, which are at best difficult to follow and at worst utterly mind-numbing.I forced myself to finish it for lack of anything better to do, but would not recommend it to any but the most starved for diversion.And, by the way, I am a native Pennsylvanian, so I really expected better.

The author brings in more characters than is necessary and describes their entire personal history. Though the description of the book states that it is about a flooding of a town in 1889, this vital event does not occur until page 240 (there are only 258 pages in the book). In fact, the flood is only described for seven pages before the narration is projected into 1917. Therefore, there is little room for any resolution to these characters that the author has so painstakingly described. In addition, the introduction of the characters seemed contrived and almost appeared as character sketches as opposed to three dimensional people. Possibly more upsetting, is the fact that there is potential in this novel to be an epic in historical fiction. However, in its current state, it falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this book","review":"what a drag. Hard to follow who the characters were and what they had to with the Johnstown flood.

Shetranscends the best of historical fiction (my favorite genre)with a truly poetic combining of fact and fiction, characterand plot, action and contemplation that is truly mesmerizing.Her luminous prose far surpasses any I've read recently(including several very well-received books). But her greatestaccomplishment is to make her reader experience the gut-wrenching, profound sense of loss that people of 1889 (or of any other time with great national disaster--such as September 11th) must have experienced.

Now, I doubt if I'll ever read Alice Hoffman again. The characters in the book were completely unsympathetic and uninteresting. Many of the characters were underdeveloped. The main character, Lucy, was completely unbelievable. I found myself thinking many times, \\"Yeah, right, a real mom would NEVER act that way!\\" The only reason I give the book two stars is that I like Hoffman's style and use of words to paint a picture.

Lucy's son is missing so she screws the nasty policeman? What is that all about? I cared nothing for any of the characters and could not even bear to finish the book.I am seriously thinking of starting my next barbeque with this book.

I soon found that was the only great thing about this book.Hoffman throws little bits of philosophical thoughts at the beginnings and ends of her chapters, to sound more quotable. But overall who would want to quote phrases like \\"the meanest boy in Verity\\". The book was slow-moving, repetitive, predictable, and frankly ridiculous. Why would anyone want to have sex with a crazy cop with an ugly face and two vicious dogs who stalked you? I think that the characters are warped and I in no way could relate to any of them. The writing wasn't bad, but Hoffman needs to build a better plot.I may just have to keep this book around for occations when I need a good nap or feel like reading about some people who are possibly more annoying that my co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This is my first Alice Hoffman book, but I know it won't be the last.

This brings her closer to officer Julian who is a bit of an enigma. He believes he's ugly and relates better to his canine companions than to people. If this were written by another author I'd expect the two to track down the missing kids and fall into a blissfull love affair but it's a Hoffmann novel and her stories are more complicated and melancholy.This book, like the others I've read by Hoffmann, focuses more on its offbeat characters than it does the mystery and that's fine by me. It's bittersweet and doesn't go where you expect it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read!!!","review":"This book tells about a city in Florida, Verity, where more divorced women from New York reside.

This book is no exception.Turtle Moon was actually the first of her books which I read. I became an avid fan following this first experience. Ms. Hoffman delves into the richness of human relationships while exploring the mystical dimensions which we can all experience if we open ourselves to them. This book may just give you a hankering that will lead you in that direction.Turtle Moon is a book with a strong spiritual theme. Being the author of a spiritually-oriented book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I always appreciate books that explore this oftentimes hidden dimension of the human experience. Turtle Moon will help you make a soul connection.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Dramatic Mystery","review":"TURTLE MOON is all a mystery should be.

Hoffman is a talented story teller who adds an interesting otherworldliness to her novels but there is not much else about her style to grab on to. The prose is basic, the characters under developed, and some of the events are so implausible that they become irksome. She also tends to recreate the divorced or unhappily married woman with a mixed up teenager in her books. In this particular book the numerous divorced female characters all blend together. This makes it difficult to remember who is who and what their histories are (something that you need to follow for the story to make sense). All in all, Hoffman is a great read for the train or beach she but doesn't really challenge or satisfy me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hoffman Hit!","review":"Alice Hoffman has scored again with Turtle Moon, a grown up fairy tale with a twist. I love how Hoffman's books deal with characters who may be unlovely on the outside, but who turn out out to be beautiful on the inside (and vice versa!). Overall, her characters are heartbreakingly human, and my heart breaks everytime I read Hoffman's books. So cathartic; and so irresitable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Farm Animal Cookie Cutters","review":"We got the cookie cutters for our grandson, we use them to cut out pancakes, cheese, toast, bread, and he loves the animal shapes.

I even tried putting two of these flower boxes holders next to each other and sitting one flower box on both to distribute the weight and it still bent and was about to fall off.

It should be noted that the product description boasts of being able to support this size of planter box.

Out of the box, one rests perfectly on the railing and is not influenced by the weight of the container. The second one droops several degrees so the plant container (smaller than the HoldAll Holder) slides to the front and is at an angle. Not ideal. I haven't seen another skinny iron railing solution, so this will do for now. I am considering trying to bend the metal to make a better fit, but I don't want to reduce what limited strength it has, so I may try and cut a piece of plywood to stick under the bar that cantilevers the weight off of the rails to support it some."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Recommend!!!.","review":"I purchased these and received them today, Jun 11, 2012.

The game features a lot, but the guide isn't helpful at all. The maps here really aren't detailed enough anyway. The game guides maps and hints just aren't as detailed or as built to the level at all. This one will surely give you enough trouble, so you can't even eliminate Andross, and unlock all those hidden courses.

Finally, it has a retractable cord of two feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail me Two times!","review":"The first one dead in 48 hours.The second dead in two days.The third one, ..., not a chance, order canceled.

And the cord does look flimsy, but I have had no problems with it yet, and the retracting cord feature is great. The mouse is responsive and predictable, the two most important characteristics for my money.The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is a personal quirk. Five stars is supposed to mean \\"I love it\\", and I make a practice of not falling in love with inanimate objects. (Hey, we're all entitled to some quirks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS MOUSE","review":"Got this for my laptop when I put my wired optical mouse to my desktop.

I sent it back for a refund.two stars because when it worked, it was awesome. I needed very little movement to reach the extremities of the screen. The problem (as mentioned) was the wheel. The mouse itself was very light and very cheap feeling. I would suggest going for one of the 8 dollar mini mice vs. this $15 one.ohh... and the case is garbage also. there wasn't anything redeeming about it so don't let it sway you in your purchase decision.****update****i returned it for a refund. amazon.com has an awesome policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but poor quality","review":"the left-click button (kind of important) is sticking/not always working already, and i just bought this mouse 2 months ago.i use it every time i am on my laptop because the dell touchpad broke and i couldn't afford the time to ship it out for service. so maybe it would be ok if you only use the mouse occasionally. but i doubt it.it's kind of light and plastic-y and a little too skinny (not wide enough) to feel really comfortable. (i only use mini mouses because they're more convenient to carry around, and i've never really felt this way until i got this one, which is less round and more rectangular/narrow than others of a more standard shape.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This item broke within two months. I'd give it zero stars if I could. >:(It's this kind of situation that makes me think about using Amazon less, since \\"the window for returns\\" is over.

This is the second time a piece of IOGEAR equipment failed on me within weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went bad after three months","review":"In my opinion, a computer mouse is one of those things that should just work. It should work perfectly every time, all the time, and should last for at least a couple of years. I would much rather pay a few more dollars to get something I could depend on -- after all, I use it for a few hours every single day.After only three months, the left mouse button of this device started to flake out. It would only register a click sporadically, and I found I had to click harder and more firmly, and with each passing day, my frustration just increased. After reading some other negative reviews here, I see that I am not alone. I'd suggest you save yourself some aggravation, and buy something more dependable (I wish I knew what to recommend, but I don't.)By the way, I bought two. They were both broken within the first three months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mouse ever!","review":"The tall skinny feel is all wrong but that's opinion. The real trouble is the poorly designed buttons. The tactile \\"click\\" happens before the real mouse click is registered. It was frustrating to click and nothing happens on the computer. It would take three tries sometime to actually get the click in, and trying to get a double click out of it led to beating on the mouse to get a consistent response. I tossed it in the garbage. Could have been a manufacturing defect but looking at the internals, I think it's just the design. I'm happy with my targus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a year of use","review":"Unfortunately this mouse lasted only about 6 months or so.

Otherwise we have to help when she is playing her Kindergarten game or reader rabbit series. This mouse broke within less than 20 mins of her using it, the wires fell out right where they go into the mouse.

She has used it for few days now and it has not failed at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Retract","review":"The retractor mechanism didn't work properly from Day 1. It would either get stuck or tangled, and after a week it broke completely. Also the left clicker button is a bit stiff, so sometimes it's hard to double click quickly. And the mouse is quite tiny. On the bright side, it's a lovely red color and it comes with a cute carrying pouch. But I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working well","review":"Bought it a few months ago based on good reviews, but not working well for me.

I figured how hard could it be find a basic replacement. Harder than I thought, apparently. This Iomega mouse looked cheap right out of the box and feels very flimsy. All of which I could get over if it was actually functional, but it's not. It's rather insensitive to movement so you find yourself jiggling it around to get it to start moving your cursor?! If you don't use it for a few minutes, it appears to go to \\"sleep\\". You have to click a button or tap it on the desktop to wake it up and remind it to... be a mouse! Remarkable they would sell a product like this. I emphatically recommend you try a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart after about 3 uses","review":"Thought it was great when I first used it, as it was nice for travel.

Today, 14 months after purchase, the mouse just stopped working altogether. A pretty poor value."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"Do not even waste your money on this item! TOTALLY OVERPRICED! The item arrived and is only the size of a deck of cards, for the ENTIRE PRODUCT!

Trust me, move on and buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a Spectacle","review":"There are three major problems with this movie. First, the movie is truly boring. I have never been able to sit through this without falling asleep. It makes El Cid look hyperactive. You never really care what happens to these characters. Second, Sophia Loren. She never looks less than glamourous and perfect no matter how dirty the surroundings. Every hair is always in place, makeup perfect, and her gowns (she never wears \\"clothes\\") look like something from Paris in the 1960's and are always clean and ironed. Ridiculous. Third, Samuel Bronston. He had a knack for making long and static movies. Sometimes shorter is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch This . Get :\\" I Claudius\\" Instead.","review":"If you are a serious student of history don't watch this. It will seem very inaccurate and horrendously petty, especially the last part when the soldiers were running around and fighting to get some gold in their hands. I was very disappointed with this film. The epic drama:\\"I Claudius\\" is way, way, better. In fact, there's no comparison what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fall of the Bronston Empire","review":"This bloated, overlong epic marked the virtual end of multi-million dollar spectacular movies produced in the late fifties and early sixties. Boasting the largest budget ever at the time, it also grossed the least amount of money for this sort of film (a mere $500K). Its screenwriter, Philip Yordan, once told me that after this movie \\"the banks closed their doors whenever they saw Sam Bronston coming.\\" Despite its impressive cast, the film is downright dreary. How did such a huge film on such a fascinating subject go so terribly wrong? It's too bad, really, because I miss this kind of spectacle with thousands of \\"live\\" extras and fabulous, rousing music scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elongated.","review":"'Fall of the Roman Empire' is vastly superior to its remake, 'Gladiator', but that's not saying much. Its advantages include genuine locations and rich art design over bland CGI; elements of perversion culled from Greek tragedy and Wagner; sly moments of directorial humour at the sheer lumbering witlessness of the whole enterprise; and an allegory for an America cracking up over Vietnam, civil rights, the 1960s. Besides that, it's just like every other historical epic you've ever seen, except longer and less camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is great","review":"I recently purchased and viewed Fall of the Roman Empire on DVD in Widescreen and Dolby Digital Stereo format. I believe the 5 stars were earned due to great scripting, direction by Anthony Mann, and music of Dimitri Tiomkin. The action scenes and music are further enhanced by the widescreen and dolby of the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is not so great movie but still enjoyable.At last available in a DVD with decent picture and sound, along with mind blowing extras. This limited collector's edition comes with 1 additional booklet and few art cards. Even though I purchased the Limited Edition, I feel like the goodies not worth the additional money I paid. Also the box will eat up more space in your DVD rack. So buying theThe Fall Of The Roman Empire (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)will be a good deal. I highly recommend this along with .El Cid (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)to any classic DVD collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Swords, sandalls and longing looks.","review":"Long and lumbering it takes awhile for anything to actually happen. I found the award winning music score to be intrusive. Stephen Boyd and Sofia Loren are pleasant to look at, but beneath that surface there's not much there. Boyd was an interesting overlooked actor, type-cast after his turn in Ben-Hur,it would have been interesting to have seen him as Antony in \\"Cleopatra\\". Alec Guiness and James Mason were outstanding and Christopher Plummer delightfully chews the oppulant scenery as the mad/bad emperor Commodus. The lavish sets and crowds were truly awe inspired. Unlike the computor generated effects of Gladiator, they actually built the sets and populated them with real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall of the Roman Empire Over 3 Hours!","review":"I bought this DVD because it's a favorite of mine. I didn't care if it was the original 185 minute version or the 170 edited version. When I received the movie it was the 185 minute cut! This film is one of the best ever made!

The problem is that you keep watching the movie with the hopes that it will get better. It never does. I am a great fan of Sophia Loren and I am surprised that she agreed to participate in such a farce. The movie's concept had such potential, but fails miserably. The battle scenes are truly pathetic, compared to movies made during that time frame.

Don't get me wrong, I love Quo Vadis, Gladiator, Ben Hur, The Robe, Spartacus, and Demetrius and the Gladiators, but this one is a flop. I can't understand why so many folks rave on about it. The music is all wrong, and the slow paced script and wooden dialogue obviously failed to inspire the actors, which is a pity because many of them were the best we have ever seen. The DVD's themselves are great, the excellent extras are far more interesting than the film itself. Save your money and buy the other ones I've listed . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From an Epic Epic","review":"Mounting this sweeping saga may have been a logistical triumph, but it makes for a soggy movie. Dire dialogue, incorporating great slabs of expository speechifying that would be laughable if it weren't so dull -- Roman princes and pro-consuls giving each other redundant history lessons on the glory of Rome (for the edification, of course, of the audience) -- characters that were Hollywood cliches for toga epics by 1964, and legions endlessly prancing around on horseback all conspire to emphasize Sophia Loren's sullen demeanor. Maybe in her youth, and in her native language, she was a competent actor, but English dialogue and the burden of being one of the great beauties of the age seem consistently to have reduced her to displaying the emotional range of a bad case of constipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall of the Roman Empire","review":"It is a great movie when I saw it when it first came out: BUT this BLY-RAY isonly to be seen on a REG \\"B\\" player, and I did not see it in the promo that itwill only play on Reg \\"B\\" which Amazon may have left out?Was it a mistake on sending the wrong type or was I not looking in the rightplace before I purchased this procuct?By the way it did get here on the 16th of July, which was great, but sorry tosay,- I will not be able to see it on the 19th of July my birthday!SHAME ON YOU ALL!?!

I was also bothered by the fact that the film is supposed to be telling the story about an important historical event and Hollywood chose to fictionalize the story. One of the two primary characters upon which the story is built is a complete fabrication. I think historical stories in film should follow the actual events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the DVD version ??","review":"As with El Cid, I was anticipating the release of \\"Fall of..\\" on a remastered and widescreen DVD release during April of this year. Now the release of this movie has been postponed or withdrawn, with no explanation. I have seen a DVD version of this movie being sold on EBay. It seems to have been pressed in the Far East and is being sold as a new DVD in a sealed package. The one star rating is for the poor quality VHS pan & scan version being sold.

I had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rome as it once was","review":"This is an excellent film from many perspectives, but in one way it is unique -- its effort to portray accurately the look of imperial Rome. Those who have carefully walked over the Roman Forum and Capitoline Hill will recognize many specific buldings, not just the great temples but also the commercial buildings around the Forum. In Ben Hur, by contrast, the set for the Roman Forum was mostly conjured out of thin air.

Bradbury writing about the fantasy world of Hollywood is a very natural coupling, and gives Bradbury an amazing canvas unto which he can paint his complex, interesting characters. There is a constant battle for attention between the place and the characters, a tension that helps rather than hinders the story.The plotting is not Bradbury's best. The central mystery of the novel is rather translucent. However this is more than made up for by Bradbury's lyrical writing, his characterization, and the magic that runs like an electrical pulse through the novel. If this is your first foray into Bradbury's work, I would recommend you readThe Martian ChroniclesorFarenheit 451orThe Illustrated Maninstead. If you know and love Bradbury, dive right in."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"Is this the same guy who wrote all those brilliant stories?

This woman is an aberration for serious NDE research and an insult to the heroic work of real scientists like R. Moody, P. van Lommel, Chris Carter, J. Long, E. Alexander, M. Sabom, P.

The instructions and advice are extremely basic, almost to the point where you'd need another book to supplement this one. Kudos to Cindy for appearing in the photos sans makeup, but some of the 'oh-she-doesn't-look-so-great-without-makeup-either' effect is diluted by the fact that she looks nearly perfect even without wearing cosmetics.

The author obviously has little real world hands on experience with DOS or Windows. It is far to simplistic to use for a serious study guide and the huge number of errors will seriously confuse a beginner. Don't waste your money on this book. You would be much better off to get copies of Windows 3.1 and DOS, install them, read the manuals, and the help files. To make matters worse, about one third of this book is dedicated to things that have nothing to do with the A+ Certification exam.

I truly miss those shows at Tremont and especially Fat City. There was no better venue for seeing a Spite show than Fat City....talk about up close and personal!Anyway, I have promoted these guys to everyone I know and if you like metal that doesn't sound like everything else out there, then this is for you. It really doesn't get any better than this. This stuff was cutting edge when it came out, and is still way ahead of new stuff coming out today. IMO, A LOT of other bands still have some catching up to do.Sorry for Dans family and good to see his sis here....I still love Spite.

The third guy said he would install it, 5 hours at $65.00 per hour but not guarantee anything because they have been known to screw up the vehicle once they are installed.

I checked the web site and found a so called fix, this did not work. We tried some other adjustments with the tach mode and that did not work.

The wide-angle ads a nice crisp touch and the telephoto does help with distant stationary objects but you must have a very steady hand, the macro lens works for super bright settings.The adapter needs several turns to fit in, so it's not very practical to switch lenses on the go. If you are open to experimentation you can try using the lenses without the adapter (making sure the lenses don't touch), keeping the adapter on and fashioning a new cap, etc. a lot of things to do with this extra equipment on an otherwise \\"semi-pro\\" cameraIf you do go with this purchase remember that you will have to keep everything extra-clean since you will be working with basically three exposed lenses.

I own a Kodak Z712 IS and I love the camera. This lens just doesn't do the job though. Sure, it improves your zoom, but that's about it. On the Opteka site it says that this lens actually IMPROVES picture quality. Wrong! First off, you need a tripod or your pictures will turn out fuzzy most of the time. Second, every pic I've taken looks like I took it through a window. Would you want to take pictures of subject in your yard from inside your house and through a closed window? Not me, and that's what my pictures look like. My camera's pictures come out much better without the lens. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I don't think so. I followed the directions.

Although, Swartt had SIX claws, which made him seem like a particularly cunning villian, and it was neat to see how that heritage passed to Veil, and THAT is why he was in the story. And, if you can't handle slow reading, there isn't a book in the series that you should read.

They were Redwall, Martin the Warrior, Mossflower, The Outcast of Redwall, Salamandastron, Mattimeo, and Marlfox. Of those books, The Outcast was the worst,followed by Mattimeo. Both books had a gloomy feeling to them, but Mattimeo's characters were so god that they almost disguised that. The Outcast, however has very shallow characters. The book was more boring than the other books. I guess that any Redwall fan has to read it, but I don't reccomend it to those new to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore Redwall Buffs Only","review":"I expected better from Brian Jacques!

The plot and ending are predictable. The characters are annoying and unintelligent. Another example of bad writing.

Skip this book, go back and read 'Mossflower' or 'Mariel of Redwall' again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the title, dude?","review":"I wanted to read about a character that wasn't usual do-gooder Redwall mouse or squirrel or whatever. So I thought, a story about a shade of grey type ferret. AN ACTUAL CHANGE! How about that? Instead we get Super-Badger and the acutal OUTCASTING doesn't even happen until the LAST PAGE of Book 2 (of 3 btw). The (non) story between swartt and his dirty little secret son was so much more interesting than anything between that friggin badger and stupid bird. If you're going to call this \\"Outcast of Redwall\\", make it about the Outcast of Redwall. This should have been called \\"Another Invincible Badger in the Land of Mossflower\\". Horrible, just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, though very formulated.","review":"Don't get me wrong - Outcast of Redwall is a positivly stunning book by my favorite author, Brian Jaques, but it seems so much the same as his other books! I've read quite a few Redwall tales, and they all have the same theme and basic story elements. If Jaques could make a totally original Redwall story, I think it would be great. The first Redwall story, \\"Redwall\\" still seems to me to be the best one. But, I'm not going to stop reading Redwall books anytime soon. So keep 'em coming, Brian, and we'll keep reading 'em!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"If you are a first time reader of Brian Jacques, I recommend you read this book!I loved this book, because it drew me into a world of chivalrous fighters and vile villians.Ever since reading The Outcast of Redwall,I have been hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To good to put down.","review":"Like all other redwall books this one was great.

Because the title said the outcast of redwall, (Which is Veil by the way.) but it really just tells the story about Sunflash, a badger-lord. I wish they told the child-hood of Veil more, and less about the badger. I also didn't like the ending. If you like the redwall books, then go ahead read it. But check it out from a libary first, before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Redwalls","review":"This is a story of Sunflash the Mace, the missing son of Bella,and his enemy, Swartt Sixclaw (mainly), and Swartt's strengh andcunning to keeping himself alive while searching for Sunflash. It has very little to do of the outcast, especially because he got outcasted at the very end of part 2. All he really did was save a mouses life, and betrayed his father. Every chapter had something exiting, and has alot of battles unlike some other redwalls, such as Pearls of Lutra. This does not match up to Brain Jacque's novel of Redwall and Mariel of Redwall, lacking some magic it had in those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book","review":"This story about a orphan bager and his kestrel friend,Skarleth.mean while at the abbey, Veil, the ferret was sent out of the for almost killing a abbey creature.Brian Jacques,stars still on this book and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the charts!","review":"I have to say this is the out there Redwall book he wrote.Thats a good thing though.He makes this one a little diffrent from the rest.He takes us to a whole new diffrent settings and characters.He really doesn't focus on Redwall though.I mean yes it is there but not like the others times he writes it.This is an excellent book you really need to get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outcast of Redwall","review":"I have to say, this is not the best Redwall book, but it is exciting. My favorite characters are the badgers. I love the redwall badgers, but they are especially great in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Adventure Every Page...","review":"You should read this book if you have a good imagination. The characters will stretch it until you don't what's real and what's not, the animals have as much a variety of characteristics as a room of 200 people. Some make you laugh until your belly aches, and some make you cry until your eyes hurt. It's a wonderful book, all Brian Jacques' books are. I encourage you to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good use of secondary character, interesting plot.","review":"Outcast of Redwall is a wonderful book, though it has been talke dabotu in chats that Sunflash was pictured all to invinceably, though some may not agree. It lives up to the standards of all redwall books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but sad.","review":"This book is awesome. I'll totally give it that. The only thing I didn't like about it is it's so sad. There were just so many parts that made me feel dissapointed, betrayed, and just sad. There is an amazing battle near the end, which is great. So, all in all, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Redwall book yet","review":"Like most book series, Redwall can be a bit unaccessible without reading the whole series from oldest to new. Also alot of the plots repeat themselves. But in Outcast, author Brian Jacques really treats his readers with the struggle that young Veil has trying to get Redwallers off his back, but soon ends up sacrificing himself for their survival.Also, Jacques doesn't actually have any situations in Redwall occuring until halfway into the book, which lets Jacques show much more surprising and interesting characters than he does in his other books. My favorite character has to be Swartt Sixclaw, who is also the most unique, whereas characters like Veil and Sunflash are too usual in a book like this. Sixclaw is really funny all through this book, constantly insulting his horde until they fall apart.This and Martin the Warrior are probably the best Redwall books and are some of the first you should ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK!","review":"The Outcast of Redwall is one of the best books ever written! It deserves 500 stars! It is about Sunflash the Mace, lord of Salamandastron, Swartt Sixclaw, a weasel, and Swartt's son Veil. It has a very intriguing plot where Sunflash the Mace and Swartt Sixclaw swear to kill each other and Veil is taken in at Redwall when just a baby. He is cast out seasons later for trying to commit a murder as well as many other things. The end is totally unpridictable and very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept - Poor follow through","review":"This is the first novel I have read in the Redwall series and it was an upset. I could not tell if this book was for adults or children? The book could have been a mesmerizing battle of good and evil but the story was padded with too much cheese. Why do I have to know everything these creatures eat for dinner anyway? The concept of Redwall seems very interesting but if the other books are similar to this one I will not hold my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"News flash: Lesbians do not have to come to a tragic end!","review":"I thought we had progressed away from this punish-the-deviant-lesbian theme that is a throw-back to the 50s but apparently not. I had high hopes for the story ending well but suddenly it veered off just before the end. Oddly enough, I know several of my fellow vagetarians who work in the therapy world who simply adore this movie, but I can't understand why. Don't they see enough tragedy claiming our LGBT population? Perhaps you'll like it as they do, but I am not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for grown-ups","review":"The manufacturer fails to mention that the strap that comes with this mask is very small and won't fit any grown up. I kept it at the loosest setting and it still wouldn't go around my head (which is relatively small compared to most people). Thinking it to be just the strap wanting to \\"break in\\", I tried forcing it around my head. Within a few minutes in the water, it opened up from the strain.Again, this item is just unusable by a grown-up, which the manufacturer fails to mention anywhere on the product packaging or advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"portable ice therapy at it's best","review":"The design concept is excellent and 100% functional, the only drawback I find is the small capacity of the container for a runner's post race ice therapy...I recomend you buy 2 instead. Other than that it's a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little ice stick","review":"I am a treatment massage therapist and this little ice stick is great for doing cryotherapy and cross fiber friction. I use it in absence of a freezer at my current job. It gets the job done, unfortunately I go through the entire stick in one massage- although the carrying case will keep the ice for several hours before I use it. The only downside is the ice doesnt grip well after it starts to melt and you may have to hold the plunger to keep the ice from retracting back into the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Massager","review":"This is great for cold massagess on any limb and also bee stings.

It is amazingly heart felt and brings into perspective how much one person can accomplish let alone many.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for learning painter","review":"Painter 5 Complete is not a good introduction for the beginner or intermediate user. I have found I learned much more stumbling around in the dark or from the official Painter manual that ships with the program.

Buy the Painter5 WoW book instead--although more advanced it will get you up to speed much quicker and more enjoyably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly organized and written.","review":"I'm new to Fractal Painter and was looking for a comprehensive volume with tutorials. This book is written by an artist with what appears to be a focus on people already familiar with version 4 of this software. Incredibly, this is how the book begins, rather than placing the \\"Changes from Version 4\\" in an appendix where it belongs. The text is sloppy when referring to on-screen controls and there is virtually nothing in the way of tutorials. There is nothing that describes concepts that are crucial to working with Painter's quirky controls. I'd recommend staying away from this book unless already an expert with Version 4. Even then, it's pretty bad. Where were the editors when this was written?"},{"rating":"1","title":"150 pages into the book and CD missing images in tutorial.","review":"I wish someone would go through these books first to see if all the images and tutorial items are complete with the instructions. I did a \\"find file\\" on the very first image I was told to open..in the mosaics tutorial..Guitar.jpg, only to find it is not on the CD. So I go to my collection of photos and get one of my own. Then the next tutorial I have to swap CD's to the Painter CD to use one of the images provided on it. I will never get this learning process underway if I can't find images and have to keep changing CD's.

It's a fun toy and takes off easily on the hard floors, but is smaller than expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy again.","review":"I like the colors and the package arrived timely and well packaged. My only problem is that the paper doesn't cut well. I thought maybe I needed a new blade in my cutter, changed it, still tore when cut. I have 2 different brand cutters, both tear the paper. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong and asked my friend to try on both her cutter and mine, tore every time. So if you think that you may have to trim this paper to a smaller size or shape, don't get it. I ended up hand trimming the little jagged pieces off and just don't use it if I need something small.

Don't be discouraged, hennalucent is a wonderful product. I have been using it for years. Its a great way to color your hair without all the harsh chemicals. As for the dryness, you just add more water to the product. It's supposed to be thick when applied which makes it a little harder to work with but it is worth it. You can also add an egg, avocado, or mayonaise to it (all which are conditioners for your hair) to make your hair even shinier. Henna shouldn't expire, its a plant, not chemicals. I had henna that I got from Israel for over 5 years and it still worked properly throughout all 5 years of use.The only thing about henna...it doesn't cover up gray hair. If you are gray hair free, try henna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hennalucent just OK","review":"I got this product because of the reviews I read from the internet.I am allergic to hair dye so I thought I would give this a try sinceit received great reviews. First of all, it did not cover my gray hair. After Iused it, I read in the product insert that it will really not cover gray hair.Second, it made my hair shiny for a while but after a few days the shine was gone.Third, it made me itch a bit but nothing to be alarmed about.I still gave it 2 stars since this is the first time I used it. Maybe onthe 2nd or 3rd application, it will have better results. Also, it's very affordable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake San Marzano in a Can","review":"I bought this brand at a grocery store and by chance am cooking side by side with a can of DOP San Marzano tomatoes from Dani Coop. Major difference is this San Marzano brand apparently (from what I read on internet) is San Marzano variety of plum tomatoe that they grow in Italy except it is grown in California under different conditions. The San Marzano brand is much lighter, almost watery flavor and it does not immediately breakdown i.e. still alot of chunks after slow cooking for 30 minutes. The Dani Coop had intense flavor, a bit on the acidic side and immediately brokedown into a sauce once I put it on the burner. There is a major difference in price as the Dani Coop is around the same price as the SM brand except it is 14.1 oz instead of 28 oz. I would not buy the SM brand again given I was deceived on the San Marzano label (and the expensive price!). I will try other San Marzano brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars?","review":"These are a can full of nasty. Yes, more of a scam than anything. I'm very sorry for the positive reviewers - as there are simply certain things in the culinary world that are a complete 180 degree shift when you have quality and sub-par - tomatoes are one of those things. Tomatoes aren't like pizza - when even the bad ones are pretty good. For a tomato to be good, you need bright &pure tasting fruit, proper acidity, and lack of detracting flavors. These have none of these traits. They taste metallic, processed and bland. So, no offense (ok maybe a little) meant to the positive reviews, but buy and DOC tomatoes and taste next to these. If you can't tell the difference, you probably shouldn't be writing food reviews on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Marketing BS","review":"These are not San Marzano tomatoes at all. Someone was clever enough to name their company San Marzano knowing that naive consumers would be aware of the cache that real DOP San Marzano tomatoes carry and mistakenly think that they were getting a great deal. What they are getting is just a domestic plum tomato. And frankly, these tomatoes are even weak for a domestic whole peeled tomato."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"These are NOT San Marzano tomatoes - they are grown in the USA. They are not only expensive, but OVERPRICED. This is nothing more than deceptive and false advertising. The company should be ashamed of themselves. If you want real San Marzano tomatoes you need read the label carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive branding and a terrible product","review":"I wish I could give this stuff zero stars. It's bad enough that the label is deceptive and obviously meant to mislead consumers, but the product is also awful. I recently was cooking with a friend and asked her to buy a can of San Marzano tomatoes for a recipe we were going to make. Not knowing better, she bought a can of these and I was stunned by how awful they were: small, round, pale, tasteless, mealy, and packed in a tomato-tinged watery liquid. I repeat what others have written here: buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, not San Marzano either...","review":"Everyone knows now that the brand name is San Marzano, but these tomatoes are not grown in this region of Italy nor are they from San Marzano seed. All in all, the product is a round, domestic tomato with added preservatives. What I don't understand is how they can say these are grown from San Marzano seed. If they were from San Marzano seed wouldn't they have an elongated shape rather than a round one? I'm also surprised at how many people think the DOP stamp on other Italian tomatoes are some sort of guarantee of quality. The fact is there are more cans of DOP Italian tomatoes being sold than DOP tomatoes being grown in Italy. You do the math. Most DOP products also have added preservatives and basil. I personally look for natural brands at my local Italian deli for the best luck with tomatoes. The best thing is to try several brands and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing","review":"I was fooled by the San Marzano label and bought 2 cans.

There's been a lot of interest in San Marzano tomatoes lately, and this is just one of the products that's attempting to cash in on that interest. Fortunately, I always read labels, so i wasn't fooled by this product, still, I bought a can just to see what they were like. Terrible! Don't waste your money on these tomatoes. There are many other canned tomatoes on the market, real San Marzanos as well as other types that are more flavorful and sometimes even less expensive.I wanted to rate this product with zero stars, but the posting format requires that it get at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor substitue","review":"I teach pasta class and make sauces.

Someone needs to work out their software bugs as they have a very good product.I am so ashamed Amazon would continue to sell such a product after so many negative reviews. If Amazon had a rating system like Ebay the Datapilot would not get any customers to buy their product.This is also the only product that I have seen that DOES NOT allow a customer to send feedback to the seller.

It is cheaply made and the DVD menu itself is the first dead give away that this was made quickly. It reminds me of an amateur DVD. I think I could have made a better menu and DVD. The extras are terrible to be honest. This season saw the retirement of three legends (Van der Sar, Neville, and Scholes) and the DVD takes about 5 minutes a piece to explain their significance to the club. It is sad really because between the three of those fantastic players so much could have been done but the producers of this DVD went the fastest route possible and came up with the weakest possible composition. I have watched many season reviews and this one is surely not worth your time. Sorry guys but this one sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with everyone else....","review":"I read the reviews, but I still tried to go in with an open mind. But yeah absolutely awful, what makes it bad is the camera angles. Rather than showing the standard telecast goal followed by replays from varied angles, they show only angled replay shots and it really kills it and takes you out of it. If that isn't a deal killer to you than this is pretty much the same as with previous seasons.

But I am very disappointed with this DVD. I own every season review since 1994, but this is by far the worst in terms of pure viewing enjoyment, and production of the DVD. Considering this is our record 19th League Title, you would think that we would have a decent DVD to look back at the season. Most irritating feature is that camera angles keep changing as a goal is about to be scored. It really spoils the viewing of the goals. Some classic games (West Ham away) are somehow edited into a few minutes, not doing justice to the match itself. I think they should re-make another season review and allow fans who bought this junk DVD to exchange them.P.S I love Man Utd...

Horrible Product.","review":"I've been buying these reviews for as long as they've been doing them & always enjoyed them, more recently with my kids who love the whole 'season in a couple of hours' excitement these DVD's USUALLY give you.This one is HORRIBLE though. It must have been edited by someone with A.D.D. I don't know if the ploy was to give us \\"never seen before' camera angles but it just fails miserably as 95% of the time, just as the goalscorer is about to connect with the ball, Mr Editor decides to change angle, slow things down, spin things around, replay his favourite bit three times & you're left with a headache trying to follow the action & the excitement is sucked away in a mist of frustration.I know there's perfectly watchable, crystal clear footage of every goal in every match featured here. They just don't use it.***** for the team & the season* for this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst Man Utd dvd ever","review":"This cruel joke of a dvd is an insult to a historic, record breaking season, an insult to the fans and to the name of the club.

My 2 boys can do a lot of damage, but this one (to my not so secret regret) survives all that energy. I like that the letters are all capitals, my oldest (age 3) sometimes has difficulty doing letter identification with lower case letters.The volume, however, is over the top, even muffled with some tape over the speaker. My boys didn't use it for learning their letters.

Basically what it's about is two kids rob a bank wow very exciting. ''Stevie'' finds a hand gun and with his girlfriend Rocky they rob a bank. The two 13 year olds go into a bank with a hand gun and force everyone to the floor and so on, nothing new you've seen it all before. What gets to me about this movie is that all they had to do was tackle this kid and take the gun away. The acting (stunk) and I can't believe Burt would do this movie. Now this movie is great....for laughs. They try and be dramatic but it's really a comendy to me. The ending was so cheezy they tried to make it a tear-jerker and it worked I cried! I cried because I was laughing so hard.

While this isn't a bad thing, (it's a romance novel after all) I really found the book disappointing. Nothing ever seemed to happen between the characters that was interesting (even their constant verbal battles got tiring) and the love story that happens near the end is stupid and rushed. No one would actually do any of these things (this is even outrageous for a romance book) and Stevie is written as a woman who is only there to make female readers root for her. The writing isn't very good and the book seems to add on about 60 or 70 pages that don't really belong to, or contribute anything to the story. The steamy 4 or 5 page sex scenes are well written, but the rest of the story is not. Not recommended at all, unless you are looking for a book to make fun of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ACE book","review":"ACE becomes popular in the world of system programming these years because of it's portability, low difficulty by providing wrapper encapsulating the complexity of low-level thread usage.

The tree on the front cover is a prime example of what a Bonsai tree is not supposed to look like. The tree is a young Ficus with no taper to the trunk. The branches grow straight up and the style is all wrong. Most importantly are the horrible scars on the branches from leaving the wires on too long. The book is very generic and really doesn't give enough information to create a heathly and well trained tree.

But since they haven't been around in such a long time, I couldn't analyze why. It was a subconscious thing that I couldn't qualify. But now I can. The Number One Son and Charlie Chan's interaction, both together on screen and apart, is the cherry on the sundae for me. Along with the taut editing of this film, the scene where Key Luke is holding Erik Rhodes (Max Corday) and discovers his father is in danger is so full of complex emotion. Lee Chan's demand from behind a gun, \\"TELL WHERE MY FATHER IS GOING!\\" and Corday's response hits me square emotionally ever time. I can't explain how happy these releases make me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good memories","review":"Charlie Chan movies are favorite memories of my youth.

It worked good enough for about 3 months and then it started making a rachteting noise that I just thought was the wheels were just trying to synchronize their clutches. Today, I realized that the noise for the past 8 months is a failed clutch in the left wheel making it trying to mow with just the other wheel pulling. Many times I have to mow two ways to eliminate the chopped pattern of the cut grasss from the reel not turning fast enough because of the left wheel slipping.In summary, this is a poorly made mower, is too light to get traction to turn the blade to cut well even with both wheels working, and is way over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I purchased this mower to cut a small narrow yard that runs alongside my driveway. What a joke. It can't really handle much of anything. It only takes a tiny bit of grass to jam up the mechanism and bring this mower to a screeching halt. It does a lousy job of actually cutting blades of grass. Probably rips out more grass then it cuts. You'll have to go over the same area numerous times to get a level cut. In the past I've purchased two other manual mowers from local hardware stores that cost half as much money as this unit and both worked much better than this.

I think that with this album Dre really proved that he's still very very very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"dr dre knows what he's doing and he's proved it, two great singles; still d.r.e & forgot about dre and these are the best two songs on the album, and are the reason i got it. all the other songs have the quality you would expect from dre, but are nothing special, the album is good but i found it really hard to listen to all the way through as the songs start to sound really similar after a while. more variety is needed on this one.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still DRE, Still Superstar, Still the BEST","review":"The rap community has been waiting for this wonderful and excellent album for years. Dr Dre is the doctor and has no equal. By mixing vocals by Snoop, Eminem, Xzibit, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Hitman, J. Blige, once again Dre brings platinum on the table. We all know that we still can count on Dre on delivering powerful and great music to millions of fan around the world. Is still around, is still superstar, is still wonderful, is still the best, It's the D R E!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can u say THE WEST IS BACK?!","review":"This PROVES Westcoast rap is the best style ever.

Well I think their both amazing. Dre is without a doubt one of if not the best producer ever. There are plenty of great songs on this, and it features guests such as. His old homie Snoop, his new protege Eminem, Xzibit and Nate Dogg. All of which are great. Dre is certainly not the best rapper of all time so he has guest appearances on just about every song.My top five tracks are1. The Watcher2. Still D.R.E.3. Forgot About Dre4. The Next Episode5. Murder Ink"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats","review":"Beautiful beats the only aftemath artist i have respect besides a little bit for eminem this is one to play when just sitting chillin blunting or anything you can play this cd anywhere8.5 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, but it was scratched","review":"When I opened the vinyl and started playing it, it was skipping from the beginning and continued throughout the album.

Dope beats, funky samples and rhymes that capture you and dont let you go. However dont be fooled into thinking this is an update of the 1992 classic, its not. Its not as gangsta as I would have liked it to be and it does not have the same attitude the first album had. Another thing is that Dre and Snoop don't shine enough. He leaves it to Hittman and Kurupt who are good but dont live up to the original duet of Snoop and Dre. Chronic 2001 is a phat album but doesnt deliver the punch of the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for 2 good songs","review":"I have been waiting for this cd since 1992 when the original Chronic came out. I have to admit that I got caught up in the hype surrounding this release. Dre has changed his style, moving from meter and rhyme to Chronic 2001's disjointed, \\"I have too many words to say in this song\\" style. I was disappointed, and I think that deep-down, most would agree with me, despite all the 5 star ratings. I would have given this a 5 star rating if there were some hard-hitting beats, but frankly, almost all of the songs are slow grooves. There is too much funk and not enough hip-hop.This cd sounds like something that should have come out 25 years ago.Still Dre and Murder Inc (with the Halloween movie theme) are the only good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"rated #1album of thr year","review":"this album is a for sure banger i love drdre i think it will be a another classic album from the master of producing"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOMB : 2001","review":"I would like to say first that i think it is unfair of people to say this album is no good just because \\"The Chronic\\" was probably one of the best R'n'B albums of the decade. \\"2001\\" is in my opinion along with Jay-Z's \\"Vol:2\\" one of the best albums of the last 5 years. When you define R'n'B you have to mention Dr Dre, 2-Pac, Snoop Dogg etc... This album features some of the hottset new and old rappers around today including Snoop Dogg and Eminem. In my opinion this album is a must have for all R'n'B and Hip Hop lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dre, What Happened?","review":"The music on this CD is lame.

Let's make a cd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Off From The Original","review":"This CD did have a large number of artists, but still lacks greatly and is nowhere near as good as the original Chronic. Just as Dre, the Chronic has really fallen off. I really would suggest you did NOT buy this CD, but the original Chronic and Chronic 2000 Still Smokin' would be worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Overrated","review":"Don't get me wrong: Snoop and Eminem are great rappers and shine on the two songs they are each on. Dre just is not nearly as good as a producer as he used to be. The beats aren't tight, heavy with wailing keyboard in the background. They're clunky, mechanical, rushed sounding. It's Dre's first album in 8 years and he seems to have spent only the last few months working on this album. I heard that Dr. Dre is a perfectionist: DOES NOT SHOW on this particular album.I mean you've got some jamming tracks. I really liked \\"Still DRE\\" and \\"Forgot about Dre\\" as well as \\"the Watcher\\" and \\"what's the difference.\\" But overrall this CD is not very good. It's the kind of CD where you find yourself skipping song after song."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sincere Effort, But too boring","review":"This CD is a quality effort by dre but I was expecting much more than what I actually got from the CD. I dunno the beats just weren't creative and there was only one good bass song...there are only 2 songs I ever listened more than once or twice on this CD: the one featuring Eminem (\\"Forgot About Dre\\"), and track 21 (\\"Bang Bang\\"). The beats didn't really interest me, unlike his first CD. If you have the same musical tastes as everyone else out there, buy this album...cuz obviously a bunch of peeps like it (as u can tell from all these friggin reviews). However, if u think you only like creative beats and good melodies and stuff then maybe consider getting something else (like Jay-Z...now that's a tight CD)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dre Same ol' G","review":"Dr Dre is 1 of the best producers, and rappers there is. This album is off the hook, it's my 1 of my personal favs this year. This and Kurupt Tha Streetz iz a Mutha, are the best albums that have came out for a while.

Now I'm not much for Rap, but this is one of those CDs that grab you in no matter what music you listen too. (Kinda Like The first one. Remember?)

FIRST OF ALL XXXPLOSIVE is the tightest song and i dont care what anyone else has to say. that being said, on with the review. as another reviewer mentioned, the reason why it did not get a 5 from me is the fact that the beginning of the cd is tight, but towards the end, the songs start getting weaker. its still a MUST BUY. this is the tightest cd out right now. nothing out right now can touch this. Jay-z's cd is alright, because it has a song with dre on it. but his beats are like BLAH right now. so go get both of these cats' albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rap cds to come from Anycoast in a while!","review":"This is one of the tightest cds out right now.....especially from the west coast.

The beats are decent and even head knocking on a few tracks. However they are far and in between. Instead what you have is a mix of every rapper you have never heard of (of Snoop is there but enough with the \\"lo lo's\\"). Its no coincidense the 2 best tracks are those with Eminem on them.

As most people reading this review will already know, \\"Dr.\\" Dre received his doctorate in music theory at Yale, to follow up his earlier work in cello performance at Oberlin. At both schools, his writing emphasized the darker romantics, with a smattering of more recent composers. These influences were obvious (with the obligatory \\"rap\\" spin) on the \\"Straight Outta Compton collaboration again, through \\"The Chronic\\" (particularly, see \\"Rollin' in My 6-4 as an obvious example).

Who came up with the idea of making violent drug dealers into social icons? Dre reels about how bad things are in the hood, then verbally struts all his guns and drugs and murderous intentions. Dre hates to see poor people in the hood, but can't help rubbing his immense personal wealth in our face.

It's not even close to being as good as the original Chronic. The problem with this album is its excessive production---Dre perfected it too much. It's produced much like an R and B album in my opinion in terms of the production but I guess that's why its been so commercially accepted. The 8 years between albums showed. In a time where rappers take too little time between albums, Dre took too long. The rawness of Gangsta Rap is lacking in this one. I hope he sticks to producing for Snoop and Xzibit from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Dre 2001","review":"This is a very good CD.

Thats not a bad thing though, just that its not as much Dre as I would like. I thought Eminem kind of screwed up the 2 tracks he was on, just because tha west always sounded hard but at the same time laid back, almost like they thought they were on a different level when they talked their ****. Eminem sounds like a whiny little kid. It would be different if he was on already-bad tracks, but hes on what starts to be great songs. Other than that though, I have no complaints.Cop tha instrumental too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dre's done it again!!!","review":"OK, i know its a cliché, but you just try listening to this album without bobbing your head, its like a nervous twitch.You will be humming these songs all your life.Back on the Doggfather, Dre literally took a simple bleep, and turned it into a hiphop masterpiece. But with modern technology, well, Dre makes the greatest electronic beats in the history of the world. I'm not egsagerating when i say, in a few hundred years, Dr. Dre will be recognised in the same way that Beethoven and Mozart are now. No point going on about the content, listen to the clips. Then buy it. Not for Dre's under-par rapping skills, hes got the whole of aftermath rapping with him, but for the truly astounding beats.Incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap At its Best","review":"If You Like Good Gangster Rap Its Either Dre Or Tupac. Since Everyone Owns Tupac(And If You Dont Go Get That) Lets Buy Some Dre. This Albumn Is Great. you Dont Even Have To Skip A Track. Theres Some Really Funny Skits(Pause For Porno, Re-Education) Plus Awesome Rap Tracks. My Personal Favorite Is F*** You. Great Song With Snoop. Also The CD Has Cameos From MC Ren, Xzibit, Jake Steeds And Of Course Eminem. You Need This. You Need This. You.............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgot About Dre - How Could We?","review":"Its been 4 years since Dre released 'Chronic' and this is worth the wait. Now with a load of supporting artists such as 'Xzibit', 'Snoop Dogg' and 'Hittman', it makes the album all the better. And after signing Eminem, he now has the added help of his humourous lyrics, making songs such as 'Forgot About Dre' and 'Whats the Difference' even more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD","review":"Hats off the Dr.Dre and all his friends for this excellent cd. All songs were fantastic on this album. I recomend it to anyone and everyone planning on buying this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was well worth the wait.","review":"Wonderfully produced! Not all of the songs were amazing but the bigger portion of them was extremley good. If you don't approve of cuss words and violence then don't buy the album! I bought it cause it had Eminem on it who I love but after listening to it I loved it. Dre makes great albums nothing more to say about that. Not exactly good for anyone under 13 but hey thats why there is a Parental Advisory sticker on it. This is good hard core rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still D-R-E","review":"What can be said about Dre's first LP in eight years? For one, he is still the bomb. His sound engineering and hip-hop harmonies are still some of the best the world has to offer. His guests are top quality--Snoop, Eminem, Xzibit, etc.--and the rhymes are still written well. Sure, it took eight years, but a lot of things happened in Dre's life in that span of time. Thus, we arrive at the part of the new record which exceeds the original Chronic the most: emotion. The old Dre was hell-bent on partying, gangbanging, and mocking people like EZ. This time around, Dre looks to make amends (\\"Still D-R-E\\"), send a shot out to his departed brother Tyree (\\"The Message\\"), and prove that he's still got the fire (\\"Forgot About Dre\\"). It all boils down to success. Dre has the best of both worlds now. And he no longer has to risk his life and lose friends to attain it. And \\"The Chronic 2001\\" is a testament to that. Welcome back, Dre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beats make this album.....","review":"Truly, the only one that comes off nice lyrically is Eminem. But the beats are very good. Mostly every song has a very good beat, Dre is an amazing producer but isn't, and never will be an outstanding MC. But the album is very good....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammy Award Winning Proformance","review":"Dr. Dre's masterpiece 2001 is one of the most creative,orginal and addictive rap albums of the day. His exquisit beats and explicit rhymes blended with his genuine Compton style creates 2001. Dre re-invents beats on this release drawing from all sources and connecting them into a smooth-flowing invigorating groove capturing all ears. Along with performances from Long Beach rapper Snoop Dogg with his twangy voice and Slim Shady (aka Eminem) and his hilarious no-nonsense rhymes, completes this album. Using genuine West Coast flavors, the doc is back on top and releases his latest work which rivals his own orginal \\"The Chronic\\" for the best rap album ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest Dre Album yet !","review":"Dre took the cake and ate it with this one. A sure winner. Pop this one in your deck and just let it play. From Beggining to end you won't skip a song maybe the interlude but not the song if you do you'll be mad at your self for missing another tight song. With guest appearances by Snoop,Nate,Daz,Eminim, and the featured new artist of Aftermath records (Dre's label) Hittman. Your sure to enjoy every moment of this Wonderfully mixed CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whack....","review":"You gotta give this man his props for creativity... and his production skills appear to have sharpened, minus the \\"Death Row\\" influence. Actually, I think this is a very nice album. I gave it two stars just to get yall attention! Slick, huh? Compared to his first, the beats are more mellow, allowing listeners to focus in on lyrics. What you will hear is a smooth Dr. Dre sound that anyone can vibe to. My favorite... gotta give it up for: \\"track #17\\" featuring several of his talented guest. I don't know, I grew up in LA, and when listening to track 17 as I roll thru the ATL, I almost feel as if I'm back at the crib, rolling down central on my way to get my grub on at taco pete's! But hey, like the song says, and it's true, \\"LA brothers are all over the world.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell...","review":"Apparentely those beats he's supposively perfecting aren't on this album. Over half the albums beats sound the same. I don't know why Dre calls this his album, 15 damn people are featured on every song. Pulling a Master P? If I didn't know better, I would say that this album was strictly made to make money, riding on the success of the chronic. He only raps by himself for ONE song, and it's kind of weak. Getting sick of all these whack producers putting out 20 albums a year and all the suckers that go out and buy them (i.e. Cash Money and No Limit.) I suggest to purchase the real stuff, Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, Jurassic 5. Don't buy the album, you'll hear the only two good songs of the ablum on the radio soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"this cd is ok, at that, i give it 2 stars because there are only 3 great songs, forget about dre, still dre, and the next episode, the rest of the songs are bad or just ok, if u you want some REAL rap, go check out some Dmx, Lox, or nelly, they make me forget about dre."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHRONIC HAS BEEN DROPPED !","review":"Dr Dre proves on this CD why he still rules. His beats are as whack as ever, and his rhymes still maintain that edge which makes Dre an O.G. Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and the Hitman also make cameos to back up Dre. Hopefully this CD will pave the way to eliminate that ' commercial pop ' rap made ever so popular by the likes of Will Smith and Puff Daddy. Go out and pick up some chronic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tight cd","review":"This is a dope cd but would have been better without eminem. Imagine that I am white and I don't like eminem but anyway the reason to buy this is because of the song xxplosive which is way better than that forget about who song. Would have gave it 5 but eminem was in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Dre Day baby!","review":"Dre's CD is too tight! The lyrics are tight, the beats are tight, and his guest performer's are tight! The only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 starz is cuz a few of the tracks are too similar. Their beats are too slow, and too close to being the same. But that is only a few of the tracks, everything else is so tight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DRE IS BACK","review":"Dre 2001 is a killa album. He and eminem are flowin. There is a wide range of bass lines and tempos that keep you listening to the whole cd. This is one of those you will keep in your car cd player for weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Dre At His Best","review":"Since its release in 1999, this CD has spent more time in my deck than any other. 2001 is easily one of the greatest CD's to ever hit the record stores. Dr. Dre's production returns at the same high level of quality as \\"The Chronic\\" and he still brings the best of the best as guests in his tracks: Snoop, Xzibit, Kurupt, Eminem, Hit Man, etc. The Watcher, Still D.R.E., XXplosive, The Next Episode, Ackrite, and Bang Bang are my personal favorites--yet it's hard to say that I really have favorites on a CD this good. If you enjoy rap music, this is an absolute must have. I recommend buying it immediately if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr.dre~2001","review":"real awesome cd, one of my favorites this will always be a classic Dr. Dre is amazing this cd is amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"things just aint the same for gangstas","review":"its been a long wait for the sequel to the chronic but it has been worth it. this album is easily a 4and a half you cant go wrong with this the production is amazing and the ryhmes are the shit.still snoop dogg and dr.dre for sure biatch! go get this the chronic$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Whats the Difference between me and you? \\"","review":"wow...thats a pretty good word to sum this cd up. You wont need to press the skip track on your discman when 2001 is in there. You've heard forgot about dre...you like that...every track on this cd is for you. Snoop makes some amazing camios. \\"HEY..HEY\\" Next episode of off the hook. im out...peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not a classic but Dr Dre has done it again!","review":"After the long antipated wait Dre has finally released 2001. The lyrics are better than the chronic. For example The Watcher is where Dre explores how rap has changed and on What's The Difference, Eminem and Xzibit are brilliant. It could've done without the skits though except for Eddie Griffen. Other great tracks are The Message, which is a tribute to his brother, my favourite track, Forgot About Dre, The Next Episode(Too short though). Only reason it has 4 stars is that the album declines a bit towards the end and a couple of tracks could've been excluded. However this album is great and the production shows why Dre is the best producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget dre...its not the last episode","review":"this is a great return for dre. its a tight album, and most all of the songs are good, and the ones that are popular, are qute good, unlike eminem, who gets old...dre is just as good everytime, so if you like dre style rap, get this"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great memory of his rappin days","review":"Dr dre is one of the greatest,if not the best rappers as shown by this cd. He has sick beats through out this album like the songs the watcher,still dre,forgotbout dre, the nextepisode, xplosive,actrite n some others. He also has every song made with great lyrics n chorus that r 100 times beeter then some of these rappers now adays.

This cd will last through the test of time. If you enjoy Dr. Dre's style of flowing beats, poetic street lyrics, all while keeping it as real as possible. Then this is the cd for you. I suggest the true hip-hop or rather music fan pick this one up quick, fast and in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Dre Day","review":"I can't believe the dishonesty in some of the reviews I have read concerning Dr. Dre's new album. Sure, I understand it is difficult to admit when an artist you like makes a terrible album. But the truth is that this CD sucks - big time.The music is slow and lame, the raps are boring.

The biggest problem is to get any ansers from their technical support.

The big bad wolf just can't recover from a run-in with Miss Piggy, who seems to have starring roles in at least half of the tales.

If you like flute playing, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better master of the instrument than Orlando \\"Maraca\\" Valle (who I consider to be one of the top three masters of the non-classical flute, next to Dave Valentin and Nestor Torres).Maraca puts together a powerhouse group of accomplished masters on their own instruments (listen to that conguero! Very Giovanni Hidalgo-ish and talented!) and Maraca gives us very interesting arrangements and performances.

The main character is a discredited reporter. He has sacrificed his marriage, his relationship with his young daughter, and with his sister is search of the next headline. After losing a libel suit (and his job), he gets a job as a reporter for a third rate shopping newspaper. He hears about a young boy who was killed and decides to investigate it. He is intrigued about the story after interviewing the victim's distrought parents. Eventually the story brings him in contact with a woman seeking her sister who has been kidnapped to serve in the illegal immigrant prostitution trade in Ireland. How these two incidents are conjoined and where they lead, brings true suspense.The benefit of a mini-series is that it allows for strong character development but the plot has to remain tightly controlled because of time restraints. This is a very good series and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the Barron's books on language mostly very good -- I am very fond of the verb conjugation series.

It was described as brass. Most of it is brass, but the most important part, the nozzle, is cheap plastic. It looks like cheap plastic too. I had to call the company three times for a replacement nozzle right from the start because the underside was cracked and it sprayed all out the sides. Their customer service was hassle free, I will give them that, but I am rating the product. The nozzle does not swivel around either, so you have to pull it out and it is hard to push back in. The ONLY reason I bough this is because it was the only black kitchen faucet I could find, there were a few others, but this was the best looking. What a let down. I really expected more because it was rated so high. If the company replaces the nozzle with a brass one, this would be great! What were they thinking? It ruins the whole faucet!

The remote starter works well and has excellent range, but some of the other functions do not work as stated or described.

The unauthorized guide was superb and was by the most important book I used to prep. The Element K book was worth the money and filled in some gaps. This PDF, in contrast, was dull as dirt, filled in no major gaps, and gave me no benefits over the other two items I purchased.Just to qualify my opinions above, I did pass the exam on my first try after 4 hours of prep with a score of over 800 out of 900 (versus 655 needed to pass). I spent 2 hours with the sample exams in the unauthorized guide, 75 minutes with the Element K book, and 45 minutes with this PDF.

That is not to say that the essays here collected are no good. The new translation is self-avowedly more accurate to Levinas' French than the Lingis translation.With the above proviso in mind, the five essays collected and published as _Humanism of the Other_ are wonderful representations of the radicality of Levinas' notions of ethics. Of particular is the essay \\"No Identity.\\" Students and scholars of Levinas in particular and Continental ethics in general are well served by being or becoming familiar with this work.The introductory essay by Richard Cohen is very clear and worthy of a serious reading in its own right. Cohen is a top-notch Levinas scholar and translator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the whole series","review":"I picked the first one up at my local library, and had to have more.

I'm not completely finished with it yet, but so far it is one of the best books I have ever read.

I never expected to come across something this great! It fits what I want in a book so perfectly. I love learning about Jerusalem!!!!!!!! The only falt I can find with in it, is it's characters.

Now nearing 70, the Royal Geographical Society-honoured explorer and conservationist decided to follow in some famous footsteps by spending 40 days in the desert (the Sahara, in this case). The book has 40 mostly short chapters, one for each day of his sojourn, in which the author muses on his life and gives us various vignettes of life among the Tuareg. The book is necessarily episodic and may be most appreciated by readers who are already familiar with some of the author's earlier books, especially his autobiography, \\"Worlds Apart\\". But if you enjoy literate and thoughtful non-fiction and haven't read Hanbury-Tenison before, this may whet your appetite for some of his other work. As always, Hanbury-Tenison is a voice of common-sense in our troubled world."},{"rating":"2","title":"great timely story","review":"The story line is intriguing and one that needs to be told more often. People always make an assumption when they she children of different ethnic backgrounds that the person with them is not the parent or that they are the adopted parent. I think what this book deals with is the assumption that everyone has about race and the fact that we never think abiut the children's reactions to comments that people make.The story is also good simply because it is very well written and the characters are people that you might know or know of.

The PC version of both games are NOTHING REMOTELY like the versions on action games for PS-2, X-Box, Gamecube etc. The website makes no distinction.

The PC version is an adventure game like the old Sierra Online products such as \\"King's Quest\\" - but with updated graphics and a few mini-games tossed in. The game is very short and has no replay value since the adventure never changes. Why does the publisher do this? All three boxes for the game a very similar - and when your kids play the demo for the PS2 version at the store and see the same box over in the PC section - they grab it thinking it's the same game.

The art in the film is very Americanized Anime with the voices of \\"Annie\\" as Dorothy and a few well named stars. The whole scene with Dorothy and the confrontation with the witch is awesome and a little scary-but GREAT! Over-all this is a classic cartoon in my eyes! I very much enjoyed it and everything about it! A great film to show to you're kids! The wizard of Oz is colorful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This was almost impossible to watch due to poor quality of tape.

I liked that it saved space and was easy to use, and had the features I was looking for. I expected the sound quality to reflect the small speakers, which it did, but it still wasn't bad. I liked the night light feature, too. However, the phone stopped working, rarely registering a dial tone, and when it did, sound quality on the phone was very scratchy and would cut in and out. And of course, I had forgotten to send in the warranty card, so my money was wasted in a matter of a few months. I like having a phone by my bed, so I decided to stop using the Coby unit altogether.Anyway - watch your step with this item.

She was so completely about herself and those poor little children suffered because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime Classic","review":"This book gave me chills. This is as brutal of a murder/crime as it can get. Ann Rule brings such skill in writing this book that one see the monster that Diane Downs truly is.Why this is such a good book is that Anne Rule does not write with any sort of journalistic hype. This is document of a crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rule's Rules","review":"Ms. Rule has written another haunting head scratcher. One must learn to bear with her as she lays down the \\"Rules\\" of the game: the geography of the city in which the crime was committed, its employment patterns, crops, weather and white collar to blue collar ratio. There is a method to this technique, and as one reads further the abandoned gas stations, monochrome trailer courts and barred storage sheds become stories within the story, unforgettable like the covers of pulp detective paperbacks. An unforgivable crime, a flimsy motive and a searing cross examination in the courtroom make this a book one doesn't need to read if sleep deprived. She is the best at what she does, and hers is the only \\"light\\" reading that I do. I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRINT WAY TOO SMALL","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book because I saw the movie with Farrah Fawcett which was really good. Well, I am sure the book is excellent but I will never know because the print is so small that I will never read it. It must have been done in an 8 font or something. I am afraid it will hurt my eyes to try to read something so small and the words all crammed together.This is only the third review I have ever written on books.

This prompted me to do some research into this case and I've come to the conclusion that this woman was wrongfully convicted of a crime she did not commit. I think this author fantasized a great many details in her book. If you do just a little looking into this case you will probably come to my same conclusion. This is not an isolated case, this happens time and again on many levels of our legal system. And the sad thing is, she's still in prison. The author of this book has made a lot of money off this case and it is not even an accurate portrayal of events and the blatant miscarriage of justice. Shame on everyone involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting non-fiction","review":"My mom had this book in the basement, with her hundred other Ann Rule books.

It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Top 10 Favorite True Crime Books!!","review":"Ann Rule, in my opinion, is the queen of true crime writing. I've read many of her books - some good and some not so good. But Small Sacrifices is one good read. It's detailed and interesting. You don't need me to summarize the story - if you read a lot of true crime, you already know about it. But the book held my interest from beginning to end. Reading a book like this makes me want to re-review some of my reviews. It's not fair to give an author a 5 star rating when it doesn't come close to the quality of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily The Best True Story I've Read","review":"Anne has the way of weaving a story!And what a story this is! Getting inside the head of a mother who \\"sacrifices\\" her small children to win back the heart of a lover- she has done the impossible.We hate the mother, we understand the mother, we cry for the mother, we despise the mother... Anne Rule has made this murderess so three dimensional. We can somehow understand things we never thought we could with Anne as the teacher.And we are taught without even knowing it. That's a gift, Anne."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best true crime book I have ever read.","review":"Ann Rule has such a gift for taking true crime stories and making them read like a novel. I could not put this one down. I was up all night long reading this and really got the creeps. This woman (Diane Downs) is absolutely fascinating. I saw her on Oprah years and years ago and she is a true psychopath. It was very creepy to watch her. I agree with the previous reader that I would like updates on this case. Ann rule is the best true crime author. She does not miss any details. This is a must read for true crime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still haunts me!","review":"This book is the best written book I have ever read. I believe I think about this story every day. I wonder if Diane Downs has ever felt any remorse for what she did to her children? I have so many questions about this book. Do Christie and Danny, now that they are grown, have any contact with their mother? Do they have any memories of the shootings anymore? Ann Rule did an excellent job at writing this book--I must say her best yet. I feel I was right there and watching Diane Downs whole life due to Ann's writing. A couple of things still disturb me though. Both Steve and Diane Downs came from big families, yet neither side of the family came forth to adopt either child after Diane lost custody. Also did Lew and Nora stay together even after Diane went to prison? Did Lew have any contact with Diane after she went to prison? I hope Christie and Danny were able to put the horror behind them and live a normal life. A must read for any true crime reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life makes best reading","review":"I have read a number of Ann Rules books and enjoyed them all, and this is no exception. She finds and writes about fascinating real life stories. Her narrative is compelling, completely researched, and well written.

In my opinion one of Ann Rule's very best. You have to wonder about these people, women who would kill and hurt their own children without a shred of remorse. I was moved by the prosecutor's attachment to the surviving daughter, that was such a touching part of the story to me. Glad this woman is where she belongs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, I had a hard time putting it down. IT was very sad what the three children went through from the day they were born. Ann Rule does a wonderful job telling this story. It's unbelivable how bad the system is, she escaped from jail and they could not find her for days. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turning fantastic read","review":"I have to say that this is Ms Rule's finest piece of writing so far. This book is wonderfully written and I could not put it down until I finished reading it. Throughout the whole book I was in delimma whether Diane did murder her kids or was she a pawn of the police system? I think the evidence speaks more than what anyone has to say but one thing is for sure this is an excellent read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Draw You In","review":"I read this book years ago and it is still the definative true crime book. One of those rare stories that has you reading it again and again, each time catching something you missed before. This is Ann Rule's very best. True Crime devotees will keep this one within easy reach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I've read this book three times now, and I don't doubt that there will be a fourth! Ann Rule did an excelent job telling this tale of a woman who's only purpose in life is to satisfy her own needs, regardless of anything or anyone else, namely her children. If you enjoy suspense, mystery, and a book that you just CANNOT put down then this book should be on your number 10 (in the number 1 slot) of books to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Had to return this, it wasn't what I was hoping for.

It has what we need to know about building a good fireplace and how the other designs fall short. This book has helped drive a movement toward the construction of this type of fireplace.There are 2 houses owned by my relatives that had Rumford style fireplaces built in the 2nd quarter of the 1800's. One of them had the livingroom fireplace rebuilt in the 1940's and later replaced by a room intruding wood stove, neither change ever worked to anyone's satisfaction. The other house's parlor fireplace proved to be so efficient that when in use with just a small amount of wood the room radiator had to be shut off. Three cheers for this book. It demystifies the principles, genius and construction of a truly efficient fireplace without the loss of the contemplative aspect of an open fire. Benjamin Thompson is man we should all know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a pamphlet than a book","review":"I had hoped for something a bit thicker than the credit card I ordered it with.

Those above a certain age might recall that these were first issued on Everest LP, and I've been hankering for a CD reissue of this white-hot 1947 Segovia performance of the Bach Chaconne.Be warned: This CD has a cut in the Chaconne. At the third beat of measure 225, the music suddenly jumps to measure 232. This, of course, spoils the entire performance. If such a sloppy edit would bother you as much as it did me, then avoid this CD.(Note: These same performances have been issued on Empire Music Werks EVC 4500660, and this CD has the same unacknowledged edit. If you're looking for a good CD issue of Segovia's 1947 Chaconne, try \\"Segovia & His Contemporaries: Vol. 3\\" on DOREMI.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessive Compulsive --CA$H","review":"Obsessive compulsive behavior can be hazardous to your health even if you're a bad guy like Sean Bean. This is one of the oldest crime story ever told i.e. the straight guy ends up with the bad guys money and the bad guy wants it back. This one,however, has a twist: the bad guy is a number guy who has O.C.D. and will not settle for anything less than every penny he is owed. In the process he turns the straight guy and his wife into bad guys like himself. I really liked this movie even when it slowed down a little in the middle, because it was a trick they played on the audience. They were setting us up for a big change in the straight couple's character and a surprise ending. There were little flaws in the movie like; Bean practicing Yoga and smoking like chimney,calling the Illinois DMV the Chicago DMV,and a cop-out repayment plan to some of the victims especially to their jerk of a banker. But, by and large this is a very good crime movie with an exceptional ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was expecting with this cast...","review":"I recently viewed this movie and found it to be far less enjoyable than I had hoped. This was disappointing, as I really like actors Chris Hemsworth and Sean Bean. The story was also set in chicago, and living in the Chicago suburbs, it's always fun to see the local metropolitan area up on the screen. What I was expecting was an action movie with some sort of twist to the end. What I ended up with was a plodding story with a completely unbelievable antagonist. Likewise, the protagonists behave in completely unrealistic ways that just make you roll your eyes and ask \\"Seriously?\\" I can't figure out how this movie has received so many high review scores. I'd say it is below average in most every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this VERY MUCH!!!","review":"A unique, but at the same time a familiar type of crime movie. But it was done very well.

I have given away 7 or 8 of these away to friends who had lost loved ones. They all read this book in 1 day. All of them were so comforted by this book. I not only recommend it. I keep a copy of it handy to give to friends in need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Back when I was a destitute college student, a fellow student and I worked together would share canned soup and rice meals to save money. He was from India, and he had these fantastic spicy pickles that would jazz up our otherwise bland meals. They were a bit of an acquired taste, but I quickly grew to love them.I've searched for those pickles for 20 years and I think I've finally found them--hot mango relish!If you like a little spice, then you will love this relish for making your meals have more kick. It has a lot of chili powder, so it is very similar to a Chinese chili sauce, except that it has chunks of mango fruit as well.As a side-benefit, you can use the the chili oil that the mangos marinate in as chili sauce or chili oil in your cooking. That saves having an extra condiment jar in the fridge.Sometimes I have to make a recipe just so I can eat my hot mango pickles. Today I made spicy black bean soup and spooned on that hot mango relish. Yow! My mouth is still burning! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonder to use and a joy to read.","review":"As both a dog owner and writer, I never knew there were so many varied web sites for research and, even better at times, just for fun.

Then, ask yourself, which do you like better, the originals or Arturo's mimics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No One Man Can Do Justice To All","review":"Trumpet players Beware!!!There is absolutely nothing new on this CD. At best, it is the attempt of one player to try and mimic the best in other great players, perhaps in an effort to show that he is the best of all and can do everything.No one can. And anyone who has played a trumpet knows this.Mr. Sandoval is talented indeed, but he is no Louis Armstrong, Harry James, Maynard Ferguson or Rafeal Mendez...especially all rolled into one.For my money he should stick to what he did on his big band CD. That is a CD worth listening to again and again!!! Of course, in this case, Arturo played all the solos and 1st and 2nd chair. Is anyone good enough to play with him, does he have a problem sharing the spotlight, or is it just bad management?Get back to your roots Arturo so we can all begin to enjoy your fabulous trumpet playing again!!!I'd have rather bought a half decent bottle of wine and listened to an old Maynard album than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Technique and Tribute","review":"I don't really understand why other reviewers are trashing this album. Listening to the original recordings by the original artists is, of course, wonderful, but that's not what this album is about. It is an amazing tribute to some of the most influential trumpet players of the 20th century. This album is Arturo Sandoval's salute to many of those who have inspired him over the years. The fact that Sandoval can play in this many different styles with such technical ability is a real tribute to him as a musician. This album is a wonderful example of the range of the trumpet as an instrument and a good addition to the collection of any serious jazz listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"There is a phrase: \\"Jack of all trades but master of none.\\" That is appropriate for this farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"the only question is - why?","review":"This isn't jazz.

Arturo may be a master technician on the trumpet but his musicianship is nonexistent and his musical interpretations are downright WRONG. I can actually picture Artro's thought process when he was deciding to make this CD:\\"I want money\\"\\"But I am lazy\\"\\"Good albums require lots of work\\"\\"How about instead I make a crappy album and sell it to chumps\\"My advice: Don't be a chumpa and DONT buy this album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of whatever how much i paid for this thing","review":"Why did i buy this cd? That was my question that I have been asking myself for the past 3 days. WHY??? Arturo is a good trumpet player. I am not knocking for that, but all throught his career he never worte a single original note. I thought this album was gonna be of original. I was and still am dissapointed with this album. Arturo please write some of your old tunes. Don't take anyone else's material and just change the style to it. It's like sampling without using a D.J.

The only thing working on it is the radio and I've only used the radio once in the past! Well, the radio doesn't actually work - it's on. And won't shut off without unplugging it. The light doesn't work, the clock doesn't work, and none of the buttons respond. Thoroughly disgusted with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality????","review":"I know I need to contact the manufacturer for Verilux Rise & Shine Natural Alarm Clock Deluxe Bedside Lamp. This item only worked for one week before the light and the time readout display stopped working. Hmmmm. The alarm still functions. Without the light it has become the biggest, most expensive, alarm clock without actually ever knowing what time it is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change your wake up","review":"I LOVE my Rise & Shine. Besides waking up slowly, gently, you can fall asleep to one of 8 sounds or music and wake to different ones. And you change how long your wake up cycle is day to day. A great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Dawn Simulator is no dim bulb!","review":"I researched long and hard and finally chose this one. The FS Natural Alarm Clock gives you many options. It does what the \\"info blurb\\" says it will do. It is great to go to sleep to a babbling brook and chirping crickets and awake to a lighted room and the sound of roosters and farm noises. If you don't like sounds, or the radio, mixed in, you can use the dawn simulator only. The options are many.The Dawn Sim does have a couple of flaws. In the winter it can build up a static charge and then things do not work properly. Just unplug it, take out the batteries (for backup), and let it sit for an hour or two. Put everything back together and voilà! It works again.The only other flaw is that you go through bulbs fairly fast. They are a little pricey and you can get them from only one place. So buy a couple of extra bulbs to keep ahead of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea lacks quality","review":"I purchased this item on special for $49.95 and was excited to get it. I went home and tried it and immediately, the lamp would not come on. After trying several bulbs and on both AC and battery power, the light would not come on after I pushed the button several times. Everything else seemed to work fine until I tried to shut the alarm off. The wake button jammed and would only stay in alarm mode.I think this could be an awesome idea if the company would just invest a little more in quality and caring about their consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Like the idea, but in reality doesn't work so great for me.Pros: Like the nightlight color effect on the clock. Reallly does help me fall asleep a bit quicker. You can set the light to turn down gradually at night along with music, sound effects, etc.. Nice selection of sound effects.Cons: Light way too dim on highest setting, therefore doesn't get bright enough to make a \\"nice sunny day\\" re-enactment. That's my biggest complaint, just not bright enough. Bulbs are expensive. After the first week of waking up to the birds, I wanted to kill birds. The sound gets very annoying after awhile. Way too expensive. Very bulky. Cheap ugly plastic shade.In the end, just not worth the money. Maybe for 50 bucks I'd give it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the idea, poor execution","review":"I had this clock a couple of years, but it was always difficult to use. Then after 1 year, the light stopped working - which I've read on several other reviews. It's the best looking of the lighted alarm clocks on the market. I'm going to wait a couple of months and see if any other models are updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I also live the the Seattle Area, and winters are dark and rainy for months on end. Your body loses it's day/night clock. This lamp worked great, for about eight months, then the alarm broke. Now, all I get is a horrible screech in the morning. So, that comes to 20 dollers per month to use it for it's lifetime...:(. I'm looking around for something that is a better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 lamps and neither worked","review":"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. The concept is a great one and probably the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1. The first lamp did not work out of the box. All of the features of the lamp (sounds, radio etc) worked fine but the light did not come one. So we returned the lamp for a replacement. Once the second lamp arrived we were so excited that we plugged it in immediately. The light on this lamp did work. HOWEVER, when the alarm function was used, the light would not come on. You could turn the light on manually, but when you set the alarm only the sounds would work. We have returned the lamp for a refund and are now looking for other options. The quality of this lamp is just not worth the high price, and after 2 tries we are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy with defunct product","review":"Like the fading in of light.

Specifically the long battery life and portability. Well if you have blue eyes you better look for something else.

Then I tried to use it without the power and it only held a 30 min charge with 36 hours being plugged in. SAD to say it was not what I had high hopes of. So back it went.

However, the blue lights just didn't work for me: no difference in mood, energy, or sleep patterns, and they actually gave me a bit of a headache.I went back to use my 'Day Light' light, despite the fact that it is like a giant soccer stadium light and must emit some UV (since it puts blond streaks in my hair if I overuse it).Sorry, Philips, its an otherwise good product, but the blue light doesn't seem to be my frequency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Working","review":"I've only used this lite a handful of times, when I needed it. I've had it for about 2-1/2 years and when I went to use it the other day I found out it only works when it's plugged in. The display shows that the battery was charging, and then it was fully charged, but nothing I do seems to be able to get it to work on battery power. If I have it plugged in, it works fine. But this defeats the \\"portability\\" which is the reason why I chose it over other models.I do think it helps me with SAD, although it's hard to tell if this is due to a placebo effect. I only regret the purchase because it stopped working on batteries. Very disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon shipped opened products, light gave me headaches","review":"I purchased this product hoping that it would help me with my up and down energy levels. When I received the product, the plastic bubble wrap the unit was in had been previously opened. As an earlier reviewer had said, when I plugged it in, the unit would make a high pitched noise which also occurred when the display light was on.I sent it back for a replacement and the second unit was also used before. The packaging was opened, battery already partially charged, and it too made a high pitched sound when plugged in. In desperation, I tried the unit a couple of times before returning for a replacement and the light ended up giving me headaches that lasted several hours. Instead of asking for a replacement, I asked for a refund. It had been used already, didn't work to improve my energy, and made my problems worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Therapy","review":"It's bright!

I did. This one. It lifted my mood when I used it--30 minutes a day. It was a miracle. I took it with me everywhere when I had no time for it. I used it in the car, at work etc. It was fantastic.Until about 6 weeks after I got it, it broke. The light won't go on. I will be grousing to amazon and Philips tomorrow, at the beginning of a week.

So when I picked up this Thor graphic novel (which is the first Thor story I have read by the way) I didn't know what to expect. And lo and behold, I was disappointed.You see, in fantasy novels and ancient Norse myth, Thor was always portrayed as a relentless, mighty, rough, and sometimes vicious warrior-god, kind of similar to Conan from Robert E. Howard's Conan fantasy novels.But, sadly, in this Thor graphic novel, he is portrayed almost as a cheap ripoff of Superman.

I don't know if it was caused by the sun or the heat, but when installing it yesterday, the material just came apart. At first I though it had just come out of the slides, but upon inspecting it, the material is rotten. I can literally tear it apart with my fingers very easily. Great way to ruin a good product.I would have gladly paid an extra 5-10 dollars for this if they had chosen to use some high quality UVA proof nylon webbing, instead of this disgrace of materail they used. Plain string would have been a better choice.Only giving two stars because of the concept and rest of materials seem to be okay, but time will tell.

My Golden Retriever no longer falls in the space in front of the seat when I must decelerate quickly. I us it in my Honda civic and it is fine; there is a bit of dip in the hammock in front of the seat due to the small size of my car, but it is much better than my dog falling in the space between the front and back seats. There are snaps on each of the straps designed to wrap around the headrests, but I keep the straps long enough to just lift over the headrest for an even quicker removal of the blanket when required. The only design change I would make is to not have the seat belt slots in the blanket, as sand and dirt will go through them onto the car seats. I often turn the blanket around so that the slots are towards the front and the pockets on the back, so that any dirt that falls through the slots will go on the floor and not on the upholstery. Duct tape might help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for us","review":"I purchased this hammock last year.I have 2 dogs that love car rides.

It was strong, heavy duty, and durable. The main problem at that time was that the straps they provided wore out quickly but one could easily replace those with high quality bungee chords.After five years of hard use it was time to retire my original Solvit back seat hammock with a new one. I immediately saw that the material of the current product (May 2010) was thinner and more pliable and that the grommets were smaller than before (no longer allowing the use of standard bungee chords). Assuming that these were design improvements I tried it out. After one week of regular use the grommets are already pulling out and the material is ripping. What was once a fine product is now the worst in its class. I'm returning this to Amazon even though the return window has passed (there just were no dog trips until now) and would hope that they stop selling this product.AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"This keeps the new car new!!","review":"It is so easy to put in the car and to remove.

Overall it's not practical. The seatbelt feature is useless, nobody would want to sit on that and buckle up. Besides, the reason it has the straps is so it can be removed quickly in case of human passengers.

One of the plastic pieces that connect the straps that go around the head rest broke one day! Since then, I've had to tie the straps together, which is not as convenient because then you have to untie it every time you want to take it down. I would like to have seen it being a little bigger. I'm short and so when I drive, I have my seat pulled all the way forward - the hammock doesn't rest on the back seat nicely that way and creates less room for our dog. But the Hammock it self is great. Never any poked holes from nails, keeps our seats a lot cleaner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect your seats!","review":"Great product. Has enough straps here and there to keep the hammock in shape. Easily foldable to put the product back in its box and back into the trunk when not in use. Easily adjustable and the 2 pockets are great for holding various dog gear. I only have 2 complaints about this product. 1 - the manufacturers should give the consumer an option (zipper? velcro?) for closing up the holes where the seatbelts can go through. I didn't use it and the dog fur got to my seats through there. 2 - dog fur clings to the material and it took a bit more effort in vacuuming to clean it. Well, I guess it can also be a good thing since wind blowing through open windows while driving would have difficulty picking up the fur from the material and blowing it around your car? (can be a very hazardous situation with dog fur flying everywhere while you're driving). Overall, great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving A Seat...","review":"The Solvit Dog Hammock is a great protector of upholstry and the rest of your car's interior; it captures a good amount of your dog's hair and keeps their clawing marks away from the back of the seats. It is also safer for your dog when riding in the car as it eliminates the possiblity of your dog falling into the backseat foot-well when you are forced to stop suddenly (not that I am a bad driver, mind you, but things can happen). The hammock also is great when the dog gets in the car after swimming and would normally get the seats wet and dirty (a little Fabreze and 15 minutes in the dryer and it will be smelling fresh again). All in all, a good product for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the dirt off the seats","review":"I love this product. My dog seems more relaxed too.

It also keeps the car clean by holding the dirt in place. One shake and the dirt comes right off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but velcro fasteners come undone","review":"I have a 75lb yellow lab and his hair gets everywhere! This is a good protective seat cover, however there are 2 fasteners on the side that secure the cover to your seat belts and they are constantly coming undone. I solved this with the universal fix all... duct tape. Also this does not keep the hair from migrating to the floor of the backseats so make sure you constantly vacuum the buildup of hair on the cover. Other than that this cover stays in place, keeps the majority of the hair of the seats and is best at keeping dirt and water off. This was tested when my pup vomited in the back seat after drinking too much water too quickly. I removed the cover and sprayed it off with a hose and only a little splatter got on the seat! Size fits a standard 4 door sedan, but cannot imagine it fitting a larger vehicle like an SUV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Quality is good, thick material, definately better than I expected. We don't have true headrests on our back seats, but the straps are adjustable so you can adjust as needed.

But overall am happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I was concerned that the hammock would be too big for my Audi A4, but it is a perfect fit.

It seems very durable, and I have a large (85 lb) dog. I also find it convenient with other things I put in my car that I don't want rolling around or onto the floor (like groceries). Unfortunately, the dog is not a huge fan of it. He is not comfortable, and stands awkwardly trying to keep his balance. I can't tell if it is actually slippery or if he is just not used to it yet. I'm hoping he will get comfortable eventually, and for long trips I might put his bed on it and see how that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't meet my needs","review":"I have two small dogs.

It traps the hair and dirt so it doesn't fly around the back of the truck (Toyota 4Runner). It's easy to get off and on when you want to put people in the back seat. It's especially helpful when you have to make a short stop...instead of the dog going down in between the seats and possibly breaking a leg, there is good leverage for him to stay on his feet. I thought it was a good value for the money. The only thing I haven't done is washed it, so I'm not sure how it will stand up to that, or how easy it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea but high rip potential","review":"The concept of the product was great - it fit in my car perfect, tucked into the seats great but in about a week I saw that it had ripped in a perfect line completely accross the part that meets the bottom of the back rest and the seat - like it had been cut by a knife. No knives in my car... Basially useless to me now. My dog didn't do it and he's the only one back there. Its not a chewed spot because its straight as an arrow and not at the sewn edges so it either had a defect in this particular one or the product is \\"split\\" sensitive. So buy it if you have a little 4 pound dog but apparently nothing larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Good price too. This fit our back seat well.

David Lindsey is a master of the thriller, I know of no writer today who can pace a thriller better than Lindsey, I can assure you that if you read this book you will want to read all his other books, he is consistantly good, which is notable for a writer of thrillers. I have read all of his books and periodically go back and reread them. I enjoy most of Patrica Cornwell's Scarpetta books and I like Grisham and Connelly, but Lindsey is in another league altogether. If you love the thriller and relish great writing then you will not be disappointed in this book.

I agree with other reviews that at 300 mm, it is difficult not to get some blur, but not impossible. It comes down to shutter speed.

I have a vivitar 70-210mm and it zooms in closer that the sigma 28-300mm does, and it produces better quality images. The only good thing about this lens is that it is built sturdy, its heavy, and the macro feature works great. I used this lens to shoot some portraits for a client and had to reshoot all of them with a different lens because of the poor quality the lens produces. I would not recommend this lens.

So, I'm just not into this kind of philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Scholarship","review":"Anyone can take parts of the New Testament to show this or that (in Mitchell's case to support the Zen view of Jesus). The point is to study it as a whole in an academic manner. I would recommend Meier \\"Marginal Jew\\" or Brown \\"Death of the Messiah\\" or even Grimbol's \\"Idiot's Guide to Life of Christ\\" If you must translate and comment fine, but don't edit, and do use historical evidence. Really shallow, and I am not a fundamentalist or Catholic; I am a bleeding heart liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Mitchell should stick to Rilke.","review":"I have long enjoyed reading Mitchell's translations of Rilke. However, I found his reading of the gospels to be a smug editorial far more comfortable in its views than those of the strictest traditional Christian commentators. Mr. Mitchell has stripped the gospels of their poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will expand your understanding of Jesus' life.","review":"Stephen Mitchell exposes the essence of the life of Jesus in a way that makes him irresistable. What if he were just a man? What if he were no more akin to God than you or I? His teachings suddenly have a magnitude of insight, brilliance, and commitment that are absolutely astounding. Since 1995, I have read this book cover to cover more times than I can count. Each reading is rewarded with a clearer, deeper understanding of Jesus the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I write this as a seeker, not as a dreaded fundamentalist or, God forbid, a Catholic, as another reviewer has noted. Why is Mitchell's book so popular that it has even been made into a television program? He has done nothing but select passages from here and there in the Gospels to illustrate that Jesus was quite the teacher. This leaves the reader at the mercy of the author's editing. For example, right at the beginning, we see Jesus baptized by John. Mitchell then omits the incredible result of that baptism, the real stuff of the passage. The reader asks what he has been \\"taught\\" by Mitchell's truncated version. The New Testament itself provides the answer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"gospel\\" according to Stephen Mitchell","review":"I'm not exactly sure which \\"jesus\\" this \\"Gospel\\" is supposed to be according to, but if you really desire to deny everything the son of God died and was raised back to life for, and ignore His own testimony as to who He is- \\"I am the Way the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the father but through Me\\"- Than by all means buy this book! Maybe you can ask Jesus what he thinks of it when you stand before Him in Judgement for the sins you deny. Or maybe you could acknowledge your sins and be justified by faith in the real Jesus Christ- \\"Be earnest therefore and repent! Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me\\"-Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed perspective.","review":"Upon first reading, I was stunned at Mitchell's clear-minded dissection of the gospels. Mitchell's skill at extracting the spiritual context from two millennia of church propaganda is something that I wish he could share in more than just text. All my life I have been repulsed by the barbarity and narrow-mindedness of both the Christian bible and the Christian church. This book opened my eyes to the beauty and elegance of the teachings of Jesus. It sets aside the sophistry and questionable history and focuses on the spiritual nature of the people involved. A spiritual nature that is just as evolved and valid as the ones we encounter today.An excellent 'must read' for anyone seeking freedom from the bondage of the memes they were infected with by The Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"All of the books I have read are absolutely wonderful.

Bob Jones was one man of many who worked for Mr. Jackson, and many who have worked for him have had great things to say about him, as well as admitting that he had his faults, as we all do. Mr. Taraborelli's book is a much more detailed, authentically written account of all aspects of Mr. Jackson complex life, not just the negative or the \\"weird\\". He was a true friend to Mr. Jackson, not someone who was fired by him.

This proved to be true, even though Lisa Marie did not realize it until he was actually gone. The rest was pure amusement at MJ's expense. If you read it as fiction you will enjoy it.

The book was seemingly not edited at all, because it if was, a lot of the most glaring mistakes would have been caught. Unless that is, Jones just didn't care about this. He comes off as being a very bitter old man who wanted something for nothing. It is now clear who has been behind the Jackson rumor mill all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge, and poorly written at that","review":"Having read Jones' book, I can't help but wonder why it is that he has been working so long for Jackson and has had only good things to say then, but now, once he has been fired, suddenly Jackson is this bad lunatic who can't stand to see his sibbling's success, has little moral sense, etc.Why, for God's sake would you continue working for such a man for so many years? If Jones had had integrity, and a sense of what is wrong or right, he would have stopped working for Jackson right away. But he ended up working 34 years of his life for the man, and what does that tell us about him and his integrity?Therefore, this book is worth exactly the same as all the other books written by former employees, scorned wives (and such likes) - NOTHING.Moreover, it has no literary value whatsoever.In my opinion, it is a poorly-written attempt of revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read his testimony under oath instead!!","review":"This man worked for Jackson for decades basically doing nothing.

Randy Taraborelli's Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness (still the definitive biography of Michael Jackson).Does Michael Jackson have serious issues? Definitely. Is Bob Jones just a bitter ex-employee with an ax to grind? Possibly. But there is another question that must be asked: is this book worth our time and money?The answer is no. There is very little in this book that has not already been said by others.

In the few pages that I read, I was able to find a huge contradiction to something that the author wrote concerning the song Word to the Badd by Jermaine Jackson.

No, I guess not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Michael Jackson from a Motown insider","review":"Author Bob Jones was a fixture at Motown Records and was the man who dubbed Jackson the 'King of Pop': for over thirty years he was the public relations force behind the star, and so there's no better writer to explore the 'real' Jackson. Michael Jackson fans - and even those who know music well but don't particularly like Jackson - will find this a gripping read which exposes many truths behind the mask; from his affection for children to his endless plastic surgeries.

Mr. Jones has quite an axe to grind, and when I saw him being interviewed, he seemed quite cagey and unclear in his answers...except when asked why he decided to write this book, he said something like \\"I'm doing this for Bob Jones.\\"The accusations of Jackson being a racist and not helping his family are utterly and verifiably false.

He basically calls Michael a racist, a child molester, and all sorts of other nasty things without actually using those words. This guy makes me sick. There's no wonder this book was in the bargain section being cleared out of inventory. Don't waste your money or your time. This is nothing more than tabloid garbage.

It screams of tabloid sensationalism, treachery and revenge, it is full of malicious lies, inaccuracies and discrepancies, but is a perfect read for those die-hard Jackson haters and members of the public who aren't concerned with the truth.For those who have common sense and are willing to read a book that is based on truth and integrity; not on the words of a disgruntled employee and a reporter who found an opportunity to use Jackson as a means to make some money and a name for themselves, this book is a must not read! Instead, read something of literary value based on facts: Michael Jackson Conspiracy, by Aphrodte Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull.

Don't waste your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible,vicious attack book by a fired employee","review":"Wow, this is a really horrible and vicious attack book written by a former employee who had been fired by Michael. One of the authors is that Stacy Brown guy seen on Nancy Grace occasionally, and the other is a former employee named Bob Jones. He is not only a \\"disgruntled former employee\\" but is obviously delusional as well. He says that as a PR person, he is the one who actually \\"created\\" Michael Jackson. This is a sorry waste of trees, money and time and there is nothing new or useful in here either. Just a bunch of vindictive innuendo. What a couple of mean and bitter people. Too bad MJ had so many people like this in his life-backstabbers. It really deserves no stars but Amazon makes you choose at least one. I checked this book out from the library, and I am really glad that I hadn't paid any money for it. This is a really bad book and not even well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book from Jackson \\"insider\\"","review":"This was a disappointing book. It seems Jones has some anger.

Here's a guy intimately involved with Michael for thirty years. He couldn't possibly know more than the jury. After all, one juror said that she rejected the testimony of the mother because she snapped her fingers at the jury.Bob Jones was head of Michael Jackson's company MJJ Communications. He created the answers to many of the bizarre stories created around Michael. He put a positive spin on Michael's endless plastic surgeries and years of bleaching shis skin.This book is mostly a series of short stories about life with Michael. I have no idea if they are true or not, but they make very interresting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson Hater","review":"I watched CNN, when this man went on TV, in the days after MJ's death, before his memorial, and said that he believes that MJ may very well have molested a child.

I bet he is.","review":"This book is conspicuously contrived by a selfish, ignorant, and absolute fool! DO NOT WASTE your hard earn money on trash that you can read for free. Jones is indeed a man who is ravenous for quick-earned money off from someone who has been nothing but amiable and kind to him. Up until he was fired he has stated nothing but good things about Jackson, and this is vividly a chance to pull a disgusting revenge on him. Michael Jackson may be eccentric or aloof to some but he is not what Jones claimed him as."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because 0 stars wasn't an option","review":"I bought this book used for a penny, but after reading it realized I had paid too much.

However if you still feel the need for some juicy gossip in the league of Bob Jones - the national enquirer is only $3!!!! So for a few dollars you get a delicious meal and some slanderous gossip...PLUS!! it is available in an easily disposable medium so once you've read the cover and looked at the pix you can burn it! Now IF ONLY Bob Jones had copied the national enquirer formula in its entirety - unfortunate individuals like me wouldn't be stuck with this dead weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"This is simply pitiful. Bob Jones is a nasty individual who turned on Michael Jackson cause he got fired..and decided to make money off of MJ by writing this dirty book.

I read the sample of this trash book, and decided not to help finance this angry black author (I am Black also). Just because this person was there with Michael don't mean all that he written about is true. Espsecially after he got fired by Michael he find a way to cash in on Micheal by written this trash for money and revenge. And only people that really like this mess is the people that hate and were envious of Michael's music, wealth and fame. By the way Bob Jones why did you get fired after being with Michael for so long, my guess is that he couldn't trust you anymore. A dead man can't defend himself from your trashy so call book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOB JONES HAS AN AXE TO GRIND","review":"Don't belive the trash in this book.

It's by the author! This is the first time I have seen any author get so butthurt that they come on Amazon to defend themselves. The best part is when he talks about how big and tough he is and how he has a hot woman. Best. review. ever.Anyway, I implore everyone to read the 2005 Jackson transcripts. Both of the authors testified and both admitted to sensationalizing. When facts and lies are woven together, the product is often compelling. The draw of this book is supposed to be that it becomes from this incredible \\"insider.\\" However, this insider admitted on the stand that he \\"seldom\\" spent time with Jackson.This book is bad. It's petty. The author is clearly a defensive and childish. If it is fact that you are reporting, it ought to be able to stand alone. Clearly, this book does not. Don't bother with it. Read the trial transcripts and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry I wasted my money on this crap.","review":"I had a hard time reading all these lies.

So many inaccuracies and ludicrous stories - to be honest I didn't even finish it as I lost interest. Reading the tabloids would have given me more facts.If you really want to know about the 2005 trial, I suggest you spend your money on \\"Conspiracy\\" by Aphrodite Jones who gives a pretty fair account of what happened and why Jackson's acquittal was justified. His brother's book \\"You Are Not Alone\\", recently published is also an interesting and reliable read - unlike this work of fiction.There's nothing like a disgruntled employee to stab you in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Intro for those interested in learning the basics","review":"We offered this as a gift to guests at a wine tasting party.

The battery life is very impressive, and the sound pickup exceeded my expectations. There have been times when I have heard quail calling in the distance that my friends (who are not wearing muffs) have not been able to hear at all.After two seasons of hunting, I had destroyed the two small windsocks that cover the microphones. I called Peltor to order replacements and they sent me a pair free of charge.

But worth ever dollar, I spend 8 to 10 hours a day in these babies and in this case you get what you pay for. A word of caution tho, be careful when storing them the first pair got a tear in the cup and I had oil leaking ever where. Hands down the most comfortable hearing protection I've owned, and I own 3 pair. Another perk is they use 2 AA batteries not some obscure 123 or round camera battery.

They are worth every penny of their cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Peltor","review":"I received four earmuffs and one of the four had a whine in the left earpiece so I am sending it back. The foam wind screens are poorly designed as they have four very fragile prongs sticking up that hold the foam on. They are very easily broken off as they are not protected. They cost $8 a pair and are not covered by the warranty and are difficult to find, I had to order from Peltor and pay almost as much in shipping. I tell everyone to stay away from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way to go!","review":"This is my 3rd set of Peltor Pros, replacing my original set that have had heavy use for the past 3 years (my wife has her own set). As an NRA instructor it is critical that I can hear everything going on (discussions among students, comments from other instructors, the \\"click\\" of a malfunction) AND still protect my hearing when the click is a BANG. These headsets do all of that again and again. I sweat pretty heavily AND wear hearing aids (because I didn't use good hearing protection in those younger years) and the Pros provide enough space that I don't get feedback from the aids. I have a pair of the low profile Peltor's for rifle shooting and they don't even come close to the function of these.

But then, after the reader purchases the book and gets it home, s/he will find the coverage incomplete and diluted. What do I mean? Specifically, there are no detailed or in-depth examples. The material is abstract and general in nature. For a topic like microcontrollers, the reader needs examples that are \\"step-by-step\\" and \\"how-to\\". These are totally lacking.

I give it a fair rating for learning and a good rating for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good But Not Perfect","review":"Peatman has done an admirable job of condensing the world of PICs into about 300 pages. The book is very readable. However, it is lacking in code samples and circuits. The Microchip Application notes, available at their website, help to close this deficiency.The book covers all the basics though. Serial, I2C, using templates, timers, etc. The examples are generally clear and if you've had previous assembly experience, this is an easy read and good way to get up to speed on the PIC series of microcontrollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Joe and his active imagination...","review":"Joe is a typical boy, I'd guess about 8 or so years old.

It is vapid in the extreme and promotes extremely shallow values. Other people with less than supermodel bodies and millionaire bank accounts exist, too, and have much more interesting stories to be told.

I litterally only kept the last disk and threw the first two away.That being said the last four episodes are very good and definately need to be watched before the next set comes out (dont want to spoil anything but major plot points are revealed).In conclusion get this only if you really care about the MAIN story and even then you only need to watch the final disk.

Certainly, he is correct in wanting to explore the Jewishness of Jesus and the implications for the Church today. But, he should have done this. Instead the book is primarily about the process of doing this without ever seriously exploring the subject it talks about exploring.A full third of the book describes the structure of the rest of the book which he then ignores in the rest of the book. I got the distinct impression while reading that Mr. Lee was wanting to explore the subject but never achieved enough of a grasp of the subject to know what he was exploring.Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I bought this book for my daughter and it was in a very good conditions, it was used and looks like new.

The first track rules, and the last track really f*ckin' rules. The middle tracks have some great moments in them too.That's all fine, but. . . .I don't know, that song \\"Crazy Bitch\\" is just too much for even me. Its too much. I never want to hear that song again. It put a big ol' freakin' sh*t-stain on the whole thing for me. I feel pretty guilty even saying that, but that's how I feel.But, whatever. I'm just one dude.

Rather Buckcherry faced a dilemma that few do...playing good music at a time when talent means far less than image and, not being a corporate boy band or the flavor of the month, they briefly faded into obscurity.Who cares?They're back, and as good as ever on this album. Catchy, punk infused sleaze rock, driven by some strong drumming and a guitar player who sounds like he's just having a damned good time, but the real focus is the charisma of vocalist Josh Todd, and the attitude he manages to bleed into the music.This is a good album, full of kick a$$ rock n' roll, whether you want guitar driven hard rock (\\"Next 2 You,\\" \\"Out of Line\\" and many others), the uber-catchy and obvious single (\\"Crazy Bitch\\"), slower numbers (\\"Sorry\\"), or a new take on a Stonesy style (\\"Brooklyn\\").Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the buck is back","review":"when i heard that buckcherry had got back to get together(well the main two anyway),i eagerly waited the new album and i'm glad to say it doesn't disapoint.this band have got to be one one the best hard rock bands of the last 15 years, i mean \\"lit up\\" has to rate as a bonafide classic along side songs such as \\"kick start my heart\\" and \\"paradise city\\".this album follows on from \\"timebomb\\",its like they haven't been away(i also think that josh todd's album was great as well)my personal favourites are \\"everything\\"(their best song behind \\"lit up\\" and\\"underneath\\"),\\"next to you\\" ,\\"sorry\\", \\"out of line\\" and \\"brooklyn\\"buckcherry don't get much coverage here in aussieland which is a great injustice, so the chances of them touring here are remote"},{"rating":"2","title":"It actually Rocks!","review":"Yay a real rock album, instead of another whiney band!

Buckcherry.","review":"I'm glad Josh and Keith got the band back together (you probably know they were supposed to be a part of Velvet Revolver but Scott Weiland and Dave Kushner wound up taking the parts, quite well actually). Josh Todd had a solo album out 2 years ago that was pretty good, but much heavier than Buckcherry. The sound here is good, simple, classic AC/DC meets Black Crowes with a side of Aerosmith. And it works, as well as it always has. Atlantic Records had mutual feelings and in early May announced a long-term distribution deal with the band. Talk about coming back full swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly diverse","review":"Buckcherry have returned after breaking up in 2001, only 2 original members are left, singer Josh and guitarist Keith. 15 is surprisingly more diverse than I'd expect from a Buckcherry record. Sure, there are the obligatory songs about wanting to hook up with hot broads, like \\"Next 2 You\\" and \\"Crazy Bitch\\", but theres also mid-tempo and slow songs like \\"Everything\\" and \\"Carousel\\" that are just as powerful as the harder ones. The slowest song here, \\"Sorry\\" is way too predictable, lyrics and music. \\"Brooklyn\\" makes good use of acoustic guitars and its NOT a slow song. They shine the most on the more rocking tracks like \\"So Far\\" and \\"Broken Glass\\", but nearly the whole album is solid, save for \\"Sorry\\". Definitely check it out if you simply want good rock n roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly forgettable","review":"What exactly is so outstanding about this album? Comparisons with Aerosmith only work if you mean lame efforts like \\"Pump\\". GNR? No, GNR had solid lyrics and actual musicians. Give this a year and it will be on the penny CD list. Except people will still be downloading 'Crazy Bitch' the album's saving grace and a regular for cover bands at bars everywhere. Speaking of bar bands, I know several that put Buckcherry to shame. Glad 15 days is paying off for them, but wait another 15 before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom is very happy!!!!","review":"Yes my mom loves one of the songs.

It's the same mix of Guns N' Roses, Black Crows, and AC/DC that so defined the band's first two albums. Founding members Keith Nelson (guitar) and Josh Todd (vocals) are in their element and do what they do best-meat-and-potatoes, kick-ass rock n' roll.\\"15\\" isn't terribly challenging or revolutionary, but if you're not looking for Rush or Axl's upcoming epic and merely want an old-school album that rocks, \\"15\\" will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Glam Metal","review":"One of the current glam metal bands that capture my ears!!! Their new album has been out now but not in stores over Asia yet... Whenever I thought of Southern Californian pop metal, I will think of these guys alongside with GNR, Metallica, Hoobastank and Damn Yankees..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait!","review":"Any frustrated rock fan will find this Buckcherry release worth the wait. After listening to this wonderfully varied hard rock record, I can only wonder why this band had trouble finding a record label for its release. Brooklyn, Carousel, and Broken Glass are three tracks that perfectly sum up the diverse vibe of this record on which each band member has a valuable role to play. The guitar work on this record, with influences from Angus Young (Crazy Bitch) to the Edge (Everything) gives the disc a well-rounded feel. The pulsating and imaginative rhythm section drives the entire disc, while Josh Todd's unmistakable vocals prove that he is truly at the top of his game. Buckcherry has succeeded where so mny other have failed - this is a solid rock album that speaks well as a single document from start to finish, the way rock records were made by some of the great bands of the 70's like Led Zeppelin, ACDC, and Aerosmith. Kudos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rizlahead on Buckcherry's 15","review":"This is the first of Buckcherry for me and I wasn't disappointed.

Looking forward to more Buckcherry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock CD I've Heard in a Long Time","review":"This album absolutely rocks!

The easier poses are so easy it makes the practice useless (at least for a healthy 20 year old) but the harder ones are much harder than those on other beginner dvds. The workout makes me feel stressed out, miserable and incompetent.

Perhaps that's why I was so disappointed in this book. I bought it, read it (when it first came out -- 6 years ago). I have to agree with the others who say, \\"Save Your Money!\\" As someone who will pan through a lot of mud to get to one useful idea, my pan came up empty here.

If he wanted you to learn anything in this book, he would not write it, otherwise you would not need his money manager's services.

How about the part about recommending that a consultant learn to type fast, as it allows one to get more work done per minute and gives the impression that you are busy? In the end, it's just another thinly-veiled attempt by some self-appointed \\"experts\\" to cash in on the R/3 phenomenon.

Now, the authors have done the same thing in their book. The SAP market has shrunk tremendously in the past 12 mos.

It provided me with a lot of insight into the scripting that has been imprinted into my husbands brain, why he thinks that good deeds alone will get him his ticket to heaven, and why he feels so challenged and defensive if it is suggested that he might have missed the point of Christian faith completely. The book doesn't oblige with an easy solution of course, but provides some hope and a reason to pray a bit harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...","review":"I found Talaga's book interesting and engaging, but it also saddened me to read it. As God was calling him into a more intimate relationship, Talaga obviously misunderstood the calling and became Protestant. He also has many grave misunderstandings about Catholic theology and doctrine, as many Christians do. As the late Bishop Fulton Sheen said, \\"Not 100 in the United States hate the Roman Catholic Church, but millions hate what they mistakenly think that the Roman Catholic Church is.\\"Too bad Talaga turned his back on the church Christ established.

Then the oddly loud hi-hat hit when the drums normally come in. Calling Dr. Love is missing the cool backwards guitar noise that makes the song. I don't know I'm confused.

She is neither nuanced nor necessarily flashy, as did Gulda in his more recent release of Mozart's sonatas.

Our modern psychic economy is in peril, contrasted to our bull market's and the technological advancements surfacing around our delimited and barren experiences.

The story is like bad Arthur Miller (or just Arthur Miller). Doing a stage Eye-talian (he sounds worse than Chico Marx), Robinson overplays as a mustachioed patriarch who founds a bank for immigrants; when it gets into trouble, his four sons fall upon one another's throats. What elements of noir creep into the plot (along with Susan Hayward) are neutralized by the ethnic stereotyping. Robinson plays ear-splitting opera and his family eats nothing but spaghetti. It's irksome that this \\"serious\\" drama -- of no visual interest whatsoever -- made it to video when more unusual and better realized movies (Caged, Desert Fury, 99 River Street) have not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hugely underrated film!","review":"This is one of those movies you catch flipping through the channels late at night, stop to watch for a minute, and become completely captivated. I don't know what film some others were watching, but Robinson's performance bordered on incredible; hardly Chico Marx or a \\"stage Eye-talian.\\" He perfectly captured the language and nuances of that generation of immigrants.

It tells of the roots of the Round Table -- which were in Paris, where Grant was stationed with the Americans (as a singer). Grant is a wonderful writer with an eye for detail. It has first-hand stories about life with Ross, Alexander Woollcott, Dorothy Parker and the others. The introduction is by her clsoe friend, Janet Flanner. It was Flanner in her \\"Letter From Paris\\" that helped usher in a new kind of journalism. It was Grant who brought Flanner to Ross' attention. The rest, as they say, is history.

Such is the case of Jack, who is ten years old but has a 40-year old body. He really wants to be normal, so he begs his parents to let him go to school. Of course, looking like he does, it's not easy fitting in.This film brought some attention to the aging disorder known as Progeria, though that is not quite what Jack has (his aging is predictable, set at 4 years for each one he actually has, while Progeria is different for everyone) but this was a good film, and I liked it. Robin Williams does a decent job as Jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Film","review":"Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors/comedians and has played in some amazing movies. Jack is a story about a boy that has a aging disease. Every year he is alive he ages about 4 years or so. Jack realizes at the age of 10 that he's tired of being home-schooled and wants to go to school so he can interact with other kids his age and make friends. Only problem is that he looks like a 40 year old man. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and I loved it back then and I still think it's a great movie. It's shows how precious your time on this earth can be. Jack never had the chance to experience the full life he was meant to have. By the time he graduated he was almost 70 years old.

What's progeria, you say? Well, it's this very real, rare disease that causes children to age 10 years for every year they live. Of course, they don't look like an average adult, but then Robin Williams wouldn't have been able to run around acting like a kid for a couple of hours. However, if the crew had used the comedy aspects to hook viewers, and then give them information about progeria at the end, I would have been okay with it.

When reading Herman Hesse I expect a tragic protagonist but each one has a unique quest and special quality. Rosshalde is the story of a man whose life has taken some complicated turns, leaving him in a somewhat awkward situation. The story revolves around the relationship between Johann Veraguth and his son Pierre and the characteristics of each that both pull them together and drive them apart. I will not spoil the ending but expect another Hesse \\"esque\\" conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Hesse idyll","review":"The book is as beautiful as it is sad. Set in beauty amongst the lime tree garden with its flowers and strawberries, the lake, the painters studio, the big beautiful house with a dear boy, a beautiful wife and the famous painter himself. Still nothing is as it should be. Then there is the travelling friend and the longing for something else. In Rosshalde Hermann Hesse constructed a very pleasant novel. A sad one, but with all the beautiful ingredients of art, nature, people, feelings and Hesse's language and art of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesse is Wonderful=)","review":"His works are filled with elements of tragedy, aesthetic realization and, on a lesser note, thoughts of suicide in one form or another. Pierre's death was foreshadowed but I still cried throughout. Hesse's writing is very simple, but very interesting and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Like a Painting","review":"In Rosshalde, Hesse draws on his own life experience to describe the feelings of resigned loneliness surrounding the loveless marriage of painter Johann Veraguth and his wife, Adele. The famous painter lives alone in his studio on the same grounds as the house harboring his wife and son. This estate, Rosshalde, becomes the serene backdrop for the melancholy tale of a man whose love for his son has kept him in a stagnant state of resignation. A visit from an old friend finally stirs the emotions that have long been lurking inside of Veraguth, granting him the insight he will need to be free of his own self-made prison. Lyrical and deeply sad, Rosshalde is not Hesse's best work, but it may indeed be his most emotionally sincere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I am currently in Arabic 2 using the textbook we have been using and this was a necessary addition, it has a lot of key words that you need to use but don't get to see as often in the other book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the Driving to Al Ward","review":"Al Ward's Productivity Toolkit is just that; a great toolkit.

I agree this is a book you can't put down, but only because you want to finish it quick and get it out of the way. The first chapter or two draws you in with rich character development, but the plot falls apart quick. You should check out some of Goins' work, just not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Absolutely realistic! Very revealing.","review":"I could not put this book down once I picked it up. I grew up in Detroit, and Mr. Goines mentions streets in the story that I have seen in person. The characters are well developed and the story never has a dull moment. It is very graphic in detail. For example, He decribes one shooting victim as having brain matter ooze from his head after a point blank shot. This book is full of emotion, from the first paragraph to the last. Some parts of the book made me chuckle, but this book is as realistic and hardcore ghetto as it gets. He writes how people talked in the mid-70's. He follows up crime parters with a sequel called death list which is another classic of this genere. If you really want to know what went on in the inner city ghetto behind close doors, this is a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does turn...

Not a good idea for a Quickstart Guide, my impression of which is that it's supposed to be a starting point for new users... definitely not the case here. I am in the market for a new book on JavaScript, because this one just did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful...","review":"This book has alot of examples for accomplishing different tasks but was very light on explaining concepts and even syntax sometimes. My very first javascript program was to create an HTML table with dynamic content and it was quite difficult with this book. I'm not exactly sure what purpose a book like this serves unless you find a pre-written script that closely meets your needs. I recommend that you keep looking if you want a helpful javascript book. Using this book to create your own script was much too aggravating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve a star...","review":"If you want examples of how to do specific things, this book may be for you (I doubt it), but if you really want to know what the stuff means, don't waste your money. I returned my copy.If you want examples to copy, you don't need a book. There are plenty of sites out there to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very beginner book on JavaScript","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this book. After reading HTML4 for WWW, I thought this would be good too. It was hardly any reference material at all. I would not recommend this for a professional developer. I agree with another reviewer that said He was thinking of throwing it away. Disappointing, don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I didn't Have to give it any stars","review":"This book is terrible. I read hlf of a internet tutorial on Html and I learned more about Javascript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book does not belong with the VQS series. It does not teach you javascript. It just shows you some, don't get me wrong, useful scripts, but it doesn't TEACH. When I read others' scripts, I don't understand some of the functions because they were not taught. I STRONGLY suggest not buying this book, but trying \\"Designing with Javascript\\" by o'reilley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn the JavaScript you'll most likely need...","review":"This book is not a complete reference (O'Reilly's 'Definitive Guide' probably comes closest to that definition), but it is a superior way to learn the most useful JavaScript techniques (form verification, images, frames, cookies -- and debugging) quickly. The use of illustrations in these 'Visual QuickStart' guides can't be beat, and every line of code is explained thoroughly. If you need to learn advanced JavaScript -- or Dynamic HTML -- you'll need to look elsewhere. But you can't go wrong by starting your JavaScript training with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute treasure chest of scripting essentials...","review":"I bought your book today and it is great. I was browsing many JavaScript books at the bookstore and the clarity and examples of your book stood out.Almost everything I wanted was in the book. I love the script idea on \\"the time of the day.\\" I definitely want to use that on my site. Thanks a lot. Your website is a fantastic addition to the book with all the nice examples that *work*.Thanks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to DHTML!","review":"When I am faced with learning a new technology on the web I always try to find a Visual QuickStart Guide on the subject. These books are great for learning. They break the code down into simple, easy to understand chunks. The DHTML book focuses on the more interactive elements of JavaScript. Once you start to understand DHTML your pages can really pop with excitment!I strongly suggest this book to web designers who want to take the extra step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for learning","review":"This book covers some introductory scripting, but does not develope the concepts behind most of what it attempts to teach. If you already know JS, then most of this book is redundant. If you don't know JS, then don't buy this book to get a solid foundation of knowledge. The publisher does a good job of laying out the printing of the book and its graphical presentation is refreshing, but it performs poorly on teaching incrementally.I don't know what audience this book was written for, frankly."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, useful, best value","review":"This book is eminently readable and extremely useful. The examples are clear and you can easily adapt them to your own uses. Also, the price can't be beat. Highly recommended to any JavaScript beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great presentation, but that's it","review":"Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guides are excellent. But you can't learn JavaScript from this book. You can copy what's already there but you won't understand it. Programming concepts are either glossed over or ignored and there just aren't enough examples for everyday applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formatted code, doesn't teach concepts","review":"I tried to use this book in my classes but found it lacking. It presents a lot of techniques but doesn't teach the concepts well. There is a lot of code but the formatting is inconsistent with haphazard line breaks and wraps. Many of my students inadvertently entered extra line breaks which made their code break. For code intensive books, the full width of the page is needed and the display should mirror that of a typical text editor. All the HTML tags in the book are in upper case whereas students today need to get in the habit of writing lowercase tags for compatibility with XHTML and XML in the future. If you are serious about learning good programming habits, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is terrible for the VQS series. Although it has very useable and everday scripts in it, the authors really don't teach the javascript. They just show you a bunch of the functions together for you to copy and paste into your webpage. I suggest getting the O'Reilly book \\"Designing with Javascript\\" by Nick Heinle if you want to LEARN javascript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. . .","review":"This book is not a resource for programmers or even those who are learning to program-- it is ok if you are too lazy or clueless to swipe a script from another site, but if you want to learn the how and why of JavaScript it is a total waste. . . Buy a reference guide and work through it. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough explanations","review":"If you want to copy and paste exactly what they have written, the book is OK. If you want to change it a bit for your own purposes, forget it. They don't explain the code well enough for you to do it. It is the worst computer book I have ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to actually learn JavaScript, look elsewhere.","review":"This book (2nd edition) is fine if all you want is some examples to copy and your target audience uses nothing but Netscape Navigator. It covers practically nothing concerning syntax. Even after downloading the authors' scripts and running them (without changing a thing) on IE 4.0, a great deal of them failed. Worse yet, after running some with Navigator, one failed and the accompanying images didn't load! I didn't bother to check if the image names were entered incorrectly or just plain missing, but I don't think I should have to check the authors' work for accuracy when they are supposed to be teaching me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless book. . .","review":"Don't waste your money-- if you have half a brain and even a basic understanding of what JavaScript is, you don't need this. It has nothing on syntax, very little on anything you couldn't do with Dreamweaver or a little creative code-swiping, and about 60 pages of the 190-page book are taken up by reference materials and index. If you want to do more than build a \\"hello world\\" alert box this probably isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensable","review":"I bought this book based on the wonderfull book HTML4 for the World Wide Web by Elizabeth Castro, published by the same people. I guess that was my first mistake. Unlike Miss Castro's book, this book gives scripts that would be ver usefull, if they told you what to enter. Even using the same exact scripts that are in the book, a browser will not read them. Instead of substituting words to be replaced to fit your own content, you get cryptic entries like parent.content.document.location.href with no explanation of what they mean, or what should go in them. I hope if a third edition is released that adresses this, there will offer free copys to all unfortunate people who wated theyr money on this book. I think i'll go buy JavaScript for Dummies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"whose torture device is this?","review":"My first day with this book and already I want to rip it up into itty-bitty pieces. The scripts are printed so small I can barely make them out, and when I apply my own images, I can't even get them to work. I wanted to learn to write my own scripts, but this book is concerned with spreading their own around your web pages. They also try and write humorously but fail most of the time. Try another manual first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference for the most commonly used scripts-beginner","review":"I received this book at my beginning JavaScript class this week. Looks like it will be great for beginners wanting to know how to do the basic everyday scripts. Full of samples and explantion. good stuff packed into a small 200 page book. Great for what it is intendd for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This book is very difficult to use if you work with MS IE. Almost every comment in the first few chapters discusses only what works on Netscape and Mac. I stopped reading after a few chapters. (This is really a one star rating, but Amazon didn't post my first comment with one star, so let's try two stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very limited resource.","review":"After reading the introduction to this book in the bookstore, I thought it would be perfect for me. The intro raves about all the great interactive features of JS, but the book doesn't provide examples of these features. Also, this book does not explain how the actual script is generated, it merely provides you with readymade scripts to cut and paste, which is fine except that the book is so thin you only get so many JS features. Also, most of the JS functions described in this book are cheesey and purely for show (i.e. shadows, moving text, alternating backgrounds). Although the authors admit that these features are tacky, they litter the book with them. How about providing some scripts for doing calculations on the fly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe-based book without teaching the basics","review":"Perhaps if you are interested in copying and slightly modifying simple javascript snippets, this book might work for you. But if you are interested in a more fundamental understanding of Javascript so that you can go beyond the examples, this book is lacking in explanation. But the most annoying part of the book is the unreadable (and thus unusable) legend in the appendix that indicates which properties, methods and handlers are supported by which browsers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT the quick and easy way!","review":"My Real World Adobe GoLive 5 book recommended JavaScript for the WWW, so I bought it. I have done some successful programming over many years in both BASIC and HyperLogo; and I have written web pages in HTML - all with no problem. I bought JavaScript for Dummies and JavaScript for the WWW about a month ago, and have devoted a lot of time - totaling maybe 48 hours, using the books, to learning JavaScript. I am sorry to say that I have gotton essentially nowhere. I find that after a lot of study, grief and frustration, that I am unable to write anything beyond even the most elementary of scripts.I cannot think of anyone who would benefit from either of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I am a novice Java Script user and was hoping to \\"jump right in\\" and apply some Java Script to my pages. To date I have not been able to make ONE of the codes in this book do what I want it to do. Furthermore, this book teaches nothing. It is simply copy and paste with very little theory or explanation. I have used other Quickstart Guides in the past with moderate success, but cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized Visual Guide, thank god for the website!","review":"I unfortunately recommended this book to my students because of the lack of other beginner books at the time. The visual organization of code stumped the entire class because its presentation was discontinuous. In addition, some of the code was not working with current technology and the cross-browser examples were not cross-browser, not to mention not cross-platform.The good news was that the book has all the code on a website with the images of the examples available for download and that saved the day. Had I known, I would have NOT bought the book and just used the website as a tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book for beginning JavaScript programmers!","review":"I've read this book and now I can write JavaScript just like thr pros! The authors provide simple, easy-to-understand text. No nerd terms.The say that they are computer nerds so that you don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give a zero star - Do not buy this book","review":"I bought this book in 1997 and found useless. Now I have been seeing new edition, little bit thicker, in book stores. I browsed thru the pages and found that it is still useless.If you are just trying to insert some JS code on you web site as an hobby, this might be ok with this book. But for learning JS, this book will lead you to nowhere. For example, rather than explaining how JS code works, the book has wastes space by writing instructions like \\"Type a period\\", \\"Type a semi-colon\\" or \\"type an angle bracker\\", etc. It is totally waste of time and money.I would never by any books on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I missed a page or 2 along the way?","review":"I chose the Quickstart book to build on that foundation and provide a reference. The authors of the Quickstart book fail fill in the blanks as they go along, and have left me wondering what I missed in several excercises. I guess if you wanted to copy some code and didn't care if you knew how it worked, this would be a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good javascript manual for beginners!","review":"I bought this book when I felt satisfied and confortable with HTML and wanted to go further in to web publishing. It provides a quick start for you if you had no idea of javascript but have a fair understanding of web design using HTML. Simple scripts are given, then explained one line after another. Then you trans-script it to your page. There is also a companion homepage to the book. There, you copy the scripts and paste on your page. Basically, therefore, it is a user-manual kind of book. But it suited me as a beginner. I later learned how to combine some of the scripts together to produce effects that the book never mentioned. In summary, the book has helped me tremendously to have a good start with Javascript. Tom, Dori, that is a good book. Looking forward to the 3rd edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR NON-PROGRAMMERS!","review":"In spite of the assurance in the book's introduction \\"We don't assume that you know anything about programming or scripting\\" you need to have a programming background to get value out of this book. I know HTML and a little JavaScript, and I was lost by chapter 2. Chapter 2 has a ridiculously steep learning curve, along with important points left unexplained (for example brackets are used in one script, with no explanation for the significance of brackets, when they should be used, etc.)I've always been a big fan of Peachpit Press's books - this is the first time I was severely disappointed by one. I felt like a complete moron by the time I got to the end of chapter 2. In spite of years of teaching college courses in business and graphics applications, I was beginning to think - \\"am I just too stupid to learn programming?\\"And I agree with another reviewer here about the irritating style. It adds insult to injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst breaker bar I've ever owned","review":"I bought this based on the price and the fact that I needed to remove my mower blades to sharpen them. Maybe the bar I received was an anomaly but it lasted all of about 4 bolts and promptly broke at the head. I am certainly not a he-man by any means so I was quite surprised.

It's like a funky history of all the female stereotypes that have been pinned on all of us since birth.Colorful and funny and very informative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very indepth.","review":"I picked up this book because of a review in Bust magazine. I was disappointed -- the book offered no insights, just tired old rehash of things we've all heard before.It seems like the writers forgot about stereotypes and just wrote essays about women who have been treated like crap. It reads like \\"News of the Weird\\" instead of thoughtful commentary on our society.This book's intentions were good, but the whole thing is pretty brainless. I wish that weren't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I Expected","review":"I believe I was looking for something different. This book did not fill my expectations. The studies that were completed were not the type of studies I expected from this book. I had to makes notes and take very short tests and answer questions. Not for me. To involved; I felt I should have been in a classroom taking this as extracurricular for credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I second \\"author is a moron\\"","review":"This was really just another \\"Have a Good Attitude\\" book, maybe readers could convince themselves they are \\"lucky\\" even if they're not. Author never touches on things such as having a \\"socially accepted\\" well connected family or the very obvious, having good looks, both of which have a huge impact on how your life goes and what is available to you. I'm ready to sell my copy back for whatever I can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"A program for living, not research about luck.","review":"The book disappointed me. There is no definition of what luck is or how it can be measured. Luck in this book doesn't have anything to do with chance events. People who think they are happy, self satisified, and consider themselves lucky, are lucky. They answer some questionaires about themselves in the same way. Unlucky people have common answers too and get lower scores. But Dr. Wiseman doesn't give his tests to random people and check how well the test measure luck in the general sense (for example does indebtedness correlate well with high scores). You get to rate yourself against his pool of data to see if you're lucky or unlucky. Finally, there are some exercises you can do that will help you improve your lot in life, and thereby your luck or is it the other way around. The advice is quite sensible and easy to follow, but it's not going to help you draw to an inside straight the next time you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Self-Help Book, just a bunch of anecdotes","review":"I had hoped it would describe experiments that reveal habits that differentiate self-described \\"lucky\\" and \\"unlucky\\" people, along the lines of \\"Freakonomics\\" or \\"Portfolios of the Poor\\" which I loved.Instead it's a Self-Help book filled with a stream of anecdotes and a repeated assertion that if only you would convince yourself that you're lucky, your life will be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This is one of the most amateurish books I have ever come across. The content as well as the writing style are just bad and almost childish. A highschool student would write better than this. I was totally dismayed at such a poor treatment of the subject especially by a professional doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Penny for My Thoughts","review":"I saw the author, Dr. Richard Wiseman, on television the day before yesterday and was intrigued, so I bought the book a couple of hours later. I've never particularly considered myself either lucky or unlucky. But I've always felt there was more to luck than mere chance. Wiseman posits just that point.This book reminds me a bit of Dale Carnegie's classic, How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Carnegie's book was groundbreaking because at the time it was written there was hardly anything in the popular press about worryÑas opposed to today. Ha! Likewise, this may be a ground breaking book on the topic of luck. The author's style is similar to Carnegie'sÑeasy to read, upbeat, lots of anecdotes, and \\"principles\\" to follow. I especially enjoyed Dr. Wiseman's references to his earlier career as a magician.I'm going to follow the author's advice and keep a \\"Luck Journal\\" for the next thirty days. Thus far, one hour after finishing the book, I've found one penny on the sidewalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Advice for Better Luck","review":"Although the concept of taking concrete steps based upon scientific data to improve your luck seems strange, Dr. Wiseman has developed a few core concepts that allow anyone to increase the amount of good luck they experience. If you are looking for tabulations of double-blind studies on luck, this isn't the book for you. If, however, you want to find out what the average lucky person does that you might be overlooking, this book is a must read. The author adopts a simple workbook/diary approach that allows the reader to improve chance opportunities and develop the tools necessary to capitalize on those opportunities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortune cookie philosophy","review":"Though based on academic research, this book has the kind of self-help pop psych style that I personally find extremely annoying. It compares people who self-describe as lucky or unlucky, and shows this is associated with a range of other aspects of positive or negative attitudes to life. Well duh. Their concluding principles? Maximize chance opportunities, listen to your intuition, expect good fortune, see the positive side of misfortune. Is this an improvement over fortune cookie philosophy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A feeble attempt","review":"Starting out as an intellectual study, it quickly devolves into a 'new-agey' blather.

However, when we got it, we found out that it requires a minimum of 3 players, not two like the original and like they advertise it.

In fact, this is one of the best CDs I have heard. Despite the constant guilt trip I felt while listening to the trax, I enjoyed nearly every cut on this CD, even more than their debut, \\"Vivid\\". Outstanding and passionate vocals by Corey Glover, and eyepopping bass lix by Muzz Skillings make this a must own for enthusiasts of either field. William Calhoun's drummage is 5 star, as well as Vernon Reid's guitar. If a flaw could be found on this album, it could be that some musical parts didn't gel well, due to the fact that the musicians playing them are so good that some moments sounded more like jazz than rock. Still, one of the best albums to date by one of rock's best vocalists and his now extinct band.(Looks like Elvis isn't the only one who is dead!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not rap","review":"This group of guys simply rock. Now 'Time's Up' didn't have a rock anthem as their first album, 'Vivid' did with 'Cult of Peronality,' but this album shows much more range of talent from the Big Apple rockers.Like other respondents, I could do without the spoken word interrupting the fine musical performances, but this is a major work by a great band....And it's a bonafide bargain to boot.There is a lot of great rocking here, and little filler. Sure it's a bit long in the tooth by age, but not by any other means.In case you haven't heard: Elvis is Dead.Shorter review: A dirt cheap rocker of an album by a group of fine musicians that'll make you a better person for having purchased it..Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough good songs to avoid the sophmore slump","review":"The best way to sum up this review is if you liked the first record, 'Vivid' (1988), you will probably like the follow-up 'Time's Up' (1990), although sophmore efforts being as they are, it certainly does not sound as fresh.What makes this effort worth buying is the strength of the singles - the upbeat, understated \\"Solace of You\\"; the hard-rocking \\"Type\\" (counterpoint to REM's \\"It's the End of the World As You Know It\\"); and the tongue-in-cheek \\"Love Rears Its Ugly Head\\". Other standouts include the funky ditty \\"Elvis Is Dead\\" (complete with guest vocals by Little Richard and a groovy sax solo) and the Zepplenesque finale \\"This Is the Life\\".The rest of the record does not work as well. With several songs (\\"Someone Like You\\", \\"New Jack Theme\\", \\"Pride\\", \\"Time's Up\\"), the band goes way too far trying to reproduce the musical style and socially conscious lyrics of a previous single, \\"Open Letter\\", creating what is nothing more than filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a developer, forget it.","review":"This book is only a sales pitch for P2P.

Sociobiology, and now the Evolutionary Psychology are sciences which cope with a strong resistance to be accepted by the scientific community. The fact is that both disciplines have more support by common people who are dissatisfied with the political correct answers to their most deep questions rather than with the professional Scientifics in sociology, psychology, anthropology and other human sciences.The reason for this resistance is ..

But the problem is that the book does not go very far. There are many important and/or interesting works which are not even mentioned - one thinks of the official South African history of the Sidi Rezeg battles and Alamein in the Western Desert in 1941, by Agar-Hamilton and Turner. Accustomed as we are to Keegan's astonishing range, it is disappointing to see such a slight work by him. He also seems reluctant to assess the place of the huge number of personal biographies (some academic, some popular) of generals from the various armies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book is a shameless attempt on the part of the publisher and the author to trade on Keegan's reputation and the great general interest in WWII. The title and subtitle to this book leads readers to expect a historiography of WWII. Instead, this is a short bibliographic essay on important books on WWII. While Keegan's recommendations are useful, this slight book is not worth spending money on unless you can buy it at a steep discount. This is the kind of information that should appear at the back of a decent one volume history and which I suspect is absent from Keegan's book on WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"How good is his historiography?","review":"I found Keegan's \\"The Battle for History\\" a dissapointing effort. It is basically a summary of WW2 historiography. This would be very useful indeed if done well, but \\"Battle\\" falls short. Firstly, Keegan omits many important works in his historiography (those of B.H. Liddell Hart and J.F.C. Fuller for example), and if that weren't enough, Keegan even confuses Guderian's \\"Panzer Leader\\" and \\"Achtung!-Panzer\\" as being the very same book!

If you really stop and listen to them, the lyrics are imaginative, but overall, after listening to it in the kitchen while getting dinner ready one night, we all tuned them out after about five minutes.

They gradually started to hear certain words and lyrics that caught their interest. Words like \\"food fight\\", \\"stinky diaper\\", etc. The car got quiet for a while and soon giggles would pop out every now and again. Eventually, we were playing the disc over and over with the two boys singing along with special emphasis on choice lyrics.

The musical and vocals are amateurish. I thought the parodies might be a little more clever, but they are mostly silly and I lost interest pretty quickly. My daughter is only 6 months old, so I can't really ask her what she thinks right now. Maybe the lyrics really speak to the preschool and primary school set, but I'm not sure I will be able to bring myself to listen to it again with her when she's older.

It has music but the audiobook part means that the title is read to you as well as the legal copyright stuff at the end. It was strange to have a serious speaking voice in the middle of a kids' CD but it wasn't a bad thing. The benefits of this being an audiobook is the nice plastic case it comes in. It seems way more sturdy than the jewel cases that always seem to fall apart on me.The music is simple fun. The tunes are all ones the kids have heard before like \\"Take me out to the ballgame\\" or \\"Row, row, row your boat\\" but the lyrics are all original and hilarious. The stinky diaper song gets a chuckle out of me every time. The songs are all very short however and the CD is bulked up by a second instrumental-only part.

Kids will laugh with these simple, goofy songs. Easy to sing along with. Good for kids up to around age 4. Catchy tunes to familiar songs. Nothing terribly objectionable, however, some moms may not find a dog throwing up brussel sprouts something they want their kids to hear.

All the songs from the book are here on the CD.The best part for me, is that there are the tracks with the words, and then there are just musical tracks. I find this to be a great asset. While learning the songs you can sing along with the CD, and then after you've learned it, you can sing with just the musical track.My students love these songs, and they have really enjoyed the CD.

There seems to be some confusion if this is a book, an audio CD.... or both. I received an audio cd without a book. For the price that is a reasonable expectation - but other reviewers are pretty clear in that they were reading a book.Now onto the review of the Audio CD.I guess silly dilly songs are in the eyes of the beholder. While we found a couple of the songs cute we (my family) struggled to find the charm in many others. The audio quality was a detriment since most of the songs (if not all) were done on a synthesizer. It gives most of the songs a mid-80's feel. While some of the lyrics are cute and funny many of lyrics don't seem to have the appropriate rhythm.Final Verdict - I would recommend downloading a couple of the songs to make sure that your kids enjoy the songs prior to purchasing.2 1/2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice illustrations, but that's where it stops","review":"The illustration were very good in this book, but the 'silly dilly songs' were a big dissapointment.

The book got one mild giggle out of us when we went through it, my 3 year old daughter and me. The author, purportedly a \\"songwriter and comedy writer extraordinaire,\\" (from the cover) needs to ply his trade somewhere else besides books for 2-6 year olds. His foul humor probably is a hit in seedy adult joints, but do you want to feed that quality of talent to your toddler? Sorry to be so direct in giving the unvarnished true, but I wish I had known and now you can make an informed choice as a buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross-out Humor -- For Older Kids","review":"My four-year-old and I were disappointed in this book. Writing funny new words to familiar children's tunes is a great idea, I think, but I thought most of the songs and Mad-magazine-style cartoon illustrations were unpleasant and geared more toward older kids who enjoy \\"gross-out\\" humor. Topics include food fights (showing toddler completely encrusted with slop), \\"stinky stinky diaper change\\" (showing baby with clouds of brown steam arising from diaper), \\"I'm filthy\\" (showing baby wallowing in mud with enormous pigs), and \\"I'm so carsick\\" (showing green toddler on dirty carseat wincing at dripping slice of pizza). This probably will appeal to many, but did not to us -- we returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unoriginal and not funny","review":"This whole series is very unoriginal and not clever or cute. I think children already get enough exposure to stupid bathroom humor without contributing to it at home. Thankfully, even children see through this junk - quickly became the least favorite book in the toy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was hoping this book had sort of generic songs that could be sung to any baby, but found it to be more one family's special songs made up for their children. For example, \\"stinky, stinky diaper\\" related to someone's brother, not to just any baby. Also, and I realize this is a strange complaint, the book is too well-bound/ fancy to have near a bath tub. In addition, there were spelling errors--boy, does THAT irritate me, in this day of spell-check! and also rhythmic errors. (The odd extra syllable can mess up the assigned rhythm rather badly.) I am sending mine back...we can make up our own songs as good as the author's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd had this growing up!","review":"I'm 33 years old, but I still remember trying to make up words to well-known tunes with my friends. Yes, what we came up with was often off-color, but *that's what kids like*! The reviewers who called this potty-humor are way too uptight in my opinion. Guess what folks, your kids are going to make this stuff up in school, but will not be able to share it with you, their stuffy old parents. I'd much rather share this natural, fun experience with my kids, and have great memories of it. We sit on the couch and sing at the top of our lungs, laugh 'til we ache and love every minute of it. If someone is unsure about the lyrics of this book, that's what the sample pages are for. If you can read them and not chuckle, then you have no business getting it. But I think most of you will laugh out loud and bring this delightful book into your homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it and give it","review":"I liked this book so much that it has become a staple gift to give 4 year-olds.

In this video dominated age, it takes some engaging beats and performances to grab the little ones with just audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not impressed","review":"I wanted to like this CD, but found it to be lacking. On a positive note, the tunes were familiar, but the words were not something I would remember - or want to remember. I'm not sure what age group this music would appeal to. The pre-school set aren't going to understand some of the topics and the older school-age kids are going to find it pretty stupid. Most of all, the parents, who at least need to be able to tolerate it, are not going to want to listen to this for any length of time. The quality of the music is definitely lacking. This could have been made in someone's basement. There is no way I would want to listen to this on a trip in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Frankly I found this cd quite disappointing. I was hoping for some silly, fun songs that my toddler would enjoy but these songs seem to be standard and rather boring common kids songs (Row Your Boat, Twinkle Twinkle, ect.) with the words changed. While an older child may appareciate some of the silly lyrics, I think it will be lost on most children. And the performance of the songs themselves seems very lack-luster, most of them aren't even really sung but rather 'recited' to the tune of the song with a half-hearted adult's voice.If you're looking for fun, silly, creative and inspiring songs to enjoy with your kids I would defintely look elsewhere - I'll take Laurie Berkner or Charlie Hope over this any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"BARE in MIND","review":"baring in mind this cd was completed(according to oz press clippings)four years ago,when furler was 22 years old;the lyrical content and honeyed voice more than make up for her self professed \\"lack of musical taste\\"!!!after hearing her vocals on the zero7 cd i was overwhelmed with aneed to hear more;to know more.and if you are interested in knowing more about sia,then this album is for you.just listen to the lyrics in drink to get drunk,fear,or judge me to gain insight into where she was at the time.it is an inoffensive jazz inspired first album.for those looking for that zero7esque feel,buy it for blow it all away.but that's as close as you'll get.until her next offering,due for release next year. that is the one i am waiting for.but if you love R'n B then buy it.it's like the cool version."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive but long","review":"Sia has such a unique and dynamic voice and she knows how to use it. I also have tons of respect for her songwriting, a talent latent in so many artists today that have albums with their name on it. It's obvious that she actually thinks about what she's writing. Her style is unique and personal. The album is filled with several different kinds of tracks, from soulful ballads, to smoky jazzy R&B, to playful poppy songs. Yet each song is uniquely \\"her's.\\" I really like \\"taken for granted,\\" \\"fear,\\" and \\"drink to get drunk.\\"My only problem with this album is that it seems a bit long. The production is lacking on a lot of tracks. Her voice is so powerful and on most tracks the production is not so powerful.

But other than that, Sia is a unique artist who is obviously going to be around for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but not a great use of it","review":"There's only one song on this entire CD that really highlights the beauty of Sia's voice.

Her other solo work is better as is her work with Zero 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened","review":"I knew this wouldn't be the Sia from Zero 7's album. Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD.

I cannot really describe any one characteristic which I like best in each song -- it's the collective that counts for me.

Anyway, I hope I warm up to it next year when the holidays approach and the egg nog starts flowing. The good news is the re-mastered sound is very fine indeed and the cover is a classic.

It's not a particularly weighty pen, nor does it feel like it glides over paper likepremier ice skater over ice.It feels rather ordinary rather than divine. I do not think I would purchase this pen again for this price tag. I'm glad I got one, but I don't think that I will own another in the near future.That's just my take on it and hopefully my review won't be torn to shredsby angry Montblanc enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake items beware...!","review":"i buy one montblanc pen meisterstuck classic and the store sent me a fake item..! with the help of Amazon garantie the amount paid me back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique gift.","review":"This is one of the most valuable things I ever bougth through Amazon.

How many of these characters actually come from your own extended family? I recognized the majority from mine <G>. This really makes Lord Meren into a human being rather than an historical personage. The series gets better with each book as I read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family reunions and homicide: a surprisingly good fit","review":"Just what we all needed: persuasion that relatives have been insufferable for millenia. That's actually one of the most engaging elements of Robinson's Lord Meren mysteries, as each one finds the noble detective reflecting on his less-than-stellar childhood memories and current familial dynamics. As a result Meren's vivid character easily gains our sympathies, and his tenderness and struggles are sensibly drawn. He's in need of our sympathy especially in this installment, as his pleas for quiet and peace have been flouted for a vicious little circus of togetherness. Who permanently hushed up his sister-in-law's wicked tongue and dumped her in the granary? Which aunt, uncle or cousin is going to insult him next in his own house? And just what is that mysterious cargo? The mystery itself isn't the sharpest element here, but still, very well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ancient egypt-murder mystery","review":"Murder ar the Feast of Rejoicing is the title of a book that is in a series about ancient Egypt.

First of all, I don't know what water bottles it is suppose to be used with as none I have used will fit properly. I have tried all the major brands of water bottles as well as soda bottles and none screw in properly. I finally used plumbers tape to get a good seal. At first, they worked great. It attaches to the crate securely and by putting it just above the water bowl, it was easy to train to be used. Then they stopped using it. I finally discovered the ball valve rusted! Now I can get them to work for a day at most before I have to take them apart, scrub the ball valve and replace on crate. I got 3 of these things and by the time I figured out why my dogs quit using them, it was too late to return them. Great idea. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball Bearing RUSTED","review":"We had a crate waterer for our dog that was looped to the side of the crate, and our puppy kept knocking it off, so we thought this one would be perfect-- it latches on, can't be budged, adapts to any bottle. Unfortunately, it didn't work quite as well as we hoped.First, the bottles kept getting beat up (I think it was more our dog than the product itself), and so we kept having to replace them. It wasn't as seamless as advertised. Finally, we got frustrated with the bottles and removed it from the crate. Once I put the bottle up on the counter and looked at the spigot, I immediately realized why our dog hadn't been drinking from it. The ball bearing RUSTED. I left the bottle there for an afternoon, and we could quickly see the rust residue collecting in the bottom of the bottle.I don't know about YOU, but I wouldn't tolerate rust in my drinking water, or my dog's drinking water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little \\"business\\" in this book","review":"The word \\"boring\\" comes to mind when trying to describe this book.

Brothers And Sisters (the song) has an excellent guitar background part, and Chris Martin is well Chris Martin, singing well and not electronically supported like many modern artists of the day.

They aren't unique.","review":"This \\"early\\" Coldplay EP (1999 was only about five years ago, people) matches what Coldplay is today: A boring slice of mediocrity... hold all the toppings, especially the meat that should be there but isn't. But wait! This Coldplay release has something the others don't; Chris Martin sounds suspiciously like Dave Gahan on these songs (when he isn't hitting those ball-grabbingly high notes, that is). My advice: Buy a Depeche Mode album. I suggest Violator, SoFaD, and Ultra for DM starters. Depeche Mode is everything you Coldplay listeners want, but with passion, adventurousness, and great hooks in EVERY song. Forget Coldplay and get some music that speaks to your soul instead of the money you have burning a hole in your wallet. We know all you Coldplay fans are rich snobs with nothing better to spend your undeserved cash on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Lover","review":"If anyone here likes Coldplay, then they should definitly buy this EP.

Price2. AUX Input to hook up my iPodFor the price, the product works great. CD sound quality is clear. My car has a built in pre-amp/subwoofer unit and wiring it through for the installers was easy ( at least they told me so). I was a happy camper with the sound. Volume level 18 is more than adequate for car listening ( the knob goes past 30).Now, when I connected the iPod for the first time; I thought something was wrong. No sound. Turns out, I need to turn the volume wayy up past 25 AND turn the volume dial on the iPod to almost full - to get the same volume that I get at level 18 when playing a regular CD or the radio.2 stars because with a Panasonic, you would expect the thing to work - period.

I would go as far as to say this is the best animation I have ever seen. There is so much detail put into this. The art style is just phenomenal. The story is good enough to keep the movie going. Before watching this I read several articles saying that this entire movie was hand drawn without using the aid of computers and is likely to be one of the last films ever to do that. I also read that because it is hand drawn, it took 5+ years for it to come out. It definitely shows. If you are a fan of good, detailed animation, this is a must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, best action anime since Akira","review":"I'm not even kidding. I love it.

It's in a nice format too with easy guidelines rather than \\"you must do it this way\\" wording. In the breastfeeding part, it does stress that the breast is best, but in the other parts it gives equal attention to feeding both breastfed and formula-fed babies (mine wouldn't nurse and was allergic to the dairy in the breastmilk I pumped, so it was important to me to find a book that didn't make me feel like a bad mother for formula-feeding!).

It is the best thing you can do to not only set up structure in the babies life, but in your own as well. Out of the three books, SPROUT RIGHT is my favorite. I bought it on Amazon.

It has very easy to follow baby food recipes, and I love the sample daily menus at each stage.

The game itself has mostly levels from Sonic 2, with Sonic 3 music. Nevertheless, the levels are designed differently and still are fun. I also like the battle against Knuckles.

She is showing too much, she reminds me of Britney and Christina. The lyrics are too pop, not her stile. I HATE DE VIDEO; I HATE HOW SHE LOOKS IN IT!!!

To those who wrote that she \\"sold out\\": Did you not read about her intentions? Jewel aimed to produce a record which would lift people's spirits and get them dancing - a true call back to the big band hits of yesterday which carried the world through turbulent political times. In this respect, 0304 is a huge success. How can anyone possibly compare her to someone like Jennifer Lopez? How ridiculous. Jewel is a unique musician, who writes and produces all of her own material. The highlights on this album for me are \\"Fragile Heart\\", \\"U&ME\\", \\"Becoming\\", \\"2 Become 1\\". Well done Jewel! Another wonderful chapter in your career.. I can't wait to see what's next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Jewel here......","review":"Where is Jewel? Lost somewhere between Brittany Spears and No Doubt? Or did she simply get a boyfriend and fall in love? This CD is a great dissapointment to me. I have been a die hard fan of Jewel for years because she had an edge, she had lyrics, she was out there. I realize artists have to change to try to keep up with the times, but did she really need to become a girlie girl pop star???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"If you're looking for the Jewel we all loved (acoustic guitar, soul searching lyrics, and that unique and powerful voice) don't look here. If you are looking for a \\"sell out\\" disc that has no real talent, but has a good beat, look no further. I wish I could highlight a particular song that I like, but they all sound the same (pop). My advice: stick to an older album, this one doesn't hold a candle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"I have no problem when artist want to change their sounds and cross generas. I admit I wasn't crazy when I heard Jewel's voice or melody, but I thought to myself \\"Hey, this is my favorite singer, so I am going to give her a chance.\\" What a mistake that was. Unlike Jewel's previous albums, her newest one pays no tribute to her amazing voice and her ablity to create meaninful heart warming lyrics. I really hate to say this, but this album was a complete waste of talent. Jewel has deffintaly sold out in more than one way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzik 4 Disleckzicks","review":"This CD is, like, way bad and 2 bad 4 me to, like, listen 2 again and stuff.Jewel, I have three words for you:- Dictionary- Sell- Out"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a pity","review":"I thought Jewel was one of the best artists around with her release of Spirit in 1998. Sadly, since then, it's been nothing but downhill. This is positively the worst album I've heard in quite a while. It's bad for pop music in general, and is even worse if you consider that it's JEWEL. Jewel, the lovely songbird from Alaska, is dancing around in her hooker clothes and chirping meaningless crap. It makes me sad to see such a wonderful artist fall like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"If you are a J.Lo fan, and you love to dance to silly music with no artistic statment, I reccomend this. After all the talent Jewel showed us with her first three albums, she decided to become a Britney wannabe. There is way too much electrafunk on this, the music is way too dighital and techno. And the lyrics suck!!!!!!!!!!! \\"Run 2 me, ill run 2 u, let me crash into u?\\" WTF? Has she lost her spelling skills??! Do not buy this GARBAGE, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is she thinking?","review":"After recording great albums like Pieces Of You, Spirit, and This Way. Jewel (not so sparkly anymore) jumped of the deep end and into the flaming abyss with 0304. Who in the hell does she think she is? Beyonce? Aaliyah? or maybe even one of those fine ladies from Destiny's Child? Doesn't only Madonna make moves like this? I have only one bit of advice for Jewel, get back in studio and record a new album that I will enjoy listening to while sipping on a caffe latte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Excellent","review":"Well, I've been a Jewel fan ever since Pieces of You came out! I've followed her music career very closely buying all of her CD's including her first (already mentioned), Spirit, Joy, and This Way. Jewel's radical change from folky, thoughtful lyrics to killer dance beats mixed with thought provoking lyrics is incredible. This record will not put you to sleep, it is truly full of energy along with great hooks. And, the lyrics are incredible, she maintains her credibility as a superb lyricist by including lyrics that will make the listener think WHILE dancing! (yes, it can happen) Overall, I highly recommend this album, and I see many more radio/video hits to be released from this incredible accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is soooooooooo boring.......","review":"other than maybe one song, this is the worst album she has ever done....the material here is so boring you wonder how they even got through the recording session without hitting the floor snoring. The retro whatever sound they created here was a joke on her fans...better to dredge up old standards and rework them to her style rather than spit out this kind of airless empty fluff.... What a disappointment from an artist who has a great voice. The experiment failed. You want this kind of sound? Go to a pro and buy Madonna's \\"American Life\\" and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going bubble gum or pop or disco or mainstream, it stinks","review":"Hey, so I'm not a prototypical Jewel listener as I am a 35 year old married white guy with 2 kids, but hey, why is Jewel selling out? I heard that lackluster sales of her last album caused her to have riffs with management to make her a more 'packageable' star. She's undoubtedly hot, in that girl-next-door-a-little-bit-artsy-and-quirky sort of way. Gottle love that snaggle tooth. Anyway, the songs are contrite and silly and destined for the dance floor. If you want the bubble gum or pop or disco or mainstream stuff, this is your album. If you want something MORE and DIFFERENT, check out her other CD's first. The lyrics of 0304 can be catchy, but they are buried in the Christina/Britney dance mixes that lead to nausea. Jewel doesn't need to polish up and act like a teeny bopper, just do your thing without selling out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was bound to happen at some point...","review":"Yes, the once demure Alaskan poet/singer/songwriter has finally sold out. And for what reason? It certainly is not for want of money or fame, for Jewel has plenty of both. What a shame to see such a (once) talented artist morph herself into yet another Britney wanna-be, gyrating around in skimpy clothes while, of all things, getting sprayed with a fire hose in a generic video littered with quasi dance beats. Oh, and the rest of the album's songs aren't any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I have been obessed with jewel for years now. I got her first cd from winning a radio contest in middle school. I am now 21 and for the first time I am disappointed with her. Her music was always very deep and personal with so much feeling behind it. Now she is just another girl seeing how much her body is worth if she takes more off and going mainstream. Its horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jewel","review":"Others have spent words to discuss your \\"experiment\\" so mine are not needed much, anyway I have to say I still think you're a thoughtful, interesting personality, I love reading your interviews, they're deep and witty. You're far too clever for your new kind of music. Please, the next time you decide to be ironic, remember that it means being superior to the object of our irony, not merely emulating it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your $$$$","review":"As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix. This is simply not the case. It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD. Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?! I was hoping for a 'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no. If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother. If you're under 13 and female, you'll just love it.I saw Jewel in concert FOUR TIMES last year (2002). If/when she tours this year (2003), I sure won't be in attendance. I can't possibly be the only fan that feels cheated with the release of this CD. How, in good conscience, can she record/release a CD like this?!?! The fan base that she has diligently built over the years is in serious danger of ruin. Speak out against this abominable CD. I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE, I CAN'T BE ALONE ON THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel Hits Bottom","review":"I have listened to Jewel for years now, and I have always enjoyed her lyrical, poetic music. What happened to it? In 0304, jewel made the change from meaningful songwriter to the typical \\"I am trying to rhyme everything, it doesnt matter what it really says\\" pop/dance/techno. The lyrics have little depth, and there is no trace of the previous 'folksey,' political writing. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. In fact, had I known that it was as horrible as I now know it is, I would not have spent my money on it. This isn't Jewel, this is the definition of selling out on what she stood for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better albums","review":"This new album isn't that good at all, Jewel has really sold out to commercialism. The other three albums were much much more honest. She is trying too hard to be something she is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST a middle of the road Album...","review":"The album has some pretty catchy tunes but others not so.'Intuition' was the song that made me buy this and over all it still stands up as one of the best songs on the CD.'Stand' is a fun song that you just gotta bop your head to.'America' is a good song but her political views are that of a leftist quack. As a very 'middle of the road' person it's obvious that this is a good song that contains the message of an idiot.'Run 2 U' is like old Jewel music with a dance beat. Very odd and just doesn't sound right. (Least favorite of the lot.)Over all the rest of the songs are just kinda there.The songs 'Intuition' and 'Stand' are the only song I really listen to. I would listen to 'America' also if the lyrics made any sense and were not so radical. (Sad that this song was ruined by a message like this.)2 out of 5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still Jewel.","review":"Everyone claiming to be \\"True Jewel fans\\" type reviews for this album, citing it to be terrible. I have listened to Jewel from the beginning, and, granted, this is a different sound for Jewel. In reality, though, this CD is still full of meaningful and deep lyrics that we have come to expect. (I'm not crazy about the internet lingo, however.)The song 2 Find U stands out. This is most like the older Jewel.The rest of the song have a faster, upbeat tune to them. The lyrics are still Jewel.Jewel has said that she has had it in her to do an album like this all along, and \\"True Jewel fans\\" should accept that and give this album a chance.And, about her appearance, no older Jewel fan really likes it, but, if you looked that good, wouldn't you dress attractively? Maybe she has overdone it, but it is still the old Jewel that we have come to know and love.Give this album a chance. Buy it, borrow it, whatever. Decide for yourself. Have an open mind. And an open heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It","review":"Oh puhleeeze to all you who like the folksy Jewel, get off your high horses. I didn't really like Jewel until her newer songs such as \\"Standing Still\\" and \\"Intuition\\". If that's called selling out than I guess I don't know \\"real\\" music. All I know is I like the songs and they're upbeat and fun without getting too serious and folksy. If all Jewel's trying to do is make music and sell CD's than as far as I'm concerned it's working. It's the first Jewel CD I've bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney? Christina? No! It's Jewel...","review":"Everyone knows how Jewel used to sound so I'm not going to get into that. Reagrdless of her past albums, this albums is just not good! The only reason this album gets 2 stars is for \\"Haunted\\" which may be Jewel's best song yet. (This is a hidden gem on this album).This reminds me of the teen pop crowd like Britney and Christina. I fear Jewel will soon be touring with Aaron Carter. The lyrics are pretty good, but there's just too much fluff and cheesy production for me to take this as a serious album.This album will surely open up more people to Jewel, but it undoubtedly turn alot of current fans off. Most of this album is very poppy with dance beats galore, so if you like that sort of thing, pick up this album. If not, stay away, even if you are a diehard Jewel fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"I've never been a huge fan of Jewel in the first place (although I do like her first couple of albums) so I may be a bit more objective about this. On the whole this isn't as bad a sell out as, say, Metallica, but it's not the bold stylistic move of Bob Dylan either. With this she tries to blend her intelligent lyrics with a modern dance sound and production values. Sadly, with the exceptions of a couple tracks (\\"Stand\\" and \\"America\\"), it just doesn't seem to come off the ground well. It comes off like an attempt to jump on the teen pop bandwagon. Mostly the music is the usual non-descript generic dance pop that's been on the radio for the past few years now. More than anything, this is a \\"Producer's Album\\" rather than an artists creation. Stick with \\"Pieces Of Me\\" and \\"Spirit\\"... Ok maybe not so objective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all about the music","review":"You cant expect an artist to *never* change. Jewels latest initiative is amazing. I only wish more artists were as daring and expressive as she is. Kudos to her for *not* selling out to a particular music style - and for bringing her audience new sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Her best work yet!","review":"I don't usually listen to pop artists, but when I saw Jewel's new video the other day, I had to give it to her: that lady is finally getting the idea. Her early songs were just awful: stupid folky music. I mean, she couldn't even play guitar. It's good to see she's trying to do something original. Her songs now have a good beat behind them that will catch the attention of the listener, instead of boring them to tears. Her singing is up several points as well. Now, if only women like Tori Amos would start doing this. Female musicians are only good if they sound like this; not pretending to play an instrument. An excellent album that is sure to become better appreciated later on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less sincere, but still fun.","review":"I bought this album mainly because I adore Robyn (remember her?), and her new CDs - only imports - are too expensive.Jewel's new release has the same basic feel as Robyn's music... not unique and original, it doesn't have extremely clever and deep lyrics (for that, see Fiona Apple)... it's just fun to listen to.Well, all except that \\"Fragile Heart\\" track. That's just trite, and I have to skip it. That one *is* way Britney.I appreciate the new release, and since I have a personal policy against buying CDs of artists who don't write their own songs, it gave me something to plunk down [my money] on.Just don't look for it to be life-changing... because you won't find it.BTW, I gagged at the razor commercial with \\"Intuition\\" playing in the background... at least you didn't hear Jewel singing... it was only the instrumental part. Still... ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I have been a Jewel fan since she was playing coffee shops here in San Diego. This is by far her best album. I am so sick of people saying that Jewel sold out. Did it ever occur to you guys that maybe she accually likes this type of music. I know I do. Who cares what she used to be. The point is that she is making great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Jewel","review":"I've had a neutral relationship with Jewel's records. After the build-up in popularity for \\"Pieces of You\\" I began to hate the record for being too precious. I therefore skipped her second album. After hearing she and her mother butchering Christmas songs on a PBS special I made special effort to avoid her Christmas album. But then along came \\"This Way\\", which was a progressive step away from the earnest folkiness of her earlier work toward a harder sound and more mature lyrics. That, by far, is my favorite. But \\"0304\\" has a very different quality that's both unique and fitting. The lyrics haven't been lost among the beats, bleats and effects of the dance environment, which is good because stripped of those production flourishes there is some great writing here. But the songs themselves are toe-tapping catchy that you find rattling in your head after the CD has finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has not left my CD Player!","review":"I am sick and tired of hearing such close minded people go on and on about how Jewel has sold out. All's she has done is expierement with new music!! What is wrong with that? People, ignore the ignorant people who obviously have not even heard the album and claim she is trying to be Britney Spears. Does anyone ever pay CLOSE attention to Intuition's lyrics? On this CD you will find the broadest and most satisfying mixture of styles than on any CD ever! I have been with Jewel since POY and I find that she is getting better with each release. If this is what is considered SELLING OUT (Being a true artist and expanding new styles!) then I'm loving the concept of it!!! Count me in as a lifetime Jewel fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel throws down a top-tapping, light-hearted album! :)","review":"I have to agree with the review title from another author, \\"Jewel as you've never heard her\\"! This is true! I was extremely pleased with the light-hearted, yet quality material on this album. While listening to the very nicely constructed melodies and lyrics, I found my top tapping and head bobbing. This album compels you to move! The strongest songs on the album are: U & Me = Love (strange title, but excellent), America, Becoming, Yes U Can, Sweet Temptation, Haunted and Intuition. It seems she really wanted to \\"cook\\" on the last half of the album because those songs have the best musical content, lyrically and musically, in my opinion.This is a definite buy! Much, much better than her last album, but not quite the caliber of Spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"......","review":"I don't think Jewel is a sell out. Her songs are still moving and just as poetic as her other cds but I feel that the new pop/dance music drowns out her unique voice. I don't think the music fits with the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!","review":"Im a HUGE Jewel fan but was so dissapointed with this. There is not one song on this album that I truely like. It is overproduced and Jewel should stay well away from the pop music she has produced on this album as it does not suit her at all. If you like Jewel and want to continue to like her dont buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"0304 = great!","review":"I just got this cd for christmas, and i ADORE it...first off, even though it is more \\"pop\\"-ish, Jewel's statement from the beginning was that she wanted to make pop music with lyrics that meant something. She even repeated it on TRL when Intuition first came out. So what if the background music has beat, and is more electric than previous albums? The lyrics still have meaning...and still strike a chord. It's not like she's singing \\"Hit me baby, one more time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"jewel pulls a e.b.t.g. and it works!!!","review":"You know, a lot of people are gonna cry sellout and pop trash about this album but the fact is it's not all that bad. Look how long \\"Pieces of You\\" sat on shelves before it was discovered and then overplayed. When Everything But The Girl remixed \\"Missing\\" somes years ago everyone fell in love with the song and it topped the dance charts. Jewel hasn't gone quite this far into pop/club territory but the new beats and experimentation with rarely heard instruments like the accordion give her beautiful voice a refreshing new backdrop. Like her previous cds the lyrics are imaginative and strong; the music will only help expose her to an even larger audience. Big time props to the talented cover girl blonde!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"way to go jewel!","review":"This album is so good. It has music that just puts you in a good mood and it is a cd that you don't tire of. Favorite tracks are stand,intution,2 find u,u&me=love, 2 become 1 ....basically the whole cd is great. Jewel did good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel's new album wants you to buy her old album","review":"Where has Jewel gone?I\\"ve read it in the magazines that Jewel has \\"changed\\".. No more folk/country.. Now: DANCE GROOVY MUSIC...This CD is alright, I suppose.. It's just not what I was expecting.. And that's a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"shedding blood in the name of liberty","review":"So she's blasting us soldiers (goes along with the President) for our \\"shedding blood in the name of liberty\\"?

Washington for shedding blood in the name of liberty?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel's Best","review":"I've been holding off on buying Jewel's new cd, but after hearing Stand I had to go buy it. This is by far Jewel's best album. It's quite a bit more upbeat then her previous works. Check out the song entitled \\"America\\". Awesome lyrics! I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"0304","review":"A very interesting endeavor for Jewel. I bought this cd blind... meaning that I hadn't heard any singles about it, I wasn't even aware that Jewel had a new album out till I was shopping and I saw it and tossed it in the cart, thinking that I was safe because, in my opinion, Jewel hasn't put out a bad song.I was very surprised to hear, instead of the poetically soft songs, hearing songs that were more from her heart, that conveyed her feelings on things that were more real instead of just pretty words with accoustics.I recommend this album, however, I recommend listening to it first when you aren't doing anything. Listen to her words, hear her message, feel what she is trying to make you feel. Really soak it in and then you can have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience in itself!","review":"I bought her album expecting it to be shallow and extremely \\"pop\\" ridden, but purchased it anyway because I'm a fan of hers. I was, however, pleasantly surprised that it wasn't at ALL what I had expected. Her lyrics are, as always, clever, intelligent, thought provoking, and moving. The only difference between this and her previous albums is that this album has a pop/dance sound. But it's not a bad thing at all because her lyrics and the music blend so well! I read that she decided to record an album people could dance to and have fun with due to the rough times of war we were in, and it does just that! Each song is memorable and beautiful. She's evolving as a writer and as a musician, and I can certainly appreciate that. Kudos to Jewel for creating an awesome genre-blurring album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disappointed","review":"As we enter the pop era many artists change, some that you'd never expect to. This is what happened to Jewel. If you loved her first albums then this is DEFINETLY not the CD for you. It is very popish and very different from her earlier work. If Britney Spears is your idol I reccomend this CD. If you liked her earlier work then you might wanna try Sarah McLachlan's new CD, afterglow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the others","review":"Jewel probably thought by injecting her voice and her body into a style of pop now the mainstream in popularity today she'd get more coverage or sell more CD's...all she's done is failed because there's nothing particularly original or spectacular here and she would have sold more CD's by being herself in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not classic Jewel, but not bad","review":"The reason I really enjoyed Jewel's music, was because it was from the heart and not overdone like much of today's pop music. When I first heard \\"Intuition\\", I couldn't believe it was Jewel.I'm not going to say this album is horrible, because it's not. People have accused Jewel of selling out to sell more records. When Madonna 're-invents' herself (like ever 6 months), no one accuses her of being a sell out, they call her a diva, the 'Material Girl'. Now, Jewel does it and she is just trying to sell herself and give up HER music.However, most artists return to their musical roots at some point, so even though she is re-inventing herself right now, perhaps to build a stronger fan base, I think that Jewel will eventually return to the Eva Cassidy-esk singer we've all come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy time","review":"this album gives me the creeps. And those song titles are something to behold Jewel. Last year you were a serious poet, this year you can't spell. Do you know who you are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Garbage, not Jewel !!","review":"This album is a complete sell out of a great artist. It's a crossbetween Madonna and Brittny Spears. If you love Jewel, DON'T bythis album because there is no Jewel to be found on it. Iwould rate this Zero stars, but don't think Amazon allows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell-out","review":"It seems that Jewel is looking to join the pop princess ranks.The music on this CD is lacking the soul of her previous work.I guess Jewel is just following the rest of the country and working towards the higher ideal of mega bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop With Substance, Meaning(Quick Review)...","review":"and depth. I noticed the presence of trip-hop incorporated into some tracks on her new album (Stand,Leave The Lights On,Haunted). You should begin to notice major spoofing by track 11, \\"Yes You Can\\" and some of the other playful retro hippie tracks like \\"America\\", \\"You and Me=Love\\". Jewel does have more serious sounding songs like \\"Becoming\\",\\"To Find You\\" and \\"Fragile Heart\\". The majority of the tracks are spoofs of popular music with consciousness and underlining meaning interjected. There are an ear pleasing 9-11 songs depending upon you personal taste and how diverse they may be.Even though I'm not a long time Jewel fan, I will get this album, not only for the good tracks on the album, but for the bold stand she took on music today. Some people buy music for even more shallow reasons, like to view the pictures inside, or for one or two radio singles they like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Tack-tack-tacky!","review":"Unfortunately Ms. Kilcher's third studio album release is a prime example of an artist 'selling out' to impress fickle mainstream audiences. The first single from Jewel's album '0304' is infectious, irritating bubblegum music for the masses - I'm sure it will impress and be embraced by radio audiences all over the globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Jewel","review":"Jewel is back with a new album and a new look and sound. That is the only differences between this Jewel and Jewel of the past. The introspective songwriting is still here, it's just backed with dance beats and a more polished sound that her folk/country stuff from previous albums. Yes Jewel has gone pop, but her music still has substance. Many accuse her of selling out, but she hasn't, this style of music isn't what is all over the place right now. The first single \\"Intution\\" is a piece of pop heaven, that has proven to be a big hit for her, and people seem to enjoy her new style. There's so many good songs that could be singles like \\"Stand\\", \\"Run 2 U\\", \\"2 Find U\\", \\"Fragile Heart\\", \\"Haunted\\", etc. This is a great album, give it a try and keep an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A risk that's paid off","review":"I just finished listening to this album on AOL and before I didn't think I'd buy it based on Intuition since I don't particularly like that song. Plus, I'm a devoted Jewel fan from the first album all the way through. I thought, I don't want to buy poppy, shallow stuff, especially from Jewel! But, after listening to the album, I'm impressed. This is what Madonna has tried to do on her past three albums but hasn't completely pulled off because, lyrically and vocally, Madonna is weak. Jewel proves on this album that you can do dance, electronica and pop with meaning and heart and complicated lyrics. And her voice is amazing! She took an enormous risk with this album, and I say she pulled it off. I admire her for that. It's a great album. I think my favorite song is Haunted. Beautiful and moving. People, listen to the lyrics, our Jewel is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A FUN DANCE RECORD!!!","review":"Jewel has created a masterpiece. this is the most fun i have had listening to a record in years. this is an instant classic for me. this is already one of my 10 faveorite albums of all time. this album was meant to be fun. my faves are \\"u & me = love\\" and \\"yes u can\\". played back to back they liven up any dance floor or party. the surprise is fragile heart. a great ballad. it sounds so sweet. there is not a bad song on here. don't be negative. crank up 0304 and get down and get groovy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different sound but same Jewel","review":"Although this may be a different sound for Jewel, one can't deny the power of her songwriting and lyric as well as the passion she conveys through her music. It is an enjoyable record and I am eager to see what Jewel does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can someone think this not a good album ????","review":"I've listened to all jewel's materiel since the debut, and I think this is a very good album, from which i don't skip any song why playing it. That was not the case with her previous one which i didn't really like.Jewel has managed to bring new influences in her music, and the Intuition Video shows she doesn't take that 'commercial & pop' music that seriously.She looks ans sounds good. Good Job Jewel !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses Everything that Makes Her a Jewel","review":"The thing I have always loved most about Jewel is her voice. I can't really describe it well, but she has a very sensual sound that makes me want to stop and listen. Unlike most of the generic girls singing out there her voice is worth hearing and they have produced it beyond recognition.My 15 year old daughter (who loves Britney and her ilk) said it best: \\"I used to love Jewel before she was a ho\\". Her friends all seem to agree. I hope Jewel realizes what a career killer this album is and moves in a better direction. She might be able to save her reputation and pull herself out of this nosedive with a return to her roots. I hope so, 'cause she is one of my favorite young artists and I hate to see her ruin herself like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"well i dont know","review":"well since cdnow doesnt even have examples available on the day it comes out, i am not able to hear it before i buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"I could launch a T.V. series on how this album fails. But I won't. I will simply say that I wish she would go back to folk."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this cd is PURE garbage. stand was an ok song, so i thought i'd download the album, even though i hate Intuition. there are only about 3 or 4 cuts that are GOOD on this album. the rest sounds like the latest britney spears album!!

WHY JEWEL WHY. even the songs that sound like her older stuff, her voice still sounds more computerish. maybe her next album will be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Sold out","review":"I have been a fan of the old Jewel, but when i heard the single \\"intuiton\\" and saw the video i was disgusted...she has sold out to the pop craze it seems and she has gone \\"ghetto\\" The sons are no better than J.lo or Beyonce' or other horrible pop stars of that sort....buy Pieces of You, or ANYTHING besides this album, because it is just depressing that Jewel has gone so mainstream and abandoned all her folk roots"},{"rating":"2","title":"still same old Jewel........","review":"Yes, this is different then her Debut and This way, but Jewel's lyrics haven't changed. They are still poetic as the other ones, just different. Intution is just a joke as she says, but a great song. In 0304 she experiences with jazz, techno and yes pop music. A great album. She says what she wants to say in America, saying what is true. She might have changed her image, but this is a great album. She isn't BRITNEY. Britney's music is studio music, Jewel's music is from the heart and she writes her own stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not good","review":"This entire album seems to be dance music. What happened to just her and her guitar. The lyrics are good but you can't feel them behind an annoying dance beat. Her older albums are much better. She shouldn't try to be a pop star, she was better off as the folksy guitar player. I only hope her next album is more like the older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful lady, sings from her heart","review":"I just purchased this cd yesterday, All I can say is Jewel,, I love the way you do it,,you've got a beautiful voice and you sing with your heart, means alot to all of us. thank you for giving us your all once again. I love this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes, it's all about selling - even yourself","review":"It is what every real Jewel fan would write: It's not her, why care about this CD?So, yes, I did listen to it, about two days. It got boring as soon as most Popsongs do, it doesn't inspire you with its lyrics as her first albums did.She was outstanding, because she had her own way and she had success with it. But it was obviously to hard or not working good enough. Whatever it was, Jewel changed and for me, not for the better. I miss her a little and if you do too:Try Sarah McLachlan. She's true to herself and to her music. She's not selling herself for a little plastic fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite nice.","review":"When I first heard this album, I was blown away. It just sounded so different from the pop I was used to, like Hilary Duff.I like all of the cuts, but two really stand out: Run 2 Me and 2 find U. Both of those became my favorite songs ever.So, I consider a nice investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEWS FOR ORIGINAL JEWEL FANS!!","review":"HEY! for all you that's pretty much given up hope on our lil Jewel Kilcher (like i did) GUESS WHAT?! i just saw an interview w/ her and she said her next album is gonna be \\"lo-fi\\" and not like this one!! SHES GOIN' BACK TO HER ORIGINAL ACOUSTICNESS!! (...is that a word???) n e wayz, YA! good job jewel, this wasn't ur style anyways. SO YA! dont give up on hope yet, because our original GOOD jewel is back.although this cd DID have some original cuts... \\"To Find You\\" sounded like it coulda come from the \\"This Way\\" sessions. other than that, nothin' stands out...so at least there was SOMETHING half descent on this album. To Find You coulda been on this way, if she changed some things. anyways.CONGRADULATIONS JEWEL!! Your Originalness is gonna be back with us next year ^__________^"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?????","review":"Has it been so long since the great \\"Pieces of You\\" album came out? I guess it has because I do believe Jewel is going through a mid life crisis. If I was twelve years old I would probably give this album high marks. But I'm not, and Jewel is way too talented to appeal to them. If I could give her advice, I would. I'd say...it's definitly nice to change for once -- but you shouldn't change totally. Either write terrible melodies and great lyrics or great melodies and terrible lyrics, but not both. I regard the \\"Old Jewel\\", the one fresh from living in a car in Alaska, as one of my all time favorite artists. But this New Jewel...well, that's a different story.Give the album to all your little sixth grade children so that she will get some proceeds. Maybe with enough money, she'll decide she should try to play the guitar again.I think she forgot how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Jewel sell-out?","review":"All of Jewel's past albums have been commercially successful and she's formed an enormous fan base over the years, so why sell-out now and make pop-crap for the masses of teeny-boppers who think Shakira or Justin Timberlake are tallented? It's as though it's a joke...just an entire album's worth of a joke, but I'm sure this was what the record company told her to do, because they wanted to sell a few more records and give Clearchannel something to play on all of their stations across the US all summer. I hope no other great artists fall as Jewel seems to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING","review":"all i have to say is jewel is a complete sell out. this album is complete pure POP. which as we all know is a very different path than her normal music. it's disgusting how she has sold out just to make money. all her old fans will be supremely disappointed. yet unfortunately she'll gain some new ones.......... the 12 year old teeny boppers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Sorry, I couldn't even listen all the way through to most of these songs .. they are so radically different from the folk pop Jewel that we've come to know. This new breed of R&B;, hiphop, electronica just does not work - and unfortunately, this may be the bust that ends her career.Despite all of it, there are a couple of gems here. I really love the \\"2 Become 1\\" song and if the record label has a clue (don't count on it).. they will make a video out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel as Succumbed","review":"Like many female artists these days Jewel has gone for Britney image of dressing like a tart and flashing her assets to sell albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this again, its not Jewel????","review":"Wow. What a disappointment. Her beautiful voice is covered up by poppy bubble gum beats, sounds more like Britney Spears. Big big difference from her last album \\"This Way\\" which is my personal favorite. Your above the whole Pop Princess thing Jewel, take back your crown and leave this bee bop bubble gum stuff behind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Jewel we know","review":"I was a fan and was excited to pick up new cd. I just hate it. Sounds like she wants a different audience and disappoints many of her fans. I brought this cd right to the used cd shop after hearing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"can be barely called 'an experiment...'","review":"What Jewel refers to as \\"organic beats such as hand-clapping\\" are actually middle-eastern foundation beats that you will find in almost any middle-eastern pop song and even some mediterranean songs. I think this musical attempt stands out there without a soul due to the fact that Jewel neither readily admits nor understands these middle-eastern influences and thus fails to integrate that into her music rather than simply replicating it. while it's nice to see Jewel taking a new direction, the songs on this album lack originality in sound and arrangements. And it's not just the hand-clapping, but the arrangements of the semi-orchestra in songs like \\"Intuition\\" sound eastern mediterranean and middle-eastern, too. When I first heard \\"Intuition,\\" I thought I was listening to the English version of a Turkish song... or Arabic... or possibly Greek... but not \\"organic\\" as Jewels dismisses it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this woman and what has she done with Jewel?!","review":"Listening to this CD, all the way through, was neither easy nor enjoyable. If you like beat-driven \\"pop\\" with repetitious lyrical hooks, you might like '0304'. If you are expecting to be touched by another excellent Jewel collection, prepare to have your heart broken. This CD truly disappointed everyone I know who has heard it. It is pure \\"pop\\" drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice if you like Britney","review":"I have been an all out Jewel fan for many years, even before anybody else had even heard about Jewel. How excited I was to learn that she brought out a new album and now this! This album is like cotton candy: sweet, pink and fluffy, but not what you expect of Jewel. It's more like something you would want from one of those other Britney Spears clones.Not one of these songs is authentic. What I liked about Jewel are the real handmade songs that meant something, not this bublegum version.I'm not even going to bother and buy this album, although I wanted to be a supportive fan, but not for this. The only reason for giving one star instead of NONE at all, is my respect for Jewel's trying something new, but I think she should fire her new producer and go back to the real her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing new direction...","review":"...for an otherwise magnificent singer/songwriter. Jewel's newest album trades her earlier depth of feeling and musical simplicity for a Brittney Spears-ish pop sound. I would personally prefer the piano and strings of \\"Foolish Games\\" to the heavily mixed sound of \\"Intuition.\\" Compare the cultural critique of \\"Who Will Save Your Soul?\\" with these lyrics to \\"U & Me = Love\\" ...): \\"Come on, baby, won't U crash into me? / I'm like nothing that you've ever seen / Dynamite / I'll blow your mind / Guaranteed 2 mesmerize / You'll say 'ooh, la, la, la'\\" IMHO Jewel has sold her soul for a chance at pop stardom, and that's a disappointment to a lot of her earlier fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel is officially a SELLOUT","review":"This CD is HORRIBLE. It is, by far, the worst CD I have ever purchased. I used to respect Jewel for her earlier works which seperated her from the rest of the cookie cutter pop princesses. Now shes desperately trying to cater to a whole new croud with poppy britney-spears-like songs through the use of her new-founded, blatent sexuality. The only catchy song on this CD is \\"Intuition\\" and it gets old quickly. Sure, for those who have seen the \\"Intuition\\" music video, Jewel is making fun of capitalism and advertising agencies who use sex and fame to sell products. But how does she explain turning around and selling that very song to Gillette to promote their new shaving product for women??? Now all we see of Jewel is a 40-year-old women clathed in mini skirts and barely-there bra tops trying to stake a claim in a Britney Spears' market. This CD is horrible. I ALMOST can't blame her for using sex to sell this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Jewel I know?","review":"When I heard the first single on the radio, I wasn't too crazy about it. But I thought \\"Hey, it's my favorite singer, so I'll give her a chance.\\" What a mistake! First of all, the songs have electrafunk, which means it is something you are likely to hear on a Jenifer Lopez or Christina Aguliera CD. Second, her voice is way too whispery. It is way too dighitalized. Last, the lyrics are GARBAGE. All of the to's are changed to 2's, and the you's are changed to u's. What is up with \\"run 2 me, i'll run 2 u, let me crash in 2 u.\\" The only reason I gave this album more than one star is that she actually wrote the songs. Otherwise, it's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was once a Jewel is now Plastic","review":"\\"0304\\" is a total piece of crap. This is a person that battled through poverty with diverse, heartfelt, meaningful music. To what end, so one day she could release 0304, an unmotivated, heartless dance record. Who is your audience Jewel? With \\"0304\\" you turn your back on those who have loved you through the years for more money. I just don't get that. The cover of \\"0304\\" should be proof enough this is a dim shadow of the person who created \\"Pieces of You\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel is a sell-out!","review":"I love all the albums preceding 0304. However, her new style is disappointing. Save the pop for Brittany, Jewel. I'm trading this one in at my local record store."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This CD is trash. Mindless pop. What's the point of it? There's no reason for it to exist. I never gave Jewel's music much attention before until this past summer when I saw 'Intuition' come on the TV. I had to do a double take. \\"Thats Jewel?\\" I thought. This album actually made me go out and buy 'Pieces of You' to see what was so impressive about her eariler work. I was definately blown away. I understand an artist's longing to want to expand out, but this is ridiculous. The fact that her last album didn't sell so well should tell you that this is a sellout album, not musical expansion. What once was \\"who will save you soul/after all those lies that you told, boy\\" is now \\"follow your heart baby!\\" sung over forgetful, sugary dance-pop beats. She really was a breath of fresh air in the music industry. Now she's just like any other forgettable pop artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok ,but I give Her credit for trying something","review":"I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set.Vocally She is still the same.I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by.Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality matters","review":"well, I don't really care if she made a total pop album as long as the quality of this album is great although a lot of people do not like this album just because it does not have folk songs/lyrics that she used to make. However, the sad thing is that she ended up making a very crappy pop album and most of the songs sound like fake Europe-Beat. Songs are boring and cheap sond effecs are jus anoying. The only song I kinda like is Haunted (track#9)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I've only recently started getting into jewel's music..her old stuff was amazing, and I was really looking forward to this cd. lo and behold, you can tell how freaking shocked and confused i was when i listened to some of the tracks on this coaster. i can only ask myself why such a talented and stand-above-the-crowd musician would decide do this. at first, after listening to her single intuition, i tried to convince myself that she was going to be making some kind of clever statement with this album. now i understand that most of this cd is just manufactured pop. it's really sad to see another star being used and abused, as jewel would say, by a record label...well that's how it appears to me anyway. she should go independent, like the band collective soul has done recently. she might lose some exposure by doing so, but it'd sure as hell prevent her from being forced to release something like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I WAS REALLY EXCITED WHEN I HEARD THIS NEW CD JEWEL WAS MAKING WAS GOING TO BE MORE DANCE. IT'S NOT EVEN THAT. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN JEWEL. SHE IS BETTER THAN THIS. SHE COULD DO WAY BETTER THAN A DANCE CD. I LOVE DANCE MUSIC AND IT'S JUST NOT HER AT ALL. LASGO AND KYLIE MINOUGUE'S CD'S ARE MORE OF DANCE THAN THIS! I WISH JEWEL WOULD DO HER THING AND BRING US ANOTHER GENUINE ALBUM LIKE HER OTHERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Will Save Her Soul? I wonder...","review":"Do I have to give it any stars at all? If she'd started off like Britney Spears, nobody would have minded so much. But she promised something different, assured her fans that she was something new and unique, and then she goes and sells out...this is far too much of a sidestep for jewel, and I don't think her current fans will appreciate it. Walk toward the light, Jewel. Walk toward the light!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO NEXT?","review":"There could be hope!! Now that Jewel has given up music perhaps we could see the return of DAYNA MANNING. Dayna Manning deserves a lot more recognition in the world than she has. This could be her chance while the real Jewel is in retirement.Trust me music fans Dayna will not let us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly. . . Jewel sells out","review":"I've listen to Jewel since the begining. Flew 2000 miles to see her live. However, she finally gave in. No longer does she have her true sound of folk/pop anymore. The \\"diva\\" has sold out. Why Jewel? Please come back. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sellout Pop Album","review":"I listened to the album, and although it's not bad, it's nothing special. It's just another blonde Britney-like pop album, where the lyrics are as meaningful to me as much as an apple means something to a fish. I never liked her music all that much, but at least she had a niche. Over and over again, I've tried to see why people think she's so pure, intelligent and honest, but I've yet to see it. Now it's gotten to a point, where you can't tell her apart from all the other dumb blonde pop wannabes out there. Total sellout album. Just read her interviews. She's sold herself out. If you like the old Jewel, buy her first or second album. Other than that, don't bother. With each album she just gets worse, and this one's proof of that. Nothing original about this one. Buy Avril Lavigne instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't even good pop!!","review":"I loved \\"Intuition\\" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan! So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this. Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop. It's mostly folk with a rock edge. Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences. Really, \\"Intuition\\" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Selllllllll Outtttttt","review":"What happened to the Jewel that played her own instruments and brought out a soft country in her pop? She has transformed into a perfect-bodied wannabe with the most rediculus music! With U's intead of You's, 2's instead of two's or to's or too's, B's instead of be's... holy crap! I don't no about u, but th@ re-le pisses me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel Kilcher Sells Out For The Almightly Dollar","review":"Although I was never a big fan of Jewel, I was suprised that Jewel, of all people, would sell herself out to commericalism. I never thought I would see the day that Jewel would turn herself into a Britney Spears knockoff just to get airplay on top 40 radio. What's next? Torn (Remix) by Natalie Imbruglia feat. 50 Cent?This album is worth borrowing from a friend. Not because of the talent, but so you can understand what commericalism can do to a once talented artist. The album is interesting only the way a car wreck is interesting. 0304 is the kind of album I'd expect from a debut artist, not someone like Jewel. 0304 is what happens when artists listen to executives in the boardroom instead of their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a \\"jewel\\"","review":"I was surprised when i heard this playing in the background of a record store. I could not believe that it was Jewel. I am glad i heard it first, otherwise it would have been waste of my time and money to buy this album. I liked her early music, she had a unique voice and musical style. She appears to have abandoned her strengths. I will have to think twice when her next album comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Jewel were used to....","review":"I have been a fan since day one! Jewel has been such a refreshing change from the shallow lyrics of todays music. This new album has some of the the same types of lyrics, just with alot more of that typical pop sound. I like the fact that its more upbeat, but some of the songs I could live without.She is so talented, why the change? Do I feel like she has sold out? Maybe a little...And please someone please do something about her new look; NEON???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her own brand of music","review":"This album has been called \\"country.\\" Before you make that judgement, do you even know what \\"country\\" is? Yes, Jewel may have taken a page out of \\"country\\" stars like Shania Twain's books, by trying to break into the pop music scene. But I notice the Jewel still has her signiture soulful lyrics even though the back beat is different and more pronounced, she still has songs like Stand, Becoming, Haunted and Fragile Heart that echo earlier songs such as Hands, and You Were Meant for Me. While I like country music, and I like Jewel. Jewel's munsic is not country, it is her own brand of blues/pop that she has made easier to sing along with and enjoy. Unlike other singers that have attempted to cross-over into pop music, Jewel doesn't sacrifice her own opinions as she shows in America and Stand, two of my favorite songs on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound, Same Outstanding Lyrics","review":"Admittedly, as a Jewel fan, I was a bit apprehensive about this new \\"sound\\" Jewel had. Would it suit? Or would her folk rock prove to be better? All fears were eased when I put the cd in my cd player and listened to every track from start to finish.0304 is Jewel branching out with a definite new sound. But the true heart of Jewel is still there, evident in her lyrics. All new pop, r&b;, and occasional dance beats carry her lyrics all the right ways.The disc's first single, Intuition, is a great satirical view of today's entertainment industry. Standout songs for me are Run 2 U (Very reminiscent of Jewel's pre-0304 work with the updated sound), 2 Find U, Fragile Heart, Doin' Fine (Personal favorite), 2 Become 1 (Way better than that Spice Girlsl song of the same name), Yes U Can, and U + Me = Love. There's also America which like Intuition seems to satire.It's safe to say, from my standing, that whatever Jewel decides to do, it's going to be good. 0304 is evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Jewel!?","review":"Honestly this album is really disappointing. I will say to you just go back to Alaska and explore your roots again! Take care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Fans Beware!!!","review":"The first time I heard Inutition on the radio, I had no idea it was Jewel. And I nearly started to cry when a friend told me who it was. It's really a shame that this happened to a person I once considered one of the best singer/songwriters of All Time. If you're a fan of her previous work, don't get this album. All we can do is pray that for the return of Old School Jewel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Biggest sell out ever. There's such a difference in her music from this album and her first album. The old Jewel was a little different(musically speaking) then everyone else but now she wants to be like everyone else? Lame.Don't fall for this sell out. Check out her old stuff. It's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I absolutely hate this cd.

Well, I like pop, but she certainly didn't impress me.

Desperate much? Has Shakira sued you yet for \\"Intuition?\\" It's not you. You're not you. You were hot when you weren't trying so hard to be. I'm not buying the \\"irony\\" thing either. I say flaunt what you've got but don't pretend it's to prove some point about the exploitation of overt sexuality and not merely to sell more of your own records using the same tactic. This album is proof that Jewel's career has lasted at least one album too many. \\"This Way\\" wasn't really necessary either.

This is so unlike her previous albums, it took me by surprise! Her albums especially \\"Pieces of you\\" really come out well for her thoughts, poems as much as for her singing style - this one is definitely not in that class. However, i must add Fragile Heart was touching and also had a catchy rhythm to it. But the rest of the album is not Jewel.Still, its on top of my listening CDs rack. For now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul is not present","review":"If you're a fan of raw music, that is, the very soul singing out to you, then forget it. Jewel turned. She's no longer beautiful. She's glitzy, glamorous, shallow, and mainstream. \\"Pieces of You\\" is beautiful. \\"Spirit\\" started tapping ever so slightly into mainstream, adding more guitars and drums into the songs. \\"This Way\\" was about halfway there. Now \\"0304\\" is completely there. Even her voice has gone shallow. No emotion floats on this CD. No melodramatic lyrics as the beats and technology overrun them.Some people will like this CD as it_IS_\\"refreshing\\" from Jewel. However, she's now a radio clone. Too bad...I think she's losing legions of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed to see Jewel in this manner.

I believe she will lose so many of her devoted fans if she continues on like this....and the new fans that she may attract because of the teeny bopper pop sound will never understand or appreciate the true Jewel.

I don't mind change, but when change is to sound like EVERYONE ELSE... particularly when the EVERYONE ELSE at the time is CRAPPY... is awful.

It was more pop and dance beat than the soul shattering tunes that I loved from her. I listened to the whole CD once and put it down in disgust. Then, a week later, I listened to it again and tried not to focus on the fact that it was Jewel. I loved the album. It wasn't her usual thing but it still is a good thing. The best way to describe this CD would be sexy. Songs like Leave The Lights On and 2 Become 1 are perfectly sultry and romantic. The songs really appealed to my romantic soul and tended to have jazzy dance beats that were uplifting and energetic. A great CD... not as good as Jewel's first... but good enough to hold its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Jewel go, and will she be back?","review":"This album is nothing short of a pop laden, sadness parade. I remember the days when Jewel was an artist deserving of respect. Now she looks more like a thirty year old Spears wanna-be. What a sad desension for such a talent. Lets hope some day Jewel will rediscover the joys of Folk and return again to her former glory. In the mean time at least we still have the Greats (Townes VanZandt, Gillian Welch, Linda Thompson, The Jayhawks, John Gorka, Joni Mitchel, Tom Paxton, Phil Oches, Nick Drake ect.) Long live Folk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and Doesn't Gel","review":"This CD has such a different sound that when It was presented to me, I thought it was a joke. After weeks, I'm realizing it is no joke, but in fact there is something definately wrong in Jewel-land.Hopefully in a few years it will surfact that the record company pressured her into this \\"niche\\" market, and that she needed to pull more revenues by marketing to a younger generation that is willing to spend more money on CD's and merchandising.If you like Jewel's past albums, you will not like 0304. If you listen to dance music on the radio and like acts like boy band and pop-diva's, this album is for you.I lay in the former, and am thoroughly dissaopointed with this unoriginal and typical pop cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was Pleasantly Surprised","review":"Jewel seems to be going for a more pop image here. I was surprised at how well it worked. The songs have the energy and better music of pop but still have Jewel's lyrics with more depth than normal pop. I liked this CD a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel fan disappointed","review":"I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with Jewel's new cd. I reamained optimistic even after seeing the cheesey titles using numbers and letters which seemed to totally degrade Jewel's intelligence and artistic creativity. After getting the album I was disappointed at Jewel's change. With the morph into the pop world I believe Jewel has lost something that made her music stand apart from all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Whe I first heard Jewel's first single Intuition from 0304, I was disgusted and confused. Where has the Jewel I once found inspirational gone to? Wheres the guitar? Whom ever made her turn into and electronic musician should be shot, he/she ruined Jewel....."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"Jewel, Jewel, Jewel.. what happened?! This is just like all the other pop out there! She used to be great, now she sounds like a teeny bopper, with the song titles to match. I mean really Run 2 U and U & Me = Love? What is with the lame titles? It's to techno, it's not the acoustic Jewel that was the best music. I miss the old Jewel, this CD isn't even worth the money. If you're looking for good CD's I suggest Jem - Finally Woken and Joss Stone - Mind, Body & Soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"Jewel completely sold out her fans. She once wrote inspiring lyrics to beautiful soulful music, and now she's just another pop star. STINKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"while dissapointed, Jewel is in there somewhere.......","review":"While I don't approve of Jewel changing her style with EVERY album, until this CD She at least offered thoughtful and powerful lyrics and sounds.If I need another dance mix pop song drilled into my skull, I'll tune to any of dozens of radio stations in my area.What scares me the most, is how the last two stanzas of her 'intuition' lyrics are actually her TELLING her fans that she has sold out and that we can't do anything about it.This alone tells me that her lyrical talent has been turned to the dark side of the corporate commercial machine.The saddest part is that I'm sure the sales won't drop. Old Jewel fans will dissappear, but an army of mindless pop purchasers will fill that gap and spill over into huge profits for the industry.Please give us more 'Pieces Of You' and 'Spirit'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!? When I first started listening to Jewel, she was an inspiration, she was famous and a well-respected artist, and nothing about her was manufactured. She was a breath of fresh air. Now, she has become everything I prayed she never would. How can people say that it is \\"brave\\" of her to do what will bring her the most money nowadays? In what universe is that brave? What would have been truely brave is if she had continued to refuse to be everything Hollywood tried to make her to be, and if she had just continued to be herself. Her music then was beautiful and MEANINGFUL. Now is just has a background beat. We all loved her then, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"This is awful. What happened to the Jewel sound I used to know and love. I'm absolutely disgusted at this new album. Blegh. My loyalty has dropped 1000 points."},{"rating":"1","title":"So you want to enter the Eurovision song contest for the UK?","review":"This album is awful. I've bought all of Jewel's previous work and I liked it. I was looking forward to this album. What a disappointment. It sounds like some piece of rubbish that a 1980's French pop act might have come up with and would be featured on Eurotrash for the rest of Europe to laugh at. Jewel, Nul points!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt deserve one star","review":"The music is terrible, it doesnt suit her voice. She left behind all that made her unique and tried a sexy image to boost sales. She seems almost as uncomfortable with this new image as her fans are"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Her a Break!","review":"I've been a Jewel fan since her first cd. Not being a country music fan, when I bought the 4th one, This Way, the disappointment was high. With this one, however, she has redeemed herself in my eyes! I've been playing it for weeks and can't get the tunes out of my head. When I first bought it I hated it and was about to give it away. But after playing it a few times it really grew on me. Having said that, I'd really like her next album to be in her original style -- something that lets her powerful, folksy voice shine through. Jewel, if you're reading this, you've had your fun, now go back to your roots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did she sink so low?","review":"why jewel...why?!?! well the good thing is, is she sounds like her REGULAR self in concert still. performing her classics. \\"you were meant for me\\" \\"hands\\" \\"break me\\" just to mention a few. the reason why this album was made is to draw young, whiney, annoying, teenage girls. if you whiney little girls wanna hear PRODUCTIVE and GOOD music from Jewel, pick up one of her earlier albums, \\"Pieces of you\\" \\"spirit\\" or \\"This Way\\" they're 100000000000000000000% better than this crap. but who knows, maybe there is hope for her after all...(after seeing he in concert im starting to think so)"},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish!!","review":"If you are thinking of buying this album because you are a fan of Jewel's earlier stuff, then you will be deeply disapointed. She has changed from folk to sub-euro pop, like a crappy eurovision song contest entrant!! Her lyrics are weak and so is her voice, which sounds strange coming from Jewel. I accept that artist should evolve, but this is not progression."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Style - No thanks","review":"I have to add that I always enjoyed Jewel for songs like standing still, and her original folky sound with meaningful lyrics. If I wanted Brittney or Christina...I would buy them. I hate the term \\"sold-out\\", and maybe she is 'experimenting' with different sounds, but there are enough pop/dance/sound-a-like top 40 groups out there. I hope she didn't need the money that bad.The music on this album sounds canned and in no way stands out from the rest of the dance/pop junk already on the air waves. If you are 15 and love top 40, this album is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel 0304: 80s Style Music","review":"Jewel's lovely lilts are lost on this album. Sadly, I was not pleasantly surprised by her new tunes. As a fan I blindly buy CDs of sure-fire musicians whose music I know is always terrific. However, when I listened to this CD I double checked to make sure there wasn't a mistake in the recording. Perhaps there was a mix-up in the studio, surely this was not the throaty, melodic musician with whom I was familiar. 0304 sounds a lot like 80s sound like Debbie Gibson not our Jewel. I even checked to see who wrote the songs thinking that perhaps she fell victim to bad marketing advice and sang covers for another songwriter...nope.True fans of Jewel's folksy sound will be disappointed.\\"Jewel, where have you gone? I think it is terrific you chose to try something new, but there are plenty of Britney Spears, Monica Moores, etc, etc...your sound was unique and truly original. Come back.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to fix this no zero stars thing...","review":"... because that what this deserves*sigh*Why? I just want to ask her that? Why? What in the heck? You were talented Jewel, you first two CD's have been very important in my life. Your voice is beautiful, your lyrics make me cry, your MUSIC is beautiful...I can't listen to any more. I can't listen to Morning Song, Angel Standing By... I can't listen to any of it. Because you've ruined it with this trash. Congradulations, you've made pure beauty into wretched, sticking, shallow trite. Lets give you a round of applause, skinny little seventh graders LOVE your music, that's something to be proud of. Roll in your stench."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has She Sold Out?","review":"I hate to say it, but as a long-standing fan of Jewel's I was very dissapointed at the release of this album. What had made Jewel unique from the rest of the stuff out there was her unique worldly view and expresive hamanistic lyrics. However, she seems to have ditched her past to persue a new \\"trendy\\" sound featuring empty, meaningless love-pop lyrics. I fear she has lost site of the true meaning she used to hold for a new sexy image and I find it a sad and pathetic waste of talent. jewel, please come back to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known","review":"Leave the lights is okay.When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better becareful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular.EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel sells out to the ranks of Teen Pop","review":"Without hearing anything about Jewel's latest album I went to my local Sam Goody and purchased it. I was slightly curious about the album when I saw the cover, but because it was Jewel I was sure that I would love it. Imagine my suprise when I put it in my CD player. I had to check to make sure I had the right CD. It's a tragedy that Jewel no longer wants to be a talented and insightful lyricist instead she joins the ranks with all the other masses who put out meaningless and superficial songs.I will always remember Jewel for \\"Pieces of You\\", \\"Spirit\\", and \\"This Way\\". Hopefully she will come to her senses and grow tired of being another blonde in trashy clothes amongst all the others. If not, I will always choose to think of \\"This Way\\" as her final album. If you really want a good CD, buy any of her other CD's. I would only advise buying this album if you think Jewel's a new singer or your favorite song is \\"Intuition\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Jewel, get Plumb instead.","review":"Her first single \\"Intuition\\" sounds awful. I've been a Jewel fan since her \\"Pieces of You\\" debut and it never occurred to me that her voice is nasal-sounding, that was till \\"Intuition\\" was released.Completely new sound, new tunes and a new image; which are quite distateful I might add. Those who like the previous or earlier versions of Jewel should give this album a miss.Instead, \\"Plumb\\" is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT","review":"I had hoped it wasn't true, but it is \\"Jewel sold out\\" so she could sell cd's. Thought that would never happen. Jewel should be embarrassed with what she has done. She needs to go back to Texas and stay at the ranch until she finds her self again."},{"rating":"1","title":"To thine ownself be true...?","review":"Does everyone have a price? Obviously Jewel does. I guess the nasty world of commercialism finds its way into every nook and cranny these days. I suppose we shouldn't be shocked that even some talented artists succumb to the overwhelming peer pressure to conform to what is \\"more marketable\\" to up their sales (I mean, they have to put bread on their table too). I guess the disappointment stems from such a complete sell-out. From real, heartfelt, deep and poetic TO pre-packaged, cookie-cutter, superficial, and fake. Truly sad. Hearing \\"Intuition\\" by chance on the car radio, I mistook her for Brittany Spears - and nearly had to pull over when I heard it was Jewel! This is just one of many aficionados of Jewel's former music who will not be purchasing or even be caught listening to these mere fragments of what she used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she being serious??","review":"Gosh. Jewel was such a promising talent. Great, deep meaningful songs with beautiful backing music, she was just brilliant, but oh dear... What the hell is she thinking?? Does she seriously think this album is a good piece of work?It's boring, lifeless and very unoriginal.. I really, really wish I could enjoy this album but it's just dull.Pick up Michelle Branch's 'Hotel Paper' CD, it's much better than this, but then again Jon Bon Jovi's solo album is better than this and that IS saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent change of pace.","review":"Everyone here needs to stop griping and listen to the music. It took me a while to get over my memories of Jewel's former sound, but once I did, I realized what a strong piece of music this really is. Though a couple songs aren't the greatest (tracks 10 and 11, in my opinion), the album as a whole is quite good. Open your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Titles!","review":"While some might put effort in to song titles Jewel certainly breaks the mold and shows us that it isnt always the case. The choice wording on some of these tracks are great words like \\"2\\" or \\"U\\" . Im sure every child who chats online is going to love this CD just by reading the track selection! Track \\"2\\" (get it??) is the first glimpse we see of this bold style of naming but fear not it doesnt stop there! There are a grand total of 5 , yes 5! Unfortunatly track \\"4\\" \\"Leave The Lights On\\" seems a bit out of place.. 4 words.. none of them using the cool online wording.. this may prove to be the CD's downfall in the younger market. And as you can alredy see shes alienated herself from the older \\"cooler\\" generation. I can only hope for her next CD she doesnt play both sides the naming of songs is a serious bussniess shes been in the game long enough to know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Remixed","review":"Way to go Jewel. I love this CD. It is still Jewel, but remixed. She sounds wonderful and the beats add to her dramatic voice. She pulls the sound and look off wonderfully. Some people have said that she is a Britney Spears and Madonna rip off. She sounds NOTHING like Britney Spears. Jewel actually has talent. Britney does not. Madonna is talented, but Jewel sounds like Jewel, not Madonna. Jewel is rocking it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"This cd is great!!!!! ok YES she changed her musical syle ALOT... but her lyrics are still there...her wonderful songs are still there...besides you can't compare her to Britney...ATTENTION TO ALL OF THE EX-JEWEL-FANS-THAT-HATE-her-'CUZ-OF-THIS-LAST-ALBUM.....don't you get that she is using this style to make fun of the bubble-gum-pop-industry....can't you take a joke????"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have to say Jewel is a great singer so when I heard her new album was going to be different I was looking forward to buying it. I like dance music and this is not what I expected. If you're looking to be blown away with this new cd you won't. She has a beautiful voice but I don't think this style is for her. I think Kylie Minougue's cd's are more dance than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new cd from Jewel","review":"Wow! I have always loved Jewels style of music and was shocked the first time I heard Intuition on the radio. Her voice sounded familiar but the type of music was so different. I'm really pleased with her new musical efforts. I would suggest this cd to new and old Jewel fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experiment!","review":"Jewel has stated that this album is a reflection of a part of her personality. We all have different sides of ourselves and I am glad to see that she felt empowered to try a different sound from her previous recordings. I have been a Jewel fan since \\"Pieces of You\\" and have seen her live; she has tremendous talent. I enjoy the folkie side of Jewel but think that she has created a fun album with great lyrics. My favorite songs are \\"America\\" (superior to Madonna's \\"American Life), \\"Stand\\", \\"Sweet Temptation\\", and \\"Becoming\\" but all the tracks are great. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is our Jewel ????????????!","review":"Where are gone the beautiful ballads, acoustic guitarsand all the rest that made Jewel's music so good.This new CD only seems to be a try to get teenagers interested in her music.She has been a victim of Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears influence.

Her commentary on life was invaluable. Now, it seems as if she has sold out. Come back Jewel!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Musician To Sell Out","review":"I have been a fan of Jewel's since the relese of Pieces Of You. I respected her so much for not selling out but being a true poet and master writer. When I was flipping through the T.V and saw her video for some dumb song, I was speechless. She is a total sell out and I am ashamed that I own any of her Cds. This cd is a total fake. Its just another Britney Spears, bubble gum, meaning less, pop album.

If you want real music go buy a pink floyd album."},{"rating":"1","title":"JEWLE WANNA BE BRITNEY","review":"Now I nver like Jewel I'll say that right now, and I never liked Britney either. I will admitt Jewel has a sweet voice but this pathetic attempt to be a new Britney spears is rediculous. I loved INTUTION when it came out I couldn't believe it was Jewel...I thought Britney learned to sing...Then I saw the video and it was so sad to see a folk rocker trying to be a popstar. Jewel can't dance and she just dosen't have the pop look. Even in the music you can tyell this the beats and lyrics are so sad some don't even make sense.

I may as well have purchased a mediocre pop Britney-try hard album. The lyrics are meaningless and the music does not even cut it as dance tracks.

There is enough of this dance [stuff] in the world as it is. I used to look to the likes of Jewel to give us some music that was real and made me feel that at least there is still hope for proper good music. I was looking forward to more guitar based country/folk/rock from the one musician I thought I could rely on. Everything up till now was just getting better and better but this is a total let down. I suppose the higher you get the more painful it is when you finally fall. She has sold out. I am sure she is wealthy enough to not need to go down this populist route. I hate to say this about someone I do still admire but I hope this C.D. totally bombs then Jewel might realise how offensive this C.D. is to those who put her where she is today. Her disc buying, gig attending fans.

It's nothing like her other albums. The lyrics are obvious and sophomoric, the music is all synthetic, and the singing showcases none of the vocal virtuosity that Jewel is known for. It may as well be Brittney Spears singing these brainless bubble gum choruses from \\"ooh la la la la\\" to \\"u + me spells L-O-V-E\\". I can respect that Jewel wants to try a different genre, but this CD is just embarrassing. Don't waste your money--buy her first two albums, \\"Piece of You\\" and \\"Spirit\\", because unless you're into teeny-bopper, Casey Kasum Top 40 Billboard bull-poop, you're not going to like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello Jewel-Lo!","review":"Jewel must've been dancing around to \\"on the 6\\" by J-Lo and knocked herself out by one (or both) of her gigantic knockers and woke up and thought she WAS J-Lo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 0 stars, not the required 1...","review":"I heard \\"intuition\\" a few times on the radio last summer, and it went in one ear and out the other as just another trash pop song by some lousy pop princess.

In the last few days its been in heavy rotation on net radio in my office, and after about the 10th time in 48 hours I jumped up to see who the hell this chic sounding like a wounded cat set to the worst of the rest of the awful generic pop beats out there.I was completely beside myself when I saw Jewel. I might as well throw away my copy of her debut, because I can never listen to anything by her again without hearing that painful shrieking in the back of my head.

This is simply a dull, lukewarm collection of machine generated songs that offer no reason to listen to again. Where's that edgy young artist who said Bukowski was one of her major influences? Her and Liz Phair should start a support group for aging thirty-something female pop stars who think they should be Avril.(Oh, Jewel isn't that old? She sure acts like it...) I have to re-evaluate her old stuff.\\"If I could tell the world just one thing...that you're okay....\\"I think Jewel proves on this CD the true depth of her previous stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a Jewel album...","review":"This album is just ok. It's got some catchy bits here and there, but if you buy this expecting more of the stuff that made you love Jewel in the first place, you'll be disappointed.The album is very \\"dancy\\" and seems to blend in with all of the other contemporary albums in its genre. \\"0304\\" is unlike anything Jewel has done before and, while I can give her credit for trying something new, it's just not the style Jewel has mastered - instead, it's seems to be a style Jewel is taking a stab at. To me, it sounds a bit forced. Try it before you buy it.[Edit: 5 Years Later]Things have certainly changed! This album really grew on me and, inexplicably, I consider it one of my favorite Jewel albums. Amazon won't let me edit the star-rating, but I'd give it no less than a 4, probably a 5. I still think it's good advice to try before you buy though because, despite my sudden approval, it still may not be what you're expecting.[/Edit]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Point","review":"I have since given up on Jewel. Apparently being popular, having monumental record sales and looking like a pin-up poster girl is more important than music. I am highly dissapionted in her \\"attempts\\" to change her image. The world does not need another Madonna, it needs another talented musician, which are seriously lacking in most of the \\"music\\" produced nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I miss the old classic, genuine Jewel. My favorite thing about her was that she wrote her own music and created the quality sound herself--it wasn't from some manufactured machine that a studio [pushed] out. However, her new \\"techo/pop/dance\\" CD uses a throbbing beat with what may be her own lyrics, and I find it annoying and disappointing.She is a very talented vocalist as well as song-writer and I wish she would have continued to use her skills on this new CD. Instead, she has allowed someone to attempt to make her famous (as he did Shakira and Enrique), in what has become a typical formula to create a \\"pop diva\\" rather than simply music. This image doesn't suit her and I don't like it at all.She was much more enjoyable as an acoustic artist who had something to say and a unique way to say it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is TRULY a change -- A VERY BAD CHANGE","review":"This latest cd 0304 is the nail in coffin that is telling me not to buy another cd from Jewel. Her first 2 cd were works of art. Her 3rd cd \\"This Way\\" was a dissappointment but not nearly as bad as this dance cd. The only way to tell Jewel that she has gone way off track is not purchase her cd's. If you are a real Jewel fan take my word that this cd is so bad that if they were giving it away it would not be worth listening to. If I was ever to buy another Jewel cd in the future I would have to hear it first before buying because I can't trust her to really put out a quality cd anymore. I am angry that I bought this cd without reading any reviews or hearing it first, after all it is a Jewel cd it should be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Jewel we fell in love with?","review":"I have been a fan of Jewel's since \\"Who will save your soul\\". Like everyone else, I waited impatiently for the release of her second album that seemed to take forever. I just don't think she stands out anymore, now that she sounds like everyone else. Listening to this cd reminded me of my Tiffany album when I was in junior high. In her earlier albums you could hear the emotion in her voice and you could feel what her lyrics were about. Now her messages are overpowered by digital noise. I love a good dance song as much as the next person but this new format just doesn't do her music justice. I hope she knows that there are people out there who would still buy her albums even if she just sounded like Jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL-OUT with a hint of SURPRISE.","review":"I cannot believe what our society is coming to. \\"Pieces of You\\" and \\"Sprit\\" were in my opinion awesome works of art.

That's too bad because I really admired this talented woman. What an absolute let down. HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jewel, You're Not A Popstar","review":"0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me. A disappointing affair overall. I think that she will look back on this one with regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing I can say...","review":"The best thing I can say about 0304 is that Jewel's kept her lyrics. Whatever happened to the Jewel I grew up hearing? The one with the acoustic guitar? Why does everyone have to try to out-Britney Britney? \\"Becoming\\" is quite reminiscent of the old Jewel, and \\"America\\" is a slightly more modern version of \\"The New Wild West.\\" These two songs are what keep 0304 from being a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll like Martina, please check her out!!!!!!","review":"I agree that this album robbed true Jewel fans of her poetic genius, and charming folk talent. Hopefully Jewel will realize that her fans loved the old Jewel, not this flashy bauble she has become on this latest release. But in the meantime do your ears a favor and check out MARTINA SORBARA, if you've never heard of her. She plays piano, writes her own songs she's up and coming, she plays and makes her own guitars. She's poetic, and has a wonderful voice to boot. She is in every sense of the word an artist. She is all around wonderful and what Jewel was before she, and I daresay, SOLDOUT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD you should definitely own!","review":"I have loved Jewel since the beginning, so I am partial, but I listen to lots of different music. This album from beginning to end is GREAT. It is fun and thought provoking. Her writing and voice are just amazing. If you are an angry soul, this might just make you happy. :) I hope you enjoy 0304 as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die-hard fan says she's still got it","review":"Jewel has always embodied what it means to be unconditionally talented and I have admired her since her very first album. 0304, yes, is a step aside from her normal folksy sound, but it accomplishes what she set out to do: in a recent interview she stated that this album is very different from her previous works b/c she took in to account the current economy and state of the nation and wanted something feel good--something that people could listen to and have fun with. This album does just that. True Jewel fans know that she places huge emphasis on the lyrical content of her songs. 0304 continues to embrace the power of emotions brought to life through her words. \\"America\\" (last track) truly conveys where she was going with this cd and its brutal honesty is refreshing. 0304 is simply another extension of Jewel which enables the listener to become acquainted with the *woman* behind the music, introducing us to her flirty side and her humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"0304","review":"A surprise. . .Yes. I loved it. Sharing another facet of her multifaceted, multitalented self. . . .it's still JEWEL. I have 3 of Jewel's previous CD's. . .the pop sound/beat of 0304, as I mentioned was a surprise, and she pulls it off! ! ! It's like she took off her jeans and tee and dressed up for a casual, but colorful and lively party. Go for it, you just might like it. . .I think you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album does not stand the test of time","review":"I'm really tired of this album now. It's been out about a year, and it has fallen out of rotation (something that Jewel's other albums never seem to do with me). Her assertion that the slick commercialization of her image was all part of the 'joke' wears thin when you hear \\"Intuition\\" on a razor commercial. All of this has probably done irreparable harm to Jewel's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? Sellout . . . . ?","review":"I feel Jewel totally abandoned her folk roots with this horrible CD. It's \\"techno\\" beats and horrible song arrangement give me a headache. The fact that the actual CD is pink should be a sign to everyone that it is POP! Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against pop. I like good pop, but this is bad pop, horrible pop. If she thought that \\"catchy lyrics\\" and skanky clothing would improve her image, then she was definitely wrong. She turned on her fans and made one of the worst albums of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is jewel trying to do hip hop?","review":"liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":":'(","review":"poor mis-guided jewel...she had it all. the looks, the voice, the songs, and the money. i guess she decided she had enough when she put together this crap all album. the only good song on it is \\"Run to You\\" and a couple others but VERY few. this cd might be good if she stuck with her original sound. if u wanna check out the real Jewel check out Pieces of You, Spirit, or This Way. they're better than this cd in sooooo many ways. but this cd DOES have potential. if she kept away from the techno and dance sh** than this woulda been a really good cd probly. she's still got the writing ability. but anyways. hopefully this phase of hers won't last too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new, yet still heartfelt Jewel","review":"I am a loyal Jewel fan. I own every cd including Intuition, of which I am addressing. I never grow tired of Jewel's earthy sound and inspiring lyrics, Intuition not being an exception. The album holds the same soulful lyrics as previous albums with a fresh sound to get new listeners' attention. All Jewel fans have witnessed the growth of the talented female with every album. With every song she writes, she seems more at peace with herself and with being happy. The new album is a tribute to that. And although I would still like to see more albums of her previous nature, I think that Intuition is not a change for the worse. I recommend this album to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, Jewel, what happened....you used to be good","review":"Jewel has a beautiful voice which she basically wastes on these extremely corny lyriced, nearly nauseating songs. There are only a few good songs on this CD, and the second half of the CD is revolting. I wish Jewel would go back to her folk music, which was real and worth listening too. Now, I blush at her banal, embarrasing lyrics, and disco worshiping beats. It is a shame, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel, this isn't cool!","review":"Don't buy this CD. You would be better off buying the Intution and Stand singles. I was so disappointed at this CD. Jewel you aren't a diamond. Go back to your old style."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I Been a Fan of Jewel since Pieces of You, I must say that in every album she has put out, she managed to give us a different flavor, and this album is the best flavor of all, this collection sounds like those records of rock n' roll that you can not stop listening, is easy goin' and has well crafted lyrics, way to go Jewel this is her best effort ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun album /not a sell out","review":"This album is Jewels fun album. The video for intuition was done in parody. This should all not be taken too seriously. Read up on her website, watch the behind the scenes video (itunes music store) that should give you insight on what's really going on. This album is different and shockingly unlike jewel in that it's verrry Pop like almost to the point it's sickning...but again remember I don't think this is so much a change but rather a \\"for fun release\\" -Lobo-"},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't believe it...","review":"i haven't heard every song from this album, but i have just one thing to say \\"what happened to the country bumpkin that we all fell in love with.\\" i much prefer the days when Jewel was still doing Pieces of You and even Spirit. but this new deal she's got going on, i don't know. i really don't like how she's changed to another one of those manufactured pop girls. it's just horrible. Jewel what happened!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to see an artist change..","review":"It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found \\"America\\" somewhat enjoyable and \\"Run 2 U\\" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alter ego from the typical Jewel","review":"0304 is a great new album with new funky beats. I love this new side of Jewel, although the whole new image thing seems like a sell out. However, she did say in an interview that she is somewhat poking fun, but whatever, the new album is great. I do however hear some riffs that remind me of her previous songs or songs on the radio today, such as the begining of \\"Sweet Temptation\\" sounds like Tatu's song \\"Not Gonna Get it\\", and \\"Yes U Can\\" like Offspring's \\"Too Fly for a whiteguy\\", although when you get into the song, it's completely different. I really enjoy the first song of the album, \\"Stand\\" with great potential for a club with powerful lyrics. All of her songs have powerful lyrics and hopefully this album will reach some peeps that will truly listen to what she has to say, because she has some good points in them. ENjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HA HA HA","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen I would Like to say WAKE UP! Did anyb0ody actually listen to te words or watch the video. She is making fun of this glossy pop world we know call TRL. People are in such an tizzy about her selling out that she is I am sure amused by the fact that people were more then likely never hearing her lyrics that they were only going for the folk sound to make themselves seem more earthy and poetic. Great Jewel shake things. Amazing Lyrics. Funn video."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's meant to be ironic.","review":"One of the things that has really irked me about this record is not the music, it's the people who are trying to pinion Jewel into this hippie/folk artist image. It's a pop record, yes, and it does utilize pop music to make statement. It's meant to ironic and toungue in cheek.Just because Jewel inserted a couple dance beats and synths here and there doesn't make her a sell-out. I would have called her a sell out if she decided to make renditions to her past hits. Get over the folk image and get this record, it's pop music with a conscious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you done?","review":"What happened to the Jewel we know and love?? Jewel, I never thought I would see the day that you pretended to be a pop princess. Please return to your roots. This is not you and I don't like it. This album is so bubble gum and full of pop sounds that it makes me sick. Why? Why? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected...","review":"Listen to a preview before buying this CD. Jewel calls this the \\"only record I enjoy listening to\\" and \\"the one I've always wanted to make\\".Perhaps there's a reason that it took her this long to overcome the objections of her advisors... This trite little album sounds like every other piece of dance pop to come out over the last few years. Some may like it, but I suspect many other Jewel fans are going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible CD","review":"I don't care much for Jewel's old style, but it's still good for what it is. This, however, is just awful. It sounds more like Britney Spears than Jewel. The lyrics are utterly ridiculous. You'd think they were written by a 13-year-old girl. This album will probably destroy her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting feeling when hearing the word from young men","review":"When listening to these two young men sing about the trials of their lives and how God has brought them out, it gave me joy that God can and has done it for me. So if you are debating whether or not to buy this CD, don't anymore because these two young men has an anointing that will tounch you through the lyrics of the songs just like it has touched me. Thank God for Remixx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REMIXX \\"Say you believe\\"","review":"These two brothers are the best Rythem and Good News singers aroundI have had the pleasure of hearing two of their cd's\\"Dear Lord\\" and \\"Say you believe\\" and they are timelessPeace,Sandi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feelin' this","review":"I recently purchased the Remixx CD from the PX on my Base and I must say I am dissapointed. I support Christian artists to the fullest, and My Fiance is currently working on a project, but for whatever reason this cd did not appeal to me. The Chorus' seemed to have had little or no thought to them, the lyrics and their voices just didnt blend well to me. Nothing against Remixx and their ministry for the Lord, but maybe they might have rushed this a little bit too much. If a song doesnt catch my ear, at least let it paint a picture for my mind.. this CD did neither.For all you who are unsure if this is what you want, try to listen to some tracks first... judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voyage of Self-discovery","review":"A voyage of self-discovery, with some hair-raising suspense along the way. For anyone who has ever felt out of place, or been jolted into such feelings, this is the book for you. If you want to know more about Italy and about parent-child relationships, so much the better.

High quality paper, large text, solid binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backwards, and Repeatedly Debunked","review":"This book is a lesson in garbage in, garbage out. Keynes starts with numerous false assumptions, and follows them to their false conclusions. Keynes has been proven wrong time and again, not only through the texts of much better economic writers (Hayek, Rothbard, Mises), but also through the plain facts of history.Keynes' book reads like through the looking glass, where down is up, and everyone is drunk at a mad tea party. Keynes' ideas are precisely what will (and already have) lead society to economic failure and misery. The current financial crisis is only the latest in examples of why Keynes was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Economics of Failure","review":"John Maynard Keynes is the collectivist's savior. Finally, the welfare statist thinks, someone who actually makes my ideas sound good to economists. Unfortunately, Keynes's theory is nothing new. It should be incredibly obvious to any non-professional that if a large entity (government) decides to spend a lot of money over a short period of time, then in the short term there will be very pleasurable effects. In the long term, however, a large sum of money spent by the government will have very harmful effects, distorting the price system and creating inflation, whereas a large sum of money spent by a private entity will have a sustained benefit on the economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical, boring, highly assumptive","review":"The main problem with Keynes is the fact that he wrote so much, some of it has to be somewhat correct. The only problem though is that Keynes' ratio of correctness to incorrectness is highly weighted toward the latter. I sometimes wonder if Keynes did not sit down and write everything and anything he could think of in hopes of getting it right eventually. In short, a simplistic, often redundant, and economically flawed book. The reputation on this one truly overshadows it's non-reflective garbage aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as \\"Das Kapital\\"","review":"This book, along with the writings of Karl Marx, is responsible for most of the economic misery of the 20th century. Still, reading this, along with the essential \\"The Failure of the New Economics\\" by Henry Hazlitt, will give the reader an excellent insight as to why Japan has failed, and will continue to fail, to get out of the moribund economic state it has been languishing in for over the past 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of academic claptrap","review":"I purchased this book to finally read for myself what Keynes actually had to say. I started reading with an open mind but found the writing to be obtuse, and found the theories so riddled with dubious assumptions that they have little, if any, application in the real world. I also cannot imagine this book being used as required reading, or as a textbook, except possibly in a logic class as an example of faulty reasoning. If you are looking for a book on economic theory that can teach you something that you can actually use and apply, I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"the kindle version lacks ALL footnotes!","review":"I bought the kindle edition.

But this edition of the book is flawed. Keynes's footnotes are missing! Some of them are integral to understanding the book, so leaving them out is a major mistake. Another reviewer has already complained that some of Keynes's equations were mangled. How could a publisher mangle a great work like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this edition","review":"Keynes is pretty great (or at least, inarguably important), but this edition does not include footnotes, which were supplied by Keynes in the original text. If you're bothering to read The General Theory, and are capable of following it, you're probably also a reader of footnotes, so do not buy this copy.Of less concern, though telling, are the various typos that seem to be the result of (I'm not kidding) a bad OCR scan of an original. On page 13, for instance, the word \\"ina~tained\\" shows up. I'm assuming that meant \\"maintained,\\" and I think it's implausible that tildes are defensible typos.

I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book that refounded economics","review":"Here it is: the masterpiece of 20th century macro econ, and one of the last important books in which the argument advances by reasoning rather than by calculation. An enormous influence on Everybody, it broke new ground by considering things like interest, inflation, money and unemployment: all things which had really had no existence in formal economics before Keynes. It is NOT Keynes' most accessible book, and no doubt he would have changed much had he lived, but everyone, including the new classical economists, owe much of their thought to this volume.During the '80's it became fashionable to deride Keynes, particularly among those who had never read him. Like big purple hair, this fashion seems to have past. But see review below for a throwback.This is the book that created macroeconomics... and asks questions that have retained their interest. What more could one ask?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Important and Dull","review":"This book is worth reading for the impact it has and continues to have on economics. For the most part, we still live in Keynesian world. However, Keynes could have used some formal instruction on clarity, his writing is a mess.

I have about 250 chess books, and I can't think of one I would rate below this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark Repelent","review":"Miller's portrayal of an overly polictically correct world with little room for Batman, is compelling and original. The book's dark portrayal of a brooding, violent, Batman who has lost his faith in the justice system's ability to rehabilitate criminals set the stage for the modern portrayal of Batman in both comics and film. In my opinion, this is a story of Batman the way he should be portrayed, as the tortured punisher of evil not the friendly neighborhood super hero. We can leave that to Superman, and if you've ever wanted to see Superman get brought down a few pegs, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Batman Story Ever.","review":"I just recently bought this book at a local comic shop. I gotta say this has got to be the best choice i've ever made. First of all this has the trademarck writting style of the legendry Frank Miller, he also (you probably already know) pencilled the story with his brilliant unique style. This story is set ten years after batman faked his own death, he eventually gets fed up with all the stuff happening out there so the dark knight decides to make a triumphant return. This book redefined the character batman and turned him into a darker more serious hero. This has just recently been put into Time magazines 100 best english written novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Graphic Novels to date","review":"Comic books are rarely ever thought for its good writing. When most people think \\"comic book,\\" they think of a childhood past, where batman had every gadget ready for any situation.I think that this graphic novel breaks the mold of good comic book writing. Batman is no longer in his prime, in his retirement age, and yet he fights harder then he ever had before. Through this comic, Batman as a character is probably one of the strongest I've read. Batman is reborn!This is a must read for anyone! simply anyone. No other comic has ever given me chills like when Batman says \\"this isn't a mud hole, this is an oporating table... and I'm the surgeon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-invention is not always the best path","review":"While this book can be said to be the one work to usher in the modern age of comics, I find it not as entertaining or stimulating as many other tales of the Batman. Miller really never displays a knack for the characterization of the Batman, and he seems to muddle through much of the convoluted story trying to figure out what Batman is and what he stands for. Most contemptible is the relationship Miller describes between Batman and Superman, which I find to be very off base. Of course, Batman could beat Superman, but never in that way. Also, Miller's art falls short from earlier and more terrific works such as in the Wolverine limited-series. All in all, not a great triumph for the Dark Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it gets","review":"this is probably THE comic book off all time. together with MOebius \\"John Difool\\" I dont know how many times i have read this book and its exiting every time. its like waching a movie, and all you hope for is that it never ends. it has come to my attension that there is a secuel, that is the best thing that could happen this decade!!! except for world peace off cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Honestly I am not the biggest comic book fan, but this is a must read. One of the best, if not the best, comic book story I have ever read. If you are a fan of Batman, or super heroes in general this is a book you should pick up.

Batman is (perhaps) way beyond his prime, is barely on speaking terms with Superman, and the government has outlawed vigilante superheroes.Nobody writes the dystopian future better than Miller; He captures a horrifying feel as society destroys itself with a mix of apathy, anarchy, and entropy which no one can or even cares to stop.A must read for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This book tells the story of an aged batman and of a Gotham that is more violent then ever.

The story is amazing, although I was left wanting just a little more, but I can understand why the comic had to end there.

Clever, I thought.But.. this comic is overrated. Not that it's not a good story, and well presented in all the visuals, but it's not to par with all the critic's talk. The story being written in the eighties must be taken into account, so the plot twists and other references don't really hit today's audience.This is, however, a must-have addition to any serious graphic novel enthusiast, Batman fan, or aspiring artist. The reference value alone makes it worth the read, if not the buy.-The GlowWormP.S.

I found the character, portrayed as their future selves, to be old haggard and somewhat cynical. Bruce Wayne/Batman forsakes his minimal violent approach for a more \\"shoot first, ask questions later\\" approach. Gotham City is portrayed as a violent microcosm compared to the violence and decay that exist as the USA fights a Vietnam/Granada type war in Maltese Coro. This is a book that exists on many levels. It's not Batman Vs. The Joker, or Batman Vs. The Mutants, but Batman Vs The World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps necessary but not truly Batman","review":"Frank Miller's dark, gritty portrayal of Batman may have been a necessity in getting away from the campy feel of the older comics as well as the TV show. As a whole, though, i really feel it sacrificed on the essence of the character. Batman is not meant to be a vengeful brute with an arsenal of weaponry but a force of good and a defender for Gotham City. To me, the elements on which Miller deviated may be the ones that truly define Batman...and when the core of the character changes, that really ruins it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"You're supposed to love and adore this book. Just look at any reviews that don't gush about how amazing it is...and look at the comments. People are called \\"Stupid\\", \\"illiterate\\", \\"moron\\" and \\"idiot\\" for disliking this book.I honestly couldn't finish it. All the characters look ridiculous, the art is horrid and the story just drags and drags and drags. If it weren't so ugly to look at I might have had the courage to finish it but I just couldn't take it anymore.This book is awful, just awful. Sent back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and a very boring book","review":"I'm going to keep this as short as i can.I heard a lot of good things about this book and so as a big batman fan i certainly could not resist checking this one out,sadly i wish i had skipped this one.First off it's very shoddy 80's drawing,and the story is just sooooo boring i kept nearly falling asleep,but my main complain with this novel is how boring and lousy the dialog is.so as i said in the beginning im going to keep this short,i don't want to go to in depth with this review.Overall I would not recommend this book,there are certainly way better batman story's out.Frank Miller really slipped on this,instead check out his batman book-Year One,It's certainly a batman story you CAN NOT miss out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor art style kills what could have been a masterpiece.","review":"Let me just start by saying, I love batman. He is by far my favorite comic book hero, and I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to batman comics, and just batman in general. I appreciate this book, im so glad it exists because it really changed the way batman would be portrayed in the future, and paved the way for higher quality comics in general. That being said, I am reviewing the book, not its impact. The story was really good, but honestly it doesnt even matter because the art was so unbearably bad that it destroyed any possibility of finding enjoyment in this book. I am so glad that dc is going to make an animated movie based on this book, (also doing batman year one) because finally this great story will be able to be seen in a way that it deserves to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uck!","review":"This most depressing of stories failed to keep me interested.

I bought two other batman graphic novels in addition to this one, and Batman: The Dark Knight returns was easily the worst one. The art is horrible, half the time I couldn't even figure out what was going on. The story just kind of drags on. I did finish it since I bought it, but it really wasn't a fun read at all. I would recommend passing on this graphic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff for Batman lovers and the others!","review":"Batman is back, 10 years later. Older, not stronger, but wiser. Always on the edge of using too much violence or not knowing why he still wants to fight for justice. Batman has doubts, that what makes this -always excellent- Frank Miller book fascinating. A must read for graphic novel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it wrong for me to worship Frank Miller as a deity?","review":"Once Upon a time, in an attempt to relive my childhood ( My first comic ever was \\"Elektra Lives Again\\", I was seven!), I got, 'Elektra Lives Again', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'The Dark Knight Returns', all by Frank Miller..In two weeks, I was busy trying to convince my parents to move to a different state so that I didn't have to give 'The Dark Knight Returns' to the library. Its really that good. Dear Publisher, your magesties,PLEASE PRINT THIS BOOK AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"With the exception the ending, which I wont ruin for anyone, everything about this is mesmerizing.

Classic and groundbreaking graphic novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This item was a gift that was met with great excitement. The recipient loved the book the minute they saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not the only one","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't like this story. I read the numerous 5 starred reviews at the beginning and began doubting myself, but then I perused the 2 stars and under section and felt a lot better.First off, I LIKE Batman comics, I really do. The only reason I'm not hardcore is because I'm a grad student, and let's face it, I simply just don't have the time (or money). I likedBatman: Year One, and I likedBatman: Hush, Vol. 1, along withBatman: The Man Who LaughsandSuperman/Batman Vol. 1: Public Enemies, plus many more. I'm not a newbie to this world.So when I got TDKR, I figured I'd like it too, right? NOPE. I have the same problem with this comic as I did withBatman: Arkham Asylum (15th Anniversary Edition), only worse. The art is too spastic; the design is too creative; my brain just isn't able to make the leaps in logic that are apparently required to make this all into a storyline that flows in some kind of understandable manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The first 25% of The Dark Knight Returns is great reading and fantastic story telling. It falls flat by the end - but that's Frank Miller's MO: inability to bring a story to a reasonable close. Overrated, like its pretentious author.Nonetheless, this should be read by comic book fans, but it's certainly not a comic to be used to introduce people to the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way cool","review":"It's a grippingly-told, amazingly-illustrated novel. If anyone thinks that Batman comics are just for kids, this is the one that will demolish that thought. It's a book that will make you re-examine beliefs and pose questions ... would you like to have a Batman in your town? In your life? Do the means justify the end? What problems can you solve with violence? And perhaps the most important one ... why can't everyone see that Batman is way cooler than Superman?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"This is nice dark tale of pulp noir and crime. Frank Miller is awesome for making Batman very cold and grim. Miller shows us a new Batman with different styles and personalites. I recommend reading this graphic novel at least once. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not what you are expecting","review":"The art is absolutely horrendous, and it even makes it hard to understand whats happening at times. The story is not as good as people say it is. If you read books or even other comics, i see no reason why you would think this story is anything special. Batman does do some pretty cool and hardcore stuff and that is the only good thing i saw in this book. If you are a fan of unexplained dystopias where (for no explained reason) there are pale people who have spikes that stick out of their skin and nipples and villians named bruno who have exposed butts and boobs with swastickas on them and magical flying baby dolls that spew gas on hundreds of people (killing them) and joker riding on the magic baby's back to freedom, you might like this book. If you like disgusting art that makes every person but batman look deformed and like stories where batman diguises himself as a fat green wart monster, you might like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATNESS","review":"This is without a doubt the graphic novel that redefined comics, and it is almost prophetic the way the government ended up treating Heroes.A MUST READ FOR FANS OF THE GENRE"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel [...]","review":"I'll get right to the point. DK2 is a big let down. I was really looking forward to this, but in the end I was disappointed. I won't give away any spoilers, however, readers should know before they lay down their cash that Batman is hardly even in the book. You barely see him in part one, and he is not in that much of parts 2 and 3 either. Superman, his daughter, The Atom, and Catwoman, are in the story more than Batman. Plus the ending was terrible. This did not give me the epic feeling that \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" gave me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great 10 years ago, but not anymore right now","review":"This is not a cool comic eventhough it has a great story. The art's color look dull and not colorful. Frank put too much thoughts in this story and it causes confusion. Dont believe in other rewiews because not everybody is having the same opinion. if u get use to new comic with nice colorful art, dont go for this comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"only one","review":"There is only one true Batman and everything else is a lack of creativity. Go back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Batman novel from cover to cover","review":"This is Frank Miller at his best. The story is great and the art is gritty and explosive. Besides including a host of characters you're sure to recognize all in the same volume, the novel is a new take on the Dark Knight and sheds some light on his past and motivations, something usually lost in the more crackerjack comics (sorry Adam West). Miller later returned to make a few more Batman books but read this one first and it will probably be your favorite by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"one of those comics (aka. graphic novel) where structure and content of the story flow over right into the artwork, with the resurrected batman who \\"feels like being 24 again\\" drawn in clear lines and colours, just like in the old comics, that finally get seemingly clumsier and uglier the more the story of shizophrenia, paranoia,rage and brutality unfolds.Wierdly, this one is timeless despite some very very timely references within the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best graphic novel ever!","review":"Fantastic! The term graphic novel was coined for books like this. Great characters, great plot, great art! Do yourself a favor and buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read by a fantastic author","review":"Batman is my favorite superhero, and this book gives a new, yet familiar, spin on the dark knight with old faces (literally) abound. A futuristic Gotham, though still pretty much the same, needs Batman more than ever, and Frank Miller devises a great plot pitting Batman against many villains, new and old, with a great way of connecting the dots between each battle and leaving no questions unanswered. The movie does this comic no justice, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a big Batman fan looking to add their collection or to anyone who wants something new to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only true to life chronicle of batmans future","review":"Through a mix of brilliant art work, story line, and dialogue, this Dark Knight title is the most definitive Batman book ever written about batmans life after he has returned from a 10 year retirement. The Dark Knight doesn't get any darker than this...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a surprise!","review":"I have never been a big fan of Batman, even the T.V. series was very hokey. However, after seeing \\"Batman Begins\\" on the big screen and enjoying it immensely, I picked up this Graphic Novel. To my sheer delight, it was awesome, what an incrediblewriter and artist, the images are indescribable, a must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top yet subtle","review":"Their are points in this book that are over the top, like all good superheroe comics. There is also subtle satire. Some parts seem like opera. I could here Wagner's Ride of the Valkries when Batman attacked the Mutants in a tank. Yet, you have many moments that are very quiet. Plus- it proves once and for all that Batman is better than Superman."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont but","review":"this book sucks. I am too lazy to write a full review as to why and how exactly is sucks, but please trust me. spend your time and money on another graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"so poorly illustrated it's often un-readable","review":"I gave up after about 20 pages of not being able to tell what was going on because of how terribly sloppy the drawings are.it's not worth the time or the $.[edit]I realize that this is a landmark event in the Batman saga but I just can't get into a story that is so poorly drawn. Even if the design and layout was ground breaking for graphic novels - the drawing and confusing blur and swirl of jumbled images works against the telling of the story on every page.If this were redrawn today by a better comic author (I've never liked anything by F.Miller), I'd probably give it a read. Otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he really return? Didn't seem like him to me.","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is one of the only graphic novels that I have deliberately traded back to the store for credit. I did not recognize the Batman character at all in this portrayal of his \\"future self\\". The whole novel was about Batman using huge weaponry and little of his cunning to subdue whole armies of evil-doers without any of his original motivations of his parents death. I read it to the end, waiting for a plot twist, or a sudden redemption of the story line, but it simply didn't happen. If you want good Batman, read No Man's Land, Bruce Wayne: Murderer, or Batman: Hush. Now THAT was good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissapointment!","review":"After hearing the great word of mouth, this novel has generated, I was really excited about purchasing this book and reading it.

I bought THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS after hearing and reading so much about it. I was severely dissapointed. This is full of tired cliches of 'the gritty and dark hero'. I nearly puked reading this book. One of the most overrated comic books ever written by man or beast. Plot? SUCKS. Characters? SUCKS. Writing? SUCKS. Art? SUCKS.

I enjoyed it, but it didn't set off any sparks. When I read it again a few days ago after some years gone by, then I finally realized what exactly I had in my hands. TDKR is a classic, and Frank Miller, et al, have created an epic for the ages. It features everything that is great about Batman and his world, and takes it up a notch or two. Now, TDKR is not for everybody, and I understand and respect that. I was one of those people, until I decided to give it a second chance. Now, I'm glad I did.Check this graphic novel out.

It all comes together in a very exciting way. Also, is absolutely stunning to look at and examine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller's Finest","review":"A tiny bit better than Batman: Year One, this has to be the best Batman i've ever read. Grim, violent, and hard-hitting, this graphic novel shows that there is no peace in the future of the Batman. A new Robin awaits, along with a new foe in the form of the Mutants, a menacing street gang that threaten to take over Gotham. There are several famous scenes in this excellent series, such as the classic brawl between Batman and Superman, the fairground chase, and the defeat of the Mutant Leader.One tiny little problem with this brilliant work is that Batman is too violent. Almost too villian-ish. Miller depicts him as some kind of prophet to the religion of crime fighting, which makes him seem too gritty.Unfortunately, this outstanding comic was followed by the terrible Dark Knight Strikes Again, which was basically an attempted remake of the style of DKR.SO GET DOWN TO YOUR COMIC STORE."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book","review":"I see it's been said here already, but this is the best Batman book ever, and argueably the best graphic novel of all time.

The hijinks these little pigs get into are adorable and hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I wish I could see in \\"Pinky and Stinky\\" what other reviewers appear to, but I can't.Given that the book seems aimed at young elementary school children, it is particularly regrettable that both pigs and humans frequently name-call, referring to one another as \\"idiot\\" and \\"stupid\\". The characters don't really have any character, the humor is clumsy, and the plot makeshift at best.Also, there are misspellings (of the words shameful, murmur, and laser)which will mislead kids and make adults wonder why this book wasn't more carefully edited.High quality graphic novels can really reach young readers and offer both terrific stories and artwork. \\"Pinky and Stinky\\" disappointed on all fronts, and I'm sending my copy back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book. Had me laughing throughout","review":"I don't recall laughing so hard when reading a romance novel before! It was refreshing. Gideon(the hero) is quite a wit and his sense of repartee had me in stitches more than once. Although the story line is no different than any other romance novel, and most of the characters were predictable as in most romance novels, Gideon, his aunt Gussie and Uncle Oswald were so unpredictable that it made the whole story interesting.I guess it all depends what you like in a romance novel. Personally, enjoy a story line that has me laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This book has it all -- plucky heroine, divine hero, evil relative, mistaken identity, and excellent plotting. The tension between the protagonists is excellent, and the writing is both witty and engrossing. The banter between Miss Merridew and Lord Carradice is a joy to read. And the ugly duckling theme is likewise satisfying. After I finished this, I immediately ordered the rest of the series.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"most unikeable characters ever...","review":"I wish I could give this book no stars.

In Regency England, Edwardian England, Victorian England, ....women were chattel, owned by their family. The idea that a total stranger would suddenly sweep four females away from their legal guardian is hard to swallow. Women in pre-Suffarage England could be killed by the men in their lives, have their children stolen away....be thrown in the street. Being beaten by a male in the family was nothing to Polite Society.To be fair, the book did improve significantly toward the middle, and end. Not enough, however, to overcome the fantastical beginning.I found myself far more interested in the quiet Duke, than in the hero of this book. The romance between the quiet, reclusive Duke, and the \\"loveliest\\" of Prudence's sisters was expected. But, come on........instant? One look, and the Duke was hooked.I finished the book, and promptly pitched it in File 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly duckly story with no happy ending!","review":"I wanted to like this book but found that finishing it was a chore. The herione let everyone stomp on her just because she wasn't a \\"diamond of the first water\\" like her three sisters. The author found little to recommend to her anyone let alone this \\"notorious rake\\". Of the hundreds of books I have read in the genre, what make the story line of the \\"ugly duckling\\" appealing is the discovery that other attributes make them beautiful and eventually they find their own self love and acceptance and stand up for themselves. This did not happen in this story. Even at the end she contiunues to accept physical abuse with a resignation that everyone is correct in her being ugly and worthless. Her own sisters are vain selfish twits who never thank her properly for all her sacrifices.

While it has aspects of both, it's more like a series of case studies, in which almost 100 designers, magazines, posters, advertisements, icons, types... are analyzed and discussed and placed in a historical context.So if you're expecting a comprehensive book on design history, this is not for you. In no way does it feel complete for a design education. What it does is provide thoughtful pieces to consider, and a perspective on the usage of design, originality, trends, etc. The authors do have a point of view, but it doesn't ruin the book. To the contrary, it makes it even more interesting. Design isn't just art and technique It's grounded in economics, history, culture, and politics.

A gifted pianist with legendary attractiveness, her talents were short-changed with this effort. It was a childhood favorite of mine, but maturity makes me see the rediculous special effects, plot holes, and bad acting. A giant paper mache hand is all it takes to make the nurse scream in pure terror. Our giant in one scene appears to be door top level tall when she walks toward the tavern. And so, thin as the plot is, why does the sheriff and the butler need to follow giant footprints alone out into the desert to see the alien giant?

Allison Hayes is perfect for the towering Nancy Archer on the rampage in search for her cheating husband, Harry. But the actual 'attack' is only at the last 15 minutes of the film and Hayes barely scratched the actual city and just scares people off. As many people have heard, the special effects are an absolute joke, what with the huge rubber hands and when Hayes, with all her strength, picks up...er...a cotton woll doll (which was meant to be Harry).

(Maybe 90% on her, not 100%)The only downside for Dixie has been weight gain, but I'm willing to adjust her exercise to keep giving her this supplement.The results were so amazing that we decided to try it for our Shepherd-mix Smitty, but for some reason, even after 6 weeks, he still sheds. (We know it's mostly him, because of the color of the fur we have to swiff away now.)In any case, 50% less fur on the floors means we have to clean half as much, which is still pretty great.Maybe this just works best for double-coated dogs like Schipperkes, rather than the single-coated breeds like Shepherds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tests & More Tests...","review":"I started studying for the LSAT using Princeton Review's \\"Cracking the LSAT\\" which only contains two full length tests.

Whatever be the merits of the novel this is a terrible film. It is badly acted, with characters who sound wooden, unconvincing, and shrill. The movie goes out of its way to offer a portrayal of the Shoah that in its stridency ends up actually being graceless, the Nazis as \\"plain stereotypical evil\\". It does not make for interesting watching but apart from that those who are portrayed, those who died, deserve a more probing, thoughtful and serious effort. Overall an appalling film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, poor acting","review":"I heard a lot of god things about the movie and recently bought it on Amazon.com.

Both leads are excellent particularly in the final confrontation scene which makes up for a somewhat meandering mid section with too much exposition. I give this film 4 stars because although Ronald Neame does a serviceable job of directing, one wonders how a director like Fred Zinnemann (Day Of the Jackal) or Hitchcock would've done to this material. Nevertheless, still worth watching for the performances of Voight and Schell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-War Nazi Espionage Thriller.","review":"Viewed: 12/12Rate: 712/12: The Odessa File is a thrilling but weak post-war Nazi espionage thriller. I just have a hard time believing that a news reporter can defeat a trained soldier like how Peter Miller was able to in the printing press building. And then, why would the mother would so easily spill the secrets like that to some stranger she hardly knows? It makes a logical sense for the ODESSA group to have Peter Miller killed very early in the film. However, it is a well-directed picture with Ronald Neame carefully orchestrating the moments of terror in the right places. Jon Voight is excellent as usual and is the biggest reason why I went for the film. Of course, the twist in the end is surprising and clearly explains the motives. All in all, The Odessa File is worth watching no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller","review":"This is excellent and I enjoyed it very much.

Sampson and Gregory are servants to Montague, not Capulet, and Abraham has apparently switched teams as well. Gregory says that one of his kinsmen is coming, and then Benvolio enters.

Plus, it has no calories, caffeine, and sodium. It also has a very clean crisp taste to it. They aren't too sweet and don't leave a nasty after taste. This particular flavor is really tasty, and one of my favorites. I'm always talking to my brother who's on diet that he should try them.

The corded unit looks so good it's practically a work of art and it's backlit LCD screen is by far the most clear/legible that I've ever seen. All of the buttons on both the cordless and base units are very responsive (no sticking or hard pressing) and the general feel of each phone is very solid. The cordless unit works pretty much flawlessly, but I do have to admit that the reception is not quite as clear as the corded base unit (very few corless phones are). It's still very clear and nothing even noticeable when you're using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great in theory, but...","review":"I have this phone, in fact, I liked the idea and look of it so much, I hoped the problems I was having were just specific to the phone I bought - meaning hopefully it was a lemon.Unfortunately, I bought another one and replaced it and still have a problem with it. Periodically the phone cuts in and out so it sounds like you are on a cell and going through a bad cell site...This is on the corded phone, not the extension.Everything else with the phone is fine, you have all the features you could want, but this little problem is enough of a nuisance to really bring down the rating.If you buy it, I hope you don't have the same problem. For me, I lived with it for about a month, then it started getting worse. That's when I returned the first phone and got the replacement...it's started with this one, but I can't find a corded phone w/an extension for anywhere near the same price, and the only other one I've found is another AT&T.Hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea bad product","review":"I bought this product thinking I would still have phone service during winter power outages. The corded phone works great. However the cordless phone didn't work. I took it back and got a replacement. The cordless phone worked for a while, but after a couple months, stopped recharging. AT&T customer service is impossible to get in touch with, and I've given up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone needs replacement - I don't recommend it.","review":"I bought this phone (Feb. 05) after a lot of research, and was mostly pleased with it initially. The cordless has poor range and poor sound quality if I go more than two rooms away, but that's all I need it for. After a little more than a year the LCD started loosing lines and now I have to guess what the callerID # is. It also (whenever it feels like it) has a very loud buzzing sound in the handset that the person on the other end can also hear. Tried replacing the curly cord but that didn't help. The speaker phone does not buzz, nor does a different phone on the same line.Bottom line, it's a decent phone with nice features, but I can't afford to buy new phones every year. Another pet peeve: AT&T; only licenses their sticker on the outside of the phone - it's not made by them. Used to be AT&T; stood for high quality phones - now they stand for a nice looking sticker that can be had for a price. Too bad for them they've ruined their reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Stinks","review":"Well I read the reviews & most seemed good but I ordered this phone from Amazon for my mom for Christmas & it came all boxed up but when she set it all up it doesn't work.

She spent an hour on the phone w/AT & T trying to get it to work then they said its broke (hmmmm no kidding) and to send it back to them. Disappointed in amazon as well cuz now we have to pay shipping to send to AT & T???? And its gonna take another 3 weeks to get it back.

The corded phone was excellant. The cordless phone was worthless. The cordless phone had constant static. After following the trouble shooting instructions, visiting the AT&T website and calling customer service I decided to return the phone based on AT&T's recommendation. AT&T's customer service person was hard to get to via the voice mail web. Once in contact with the service employee things went quickly. Amazon's return procedure was painless and prompt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features and price, but poor sound quality","review":"The unit appears to be made well and offers good features. The price is excellent for a corded/cordless phone with an answering machine. However, the sound quality is lacking.There is noticeable background noise on the corded handset when the volume is above level two (out of four). Moving the phone to another jack where another corded phone was previously plugged in (without background noise) did not help. I bought this phone because I did not want the background noise of a cordless phone on my main phone. The noise is not awful, just annoying and surprising for a corded phone.The cordless phone sounds fuzzy both at the phone and to the person on the other end as well. Switching channels did not help. The phone was much clearer when within 5 feet of the base set, but obviously, that defeats the purpose of having a corded phone.Although there are few alternatives in this type of phone available, I would pass on this one and keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working the 3rd Day","review":"What a shame. I had such high hopes for this system as it was inexpensive compared to others (you get what you pay for). Ordered from Amazon.com and received promptly, but on the 3rd day both the base and handset unit stopped working!If trying to make calls, it would not connect from either units. When callers called me, I could hear the ring, but not the caller! Yuck. Next time I'll pay more attention to reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"No legal overview or summary - Just cases","review":"My professor was great, but I'm disappointed in his choice of text. This author seemingly downloaded some popular property cases, threw them in a book, added a couple of cartoons, and then sold it as original authorship. The price tag of $100+ was a nice touch for something that probably took a couple of office clerks 2-3 weeks to hammer out.I'm sincerely confused why this book is even contributed to an \\"author.\\" What I ask, did this person write? Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree.","review":"I agree with the reviewer below (or is it above?). I'm almost done with this semester and this has been and will be my toughest course, not because of the material, but because of the way the material is delivered in the casebook. I started with the 1999 edition and was shocked to find that it didnt include a table of cases. A casebook w/o table of cases??? come on! The 2005 edition fixed this problem, but many remain. The problems were clearly listed in the other review, and I concur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing attempt at a case book","review":"Professor Bernhardt's book is little more than a compilation of cases. There is very little editing and no clarifying information. The comments in between the cases are mostly statutes and some excerpts of other cases- there is very little commentary or even hypotheticals. He includes lots of clever little cartoons, but they are a poor substitute for actual content. The book is basically a cut-and-paste job, and a poor one at that- there are a plethora of typos and grammatical errors.There is a supplement to the book that is just as bad, with the added confusion of a different labeling format for the cases in it.I would strongly reccomend that this professor hire some undergrads to proofread this book, but only after he has gone back and actually added some value to the book in terms of commentary and guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"extream view","review":"collect new yoshi's: to collect new yoshi's you need to find a black egg or an wihte egg.to make shy guys turn into a fruit first you need the [heartfruit]then do a ground pound on the floor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase before it is too late!","review":"Michel Sardou is France's most known and popular singer/writer. On this live album he performs at his best. Certainly listen to song 4 on disc 1. It's a new version of Parlons De Toi De Moi. In the middle of the song there is an instrumental part with violins and electric guitars playing together in a way you never heard before. It's a song about a married couple that makes up a review of 10 years marriage. It holds on or it breaks the songs says. The song gets a special meaning if you know that Sardou is divorcing after 22 years of marriage with Babette."},{"rating":"1","title":"No warranty information","review":"So I am looking for this very part come across this item and consider it because my doorman replacement has gone out within a year... it works just locks up when the window is left down and the car is turned off weird.

I have known these songs (Island in the Sun, Yellow Bird, Maryann) since childhood and was really looking forward to listening to this CD.

I emailed twice and never received any response."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that lives up to expectations","review":"In this book David Pye accurately and concisely differentiates between hand craftsmanship and modern machine done work. He writes his philosophical yet practical, personal ideas on craftsmanship. It is a great discussion for anyone interested in fine workmanship. It attempts to answer questions (or at least provide an entry point into discussion) of why hand workmanship is important, why it appeals to us, and want makes it fundamentally different from machine build crafts. It does not focus on any specific craft (thought Professor Pye is a woodworker himself), but is meaningful and accessable to anyone interested in crafts and hand workmanship. This is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid, practical, a classic","review":"I love this book. Pye, in concise and often beautiful language, defines the idea of workmanship as he sees it -- its history, its implications, how it might develop. He gives interesting commentary on the Arts & Crafts movement vis-a-vis Ruskin and Morris as well.Pye really is a master of the old school, and I would encourage anyone to buy this book for both its own ideas and for a look at a wonderful mind. A great companion to Krenov."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book should be read by all designers.

It merely means that his education in his trade has been bad.\\"What an amazing nugget of wisdom from a man who browbeats the greater population for our consumption of mass-manufactured objects. No, David, assemblers who aren't emotionally or pridefully connected to the object are just deficient people, worthy of the utmost contempt.

I love this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Fisher and a Mexico good time movie","review":"This is a very light weight romantic comedy with wonderful scenery of Mexico, a light weight comic plot and pleasant leads. Both are adept and keep the movie floating along nicely. What works best of all is the wonderful Carrie Fisher as the bride's mother from hell. She is hysterically funny and steals every scene she is in; which is saying a lot given the physical perfection of the leads! You are not going to think much during this movie, but it will give you a pleasant 90 minutes in a great climate with some fun people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute & corky","review":"A good choice for a romantic comedy.

Postal Exams","review":"This is a great book if you are trying to get your foot in the door. However, I am currently a Postal employee and bought the book because the title claims to show you how to score 90-100% on postal exams. Wrong! It willl give you sample questions from most of the tests, but, any technical skills that you will need for higher paying skilled jobs will be up to you to teach yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was a great reference for taking the postal service exam. I know I wouldn't have been as confident about taking the exam without having the practice this book provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"I have 2 warnings about this book before I go into any sort of review: 1 it's a short story, 100 pages long, and big type. 2 it's no intelectual piece of literature, you've not going to have a better understanding about humanity from reading this book. If those 2 things bother you, dont touch this book.But if they dont, I would highly recommend this story. The tale is simple: The world is going to end, in about 8 hours, and the narrator wants to be with his ex-girlfriend when the crap hits the fan. His story rolls around a couple twists and turns obviously put in to stretch it all out (the bus and the lions are a particually stupid set of events), as well as some good old fashioned social commentary that hits home hard. Shapiro is even clever enough to make you question his whole spiel right down to the end. All in all a good read that is easily blown through in a day. You wont regret reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank god reading this was only temporary as well","review":"This book was really god awful, i normally don't rate a book this low unless it is totally devoid of any value. This book jumps all over the place without a coherant thought or premise. The only thing we as readers know for sure is the world is going to be smashed by a comet, thats all. This guy runs around half in fantasy and half in reality and the author just bounces the reader off so many walls you really can't get a take on things. If the book was 1,000 pages then the author might have the room for this kind of character development, but in a novella or a short book there's no time. I read this disaster with anticipation that it was going to get really good on the next page, well i ran out of pages and this book should never have been printed. I think that with some more work this story could be fleshed out and made more coherant but right now don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Ending","review":"The main character is around 23 year old when told the world ending is near as a meteor will hit it. Instead of dying with his young siblings and parents, he leaves them (breaking his parents' hearts) to be with an old girlfriend he broke up with because she was unfaithful. His plan is to be in bed with her when the meteor hits. Along the way to her house, he sees society falling apart. This young man stops to see all the sights instead of being with his family and barely makes it even to see this woman and her family before the world ends. The book ends with everyone still waiting to for the meteor to hit.This book is a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madacy Does It Again!","review":"As a classical music enthusiast, it's often thrilling and frustrating to find discs that exceed or barely register your expectations. Madacy has issued a brilliantly recorded disc of Haydn's work and every note is crystal clear (and, hey, it's at a great price as well). The only drawback to this album is that it does not contain the wonderful \\"Toy Symphony\\", however, that is more than made up for by the other selections and the clarity in which they are heard. If you're looking for a substantial collection at a great price for Haydn's work, this is the disc. Order it, it's well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it'll look nice and goth on your shelf","review":"Focuses mainly on bodysnatching in Scotland, with excursions to England and to the even-more-unsavory practice of Burking (killing people in order to sell their bodies as anatomical specimens, from the notorious Burke and Hare case). Interesting topic, but I can't recommend the book because of an abysmal lack of footnoting, overall disorganization, and persistent refusal to translate quotes in antiquated Scots into readable English. Has some nice pictures of mortsafes, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile: Read with care","review":"Take this collection slowly. The vivid, surreal images imprint themselves on the unwary mind.

It has all the quick-reflex fun and quirky personality of the old Nintendo classic, updated with fantastic hand-drawn animation and light RPG elements that extend the gameplay. The character design is wonderful, the writing is funny, the gameplay is perfect. Even the music is good. At 19.99, this is the bargain of the year. I can't over-emphasize how great this game looks. You've never seen anything like it on a handheld console screen.By the way, this is the first video game I've ever ordered from Amazon. I ordered it because a certain enormous Video Game store chain (same initials as Eloping Baboons) has decided not to carry it. That company's buyer is, apparently, an idiot. Thank you, Amazon, for making such a great game available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Lot of Fun","review":"I found this game easy to use and very challenging.

I just didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favour, just play Punch-Out instead","review":"Most definitely NOT in the same league as Punch-Out. It's pretty, granted, but the bland, unnecessarily slow-paced gameplay, which relies less on actual strategy and more on ridiculous amounts of endurance, more than counteracts any good the graphics might have done.Also, \\"dumb hick\\" humour has been done to death. This game isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is. A few of the characters have admittedly amusing designs, but without clever writing to back it up, they fail to make any sort of real impact.Clearly, this game is made by people who liked Punch-Out, yet somehow they've missed out on the elements that actually made that game, y'know, fun. This wouldn't be horrible as a free fan Flash game. As something you're actually expected to pay money for, though....no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY ...A GAME AS GOOD AS THE CLASSIC","review":"i was waiting forever for the release of this game....and finally i have to say once i got my hands on it, it was well worth the wait. pure simple punch-out style fighting mixed with a hilarious story and unbelievable abimation. i definiftly recommend this game for die-hard 80's punch out fans. my son also loves playing, so i would recommend it for kids too.... does anyone know who the maker of the game is? i'd like to find out when they're going to make a sequal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun","review":"I like books full of nostalgia and simpler ideas. Like the other reviewers I found it a good walk through memory lane. We never had a clothesline since we grew up in the city, but I remember seeing them on movies and the like. Its definitly a piece of Americana. I picked this up mainly because of the stress of the current war on terrorism, I needed something simple and nice. This made me feel some more trust and confidence in our values and the core of what is America. I really needed a break from all the crud books coming out on politics from former hippies trying to make a buck (sorry Mr. Bob Woodward). I like knowing that at our heart America is the home of the free, brave, and simple folks doing normal things. Thanks for an easy, stress free, good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Really wonderful. I love from the heart writing. There truly is something about the way the books feel.

Endless fun to share with your son or daughter, and the pictures jump from the page. Looking forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this cd","review":"This is by far the best album I own. If you get a chance to buy it, definitely do so.

The bottom is also convex, so it doesn't sit snug to the bottom.What does all of this have to do with anything?The water will obviously take the path of least resistance- instead of going through the grounds, it just goes around the sides and out the bottom without spending much time filtering through the grounds. The result is some very weak coffee.For the $7 or so I paid for it, I could have bought about 500 paper filters that would last me nearly two years.

In general, I'm a fan of permanent filters. I thought I would save paper and at the same time get more of the coffee oils with a metal filter (ie better flavor), and I've had success with other such filters in the past, but this filter was a huge disappointment. I have to agree with other reviewers that the coffee that comes through this filter is exceptionally weak. I don't know if it's the mesh on the bottom or what, but with the same amount of coffee and the same grind, I get a decently robust cup with paper filters but bland brownish water with this one.

Unfortunately, I didn't know anything about these kind of filters and I'm disappointed.I assumed, incorrectly, that the permanent filter would do a better job of filtering the coffee. Instead, it allows a lot of sediment through and the coffee has a large amount in the bottom of the cup. Yuk.Now I'm using this inserted in the middle of a paper filter.

This item weighs 3 ounces (company website is honest at least).Isn't that illegal, to charge shipping costs based on fake weights? I know handling costs something, but that is in a different tax category - shipping \\"reimbursement\\" goes right into the seller's pocket as hidden profit. It probably costs 80 cents parcel post to send this item. They want to charge 10 times that amount when it is already marked up 175 percent!What gives?

Great product nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LOVE I LOST WAS A SWEET LOVE","review":"IF YOU WANNA HEAR SOME PHILLY DISCO SOUL FROM THE 70'S, MOSTLY WRITTEN BY GAMBLE AND H.UFF, THEN THIS IS THE CD F9OR YOUTHIS IS A GREAT CD OF 1970'S SOUL, FEATURING ALL; THE GREAT PHILLY SOUL ARTISTS\\": THE OJAY'S, BILLY PAUL, THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA, ETC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charm; unimpressive chain","review":"My husband bought this for me as an anniversary present.

I don't buy the hype that it increases your baby's IQ but she really does love it. We got it when she was one month old and within a few weeks she was tracking the objects -- it bought us about 10 minutes first thing in the morning -- long enough to shower -- when nothing else (even the swing) kept her occupied. Now at 7 months it's still cheers her up (even sick!) she smiles and kicks and wiggles under it (Daddy calls it baby arobics).I do agree with the review I read that it's for stimulation --not putting to sleep! My only regret is that it doesn't have a quieter setting -- babies have very good hearing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"to much trouble","review":"i was so excited to get this product. the minute i got it home my husband and i put it together to find out that it didnt work. we took it back to the store and they told us it had been recalled for defective parts and we would have to send away for a kit to fix it ourselves. as if i dont have enough to do already. there are other perfectly good mobiles on the market that i dont have to fix myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this thing??","review":"Such a neat idea. Such a poor implementation.The motor is phenomenally noisy. Just this whirring buzz that's nearly as loud as the music. And the annoying clacking of the little pieces falling (they're supposed to do that) has me scratching my head wondering what in the world these people were thinking?? Why can't they make something with this great music, a noiseless motor, and none of the clacking things?Oh, and I guess we haven't had the thing long enough to experience the mechanical failures everyone else seems to talk about. Looking forward to it. *groan*"},{"rating":"2","title":"You MUST own this mobile!!","review":"When my son was about 6 weeks old we bought this for him. He loved looking at it and he would watch it with his little legs kicking away. This was such a help for me, it was the only way that I could do anything when he was born. I would place my son in his crib and play the mobile and voila I had a few minutes to do the dishes or pick up my home or wash up. I loved this mobile so much (as did my son) that I bought it for 3 friends that were having babies as well. Also the music was excellent and had a rich tone. There was also a high or low feature which helped control the volume a bit. I spent 40.00 for this and I would have spent 100 if I had to. We used this several times a day until he was 6 mos old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mobile But Doesn't Last Long","review":"I bought this mobile when my 3 1/2-year-old was a baby. He absolutely loved it but it broke rather quickly. I bought another one right before my infant daughter was born. She also loved it but this one died rather quickly too.

I was able to use it for about a month then all of a sudden it stopped rotating. I was never able to fix it and the instructions were in French so that did not help.

Other reviewers have noted the same problem. I was very disappointed because our son was fascinated with it from the time he was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mobile!","review":"This mobile is GREAT. Our son loves the bright colors and the small pieces that slide and make a little noise help keep his attention. He will lie for the entire time it runs and coo at it.

We haven't gone thru a ton of batteries either, which is nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same thing","review":"it worked great for the first week we've had it. now, however the motor broke. the music plays but the damn thing does not rotate. my seven week old baby is not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud, Too Flimsy","review":"It is a pretty mobile with lots of interesting things to look at for your baby, but after using it for last six months, I cannot recommend it.First, this mobile is LOUD. The motor is not too bad, but the turning mechanism is VERY loud with very annoying clicking sound. It also has small plastic parts that slide up and down as the mobile turns and it also makes a terrific racket. If you are looking for a mobile to entertain your baby, this is it. If you looking for this mobile to soothe your baby - you need to get something else.Second, it broke within 5 months. The arm part that connects the mobile to the base comes apart. Sometimes when you put it together, the connection does not get set and the mobile does not turn. We fudged with this thing for several months before it finally died on us - so no more turning. Very shoddy quality for something this expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Our son loves this mobile.","review":"We bought this mobile after seeing it in the store, and we're very happy with it. We bought it when our son was about 3 weeks old, and he immediately loved it. He's now 5 weeks old, and likes to lay in his crib and make noise at it. It's very stimulating for him, even if you play the Bach, which is recommended for calming them, so that's something to be aware of. (There's no way he would fall asleep watching it - as he watches it, he gets more excited.)We haven't had any issues with the motor or any noise concerns, and are perfectly happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it !","review":"Little Alicia (3 month old) simply loves it.

It is poorly made and is falling apart after only a few weeks of use.The falling rings make an annoying clacking noise and The mobile does not fit on all cribs. We had to replace this mobile with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but both of mine broke","review":"I bought both types of the Symphony in Motion mobiles -- one for my son's crib at home, and the other for his crib at daycare. He absolutely loved both of them and would get so excited when I turned them on. However, both of them broke after only a few months of use. The on/off button is not making the right connection with the inside parts to turn it on. When I push the button, nothing happens. When it happened on the first one, I thought maybe it was a fluke. But when I had the same problem with the other one, I realized it might not be well made. I am really upset, too, because my son really loved both of them. Now he gets aggravated when he looks up at the mobile and it doesn't move."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best purchase we made for our daughter!!!","review":"We purchased this mobile after the other mobile we had could not keep her attention. As soon as we put it in her crib she was mesmerized. The music and all the moving parts get her so excited. She kicks her feet to it and smiles.Although it is a bit more pricey than other mobiles out there, I would recommend spending the money, it is wonderful. I put her in her crib every morning to watch it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"manufacture defect","review":"We have received this item, Symphony-in-motion mobile Geometric shapes from our friend before our baby was born. We loved it at first. Both classical music that plays for 15 minutes and those moving shapes with colors that would stimulate the vision and hearing of the babies. It worked for few times and it stopped moving. The music still plays with no problem, but the movement stopped. We first thought it was the battery problem, but it still didn't work after the new batteries had put in. I sent e-mail to the \\"Tiny love\\" to ask possible manufacture defect or any suggestion, but they never replied back to me. I was very excited about the product at first, but now, I am very dissapointed that it was broken too soon (only after third time). I want to tell people not to get this product because I don't want them to have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"We thought this would be great. It is if you really want to stimulate your child. However, if you want to soothe your child into peaceful dreamland--forget this mobile. Your child will not fall asleep with this thing going. As it goes around the pieces move and hit together making a clacking sound. My daughter didn't like it very much. I think the old fashioned ones that play music are the best bet. My daughter's Grandma had one and it lulled her to sleep everytime. This thing is more for playtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor stopped working and BIG","review":"This mobile is huge, it fell down all the time, and broke on us 1 week after owning.

The first one we bought broke, but Amazon was great about sending a replacement fast. (That's why I only gave it 4 stars.) My son just sits under there and watches it all in great fascination for up to 30 minutes. Ahhhh...so in the morning, I turn that on when he wakes up and go back to sleep for 30 more minutes. Gotta love that and gotta have this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!!","review":"My 5 week old son really enjoyed this mobile for the few hours he watched it, then it stopped working. As others had mentioned, the motor stopped working and the mobile no longer spins. The music works fine. I was skeptical of others reviews that said theirs broke, so I went ahead and got it. I could not believe it when mine stopped working TOO!!!! It's hard to believe that something that costs [$] only worked for about 3 total hours. Don't waste your money!!!!!...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it broke","review":"This was a great toy, until the motor died 5 weeks after I opened the box. Unfortunately, my daughter loves it so much, I may buy a replacement one, all the same. If you can stay away from this unit upfront, do so. I am going to try and get the manufacturer to replace the unit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"My son is only 2 months old and he is absolutely fascinated when I put him in his crib and turn this mobile on. Right now he is not even sleeping in his crib so I only put him in there to watch the mobile. I can put him in there for at least 15-20 minutes before he starts to get impatient -- much better response than I get from his swing or bouncer! He will smile and coo as the mobile moves around and around, and I really love the classical musical options. Great product! Wonderful learning tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Product","review":"The Symphony-In-Motion is one of the best baby gifts we received. Our baby loved the stimulating shapes, and the music. The 15-minute play-time for the music makes so much more sense then the 2 minute wind-up's. Our baby is now 18 months, and though we have not been able to use the mobile for almost a year, we still use the music every night for bedtime. Every child should be lucky enough to have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WON'T BE SORRY","review":"My 2-month old son loves this mobile! He stares, coos and even falls asleep with it. He enjoys it at least a good 30-45 minutes at a time. I previously had a wind-up one which matched his bedroom decor and was very expensive. Don't make the same mistake of matching everything it's not worth it for this item. You will just end up winding the thing every few minutes and getting aggrivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all just love this one!","review":"My little one has loved this one since the first day we put it in. She was 8 weeks premature and so we didn't install it until she was almost 2 months old.She loved it from day 1! She looked at it sideways for a day or two. I think it was a bit much for her at first.She will watch it for at least 15 minutes and allows me to do stuff in the bedroom with her happy.At night we like to use it after her late night feedings. We take off the mobile part (very easy to do) and just have the music going because she can't see it and some of the pieces are designed to slide around and make more noise than we want. (our daughter sleeps in our room) The music puts us all to sleep.I have to agree that she does not drift off to sleep watching the mobile. I think there is just too much going on.She sure loves it, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Purchased this Mobile for my 6 week old and she loves it. Great sounds and excellent visual stimulation. This is an excellent Mobile!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful wonderful wonderfuL!!","review":"I can't tell you how much we love this product! Our daughter is now 4 months and until we got this mobile, she had never been as stimulated! The minute we turn this on, she is mesmerized! Each of the composers stay on for 15 minutes so it stays on long enough for her to fall asleep. It gives me time to shower or do some cleaning because she will lay there and talk to it for an hour or so! I highly recommend this product...I wish we had bought it sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"This product would be great if it actually worked up to par. The spinning is tempermental and the motor is loud when it does turn. I exchanged the first one and the girls at the store said this product is often exchanged and always for the same reason. You are better off getting the mobile to match your nursery and purchasing baby einstein along with a cd player for the nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this because it plays for 15 minutes and my wind up only lasted for about 2 minutes before I had to go wind it up again. I also thought you couldn't go wrong with classical music. I expected that they would have chosen better known songs than what they did; I don't like any of the 3 songs. The mobile circles around on a slant, and they have 3 pieces on each arm that slide up and down as it goes around. They make a scraping noise that my husband and I did not care for at all. It was also not as easy to attach securely to the crib - the top piece (the yellow hook) is flexible and does not stay hooked over the crib as well as other mobiles. The motor is also rather loud. I returned this and bought a different type. My son liked it, but he likes his new one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you MUST invest in!","review":"After reading reviews about this mobile, I wasn't convinced that this was the best mobile to buy for my daughter. However, I bought it anyway to give it a try. Boy, am I glad I did. The day we brought her home from the hospital, we played it while we were changing her diaper (as she was crying). She immediately stopped and listened and has loved it ever since. Granted, the noise can be a bit loud from all the rings sliding (on top of the motor noise), but it's worth it. In fact she doesn't seemed bothered by it, as she's fallen asleep numerous times with it playing. I think it bothers parents more than the baby! She's now 3 months old, I can put her in her crib, play the mobile, and she's content! She loves watching it time and time again. (You'd think she'd be bored!) Definately invest the extra money and buy this moblile....your child will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My triplets like it!","review":"This is a great mobile! Not like your traditional ones at all!Pro:Great colors, shapes and patterns can mezmorize babies. Soft classical music sounds like lullabyes. Rotates. Baby can hit or kick button to go on. Mobile can be pulled off and music box can stay on for playful music.Con:Very large and hangs very low. Must be careful for when baby is old enough to grab at it. Can slide to the side on occasion due to weight or baby pulling on it.Recommended if you can afford the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice","review":"This is a nice mobile because of the bright colors and the classical music plays for quite a while. I have the one with the remote control and you can use the remote from outside the room. I do not like that the music is not a piano like it was composed. It is like keyboard music with some high pitches that are disturbing. Also, the mobile has some little pieces that are meant to move around but when they do, they make a falling noise which startles my little one. I do like that you can take the mobile off and just leave the music box though. I plan to put the mobile part in the car for future entertainment after 5 months which is when it is recommended to take it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but doesn't work so great","review":"Wonderful design - very fascinating shapes, but the rotation motor quit after only a few months. We have twins and bought two mobiles, and both quit the same week. Our twins are now six months old - just big enough to really enjoy the motion, and now they only have music. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing, Learning and Housework...","review":"This mobile is FANTASTIC! I purchased it on a whim for my then 2 month old son. As a teacher, I wanted something with some learning substance. My son absolutely loved it from the start. He would coo and laugh, and wave his arms and legs as each shape went by. The mobile stays on for 15 minutes and the music can stay constant or switch between 3 tunes as well. It helped give me time to get housework done while my little one was safely tucked away in his crib enjoying every minute. Well worth the extra money and definitely a great shower gift for any expecting mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke too quickly!","review":"We bought this mobile for my daughter when she was born. My daughter loved it! She was fascinated by it, and the music was very nice.The problem? It broke in less than a month! The music still played, but the mobile no longer spun. We went out and bought another one, since my daughter loved it so much, and it too broke within a week.While we loved the mobile, a child's product that breaks twice in month is not worth the money! We talked to many friends and family members who had the same problem with the mobile. We filed a complaint with the manufacturer and never received a response."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had 3 of these things break in less than 2 months...","review":"Although my son loves this mobile, we have now been through 3 in 2 months. Really, it's been less than that b/c for the first 6 weeks we really didn't use it. This past time I brought it back to BRU, and it worked for 4 days. The mobile will not turn but the music plays. I have tried calling Tiny Love at 1-888-TINYLOVE and always get a message that says \\"Our offices are now closed. Our normal business hours are Mon-Fri 8-5, blah blah blah\\" but this message is ALWAYS on. I have never been able to reach them even when I call during business hours. I am furious at this so called company's complete lack of customer service. I am now going to take it higher at BRU. They should not be carrying a product of such poor quality. PLEASE read all of the reviews below about the product not working before you buy it!!! Notice everyone either gives it a 5 or a 1 b/c it would be a great product if it WORKED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INVALUABLE","review":"We were at a friend's home and when my 8 week old stared at this mobile for 40 (yes, FORTY) minutes, I immediately went and bought one. I can get so much done in 40 minutes!! Even when it turns off and quits moving, he will stare for 20 minutes or so! It does not match my nursery at all, but 40 minutes is worth a million dollars!! My motor is not noisy at all, maybe they have corrected this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great- up to 6 months then it's a little scary.","review":"This was an excellent purchase! My son absolutely loved watching the wonderful shapes move above him. The music is lovely to listen to and mixes wonderful \\"classical-esque\\" music together. The only weird thing is that around the time when my son turned 6 months, the mobile began to scare him. Now that his focus is much improved, I think the eyes on the shapes are a little frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Toy!","review":"This mobile has so many ways to keep our baby's attention. He enjoys when it is on and when it is off. It is one of the only things that interested him for the first few months. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it goes through batteries and you have to take the mobile off the crib to change the batteries so there is room for improvement. I highly recommend it though. We received it as a gift and really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"I bought this item for my grandchild after reading reviews about it. I never placed the mobile directly over the baby's head because I felt aprehensive having something hanging over her head so I placed it midway the crib. The first time the mobile fell I thought maybe I didn't lock it in properly. I moved it to the foot of the crib and after the fifth time I turned it onit fell again. I heard the baby screaming in fright, the mobile had fallen on her. I am in the process of returning it to Toys R Us. The next mobile I buy, will be something made of soft material. I would warn anyone who may be thinking about buying this product to beware!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as you might think.","review":"We registered for this and thought we were lucky to receive it. After putting it together (it is very large) and turning it on for a test run we were very disappointed. The mobile makes noise while turning (clicking) and was very distracting. The mobile also gets stuck and makes a grinding noise until it gets going again. Needless to say - we returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, at first....","review":"This mobile was really cute in the beginning. But within a month, it broke. The music still plays, but as others have mentioned, the motor stopped. No turning! And my son is upset about it, too.

They are cheaply made, though. The bolts holding the seat to the toilet do not stay tight, so expect to have to get down and tighten them regularly. Eventually the mdf cannot handle all of the shifting due to the bolt problem, so it starts disintigrating where the hinges are screwed into the seat. At this point you will need to purchase a new toilet seat (I even tried to use wood glue to keep them in place, but that only worked for a bit).

I thought that the Canon i850 would make a great addition as a photo printer but I was mistaken.First, the Canon i850 is a fast, affordable, bubblejet printer on it's own. I like it for the individual think tanks that minimize trips to the store for the ink. With that said, it is not different from my Canon S750 as a printer other than the speed and some resolution. Unlike the other photo printers by Epson and HP, this Canon \\"photo\\" printer only uses 4 colors and that seems to make a great differnt as I noticed it on my 9 year old nephew's Epson 820 printer. That 80 dollar printer clearly outshines this Canon though it is a ink hog.I wish that Canon would make a printer to rival HP and Epson in quality and the number of pigments used to print photos.

Definately better than the HP Photosmart 100 that I bought last year. Printer technology is improving dramatically. Good ink system, that will hopefully save me some money. With HP, U have to junk the entire cartridge, even if a single color is out. Canon has 4 ink system with visual indicators. so you buy just the one you need.

I managed to wipe some out with my finger the first time, but that didn't last long as now it is doing it again and I can't see anything in there (yes we close the covers on a regular basis), so must be something stuck on the print head itself. No way to get under there. Also we have had to constantly realign this thing for some reason, and visible lines were a problem.

I then came on here at Amazon to read the reviews, only to find that many of you agree with me - and no wonder. It only has 72 watts, as another reviewer pointed out - something I tried to discern when purchasing it, but didn't find any mention of on the box. I should have known better, I guess.

I'm considering adding the balloon whisk, which is supposed to add more volume to things like egg whites than you can get using a hand whisk because of the added speed.Gave it four stars only because I haven't really put it through its paces yet, having used it only once, but I'm quite satisfied with what I see and how it works so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!

I paid over $50.00 for this 13 months ago and at first the beater seemed loose but I didn't think much of it then while mixing frosting the metal prongs on one of the beaters all detached at the same time leaving me with only one side operational to finish my daughter's cupcakes for school. I have never been more unhappy with a product in my life. It is a complete waste of money. The speed is very slow and every once in awhile it just pauses for no reason. Garbage, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I bought this mixer after checking consumer reports web site. Sounded like it would be quality - WRONG!

Boy, was I wrong. I, like the other folks who have tried to make mashed potatoes with this mixer have been extremely disappointed. They always come out lumpy. Always. I don't know if it is because the mixer lacks power or if it is because the beaters don't have the metal rod going down the center of the beater. Something just doesn't cut it. I have to say, I love my KitchenAid stand mixer, but I don't like this hand-held mixer at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixers fell apart after only a few years of use","review":"The metal mixers completely broke after only 2 years of purchase.

They are high quality tools, made in the USA, that also represent good value for money. To date, these wrenches have enabled me to successfully repair a nailing/stapling gun and to dismantle and responsibly recycle several defunct pieces of electrical/electronic equipment.

It broke right out of the package. =( Frustrated!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest design ever","review":"So this is how it works:There is a little ball in the little tube you see there. The ball floats. So, as the water level rises to the top, the ball rises to plug the hole. Simple right?Unfortunately, this product's purpose is to hold back five gallons of water. You simply can't carry that much water without bobbing up and down/swishing the water back and forth. This causes the ball to move around and water splashes out. As the water level lowers, so does the ball, thus making the cap completely useless. Enjoy having water shoot up in your face with every step!Also, the wings on the side(to help remove the cap), although helpful, did not fit in my water cooler. I had to cut them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came apart on first use!","review":"I bought this new in a sealed package. Thought it was a little over-priced but worth it if it would work. It fell apart the first time I used it! I used a hot glue gun to put it back together. It's still not a perfect design, but does seem to help spill a little less when I'm turning the 5 gallon jug over to put it into the cold water dispenser.

Cowan's book, 'For Freedom Alone: The Declaration of Arbroath' - and yet go on to quote large passages from it without proper referencing.

She will sometimes watch it for up to 3 cycles. I would give it 5 stars but for some of the issues that have already been listed. Difficult to change batteries, having to take it off the crib more than unscrewing the plate. So many toys screw the plate in now, I won't blame this product. And it does eat batteries but we tend to play it for about an hour and a half a day. I loved it enough to buy it for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mobile dies on you!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"SAME thing as EVERYONE else has to say!

It burned out after a few weeks, but since the mobile wasn't brand new, I didn't think much of it.We ordered a new one and it, too, burned out in less than one month. It's really too bad that this is such a shoddy piece of junk. For the brief time that it did work, my son loved it.We were extremely disappointed with this product. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful mobile","review":"This mobile is wonderful, my son just loves it. The colors are great and the music is stimulating. There are a few draw backs though. The music only has two volume settings, they are botrh loud, we have a blanket tied around the speaker so the music is softer. Also you can't just have the mobile on without the music. All and all I would buy this mobile again, it is wonderful, my son just giggles and smiles at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality music, but colorful characters.","review":"I bought this product with such joy & expectation. I loved the design and the colorful hanging characters. But once I installed it and turned it on, I was very disappointed since the music was of such low quality that it hurt my ears! I could not stand the bad quality music and the noise that came from rotating the parts. This noise was more dominant the the music itself. I though if I cannot stand this for two minutes, how would the baby like it. I think they need to improve the quliaty of the music coming out of the box and stop those small parts sliding on the hanging wire which make so much un wanted noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST EVER!!!","review":"I originally bought a pastel, Peter Rabbit mobile to match my son's nursery. He didn't seem to pay any attention to it when I turned it on. When he was two months old, and becoming more alert,(he was born 6 weeks early) I needed something to keep his attention... besides me! I switched his mobile and from the moment he saw it he loved it. Now, he is 4 1/2months old and as soon as I lay him in the crib he kicks and squeals for me to turn it on. He loves that the little shapes shift back and forth. This mobile actually does something more than just spin round and round. I also love the fact that it plays classical music. I've read frequently about classical music stimulating the brain. Also that children who were introduced to classical music at a young age, even as early as in the womb, had higher IQ scores. I think that has a lot to do with my son developing so quickly even though he was so premature. I would not give this up for the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a Five","review":"This is my fourth one because I kept having to exchange it. My baby loves it but the squelling motor is very loud and very annoying. It is so loud that the music couldn't be heard really well. Even with my fourth one, it's still squealling. I hope the manufacture would try to fix this problem. The problem is keeping it from being a five star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality of music and motor","review":"We purchased the Tiny Love mobile, but were quite disappointed in the poor quality of the classical music. It gives a distinctly out of tune, 'tinny' quality to the music.Additionally, the sound of the electic motor that powers the mobile was so loud that it overwhelms any music that's being played. Not exactly the ideal environment for a baby to fall asleep under.However, the toys were well done and are sure to entertain most babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical problems","review":"We had this mobile for less than one month when it stopped moving. The music kept playing but the arm that rotates the animals wouldn't turn anymore. My husband who is great with fixing things tried to make it work again, but still does not. The arm also fell off once on our baby as well. Not worth the money. Get another mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little noisy","review":"It's a wonderful mobile, my baby loves it, but don't expect it to lull your baby to sleep. It's great entertainment when your baby first wakes up or while you need to tidy up the nursery, but it's a too noisy and stimulating to send your baby to dreamland. A good accessory, but not a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other like it!","review":"This is the perfect mobile! My son loves this mobile. I wanted an educational mobile for my baby. And this is it! When babies are born they really can't distinguish light pastel colors or even shapes for that matter. But this mobile has bright and solid colors, just perfect for any baby. It makes them focus on the moving shapes and colors. My son is now four months old and he figured out that he has hands. So he loves to bat the mobile around. This is a very educational mobile and I recommend it to all parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this!","review":"My son will lay in his crib for at least 30 minutes watching this mobile even if it is not turning. That is pretty good for a 3 month old. I only gave it 4 stars though because I am disappointed with the locking mechanism. With the slighest bump, the rotating part will fall off. In fact, it has fallen on my son a couple of times! It won't stop me buying another one but I just want to warn people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mobile!","review":"I love the mobile. When my son was only a week old I think he enjoyed the soothing music. But now at 7 weeks he is really enjoying looking at the animals and watching them as they move. He even smiles at it while it is on. It is so cute to see him enjoying it! My only suggested improvement would to allow for the music to be played without the movement or just the movement without the music. But overall I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!! Much better than the mobile that goes w/her theme","review":"I was so caught up in making sure that everything matched that when my sister suggested this mobile I was not at all interested. But after realizing that my 9 week old was showing interest in her current mobile (which is not very stimulating), I decided I should give it a second thought. I purchased this and WOW... she absolutely loves it. She coos and smiles at the animals, moving or not. It hangs just perfect in her crib, which has the mattress at the highest setting. This has to be one of the best purchases I have made... well worth the [money] even if it doesn't match your theme. Your baby will appreciate it and so will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"costly at the end","review":"even though i agree this is a great product this mobile did end up being costly i just wish someone would have mentioned how many batteries you go through per month. i use it whenever our son Dylan is in his crib or being changed or just for occasional entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible Safety Hazard","review":"We purchased two of these mobiles for our newborn twins. The babies love them. The problem is that if the bulb is not lined up directly above the base the mobile has a tendancy to tip over. My wife went into the nursery room a few minutes after we had turned on one of the mobiles to find that it had fallen on its side and the animals were hitting our daughter's face. Our friends that have this mobile have experienced similar problems. Some cribs are more suited than others for the security of the device but all seem unstable to some degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and colorful but...","review":"I loved this in the store, when we got it home, it worked for about two weeks and then stopped rotating. It is very difficult to get the mobile part onto the pole connector to try and fix it. Our baby really liked it when it worked, so now we strung it up to the ceiling and I am having a hard time justifying the cost when I have to turn it myself. It really isn't worth the frustration (I do recall slamming it on the floor), get one that works. If you buy it, or have it...save the box and your receipt, you'll need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immobile Mobile","review":"The first mobile we got stopped rotating the first day we used it. We sent it back and Amazon promptly exchanged it. The second one worked properly for about a month, and has since stopped rotating. Don't know why--it's just stopped.Our son loves to look at this mobile, even though it's not moving (so technically, I guess it's not really a \\"mobile\\"--maybe a \\"stationary\\"?). The music part still works, and it's nice. So we won't get rid of it--but new buyers beware, this toy may have quality control problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sounded like a good idea....but","review":"Yes, it was definately a distraction, but all that clicking and moving (it got on my nerves a little!), it was not soothing for an infant trying to mellow-out and get relaxed enough to go to sleep. Also the music was nice, but a little too electronic sounding. Mostly it was good for keeping the baby distracted for 15 minutes while we ate dinner. Then, after three months it stopped working. After changing the batteries several times, we gave up and by that time the baby was too old for it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and Noisy Mobile with Too Much Hype","review":"... It fits only on cheep Cribs. If you have a crib rail thicker than 2\\" buy something else. The music is nice, animals are cute, however the motor makes an unusual hissing sound and quite irritating. The pieces that slides up and down also makes an unpleasant noise. The company brags about how developmental this mobile is however I think the noise may actually bad for babies. I will give 4 stars for the look and 1 star for the poor construction. I will return it during the weekend.Frankly, I rather hang an umbrella upside down with some soft toys, play good music on my CD player for my baby than using this [thing].Just another too hyped Toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I have no idea how the other people were able to put it together.

It would keep him happy the entire time he watched it!About a week after I had it the problems began. It goes through the 3 AAA batteries within a week. The motor squeals so much that I returned the first one I bought, thinking it was defective, but the second one squeals as well. Now the mobile is not turning when it is turned on- the music plays but there is no motion. The on/off switch sticks.I will return this one and try one more time, but that is it.

We cannot return it from here, since we don't have a receipt and did not keep the packing slip.

The fact that all the stuff faces down toward him is great.The only downside to this mobile is that it only plays 15 minutes of music. So, when it stops--my son gets cranky.

It takes 4 dd A and I have replaced them 5 times and my daughter is 9 months old. I didn't get this until she was 3 months old now. So 5 months and $30 in batterys.So bacially its turns out the mobile really is $69.99 ! I would buy one that doesn't need battery and much more simple! The music to is good music but sounds like a bad recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only thing that keeps baby's attention!","review":"I originally hesitated to buy this mobile for my son because of the price, but it has definitely proven to be worth it! Everything about this mobile appeals to him. The black and white stripes on the underside of the disks caught his attention at first. Now, he loves the animals, and is beginning to turn his head in anticipation of the next one coming. The shapes at the top of the mobile slide as well while the mobile turns, something else for his to look at. Unlike a previous reviewer, I do not find the clicking sound of these sliding shapes annoying. Nor does my baby (who it really is for). The music box has two settings for volume, and if you really want the music without the movement, it is simple to detach the mobile part from the music box. I think this is a great product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mobile. My son will lay staring up at it for the full 15 minutes that it plays - just enough for a hot shower! Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This is a good concept, but save your money and try another mobile. We registered for this and got it for a shower gift. Our son was very content to watch and listen, however this is VERY NOISY and after about 3 days of not much use, the mobile part FELL ON HIS HEAD! It just separated from the body of the machine. It was put together correctly and everything. We tried to reassemble it, and within about an hour the same thing happened. Now he can only listen to the music, which is nice, but too bad the whole thing didn't work!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service!","review":"Just recently, after using our mobile sparingly for several months, the mobile stopped moving. (I heard this is a common complaint.) Even after changing the batteries, there was no improvement. But after writing an email to the company, they sent me the replacement part within 5 days, which solved the problem in no time. We really appreciate the excellent customer service and our baby is now back to enjoying this mobile - which he adores! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining for baby, but a Huge Hassle for Parents","review":"We love how unique this mobile is and it keeps our 3 month old very entertained most times, but I think it is over priced for the problems that come with it.1- It is unsafe because it tips over at the slightest touch. We don't have a fancy crib, just very simple and oddly enough the mobile does not fit properly over the side. We have to wedge a blanket to keep it from tipping over all the time!2- The motor is very noisy and so I can't use it to put my baby to sleep;it's only used for playtime.3-The On/Off button gets stuck sometimes.4- It consumes far too many batteries, it's already expensive.5- It is an extreme hassle to have to change the batteries by having to take the entire thing off of the crib, then unscrewing the battery compartment and then painfully adjusting it back on the crib all over again.What an expensive crib mobile that only does half of it's job, it should be half the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT","review":"This mobile, by far, is worth the bucks. Our newborn daughter could track the movement of the animals and was fascinated with it before she was even a month old!!! She still continues to lay and watch, smile, giggle, etc. It's her favorite thing and one of the best baby purchases we made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best thing we bought for our baby!","review":"I had not intened to purchase a moblie for my son, thinking that I wanted him to only associate his crib with sleep. However when we decided to have him sleep in his crib at night (at 10 weeks)it was clear he wanted nothing to do with being in the crib. I had heard that this moblie was wonderful so my husband and I decided to give it a try. Our son loved it from the moment we started it. We call the animals on the mobile his \\"friends\\". He now goes into his crib with no problems and will coo and talk to the animals for long enough to catch a shower or a short break for mom during the day.We did have trouble with the first one we bought with the motor squeaking, but we returned it and have no problems with the new one. We did have to put a piece of cardboard between the crib and the bolt to keep it firmly in place.I definitly think thiis is a \\"must have\\". I hate to think of the day when we have to take his \\"friends\\" down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!!!","review":"While this wasn't the original mobile I wanted, it is one of my top 5 best buys! My son absolutely loves it! He even zeros in on it from across the room! Definitely one of our better buys. After researching what newborns can see, this mobile fits all the requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infant Eye Candy","review":"I just put my two month old in his crib for bed, and as I sat listening to him cooing and giggling at his mobile before I turned out the lights, I got inspired to write my review on the Symphony Animal Mobile. Since Keaton was about a month old, we have put him under his mobile for visual stimulation, and it seems that as he gets older, he just loves it more and more. My absolute favorite thing about it is that it plays for AT LEAST 15 minutes(I have yet to watch the clock, but it seems like longer), and it keeps his attention the entire time. While this is not a cheap crib accessory, it is one that I feel is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mobile!!","review":"At first, ours made this horrible \\"grinding\\" noise, but it went away. It does make a lot of noise, but it has two volume settings, and we use the lower of the two at night or at naptime. Also, if you find the motion distracting for your baby, you can pop the top off the mobile and use just the musicbox attached to the side of the crib. If you choose this one, lay in AA batteries...it can suck them dry before you realize it! Would I buy again, yeah, I think I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe what you hear below . . . . .","review":"I purchased this fantastic mobile for my 3 month old son in 2001 after reading many wonderful reviews about the product. Not only was it impossible to deny how visually stimulating it was for him (he would not take his eyes off the many shapes and colors provided under the cones), it also provided the most soothing classical music with, yes, moving parts as yet another stimulating aspect of its workings. THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST for those looking for something other than the pastel, unstimulating stuffed animals most manufactures put on the end of their mobiles. I cannot imagine this being an iritating product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mobiles part falls off","review":"I bought this mobile for my daughter, and to my suprise today while she was napping the mobile actually fell on tops of her while she was asleep. It was hooked up correctly, as it has never done this in the 4 months we have had it. As a parent, I would consider finding a mobile that is strong,one that doesn't just turn and snap into place, and will not fall on top of an infant. As a result my daughter has a welt on her forehead. As for the music, one would think that they would have put some well known songs from the composers, not some lesser known ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a great mobile...if it doesn't fall apart!","review":"I have had the same experience as others here. My daughter LOVES this mobile!!! I got two of them....one for the crib at home, and another for the crib at the Montessori she goes to. The one at the Montessori gets used every day. We haven't used the one at home, yet, since she's not sleeping in the crib, yet. Well, the mobile part started falling off while she was using it. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice mobile","review":"I really like this mobile. My month old daughter seems to like it as well. She enjoys watching the spinning pieces and I think that the clicking beads are interesting to her. The music is soothing and the volume control is handy.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit stimulating for use as a sleeping aid. I have it mounted on our changing table as I think it's educationally stimulating- but not good for putting her to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this mobile after researching several. I decided to spend the extra money because the reviews for this were very high. I was extremely disappointed with this product, and returned it. If you have a crib with bumpers, this product does not attach well at all because it has to be behind the bumpers or mushes them down. It also falls over very easily by touch, and I did not feel it was safe for my son who moves around a lot in his crib. Finally, the motor is so loud it woke my son up as opposed to helping him fall asleep. The only positive aspect was the music, which was classical and had three selections. This is hard to find in other products. All in all, though, I suggest chosing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in less than two months!","review":"We thought this mobile was very cute when we got it, but after only 7 weeks of very limited use, the mobile stopped moving. The music still worked, but with the mobile broken, its pretty useless. I don't think it was worth the money we spent on it, since there is no way for us to fix the mobile or get a refund from Amazon. Beware of the quality of this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame","review":"My daughter loves this mobile. It is fun, colorful and very entertaining....when it works. We were very excited to get this as a gift since it costs about $40.00. It worked for a day or two and then stopped moving so we unplugged the animated part and plugged it back into the base several times and it worked again for a few days and then quit moving altogether. The music works fine and she still loves to look at the toys on the mobile but we must get it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it","review":"My baby has loved this ever since he was able to focus his little eyes on the moving animals. It really entertains him. He is 4 months old now and has not tired of it. The batteries last forever. The music is not too annoying. It is easy to install on the crib and feels very secure once attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mobile but noisy after awhile","review":"This mobile is very playful and colorful. The music is very relaxing and soothing.Pros:- Mini stuffed animals- Moving/Sliding objects- Nice classical music (Mozart, Bach & Beethoven)- Colors- Swivel armCons:- Battery life- Squeaking noise after a few weeks useWould I buy this product again? Probably yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"This mobile is heavy, awkward and the remote control was missing from the box the mobile came in. I'm not happy with it. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was so excited to recieve this mobile as a gift. However, it has already stopped working TWICE. I've contacted Tiny Love both times and have had the motor replaced, but my baby is only 3 months old! And we don't use it all day long. Usually, the only time my baby is in his crib awake is when I'm in the shower. He loves the colors and characters on the mobile, which is nice. But it's no fun for him to stare up at something that isn't moving at all. If I could redo my baby registry, I wouldn't bother with this mobile. For all the news about what a great item it is, it sure is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, Bad design","review":"My husband and I loved this for our first son, however after two months the mobile slowed down and the music would not play. I returned it for another one and three weeks later the same thing happened with the new one. The mobile itself is a great idea but they still have many kinks to work out with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"We were walking through a store and my husband found a demo model of this toy and turned it on for my three month old daughter. For the first time in her life she oohed and aahed over a toy. Of course my husband bought it immediately. She is completely captivated by this toy. It has great music thats not plunky like most mobiles and the toys are capivating visually. We took down our mobile that matches her room and this one is here to stay. What a great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My husband wanted this mobile very much for our new baby. It had gotten good reviews (no hint of mechanical problems then) so we were very eager to see how she responded to it. The mobile worked well for the first 3 months and our baby absolutely loved it. After three months, I went to change the batteries when it stopped working and found that one of the batteries had leaked from the compartment and taken the paint off of the crib. I'm just glad it didn't leak down to where my daughter sleeps. After cleaning up the mess and installing new batteries, the mobile still didn't work. Then the arm fell off and landed on my daughter's head. My husband (a mechanical engineer) worked hard at trying to repair the motor; however, he was unable to solve the problem. A great concept; lousy construction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's favorite Toy!!","review":"My husband and I purchased this mobile when our daughter was two weeks old. She loved it from day one!!and still does three months later. Even when she was that young she would watch the animals go around (even though she wasn't supposed to see them at that young age) When she is playful she will look up at the animals (the frog is her fav) and smile. When she is sleepy it puts her straight to sleep. I love this about it. When she would wake up in the middle of the night I could always put her back to sleep with this. It's great that it plays for fifteen minutes. Some of her other crib toys don't last that long, so we have to constantly turn them back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best out there","review":"My baby loves this mobile! I originally had one that matched my bedding, but I took it back and bought this one. I am so glad I did that. The first one I had just had some bears that spun around in a circle. This one has black and white swirls underneath that really grab his attention. His grandmother has one at her house with bears, and although he likes it, he does not get as excited as he does with this one. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea bad product !!!","review":"My husband and I put this in our registry and got it. I loved it at first then we put it together to find that the mobile part wouldn't stay on the unit and would fall off in the crib(ie...where baby will lay). When our baby was born we found that he loved it but it used so many batteries we hated it. Great idea on the push button instead of wind up, we did like that. Now that my baby is 10 months old we wanted to sell it and hopefully get some money for it but we simply can't because it doesn't work anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerized my son!","review":"My aunt bought this for my son--it was a great gift. At 4 months actual, 2 months adjusted, my preemie is just starting to react and enjoy stimulation. This is above his crib and he will watch it most enthusiastically. It was easy to install and so far as worked without a hitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two weeks.","review":"Our baby loved this mobile, but it broke after just two weeks of very light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but electrical problems","review":"I liked this mobile when it worked, but unfortunately that was only about 10 percent of the time we had it. From the first unwrapping, I couldn't get the music and the mobile arms to both work at the same time. If I unscewed things I could get one or the other to go a time, but there was obviously some electrical problem that never worked itself out. I've heard similar things from some friends who had this, so I wouldn't recommend buying this mobile until the company works these issues out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word of Caution . . .","review":"The mobile is very secure from a front to back standpoint, but it has slipped sideways (rotated?) on us which does not entirely put it in the crib, but some of the strings with the toys land in the crib so we only use it when we are awake. That is fine as it stimulates my son, it does not put him to sleep. I think the noise as it slides is on purpose. The bright color and music are great. Also, the music box part is detachable and we can bring it with us. Great mobile for the daytime, but not at night due to the safety issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Mobile","review":"My baby just loves this mobile. She stares at it and talks to it the whole time she's in her crib, it doesn't matter if it's on or off. She just loves it. I like the music it plays and I LOVE that it stays on for 15 minutes at a time. It's so colorful and a great design. I know a lot of people complain about the sliding pieces making to much noise, my baby actually likes the noise that it makes, Go Figure! The only reason I didn't give this mobile 5 stars is because the on/off and music buttons are hard to push. Also I wish it would have come with a remote instead of having to go to the crib to turn it back on everytime. Other than that this is a GREAT MOBILE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this:","review":"I love the design of this mobile, my baby does too; the problem is that the mobile breaks within a week of use. I ordered 3 of these and had to return each one because they malfunctioned. Save yourself the time and choose another mobile. I do have the Geometric Shapes mobile from Tiny Love which has worked for months, however, I did not have this mobile shipped to me, I purchased it in a store. I do not know if the product becomes damaged while being shipped or if this particular design is defective, but I would strongly recommend choosing another mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"The quality of this product is great, and it has performed well, no problems. I am basing my review on my baby's reaction to the mobile and my annoyance at the hype that surrounds it. It seems that the last thing that my baby wants when she is trying to fall asleep is a musical freak show tumbling at her. She doesn't like it for awake entertainment either, I guess for the same reason. The music that accompanies it is clunky like a cheap toy piano, which kind of defeats the purpose of it being classical music. No, you can't mute the music. The beads sliding around while it operates are noisy, but maybe babies like the \\"white noise\\".The product claims to enrich your baby's mind to the point of genius, which you learn by reading the small novel enclosed with the product, informing you that the Beetoven is for \\"stimulation\\", the Bach for \\"relaxing\\", and the Mozart for \\"cognitive development\\". I was embarrassed that I had fallen for the hype and bought this mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good principle but doesnt work!","review":"I think this is a fantastic mobile with great music and 3 d motion.

The minute I saw this mobile I loved it. I bought it immediately. But when I attached it to our crib the animals were almost touching the mattress. A baby is not supposed to be able to reach the mobile, and so I am not taking any chances. I have read the other reviews and not too many people have had this problem, I don't understand how other babies have not been able to reach the mobile. Anyway I have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very soothing to a parent","review":"I am really glad I tried this Mobile out before the baby came. My husband and I thought that it was almost instantly annoying. I way prefer the old hand-wind version my 3 yr old had. The sliding shapes that move constantly as the mobile turns give off a clacking plastic noise. We have the crib in our bedroom and that would drive us nuts instantly. Maybe baby's like it, but ours will like another once I return this one just as well too.And the music has a very canned midi sound to it. I'd much prefer the old chimes of a one song mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I brought it back","review":"I've received this mobile for baby shower.Unfortunately I brought it back because it didn't work.:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - poor quality","review":"Our baby isn't even here yet & the mobile is already broken.

Until it started making an aweful squeeking noise. We returned it and got another thinking it was just faulty. Wrong, they are all like that after about a week.

I am going to try one more as my baby loves the thing, but don't have too much trust that another is going to last. Would suggest Tiny Love talk to their quality control dept about his one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are MUCH Better Mobiles!!!","review":"I got this mobile for my son who is now 8 months old. When I put it together for him before he was born several things immediately went wrong. First, the mobile DID NOT turn at all. Each individual animal turned manually, but that's it. Second, The arm that supports the mobile snapped in two once I hung the animals from it. Third, because one part of the mobile always hangs lower than the rest, if your child has long arms (like mine) he can easily pull the entire thing onto himself. Luckily I was standing right next to the crib when this very thing happened. It was very scary to see the mobile crashing down on my son's face. No damage was done, but I took it back that same day. I now have the Sassy Deluxe mobile and we all love it. BE AWARE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mobile","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she fell in love with it. The bright colors, classical music and animation captured her attention from day one. The mobile is at an angle and the animals and shapes move in multiple directions as it rotates which makes it much more interesting than most mobiles. The only complaint I have is that I had to return it twice because it stopped rotating, but I have had no problem with the third one. It also has a remote feature which is great for putting baby to sleep without having to enter his/her room. It is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return it because","review":"mobile stopped turning after about 1 week. there was a guy 2 people ahead of me in the Babies R US return line with the same problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"my daughter loves this mobile. it was the only thing that she will just sit and look at.

Since he has not arrived yet, I cannot rate it based on his reaction. But what I can rate is how it works...NOT! It was fairly easy to assemble following the directions, & the colors & music are perfect for the crib & a developing mind. However, after pushing \\"on\\" for only the 2nd time, nothing would happen. I switched out the entire set of batteries thinking that was the problem, & it worked again. But only for 2 more breif test runs. Went to turn it on again this morning just to see if it worked, & nothing happens again! I even changed out the batteries again, & now NOTHING happens...no music or movement.

The only improvement I would make is a remote control, but I don't think I would use it that often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Mobile!!!!","review":"My husband and I received this mobile as a shower gift. We were happy to get it, because we have a convertible crib and most standard mobiles won't fit on our crib. This mobile, however, did fit in our crib and we were anticipating how our 3 week old would like it. She loves it! She fussed for close to 2 hours straight, and after trying everything, I finally put her in her crib and turned this mobile on and she stopped crying and cooed at the animals as they came down to her! I was amazed at this mobile and I can honestly say that it saved my sanity that day. A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great mobile","review":"I received this mobile when I had baby #1 (2 yrs ago). As an infant, my son loved watching the bright colors. The music is loud (clear shipping tape over the speaker solved that problem) and it does make noise as the figures move. I didn't use it to put him to sleep, but it was great to keep him entertained when needed. We now keep the music box on the side of his crib and he loves to play the music when he wakes up in the morning or after his nap. I'm now buying another one for baby #2.

I was hoping to use it with the next baby but I guess I'll have to get the new version that comes with a remote when the time comes.A sidenote, if you want the mobile to rotate with no sound, try setting the loudness switch just between settings. We were able to stop the music but maybe that is why it doesn't work at all anymore.

She has so much to explore:+ bright colors catch the eye+ black and white spirals (important for first months)+ the melody makes a big difference to other mobiles (aprox. 15 min without rewinding)+ many different actions (turns, svivels, slides)+ funny looking animals with big eyesetc...following some attributes which made me rate only 4 stars:- the melody is too loud. eventhough it has a 2 step volume control on it, we covered the speaker to reduce the volume even more.- kind of a scraping noise is produced when shapes slide down the mobiles arms. baby is not disturbed by it, but you'll have to get used to the noise.- you must turn on music in order to get the mobile turning. (I wish it would also turn silently - sliding noise is nice to follow too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby loves it soooooooo much!","review":"We received a bear mobile which is too plain but our baby still enjoys it. Then we decided to buy her another one, when we visited babysrus store, we just falled in love with this mobile at first sight and carried it home. We were so glad to have it cz our baby loves it 10 times than the bear one! She never gets tired looking at it, it's really a mobile revolution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this (but it does eat batteries)","review":"When my husband picked out this mobile I thought it looked like a scary acid trip! I wanted the soothing soft and fuzzy one that matched our baby's room. But I agreed to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. From the minute she saw it, our two-month- old kicked and laughed and loved it! She's now 3 1/2 months and now she babbles at it and follows all the movement with her eyes. It does eat batteries, but that's a small price to pay. I haven't had any trouble with it breaking (maybe we just got lucky)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would move","review":"I was very excited about this mobile after reading thegreat reviews here. When we set it up, though, it wouldnot move and I had to return it. The music sounds tinnyto the extent that I could not recognize the pieces,although I am familiar with most of Beethoven and Mozart'scompositions. Cute concept,, but poor execution. And why doall mobiles fit only cribs, why not have a mount that can befixed elsewhere: a wall or a ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symphony Animal Mobile","review":"I have to agree with Amarillo Texas. My sister purchased this very cute mobile for our baby which is due in August. My husband and I put it together only to find the same problem. I am sending it back as well and I am very unsure of purchasing another even though it is such a neat mobile. We are very dissapointed. All I can think about is it falling on our baby's face when we are asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"I put this mobile on my registry and received it as a gift at my shower. I tried and tried to get it to stay on the crib, but had no luck. I am disappointed that I had to return this mobile. It is a shame that they don't make them to fit a variety of crib shapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It scratched my crib!!!","review":"Yes, along with most of you I thought this was a very cute mobile. But, the first time I changed the batteries I noticed that my crib was completely scratched. I called Tiny Love and was told that that only happens if it does not fit your crib, however the only way to know if it fits your crib is by putting it on. The cs rep was going to talk to the owner of the company and get back to me. Well, that was about a month ago and I have yet to hear anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves mobile!","review":"This is a great mobile! I received as a baby shower gift and my son is now 5 months old and loves this mobile. Yes, it is very stimulating, he does not use it to go to sleep, he still sleeps in Mom's room and falls asleep on his own. But, when I need to take a shower, I put him in his crib and turn on the mobile. He loves the music and the animals and shapes. I love that I do not have to wind this up all of the time, you just push a button and it plays for 15 minutes. The sliding of the objects does make a sound, but it has not bothered him yet. Good for entertaining a baby, but probably not great to put a baby to sleep. But, my son loves it and I guess that is what is most important!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best mobiles","review":"I have to say I was a little surprised. I had heard this was the best mobile, but wasn't sure if it wasn't a bit too expensive. Received it as a gift, actually, & love it. It really entertains my baby. Don't know if I go in for all this \\"it will raise his IQ & speed his development\\" stuff, but it can't hurt! Don't concern yourself if it doesn't match your decor - the baby will probably love it & that's the important part - he won't care if the colors clash with the quilt or wall border."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby love s this mobile, but need to fix the buttons!","review":"My 9 month old daughter still absolutely LOVES this mobile (I know you're supposed to take it down at 5 months). We lowered her crib mattress so the baby can't reach it. When she begins to pull up,it will definitely have to come down. If you don't secure it well to the side it does topple over which could be dangerous. The only reason I had to give it 4 stars was because it stopped working (not the batteries)! The buttons have gotten stuck and it won't turn on despite me pushing the buttons a million times. My friend had the same problem with hers and she only used it for 5 months. I still have it in her crib, and she stares at it waiting for it to move. I'd definitely buy another mobile for my next baby if I knew this problem were fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"relax","review":"The mobile is wonderful. Our daughter laughs and smiles at it. When she is fussy, we can put her in her crib and turn it on. She calms down and is in a happier mood. We had a different one that she would kind of look at, but she watches this one from her changing table even when it is not going. We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it!","review":"From 2 weeks old, my son has loved this mobile! He stares at it, talks to it, & kicks and dances whenever it's on. When he's grumpy all I have to do is turn on his mobile and I'm sure to get a smile (and maybe 10 minutes of peace for mom!). I have not had a problem with any of the buttons, but I do wish it included an option for turning on the motion without the \\"symphony.\\" The music is high quality but gets OLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of three rates it tops!","review":"I bought this mobile for my third child when she was only a few weeks old on the recommendation of a good friend. My previous children had enjoyed other static mobiles based on black and white, so I was unsure about how this mobile featuring so much movement, sound, and color would appeal to a newborn. I was wonderfully surprised at her reaction to it: smiles, coos, and rapt attention! She absolutely loves it, and I'm here now to buy one for my sister-in-law! Definitely a must-have for the nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Chinese water torture.....","review":"Although I think this mobile is really cool looking and my twins definately seem fascinated by it- the motor makes this horrific squeaking noise every time it makes a rotation. I would rather listen to someone scratch there fingernails across a chalkboard. We returned one thinking it was a problem unique to that particular mobile, but the second one we bought does the same thing. Obviously these things have a major design flaw. Very disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd love the mobile if it worked better!!!","review":"We bought this mobile when our son was about a month old and he absolutely loved it. The animals are very cute and the music is pleasant. It kept him entertained for hours. But after about 7 weeks, the mobile part quit spinning. The music still worked. We took it back and got another just like it. After putting it together, it didn't work at all. As much as my son loved it, I think it is time to move on to another name brand of mobiles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs too low","review":"We received this mobile, which we registered for, as a shower gift. We put it together right away, but when we tried to put it on the crib we found that the angle of the rotating motor makes the bottom animal rotate way too close to the crib mattress. The baby isn't even here yet, and I could tell that if we left it up the animals would actually brush across his face...annoying, not to mention the danger of the small parts being that easily reached by the baby. It is a really cute mobile, and the box did say fits MOST cribs, so maybe ours was a fluke, but I would suggest trying to find one on display in the store and thinking about how it will fot your crib before registering or purchasing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY GOOD FOR A MONTH!","review":"We purchased this mobile for our 3 month old son after we realized that wind up mobiles were for the birds. This one was great- and he absolutely loved it. We used it maybe a dozen times before the motor quit. Took it back to the store & exchanged it for a new one.... SAME THING!! The new one made it three weeks before it died too! Returned it and got our money back. Would have been a WONDERFUL mobile if the motor were made better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have","review":"I have very fond memories of this album. We drove once from Cincinnati OH to Panama City Beach FL with only this CD and Sublime 40oz to Freedom. Truly inspiring traditional ska. To say that Super Nice Guy is the only reason to buy this album would give bad assumptions to Rude Girl and many other tracks. A great album to listen to that will help you forget your worries. very tight band, hope they still play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good printer, but not great for photo","review":"It is a regular printer. It can be used as a photo printer, but the quality is not very good. I can see the dots on the pictures. And the color is not \\"real\\". If using mid-quality or low-quality photo paper, the pictures are even worse. Text printing is fast and good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black ink nozzle is always clogged","review":"Like a number of other reviewers I have experienced the same problem; I have to perform a deep nozzle clean for the black ink before EVERY print job. Once this is done, the output is exceptional, especially photos, but this cleaning wastes time, ink and paper. From the number of other reviewers who have experienced the exact same problem it is clearly not a fault with my particular unit, but a fundamental design flaw of this model. Be very wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards for CANON.","review":"I recetly bought a new Canon i550 printer and I put it to work immediately. First, I was impressed by its quietness and the capability of closing both trays, input & output. But I'm using my printers only for making brochures and booklets for my patients in 3 different languages, not for photographs or pictures...For my purpose, this printer is very disapointing product: the print is faint (not CRISPY, as most other reviewers stated), even in its highest quality--it can't much even the \\"draft\\" mode of Canon S600 inkjet printer, which i'm using successfully for better than 8 months. I thought Canon is improving their line of products progressively (they stopped manufacturing the EXCELLENT S600), but it seems I'm wrong! Of course, I'm still going to look at Canon printers because of their economical \\"Think Tank\\", but I'll first try them and than buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon got the nod over Epson this time","review":"Been an Epson customer over the years.

The lower paper tray in not complete, or comes from a different printer, but I happened to still have my broken printer and swapped the part. When we purchase things, we expect they to be complete.

That the only difference was the the 550 was slower. Well, after buying it and printing with it, the other difference is that the 850 has a 2 picaliter droplet, and the 550 has a 5 picaliter droplet. So the technology is not the same. Don't get me wrong, the 550 does a good job printing. and the detail is great. But it's better on the 850.How did I find out the size of the picaliter in the 550? I called cannon, when I couldn't find it in the specs. But you can totally tell when you print. This is good buy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hassle!","review":"I too bought the i550 based on the raving reviews and had nothing but trouble.When we first installed the printer it printed a beautiful 4x6 picture on the free sample paper. After that it never worked again! I uninstalled, reinstalled, called tech support and got nothing but problems for 2 weeks.

I packed it back up in the box and sent it back to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Printer","review":"From the start, this printer would not print a single page until the print head cleaning program was run.

Maybe most of them are, but after four days I'm sending mine back.When it works right, it is a nice printer.

Don't print anything for a few hours, and the problem returns. Clean the nozzles once more, and it's fine again.I want to print, not spend all of my time performing maintenance on a printer.

If you want GREAT photos, you have to use photo paper. I've used MS Office, Corel, and Adobe products without a single problem. Top quality 4 X 6 photos thought take about 2 minutes, 20 seconds to print using the slick Canon software that comes with the printer.

Cameron Mitchell plays the ghoulish videostore clerk who shows three customers (Mark Fenske, Tim Noyes and the lovely Michelle Bauer!) clips from some classic sleaze and cheese that we all rented back in the glory days of the 1980's videostore era. It's unlikely that this will ever be released on either DVD or Blu-ray, due to rights issues, which is a shame as it would make a great party tape and is a wonderful time capsule of video's wild west from 30 years ago.Here's hoping that someone releases Terror on Tape as an \\"extra\\" on some future release as Universal did with Terror in the Aisles on their Blu-ray of Halloween 2 (1981)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Produst not same as shown.","review":"Product is not the same bottle or color as the Max Factor Whipped Cream Cool Beige 309 as shown.

This affords ability to transfer family group sheets from one binder into another that would be taken to a research facility and then easily return them to the correct binder. However, she says she has over 20 binders and the colored dots come in four primary colors....does this mean she has many red dot binders for say alpha letters A-D, E-G, etc. There is no way to submit a comment or question.

Made for TV movies are generally below par, but this one is 400 notches below that. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. It's extremely depressing to watch, because it's so badly written and directed. Seeing Janeane Garofalo in this tripe makes it especially painful as well. Knowing how articulate and intelligent she can be, it hurts to see her in this \\"film\\". Maybe she had bills to pay. She deserve better material, a lot better. She has a cult fan base, and perhaps they're willing to see her in any type of setting. I'm not, but I would love to see her in something brilliant. Despite all this, Janeane is still worth watching, no matter what she does.

And then I heard \\"Are You Happy Now?\\". And she ripped my heart out. She left me bleeding, spent and sore emotionally. This young girl with an old soul grabbed my attention and hasn't left me since.And guys, if you think her album versions are good, you really need to hear her acoustic ones. She's even better!

After dissing all the crappy young girl artists like Brit and Christina, Michelle's sound was different and refreshing. Her guitar riffs and fantastic melodies made me an instant fan.Maybe my expectations were too high for this cd and that's why i was dissapointed. This album consisted of toned down lighter ballads and made this cd very weak. She tries too hard to sing over her songs. This made her voice sound much worse than it really is. Less voice and more riffs would've helped. Plus, the songs sound too much the same.I really wanted to like this cd but i couldn't.

I had heard that it was no where near as good as her first one, and I think they are right...it's BETTER.Yes the songs are different but Michelle's voice is more mature and has more power. She sings well; with more power and emotion then ever before. Her breath support is also greatly improved, with the sound being \\"pumped\\" from her diaphragm rather then straight from her vocal cords. I also got the feeling of nasal singing on the first one which is a simple mistake many beginning singers have and can easily be corrected with more practice of adequate breath support techniques.

Her debut THE SPIRIT ROOM was absolutely awesome. It was a 5 star CD and I really liked it a lot. So, naturally I couldn't wait for this CD. After listening to HOTEL PAPER I felt like throwing my stereo out the window. It is soooooo depressing. Michelle lost all of her spunk, wit, and songwriting/musical ability on this ... CD. The only 2 worthy tracks are \\"breathe\\" and \\"are you happy now?\\" HOTEL PAPER is a big disappointment. It's loaded with dreary ballads with sulking lyrics. It's obvious that she's not happy now! If you liked THE SPIRIT ROOM, avoid this at all costs! Hopefully Michelle will find herself for future releases. HOTEL PAPER is not her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Hotel Paper, Michelle Branch's 2nd album, starts with the angry, cathy Are You Happy Now but soon turns into a huge disapointment. The songs all sound very much alike and fail to grab your attention.

The typical whiney ho-hum music from one of today's typical whining girl singers. How can there be so much angst in such a young life? Who can tell.

She has come so far since her beginning with Everywhere. The cd Hotel Paper is awesome.. every song has a deep meaning to it and is easily stuck in your head, you might be humming it for days. I just saw her live in concert with the Dixie chicks.. she is amazing. So, buy this cd, catch her in concert. You won't be dissappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"Being a big fan of the Euro Goth Band HIM i thought i wouldnt like this cd my bro downloaded a few of the mp3's to sample the cd and i loved every one of them. This is probably the best cd since HIM's album Love Metal i love every song on this cd Michelle Branch is one of my favourite artists now she's the best North American music artest i love u michelle your voice is every bit as good as HIM's Ville Valo'sScott Hoffle"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta see her live!","review":"I gotta admit...I love both The Spirit Room and Hotel Paper, but they just don't hold a candle to hearing her live, especially acoustic.When I first heard \\"Desperately\\" live, right before this album came out, I knew that was going to be my favorite song. I'm kind of disappointed with how they overproduced the song, I like it better with just Michelle and her guitar. I just didn't want them to ruin this song like they did \\"Goodbye to you\\" when it came out as a single. This song got a lot of bad ratings here on Amazon, but I don't think those people whoe gave it bad reviews would do so if they heard her perform it live...it's had the most applause in her last 2 shows I saw in San Francisco.Michelle is a great artist, I just hope her label has more faith in her and not drown her voice out with lots of background music.I know that's a lot of whining, but I'll give it 5 stars anyway, 'cause Michelle rocks! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooo Awesome!","review":"Hands down....this is so much better than The Spirit Room. That album was way to pop-like. (But yeah, I do still love it, LOL) But this album is more mature in lyrics, musically and vocally.Standout tracks:Find Your Way BackTuesday MorningHotel Paper (WOW...amazing)It's YouPS if you plan on burning your own \\"Hotel Paper\\" CD from the Kazaa file-sharing program, also include the acoustic version of Hotel Paper and two other acoustic songs from her November single release of \\"Breath\\".....I'm not sure what they're called, but I'm sure they're bound to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song","review":"This is just another CD that has one great song and a bunch of half-baked songs to fill out the rest of the CD. I, for one, am sick of buying something based on one great song only to find out the rest of the album stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring cd","review":"I loved Michelle's first cd. Its still one of my favorite cd's I own, but her second one is very boring. Besides a few songs, they almost all sound the same. It was a VERY big dissapointment.I may think twice before I buy another one of her cds again. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical, predictable and unoriginal","review":"This is just the kind of music I expected from Michelle... and every other self-proclaimed \\"singer, songwriter and musician supposedly playing alternative pop with a rock edge\\". I find that Michelle's singing sounds like she's whining, it's not distinctive at all and absolutely boring. Her lyrics just might as well be Avril \\"I-write-and-play-guitar! Honestly!\\" Lavigne's lyrics chopped up and reassembled with a different tune! Her fans would just lap it up and STILL give stellar reviews. In fact, that just might be true... Nice job changing your image, by the way. Copying a copycat (Avril) and acting like a spoiled, immature snot who shoots off their mouth too often. I guess that's what kids like now-a-days: loud, rude, cookie cutter (looks-wise and music style) brats who put down others to seem hardcore. More reasons not to blow 20$ on this \\"album\\"! Hell, not even 15$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best!","review":"Bought her last album and it was good. This album ismediocre at best......very disappointed in quality ofMichelle's voice. If you liked her last album and arejust a fan, you might like it. If you are a fan ofgood music, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWNING","review":"Michelle Branch's music could be clumped together in the same genre as bands like Matchbox Twenty and Train. I.E. people who think they're being 'alternative' or 'edgy'. Some may call it pop/rock but it is really more pop than rock. Michelle lacks in the lyric department tremendously to ever be compared to Alanis Morissette. Many of her songs blend together and sound the same. I admit, I kinda liked 'Desperately' and 'Till I Get Over You' but the rest was so boring and bland. Sorry Michelle, but I'd rather listen to Alanis Morissette, early Jewel, PJ Harvey, or Tori Amos anyday than you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Upbeat!","review":"Michelle is the ideal musical recording artist, she writes or at least cowrites almost all her songs,plays her guitar in each song, has a crisp, classy voice and is charismatic.My favorite tracks on the album would have to be:Hotel Paper: It seems almost an autobiographical song, writing her songs on hotel paper, traveling everywhere. A unique, beautiful slow song.Are You Happy Now?: Its a fun, somewhat demanding song, asking if her boyfriend is happy now!!I think it got a Grammy, it is an awfully fun song, very upbeat.Love Me Like That: A fresh rock duet with Sheryl Crow. My favorite song on the C.D. There voices compliment each other so well, and it is also a great song!Those are my top favorite songs, but the whole C.D. is worth it, Michelle is truly a great recording artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"Michelle truly outpours her heart in every lyric of every song. With cathy melodies and touchy lyrics, this a cd that anyone could enjoy. From the intro to the last song, the whole cd will catch you by suprise because of how much one girl has grown up in just 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up album - buy this!","review":"Ive been waiting for this for a long time and now that its out, its awesome!great music and lyrics and keeps her style from The Spirit Room.Thanks Michelle :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomeness at it's Best.","review":"It owns.

La musique est impressionnante. Grand pour les saucisses principales. Disparaissent ainsi le contrle hors de cet album impressionnant et malade en métal de la mort de hardcore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle needs production value to hide her weak voice.","review":"This album is a stinker. She went for a blues/ acoustic sound she doesn't have the voice to deliver the goods. I don't think should would have made it to the top 32 in American Idol because her voice is very lacking.She may write her own songs but they are unoriginal and and just plain terrible. I can admire the fact that wanted to change her image and try to copy Avril, but not on my dime. That being said, her voice sounds better on the album, than in concert. She's very pitchy during live performances.'Are you Happy Now' is best song on the album and that isn't saying much. 'Hotel Paper' is the worst song in the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"whyyyyyy!????","review":"go to speech therapy, michelle...and learn how to write songs and sing and.....eh, why dont you just quit...you'd do quite well as a k-mart clerk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid rock-pop album","review":"Breathe and Are You Happy Now? are my favorite songs on this album, but there are no duds, all the other tracks are good too. Listening to Breathe the first artist that comes to mind as a comparison is The Corrs, that track tends toward a upbeat pop sound. With Are You Happy Now? Sheryl Crow seems like an apt comparison, more of a rock edge to things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Michelle Branch","review":"I am only going to say good things about Michelle Branch because I really like style of music. This is a second purchase of the same cd. I only buy the cd's again that I have to have because I love the songs that much. I would listen to the songs first before you plan to purchase the cd. I enjoy it and have never got tired of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle.......much more then a \\"teeny bopper\\"","review":"First of I can't stand people giving this CD bad reviews! Yes, the music isn't as happy or carefree, but Michelle has grown up, and she has matured, and she IS trying to get away from being pop. Besides no one can expect her to stay 17 forever. Michelle put so much more of herself into this CD then she did in TSR. You can tell how lonley she feels, and how she wants someone to love her, but no one does.Also the songs don't sound the same. If you listen to Hotel Paper 4-5 times, you can really hear the difference between songs.I love every song on HP wih th excpetion of Desperatly. Each songs has a different feel to it, and has excellent lyrics, and a good arrangement. And just for the record, Are You Happy Now isn't even the stongest track.Best songs: Find Your Way Back, Empty Handed, Tuesday Morning, Hotel Paper, and Its You.Weakest Tracks: Desperatly, and Love Me Like That."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomore jinx?","review":"I absolutely adored her debut 'The Spirit Room' and was anxiously awaiting this new album. Although I really like the single 'Are You Happy Now?', I'm quite disappointed with the rest of the album. I liked the catchy, strong melodies along with the sophisticated instrumental arrangements on the first album. Although Michelle's voice is in absolutely fabulous form on this album, the songs just kind of meander and are rather boring. Sorry Michelle! I'm sure many fans will like this album but it just doesn't do it it for me. However, Michelle is such an incredible talent that I'm sure that in the future she'll create music that I'll love as much as her first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"I found this CD extremely disappointing. It seems like she is trying to hard to show her singing ability and because of this the music does not seem as developed. The songs are very hum drum and typical. I have been anticipating this CD for a long time only to be disappointed. Don't purchase this unless you are a Michelle Branch fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"i bought 'hotel paper' the day it came out. in the cd, michelle really shows herself to the world. alot of her songs have to do with stuff that has happened in her life since she produced her last album. i would definately reccommend 'hotel paper' to anyone who loved her last ablum or anyone who is just looking for a great cd to own! go out and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotel Paper 5 star material","review":"This album is a definite improvement from \\"The Spirit Room\\". \\"Hotel Paper\\" has a much more mature sound to it, and has great songs to listen to. Some songs include Are You Happy Now?, Empty Handed, and Breathe. All of the songs are good, it's hard to pick out the best ones. This is definitely the best work done by Michelle Branch. I suggest buying this album. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I am going to be honest, I love some of the songs on this CD, especially tracks two and seven. I have to admit that Michelle Branch has a strong voice and great sounding songs. The songs above mentioned were worth the album price alone. There are parts that are slow and boring but those tracks are great. Overall, worthy of the four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"This album is great. It sounds much more personal and grownup than the first. It is not an accident it has been in the top 10 2 weeks in a row and premiered at number 2. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes a girl who knows how to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"----","review":"...Did any of you actually LISTEN to Hotel Paper, or are you trying to degrade Michelle's image by saying she's a horrible musician, when you don't but any credibility under the statements you make? Saying she's trying to be a next Avril is a big understatement, Michelle has been around for a while before Avril, and Michelle puts more musicianship in her music and is clearly better than Avril in every way, except perhaps popularity. ...So, to anyone reading this, don't listen to reviews just undermining her image, and not music. I for one bought Hotel paper and I'm happy to say the step up from her last album is drastic. Altough if you read the album sleeves before listennig to Hp, you'll notice how the lyrics sound very airy. Once you add Michelle's voice and all the instrumentals, all the songs seem backed up and very solid...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing follow-up to Spirit Room","review":"I enjoyed Michelle Branch's debut album, The Spirit Room. It was full of catchy, guitar-driven songs. I downloaded her sophomore album, Hotel Paper, from iTunes. It was disappointing. The song material wasn't as good as Spirit Room. I found many of the songs too drab."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing. =/","review":"Having heard 'Are You Happy Now' and liking it tremendously, I bought this CD. I was anticipating a sound similar to the Spirit Room - something fresh, uplifting.Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. The only two tracks that I liked from the start were 'Are You Happy Now' and 'Breathe' upon listening to the CD. For some reason, many of the songs on the CD sound like each other (or are some variant of each other).It's a mediocre CD. Nothing really to jump out at you. I truly hope Michelle's next CD (if there is going to be one) is better than this. She's much more creative and talented than what she portrays herself on this CD to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"evolution of a fine singer/songwriter","review":"her songs are so inspiring. with each relaease of her album. it gets me hooked up. if u listen to her, u can feel what the song is all about...hotel paper...better than ever... the philippine release includes her first hit single everywhere and her grammy winning song game of love... great song from a great artist... grab a copy of it. its worth ur money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo Good!","review":"Michelle has come back strong with a more \\"guitar\\" based album.

I have been desperately waiting since May for the album to come out. I can't wait to buy the album. The first single \\"Are You Happy Now\\" (song & video) is awesome. The lyrics from \\"One Of These Days\\" is so touching. I always listen to her songs whether old or not in almost 95% of the time. I have her poster, and 30 hot pics of her, recorded MuchMusic 'Spotlight', watch MuchMusic 'Exposed' but unfortunately, I missed her concert with the Dixie Chicks, due to tickets sold out. I was stupid, I should bought it earlier. Anyways, I can't wait until her next concert. I like her becuase she's cute, cool, dresses awesome, sweet smile, pretty and hot.

I will not be buying any future albums by Michelle Branch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hotel not Worth the Trip","review":"Rolling Stone was right about this album; listeners are not going to be happy now with this disappointing effort from an artist whose attitude is getting bigger than her talent. Nothing about \\"Hotel Papers\\" makes it memorable, nothing about it makes you want to check in and stay awhile. There are so many better artists rising in the ranks these days; Branch better get her act together if she wants to compete for an audience with the likes of Beyonce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hotel Paper","review":"Think she is so innocent? http://www.broken-bracelet.net/ Just look at that and tell me what she is then.

They supposedly 'showcase' her Michelle's voice. Unfortunately, she doesn't have a voice worth showcasing. This album is terrible.I have to agree with the mainstream reviewers who have been trashing her album. That's why I'm giving Hotel Paper two stars. If you're expecting an album that is at least up to the quality of 'Are you Happy Now?' You will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the \\"spirit\\" on this CD","review":"This CD is bad. Her first CD there was only 1 song I didn't like...but now on this CD it's so...different... She's better when she doesn't write from her own experiences. All the songs sound the same, they all pretty much say the same thing, and they're all BORING! There's almost no repetative tune in any song to keep the hook going. It's so boring. DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I only hope other great artists out there, like Avril Lavigne, have a better comeback than Michelle does. I don't seen Michelle making a 3rd album. I really don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Dissapointed","review":"I absolutly loved Michelle Branch's First Signed Album. There wasnt a single song on that cd that I didnt like. I also loved Her first CD, Broken Bracelet (Only available on her website). But this CD seemed to lack the heart Michelle had in the first 2 CDs.

Sorry Michelle, I love your music, but this one was definately not your best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete waste, but close enough","review":"Michelle's new CD is a major disappointment.

Are you happy now is a great song but its not the only one on the album. Find your way back, breathe, and tuesday morning is are good songs too.

This album, with the exception of Are You Happy Now? and a few others (including, I believe, One of These Days and, actually, Tuesday Mornings) the rest really...I was quite, well, disappointed. I suppose I was expecting more of the same, Happy-Go-Lucky, hip things that Spirit Room provided, and was rewarded with more dark sounds. The music didn't really seem to jive with the lyrics right, and it is nowhere near as catchy as her Freshman Album. I bought this CD over another I was considering (Evanessance) with the faith that Michelle would not disappoint me.

Actually, I don't really like Michelle Branch anyway because she thinks who she is. Also, I don't like the way she contradicts other celebrities who have soared up on the charts just when they put their first song out.Just because they are doing better than her, she shouldn't say stuff like that on radio stations.

Her 15 minutes should be up soon .

Hotel Paper is definately ready to rock all charts!With it's first single \\"Are You Happy Now?\\" the best track and most kick [ing] song off this album. It's the right choice that Michelle did that. Other songs you should check it out is \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Find My Way Back\\". This album have a good mixture of fast and slow songs. Not every song sounds Pop. Because you might get bored of it if you have all songs pop, Michelle is able to do it but it's too boring. Added a country song to it makes it more cool! and there's even a french song in it. Please check out this album and i think this album rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty average","review":"yeah She plays&has had some success&whatnot but alot of Her Material seems just kind of there.I Compare Her Musical Progression with Jewel in that while She does quite well&Writes&Plays Her own stuff it just doesn't carry alot of Musical weight for My ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"maturity","review":"This CD is excellent. I am not the least bit dissapointed by herlatest effort. Hotel paper shows maturity and superb vocal abilities from Michelle Branch. There are alot of great songs on Hotel Paper. But five of these songs stand out such as Desperately,One of These Days, Are You Happy Now?, Hotel Paper and the highlight of the cd Breathe. To me Breathe has a pop-rock edge to it that's radio friendly and reflects Michelle's vocal prowess. If you liked The Spirit Room you'll definately love Hotel Paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but kinda similar to the last one...","review":"Hey what's up, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't all that much to say about this CD. Don't get me wrong, I like it a lot, Michelle Branch is an amazingly cool person and I think her songs are excellent, it's just that this CD is pretty much round 2 of the spirit room. Sure, \\"Are You Happy Now?\\" rocks harder than anything else she's ever done, but the rest of the CD pretty much stays away from rockin' songs. The CD is better than that crappy Santana song, but if you're looking for something new and different from Michelle don't expect to find it here. This CD is the same great stuff she showed us on the first CD, nothing more, nothing less, just more of the same. So if you like the spirit room, buy hotel paper, it will make you happy now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad In General","review":"Hey, Michelle, you \\"Desperately\\" need new music. I don't know how long it'll be \\"Til I Get Over You\\" and your bad CD. \\"One Of These Days\\" I'm going to burn it.Is it just me or do all the songs sound alike, not to mention equally bad? It's like country music gone wrong! And I don't even like country music to begin with!! It sounds like some drunk girl in a NYC bar at one in the morning to me. It's so.....whiny! And what's with that intro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Sophomore C.D.","review":"Michelle Branch's 2nd album is exactly what one would expect-- a musician required by her label to release another LP does so while she's touring the country. The point is- the foundation on which she writes these songs have nothing to do with life as we know it, but the life of a teenage vocalist who made it big. They are essentially bonus tracks of the last album, as she makes no attempts to expand or develop her style. Her first album was nearly 10 years in the making, as many lyrics and melodies were adapted from things she'd been writing since she was young. Listeners of \\"paper\\" will even sense a lack of enthusiasm from Ms. Branch herself, she trudges through her 2nd album as if she knows its only purpose is to be a place holder for the notoriously cursed sophomore slot.

I have to agree with Rolling Stone. Although, they were polite and gave it two stars. I have to give it one star. Are you Happy Now, was the best track of the album. The rest were very pitchy, in my opinion. She has a weak voice.She is trying to rip off Avril gimmick. She is a poor woman's Avril. I'm talking streets of Calcutta poor.The good news is that I also bought Clay Aiken's CD along with this album. So, I still haven't lost my faith in music.The track 'Desperately' is soooooo terrible. \\"Are you Happy Now' is okay. I liked it because they used it on Dawson's Creek.

Scan the titles and note the number of stars his past books have received. He has five 1 star books, twelve 2 star books, and two 3 star books. Surprisely he has no 4 or 5 star books. Shamms has a repuation for writing books of extremely low quality on topics he knows nothing about. He's also infamous for his 'max-the-parameter' style teaching in which he instructs the reader to crank an option to its highest setting to see what it does. He's really a horrible teacher, because he doesn't know the material, doesn't have any artistic ability, doesn't know how to write, and doesn't care about the end product. He also doesn't seem to care about ripping off his fellow man.So enough about him, how was the book? It [stinks].

Real World Bryce 4 is an excellent reference for the software. The only major differences between Bryce 4 and Bryce 5 are tree lab and metaball. Both of these utilities are easy to learn, therefore you are better with the Real World Bryce 4 book and referring to the manual for these 2 utilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at the cover!","review":"This book stinks like rotten radishes! Just look at the cover! This image is supposed to inspire us? As many of the other reviews suggest, Mr. Mortier is a Bryce novice. Don't waste your time or money on this book, buy the Version 4.0 by Susan Kitchens! Yes I know, it's an older version, but it all still applies, and the new things that aren't covered can be found by surfing the net. For more on Susans book, read the glowing reviews for her 4.0 book. The difference could not be more evident!

One might get over this if Blair's images were indeed outstanding - but unfortunately the are very conventional, very stiffly posed, and VERY 80's style! They annoy me so much it is hard to concentrate at the text.The lighting advice given is very basic and only loosely connected with the image examples given. As a professional photographer I was looking for a book with a strategic view on portraiture lighting, how to create different moods and emotions with a broad choice of light sources, interpreting personality, some new ideas to spark my creativity. I guess will have to look elsewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff, no meat","review":"I was rather disappointed with this book. I found it to be written at a fairly high level in two ways. First I felt that there were many technical terms that the reader was assumed to be familiar with already. The author used 'bare bulb', 'wrapping the light', and 'feathering' frequently without ever explaining what he meant. It was also high level in that he discuss in vague terms how he obtained a picture, but never got into the details. For example, there were no diagrams of the lighting in respect to the pictures. I'd rather he spent more time explaining how he get the shots and less time showing off his pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Maybe this is 2007, I find this style of photography doesn't sell very well in today consumer tastes. Yes, Mr. Blair is a master as well as Zucker; nonetheless, my clients want natural and fun.

I thought it would include fabric stamping not just paper stamping. This is for scrapbookers more than quilters. The quilts are made by embellishing with paper that has been rubber stamped and objects glued onto the project. Not washable and definately not for me. Doesn't seem very durable and falls into art quilt catagory. I was interesting in learning more about embellishing quilts but paper and glued objects does not do much for me.

After going to him and getting 300 digital photos taken for a headshot, all I needed was a printer. I read the reviews, and took my chances with this one. Some of the photos were taken from my knees up, and I trimmed them so that all you could see was my head and shoulders. Then I printed them onto 8 1/2\\" x 11\\" high gloss photo paper. (Consider how much the pixels expand in this process.) When I brought it to some people in the business, they couldn't distinguish it from a photo! Of course you'd need a very high quality digital camera produce something like this, but I am very impressed that a $... printer was capable of handling the task. Also, you can buy the ink cartidges for very reasonable prices. If you plan on doing a lot of photo quality prints, this will save you a lot of cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy & fussy","review":"This printer makes a LOT of noise before, during, and after printing. I have mine on a sturdy table, but the whole table shakes while it is printing. You have to have plenty of paper in it, otherwise it won't print. It jams easily as well. You have to be very careful that nothing is anywhere near where the printout comes out. Otherwise the paper will go back in the printer and jam. As for the printouts, they are fine, but nothing special. Before this printer, I had an old HP deskjet printer (ca. 2000) which printed just as well, and it was also much quieter and faster. If you are looking for a really inexpensive printer, and you don't print but occasionally, this one is o.k.

In sharp contrast, this printer takes very [inexpensive] cartridges that seem to last a reasonable amount of time. I didn't have any problems with setup or with the driver software. Print quality is very good for B&W; or color text and graphics. I have not done any serious photo printing yet, so I can't comment on that. This printer is fairly noisy and sometimes takes awhile to start printing after a document is sent to it. However, it is very fast for such a [low price] printer. Perhaps this is because it uses USB 2.0--so try to pick up a newer high speed USB cable.Although I have a few minor complaints about this printer, it is hard to go wrong with it at such a low price.

I drink several cups a day, and it seems to curb my appetite, aids in digestion and gives me more energy. It is high in antioxidants. This tea is an important part of my health regimen. I just love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tasting green tea","review":"We drink a lot of tea as a family and have a huge variety in the house at any given time. I have been wanting to go to a loose leaf green tea for health reasons and bought this one because of the reviews and great price here at Amazon. This has to be the best tasting green tea I have ever tried, loose or bagged. It is almost sweet without even the honey I like to add. It also is not bitter, at all. Just great all around tea. As a side note it takes us about three months to go through the bag but there are two adults that drink it regularly.**UPDATE** This was out of stock for a long time and when it did come back in, I immediately ordered. I don't know what happened but it is almost inedible now, really bad after taste. This is not the tea I was drinking before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"I am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea. It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA. There is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry, large and not compacted at all in the bag. In fact, the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball.Does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols? Can not find substantiation from USDA.They talk a good talk but product is severely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"All the people giving this tea high reviews based on taste have obviously never had quality green tea. It's quite flavorless other than a bit of bitterness. A quick way to assess the quality of a green tea is to look at the color of the tea it produces. A good green tea will give a vibrant green color (hence the name), a bad one will give you various shades of brown. This tea definitely falls into the latter category. I would not recommend this product to anyone who considers themselves a fan of quality green tea, nor will I buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring The Bomb!","review":"Marvaless is hot.

It came with no Moen packaging and does not have the Moen logo on the face.

The old one is probably not turning easily enough. It worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its true...made to break","review":"I have to replace these every year. Buy at least two per bathroom. Twice at much at our Home Depot so buy on line.If the diverter components go, I will be sure and NOT buy any Moen product to replace it.

I spent a lot of wasted time searching the stamped part number in the piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I searched through all the brick and mortar stores in my local vicinity and all of them were out of this part. Since the original broke off the shower in our master bathroom (which meant we had to shower for almost a week in the kids' bathroom), I was anxious to find a replacement as soon as humanly possible. Grabbed this one and it was a perfect fit.Unlike other reviewers, we've had this particular shower installed for 12 years before our handle went out. The same handle is used daily in the kids' bathroom and it hasn't shown signs of wear. I took it off when ours first broke just to check it and saw no fissures or cracks. Not saying the quality and functioning couldn't use some improvements on the company's end, but my review here is for the replacement handle itself, not the whole shower faucet setup.Not much more to say about it -- it is what it says it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits pretty good and nice looking","review":"Looks much nicer and clearer than my old one which was put on wrong and I broke when trying to \\"Fix\\" it. Not sure if it's a problem with my setup or the handle itself but I can't turn it all the way to the off position or it will start running water again, I have to keep it turned slightly away from \\"Off\\". But it's not a problem for me and I think I can fix it by buying a rubber bumper to attach to the inside of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many broke. Replaced with different handle","review":"As many others here have noted, these plastic handles do not last. The Moen part 100710 (stamped 96997 on the handle) break fairly easily. After replacing several, I switched to a different handle. There are many Moen Posi-Temp handles that can be used in place of the 100710. Moen's web site has exploded parts views for many different models of Posi-Temp tub and shower faucets. I chose the Chateau chrome handle (part # 100657). Very simple and comes with the adapter and screws needed to install on the existing faucet. Found an online dealer that with shipping, is only a few dollars more than the 100710 price. Available here at Amazon ([...]). Save yourself some headaches and switch to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy a few","review":"I have two tub/showers with this fixture. I probably replace this knob at least once or twice a year. The inside plastic ring breaks easily. Once broken you can not fully shut off the water flow without removing the knob and turning the brass water flow valve with a pair of pliers.Good thing they are easy to replace.But buy several to have on hand. I have 5 extras right now. Giving a low rating because of quality of knob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Often","review":"As others have said, this handle breaks often. I had the guy at our local hardware store search his book to see if there was any type of metal replacement that would fit. No such luck.Moen is raking in the bucks on replacement handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"quick tip to make these last...","review":"as you have all figured out by now, this handle is garbage. Moen should be embarrassed for making it. I bought a 1/2\\" copper pipe (it's about an inch long) for a buck at a local hardware. I think it's called a coupling pipe. It fits over the part that always breaks to support the plastic (I glued it on since it's not an exact fit). I don't know if it'll last forever, but it's better than buying a sixth handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review","review":"the book is pretty good because it's very funny stories in it there are a decent amount of them well just read the book it's awsome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse James Women","review":"Produced by Lloyd Royal Sr. this is a great B movie from the 50s.

First, we used it ungreased (as is recommended) and the cornbread stuck so terribly that we had to rip it out in little crumbles to remove it from the pan. The second time we used it we greased it heavily with crisco solid and the cornbread stuck marginally but it had a very odd flavor from the pan (the taste was absolutely not from the crisco, it tasted just like the pan smells, very metallic). Considering the price of this pan, I am highly disappointed with its quality and will not be using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bakes well, but hard to clean","review":"Even though the pan is pre-seasoned and using baking spray, cornbread frequently sticks, resulting in a non-cactus shaped lump of food.

The official DVD is put out by VICOL ENTERTAINMENT and has both dts and Dolby audio tracks. I suggest ASKING the seller to confirm their DVD has the VICOL ENTERTAINMENT logo on it prior to ordering. There are two other versions on Amazon with a different reddish cover. That one is the official VICOL version, but there is a third VICOL release with a blue cover also as pictured on this auction. I would just ask the seller to make sure the product they are selling has the VICOL logo on the art in SHARP lettering. If you get it and the text or logos are blurry, it is probably a bootleg.

This movie to me is an abomination, much as the Mission: Impossible movies are totally out of touch with the original television series, which I loved. Judge Dee was a magistrate who became governor; he had four assistants, three of whom were reformed criminals. They did the legwork while he did the investigating in the higher levels of society. He could fight, but he chose not to unless it was absolutely necessary. He had a long beard of which he was intensely proud and three wives whom he loved very much and treated as equally as possible. There is NO resemblance between this \\"Detective Dee\\" and the Judge Dee I love. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this movie. Please, someone, make another movie based on the books and not some ridiculous fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow, but then....","review":"The movie takes off and does not let up.

I watched him in the t.v. series Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre and thoroughly enjoyed his performance. That intrigued me to watch this movie and I was very impressed with the entire movie and all the cast. Andy Lau was amazing as Detective Dee. The special effects were brilliant, loved the action, the storyline had plenty of twists and left me with some unanswered questions (a sequel maybe?) I gave it a four star verses five because I would have preferred more martial arts action considering the level of martial skills in the movie was very good. The movie was very well produced and the English subtitling was excellent.

I found the \\"one item to a page\\" thing a little too overdone and self important. Really, MORE information on LESS pages at a LOWER cost would have been much preferred. At 39.95, it is unlikely that I will buy the next (inevitible) edition...- I mean, just how many photos of a single item, followed by a line drawing of the same item, do you need to see?...

There are better choices.","review":"I bought one for myself and my sister about 5 years ago...It takes nice pictures but the details aren't the sharpest.The camera is kind of big and bulky. Check out the newer cameras, they are much smaller and lighter. Smaller and lighter means you will take the camera with you more often and take more pictures.I wasn't thrilled about the reliability. Both cameras had to be repaired as soon as the warranty expired (2 years). Both cameras had the flash go bad which cost $90 each to fix.Then the door switch went bad on one making it totally useless. This time the repair would cost $100. I decided to buy a Canon instead.If you choose this camera, ask yourself if it is worth the price to have a camera that will last only 2 years.I strongly recommend you check out the newest models.

This doesn't even come close to a healthy bar. Just because it contains the buzz words organic, flax, and hemp does not make it a healthy choice. The sodium should be in the single digits and the sugar should not exceed 2-3 grams. To determine if it's healthy in terms of fat content, do the following: Divide the total number of calories by the total number of fat calories. If the answer is five or less, don't buy it: It contains too much fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opening book","review":"Wow! I am going to send a copy of this book to my team leader, as she hasn't figured out why she is always angry. It's because she is here until 9 every night, goes home to see her kids for about five minutes (who have \\"acted out\\" while she's been at work) and has to spend what little free time she has taking them to family therapists - who tell her she needs to achieve work/life balance, or, as she says, \\"whatever THAT is\\".I would also like to give this to the productivity experts who say companies can do more with less. I'm sick of doing more with less and I am going to use this book as an inspiration to rebel. \\"No more 12 hour days\\" has become my mantra. Woe to those who try to test me on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Person In America Should Read This Book","review":"This is something that needs to be forwarded around. We need to spread the word.MSNBC had the nerve to do a news story saying people in the US have the lowest productivity in the first world, but as this book points out, people in the US work an average of 9 more weeks than other first world countries. People who put in 10 and 12 hour work days as we do and don't take vacations are exhausted, and have terrible health and productivity as a result of it.European countries such as the United Kingdom where they eat more sugar and fat than we do, are thinner and in better health because they are not working themselves to death as we are.One of my favorite quotes from this book, is \\"Time is a family value.\\"The Mother Manifesto is is a co production of Take Back Your Time and MomsRisingThe Motherhood Manifesto: What America's Moms Want - and What To Do About It"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Places","review":"As a long time fan of Buffy Sainte-Marie, for some reason this was the one earlier album of hers that I never bought - so now, finally I have a copy - this CD is wonderful... if you're a fan, you might already have it but if not, there's some great stuff on here.

I ordered a 32 (I like my suits snug--I do triathlons/compete and understand that tight suits are good and don't have much of a chest to fit in there). I have never worn anything larger than a 34\\" in a suit (and they were not particularly tight), except when I bought a 36 for early in my pregnancies. So, I cannot get the 32 suit past my mid-thighs--yes for my height I have muscular thighs and bigger hips probably--but I have to agree that this suit is sized 1-2 sizes smaller than normal, even for speedo.I will order the 36 and see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"MATERIAL IS THINNING IN LOWER BACK AREA","review":"I LOVED IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT BUT NOW I NOTICED THAT THE AREA LOWER BACK TO BUM AREA IS THINNING.

I ordered a size up from the size I would normally wear I found it very tight but great for swimming laps.One thing that did NOT work for me was the fact that the sides are quite generously cut. If you look carefully at a couple of the photos you can see that the back is cut quite deep. I'm pretty busty, and I found that coming up for a break after a couple laps I was trying to quickly tuck things back in! I'm a 36D so I'm not even abnormally large but this suit is best for ladies with small busts. Will have to buy another suit now. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great delivery!!","review":"Delivery was very fast.
