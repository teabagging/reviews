I suppose that, no matter how bad a movie is, there will always be someone who likes it. I just am not of that ilk.I love superhero movies, and I like some musicals - but this is the first combination I have ever seen of both. The humor was \\"far beyond that of mortal man\\" (it sucked). It could have been possible to make a pretty good movie using the premise of a dishonored old drunk of an ex-superhero - but this one missed the mark entirely.If you are a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show - you MIGHT like this.

The book contains a wealth of information that is vital to the traveler such as travel tips, length of stay considered adequate for each island, flora & fauna, native foods, and even important information about crime and health issues that may be encountered. Additionally, it includes an in depth look at the culture and history of each island. I would have preferred seeing more detailed maps, more weather information and pictures of the islands, but for anyone planning to visit or sail throughout the South Seas, or if you're just an island \\"buff\\" it is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and even relevant - if you have the money !","review":"No doubt interesting reading.

Arch Lustberg's straight forward approach explains everything about public speaking from how to stand, project, make eye contact and most importantly, be likable.Being likable is a theme throughout 'How to Sell Yourself'. He explains tendencies of ineffective speakers and how mismanagement of audience perception is much more of a critical mistake than mispronouncing words. While he touches on many of the finer points of public speaking, likability is the strongest theme for me.His explanation of how George H.W. Bush and Al Gore lost elections due to the fact that they were trying to speak to the nation in a way that was unlike how they related to constituents really caught my attention. Whether or not people can relate to you is more important that projecting yourself as an authority figure. Any public speaker or salesman must own this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginnings of science fiction genre!","review":"I owned this book a while back, maybe 15 years ago, and forgot just how extensively it covers the science fiction field, both in literature and in movies.

Hocking skipped too many steps for us (\\"It is easy to see ...\\"). He often takes a geometric approach, but presents it at a level that was incomprehensible to any of us (including our professor). I don't doubt Hocking knows what he was talking about, or even that some other readers might, but it was beyond all of us, many of whom as undergrads majored in math or statistics, for what that's worth.For theory of the linear model, consider Rencher and Schaalje's Theory of the Linear Model, which is extremely thorough and clear, has solutions to all exercises, great for self-study It doesn't cover all the material that Hocking does, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things that don't work","review":"This pedometer not only counted my steps incorrectly, but it counted them when I was sleeping!

The program would not allow me to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pedometer ever","review":"I have owned at least a dozen pedometers, and this is the worst.

Unfortunately, this is one of the latter cases.I agree with others who have said that this pedometer is a little too sensitive. Somehow it counted 35 steps this morning from my bed to the bathroom, which takes me all of about 10 real steps to get to. The day I bought it (yesterday) it had reset when I bent over to untie my shoes because the reset button is so big, and the day I threw it out (today) I accidentally reset it when I was taking it off while changing clothes.Normally, too, if I'm going to write a negative review, then I'll try to offer up an alternative.

This one is a totally different design and is useless. I never found out how accurate it is, because in the new design the reset button is in front of the device so you can't help but to accidentally reset it in the normal course of human motion.

I would not have purchased this (and ultimately returned it) if I would have known that it has no cover (the picture here on Amazon shows it with a cover). Sportline appears to have changed the 330 so that it no longer has a cover. Not sure what they were thinking on that move. As it is, I was able to go to a Target store and see that they still have a Sportline model (I believe it's a 330) that looks like this picture - even though it's about $4 more -- but well worth it since it doesn't reset whenever you sit down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to throw away after two days","review":"Design flaw.

I usually wear a pedometer all day, every day. I bought this one to replace a different brand in which the screen display stopped working after 2 months. This one was priced just about right, so I bought two for the inevitable loss or breakage that comes with daily use.This pedometer might be all right for a specific walk, but for daily use, it's useless.

The film is supposed to take place in some fantasy past but the script spews out modern idioms and values out of the characters displacing them even more from the context of the story. The final scene with two women fighting against each other as if they were professional boxers was even more atrocious bringing the film down into the pits of vulgarity. The only good role and acting in this film was by Val Kilmer.Stay away from this pathetic film: it's not even worth renting.

A true classic for its genre, it follows the story of a dwarf named 'Willow' after finding a baby floating down river. Each character in the story is fun to watch, the dialog is excellent and the effects are decent as well. The film is a bit goofy but the dark backdrop made it all the more interesting. From beginning to end, you'll want to stay in your seat as the comedy, drama, and action are all well worth watching.

I don't care much for DVD extras (generally I just want the movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not very often that you see a movie of this quality","review":"The first time you watch this masterpiece, you will understand why critics gave it a bad rating.

I hope that Mr. Lucas will someday make a sequel and forget about the moron's that rate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suberb fantasy adventure","review":"This film did bomb at the box office. But I myself think this film is great. Val Kilmer in one of his early roles and at his most delicious! This film was thought up by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard and should have gone down a storm by the public but it didn't but I still like it. It breaks down as an evil queen (Bavmorda) who has been told that in the prophecy there is a baby that is so powerful that it will kill her and rule. She must kill it. The baby is born but the midwife saves it and like moses places it on a rive and she floats downstream to a dwarf village where she is discovered by Willow who then sets out to return her to the Dyganys (The large people) and on his wat comes across Mard Martygan (Val Kilmer) and Bavmorda's daughter Sorca, and two hysterical brownies who kept me in stitches throughout. They experince some pretty funky adventures with some cool special effects. All in all this a cool film so give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willow(1988)****","review":"This is one of my favorite adventure films of all time. The movie \\"Willow\\" is a great adventure movie about small Willow is who is an \\"Elwin\\" (a race of small dwarf-like people who live in a village). When Willow's children find a \\"Dykini\\"(Bigger people like you and me)child on the side of a river, he decides to take her to the village council. When the High Elwin(leader of the village) tells him to take a journey to bring the child back to the Dykinies, he soon finds out that the evil Queen Bav Morda wants to destroy her and finds himself in the middle of a great adventure that leads him through encounters facing the great swordsman Mad Mardigan(Val Kilmer), knights, dragons, trolls, fairys, and evil sorcereses.Highly recomended film.-Watch for the cool scene with the two headed dragon(Eborsisk) done by using dazling special effects a stop-motion animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"If it wasn't for hubby I wouldn't have Willow added to my DVD collection. Just the looks of it makes me think it is boring. But it is a good movie. I even find my self watching it with out hubby around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best they can do?","review":"I really wish Lucas had made a better movie than this. In fact he did, it was called Star Wars. Look at this movie and see the similarities to Star Wars. Willow is Luke Skywalker. Billy Barty is Obi Wan Kenobi. Val Kilmer is Han Solo. The two little faries are R2D2 and C3PO. And you can obviously see who the Darth Vader character is.I would have forgiven this if at least the story were watchable. Even when I saw this movie as a kid I found it hard care what happened it any of these characters. I really wanted to like this movie because I am a big fantasy fan. Unfortunately when Hollywood makes a fantasy movie 9 times out of 10 they make it silly beyond belief or so sappy that you wonder why they didn't just make a modern romance movie instead.If you want to see a real fantasy movie check out any of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Princess Bride, Excalibur or Conan the Barbarian (NOT the Destroyer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"Illegally sold outside of USA or Canada, unable to be played in Australia.

It is boring and I think Willow is such a terrible main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable","review":"From the obvious rip-offs of Lord of the Rings, the Bible and lots of other standard quest fantasy (not to mention Star Wars), to the idiotic villains, to the lame special effects (including a ridiculous two-headed dragon named \\"Ebersisk\\", obviously Lucas knew these guys weren't going to be fans of this drivel), this is a really awful film. The script is terrible, the performances range from lame to embarassing, the whole thing reeks of a lack of imagination but a determination to make some kind of fantasy film cobbled together by people (or, I guess, a person) who really can be bothered to come up with anything new. If the Ewoks were the first sign that Lucas had lost his touch, ths was the second. We should have seen the Phantom Menace and it's Jar Jar Binks sense of things coming a mile away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Turkey","review":"Willow was boring and cheesy when it came out and I can't imagine anyone but the biggest Val Kilmer fan in the world ever wanting to buy this flop.

A great part of nostalgia and a great movie on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the True Fantasy Film Classics","review":"In these days, it seems people lost total interest in fantasy filmmaking. It's a shame too, because a really talented group of people could pull off something spectacular with modern special effects and all. But, enough of my whining and on to the review. As my header says, this really is one of the truest fantasy movies around. Never does it get irritating, the characters are always interesting, and the fights are right on. As with the other reviews, I agree this is Val Kilmer's best work. So, if you're sick and tired of starships and teenagers being menaced by spooks, mutants, or whatnot, give this fantasy flick a go. Trust me, it will stick with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willow","review":"Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis star in this spellbinding tale of a village in peril, when an evil sorceress takes over the land, and the title role must leave his wife to battle the evil 'witch.'

One ofthe best adventure films of all time, Willow is a clever, interesting film of sparkling settings and likeable characters!A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings fans, calm down please.....","review":"Willow borrows from a lot of sources, in many ways more heavily from the Bible than from Lord of the Rings. The story of the slaughter of babies, Elora's escape in a floating cradle, and discovery by Willow's family is drawn from Moses's story.Unoriginal? Maybe, but it's done in Fantasy all of the time.(Tolkien, by the way, peopled the Lord of the Rings with elements drawn from European and Christian mythology himself.)Tolkien may have written the definative fantasy epic, but he didn't invent the genre. Now all of you calm down.Willow is a good movie with fun charachters and one of the best scores I've ever heard. Not a great movie, but very watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for a NEW copy of this movie but received an obviously used one","review":"Wait a long time for this order to be filled.

This movie is taken advantage of Tolkien's world, and so be it. As for myself, this movie is a better \\"Tolkien\\" story then the ridiculusly long/boring LOTR series. First of all, the what some might call \\"little people\\" look definitely more convincing than Wood and the others, the bg music r stronger piece in terms of speaking Tolkien's world. Yes, there r some weak parts in between, but I liek this whole quest of Willow Ofgood, its more charming and the pace is faster, not to mention the directing is way better. I dun read Tolkien's books because its long and boring but becuase its fun. And this movie absolutely have done a better job. The music works, that's all I wanted to point out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lame Formulated Story","review":"A seriously lame, formulated story. The entire tale is based on believing its ridiculous beginning. The scenes seem to be very much copied from many moments of the Lord of the Rings, way before those movies were made. It's a professional Hollywood film; it has good acting and decent character interaction and tension. The special effects are decent for its time. But still, by the standards of 2008 movie making, it's not a very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willow","review":"This is a great movieEven the kids can watch this movie, without having to listento all the vulgar language, or watch any sex scenes.A good family entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willow rocks","review":"I have always loved this movie.

It's a fairy tale story with dwarfs as the central characters. Val Kilmer gets involved as a flawed action hero.A great deal of humanity and compassion comes through as actor Warwick Davis tries to save a little child whom the wicked queen is trying to destroy. Some of the tiniest fantasy figures in the movie are completely unnecessary for the story and get in the way. Simplify it, cut it to the bone, and this could be a fine movie.Davis does a fine job of acting and the family values he embodies can teach and be a great inspiration to children and adults too. Everything but the kitchen sink gets thrown into this Ron Howard flick, and yet at its heart it has a sweet little tale to tell which all but gets lost in the telling. Watch Jean Marsh ham it up as the wicked queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treat","review":"This is a great movie with all the elements of fantasy ...and that includes Val Kilmer.Good for all ages but it is a bit scary sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"One of the greatest fantasy movies I've ever seen!

There are simply no similar hi-quality stories filmed just yet, with the exception ofLegendand the soon-to-be-releasedThe Lord of the Rings, but that's it. Full of unexpected surprises, Willow has even some Biblical parallels (Moses in the river basket, etc.), and it is a great fun for the whole family. No unnecessary profanity or sexual innuendos, which parents always spot in some new Disney movies. If you seek an unforgettable experience with your kids, this fantastic flick is for you.

WRONG!You gotta have plot character and the mythic element of the hero for fantasy to work and to make great movies on the subject. I wish Peter jackson would remake this cuz it has some cool things in it like the two headed dragons [did they have cgi back then??] and the devil-dog creatures and the guy with the skull face but this is tipical of Lucas who likes to spend money on everything but a good scriptwriters and a good story.

Val Kilmer actually looks excited to be in a movie...a far cry from some of his more recent performances.The special effects were pretty state-of-the-art for the day and I am wondering how they will hold up this many years later.All in all, a very well done movie. Action packed, humorous, and fine performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little People, Huge HIT!","review":"VAL KILMER. What more do you need? How about Action, Comedy, Romance, and Magic?

I usually read a chapter of a book each night but I sped through this one in one evening. Every short story makes you anxious for the next one.

I bought it after being captivated by The Other End of the Telescope on the radio. Co-writer Aimee Mann has a similar grip on me. It's a great buy used - I don't understand why this CD was so overlooked and the price is so low now. I was very glad to hear Complicated Shadows on his recent tour - it is awesome live. The title track always stops me in my tracks. I just love his versatility. He can sing a gorgeous ballad and follow it up with a rocker that can hang in there with the Stones or anyone else. And they all spring from his bottomless pit of a catalog. Amazing. If his fan base is considered a cult, they're not getting me back without some serious reprogramming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis is still in the building","review":"A vindicating return to form, all the more remarkable for the fact that many of these were old songs either not yet used or written for other artists, AND that he decided to try to recapture, one more time, the magic of making music with the Attractions.

When I first listened to it, I correctly guessed that Elvis had a hand in the production. Why? Because all the imaginative and insightful bass guitar work contributed by Ma'Man Bruce Thomas constitute the quietest sounds on the CD. As one previous reviewer mentioned, \\"Elvis' voice is front and center\\", and that too is no coincidence. It's Elvis' show after all, and if he wants to slightly sabotage its perfection by skewing the production because of his little feud with Bruce, well, he can of course. Our loss is his gain. But try this at home: Carefully adjust your equalizer to bump up the bass just a little bit, and then play a song like 'shallow grave' again. Feel gypped yet? Now you too have been reminded, it's Elvis' show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"Best Costello recording of all (except for maybe Armed Forces)...great variety, all the songs are good, no hoaky stuff, serious compositions....a treat for listeners and musicians alike....highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this Toro Product","review":"I have a Toro String trimmer Model 51932.

I am used to the great support that Sears provides for Craftsman hardware, even years later. Would that Toro had the same philosophy. Just because I've had it for a while doesn't mean that I have to throw it away because Toro won't supply support. I used to rely upon Toro, in part because they built their products in the US.

For those not in the know, the Wolde-Newton Universe chronicles the connection between almost every pulp fiction character ever created, in real-world terms, as if the fictions we know are based on a true story. This book, while centered on Tarzan, of course, is a cornerstone of the Wolde-Newton idea. The idea of Lord Greystoke as still alive and kicking today (thanks to friends and family like Doc Savage and Sherlock Holmes), and the attempt to reconcile his pulp chronicles with a real life person makes for a pretty exciting read. Farmer is always good for a read, anyway, but he is a tireless student of the pulps, and has made a strong tapestry of their characters and situations in a real-world reference. Bottom line: i dug it. That having been said, Jane's measurements are a bit hard to swallow.

Terrific for beadwork: doesn't stretch like monofilament, has a little bit of friction to its surface so it doesn't slip out of the needle and square knots don't pull out, and has more structural integrity than silk so the needle can't accidentally go through a strand and get hung up. I do enough needleweaving, gourd-stitch, netting etc. that I will easily use this up. And if not, I'll fish with the rest.It's whitish, not transparent (I make see-thru raised patterns on some of my beadwork and was looking for a really invisible thread).

Kids, teens, and adults who think this makes them rock fans, it's just too sad.Speed of Sound is terribleFix You is an over-indulgent fake cry fest for what purpose I don't know.This album is not worth your hard earned money. Save some cash, save your ears from shreiking man-children, and buy a Led Zeppelin, Who, or Pearl Jam album. THAT'S rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPEED OF SOUND = CLOCKS PART 2","review":"Well, I am glad I have their 1st 2 cds! They were brilliant! Now they are just another formulatic pop/rock/alt band with no soul. Speed of Sound sounds very very similar to Clocks from their last album. I passed on this one.Too bad...With Tori Amos putting out bland cds too lately, makes me think getting married and having kids turns great song writers into boring saps with nothing to sing/play for so they formulate their songs instead of them just flowing out due to creativity and emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me??????","review":"I think it's tragic. How can Coldplay, in such a short career, become no better then the rest of radio-gimmick radio bands recycling their biggest hits. C'mon people, there is nothing new on this album, it is completely recycled material. I expected WAY more from these guys. True, I just saw them live on T.V. and Chris Martin thoroughly annoyed me to tears with his horrible stage precense, so maybe I have a little annomosity left over from that. But really, this album is lacking and I think most people that rate this album high probably have a narrow view of music. Sorry, I dont mean to insult you, but do you mean to insult me? It's frustrating how generic music has become. If you want to play it safe, go get Ok Computer or even the Doves disk, or this guy down the street named Tom Foolery can even play for you.... whatever, this sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best band since U2","review":"Coldpaly is on their way to becoming a \\"U2\\" like band that has mass appeal in the world. The reason Coldplay is so significant and why they are important, is because Chris's lyrics that he writes are humbling and allow one to connect with the spirit. His style of writing is very much like Bono which tries to get one to frocus on the the world around them, and not the inner makings of themselves. Coldplay is on their way to becoming the U2 for the new millenium. A band that has much to say and many people listening. Thank you Chris Martin for helping us rediscover what makes music special. A truly remarkable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up to Rush of Blood...","review":"In my opinion, Rush of Blood to the Head is their best album, people had really high expectations for this cd, as did I. Upon first listen I thought it was pretty good, but sunk in after 3 or 4 listens, becoming one of my favorite releases for any genre this year. Coldplay has a weird appeal about them that can attract fans from different musical backgrounds which is hard to do these days without sounding forced. The lyrics are from the heart and the music is put together very well. The last song Kingdom Come was a really great bonus, you could definitely feel the Johnny Cash vibe. Anyone who appreciates good music should own this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD (too bad it doesn't work in my car)","review":"The CD is excellent in my opinion. The only problem, which wasn't stated at the time of purchase, is that it will not play on some audio equipment such as car CD players, due to new anti-piracy protection. BUYER BEWARE!I have a 2001 VW Golf and it doesn't play in my CD changer. Ironically, I've already put the CD on my iPod and will probably burn an illegal copy of the CD in order to get it to play in my car. Hopefully that will solve the problem.It's another instance of ill-convceived technology that creates more problems than it solves. I've read of other technology that makes CDs (such as the new Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band) incompatible with iPods. see this article on Yahoo! news: (...)To sum it up: Coldplay rocks, record companies don't. Be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldplay's worst","review":"The lyrics, utterly trite, make me embarrassed to be a Coldplay fan. And why o why have they traded in a piano for a cheesy synthesizer?What amazed me about \\"Parachutes\\" was the sheer restraint of it. It was subtle and nearly perfect from start to finish. \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was good too; although more direct and louder, gorgeous melodies were still abundant. (The song \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\" was atrocious, and hinted at the lyrical disasters to come).X&Y; sounds different and worse, combining some cheesy drumbeats, synth sounds, and lyrics with deteriorating songwriting. There are a few nice moments here, but I want to sing along again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even music?","review":"I've never heard such [...] \\"music\\" in my life. [...] This music [...]!

Now that will be money well spent instead of this piece of [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell to the hype","review":"This CD is horrendously bland. The second Audioslave CD is way better.This has just been voted \\"Best CD of 2005\\" by the readers of Q magazine in the UK. Oh dear. What is wrong with people? Rock is supposed to kick and rail against authority, it's not supposed to be something your mom likes or plays in her Volvo when taking your mewling brother to the kindergarten.Music has indeed lost its way if this is the best 2005 has to offer.But of course, it isn't the best. It is not even close to being in the vicinity of being the best.Check out, Porcupine Tree, Roine Stolt or even as I mentioned before, Audioslave for music in 2005 that's at least got heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh","review":"Barnes and Nobles played this album in there stores and I was practically begging them to turn this crap off.

THE ALBUM IS HORRIBBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwyneth Paltrow screwed up the greatest band","review":"Of course it was just a matter of time for a band to mellow out, but chris fell in love with Gwyneth and had kids what more does he have to accomplish. Remember how it took 6 months longer to finish, because even they knew it sucked. You know what I'm talking about if you bought the live cd and heard the two new songs, this is more of the same. The first six songs are painful, Songs 7,8,9,10, are great coldplay songs, 11,12,13 go back to the suckin'. I've been trying to make myself like them but there is just nothing there. There's always a good chance that Gwyneth exits this picture, if it doesn't happen soon the next cd could be worse. In ten years people will still be listening to the first two cds but not this one. I've seen them twice in concert, I will see them many more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful? Yeah right.","review":"Coldplay is the most overrated band this earth has ever met. These guys are like the Star Wars of music. Both things are totally overrated yet mindnumbigly dull.This album is terrible. The musicianship is lame. Chris Martin is one of the worst \\"singers\\" ever. No originality, no hook, no excitement is to be found here. Just a flat out boring Radiohead rip off. Thom Yorke should murder Chris (ala Varg Vikernes and Euronymous). If you want something beautiful check out Damnation by Opeth. They're metal but that album isn't. But it has passion great vocals (Mikael Akerfeldt>Chris Martin) and great musicianship. Unlike this boring pile of horses***."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2.1","review":"Earnest but trite lyrics, expansive chords, falsetto singing to convey emotion - no, it's not the new U2 album, it's the band formed in their image who are currently battling for that emptiest of prizes, Biggest Band in the World. Trust me, if that many people like you, you must be doing something terribly wrong.And anyway, isn't one U2 enough for this world? This is music to listen to with your slippers on. Anyone under the age of 25 who likes this needs to listen to something by The Blood Brothers as something badly wrong has gone wrong in their teenage years.If you are over 25 and like this stuff, don't worry, it's still not too late. Take a Blood Brothers album twice a day for two weeks and the decline in your musical health should be sorted out."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE IS BLIND AND DEATH!!!!","review":"The girl or boy saying\\"Coldplay rocks\\" is stupid!! X&Y; stinks and Parachutes is much better. Coldplay are not cool. True they do some good songs but how can Coldplay ROCK? I think she was born with a seeing and hearing problem. I think \\"A Message\\" is the only good song on the album. Every other song, Square One,What If, White Shadows, Fix You, Talk, Ex and Why, Speed Of Sound, Low, The Hardest Part, Swallowed in the sea, and TwistedLogic are all horrid and utterly unlike Coldplay. Plus, I hated what the Q magazine comments said, something like \\"Coldplay made it\\" or \\"Truely magnificent\\". Blah Blah Blah Whatever. I don't know what those death reviewers really wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC ALBUM","review":"I'm sorry to all the haters, but this really blew me away.It's wonderful to listen to on the road at night with the windows down.Coldplay has done a fantastic job with this album. I like every song individually and together as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldplay's worst","review":"Just because you liked the first 2 Coldplay cds don't think you're necessarily going to like this one. I love the first two, but this one leaves me totally flat. Not that it's a departure... it's no departure at all. Maybe their \\"thing\\" is just getting a little tired. Or maybe this is just an uninspired interval and their \\"thing\\" will come roaring back on the next cd. (Or -- and don't bet on this, at this point -- maybe next time they'll try something a little new.) I certainly don't insist that a good band reinvent itself with every new release, but these particular tracks are just a big bore, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it.","review":"i was a fan of parachutes. a rush of blood to the head was ok. and this cd just didn't quite make it. coldplay's other two cd's were uplifting, but this one is depressing.the thing that i really dont understand is that singer chris martin just got married, has a child, has a wonderful life...then why are his songs depressed? isnt music supposed to be a reflection of your inside?i wouldnt spend more than $3 on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and annoying","review":"Since I have friends who really like Coldplay, I thought I might really get into it as well. However, after listening I just don't get their popularity. Chris Martin's voice is generally whiny and off-key. The song \\"Fix You\\" happens to be one of the most grating songs since all of Celine Dion's repertoire. Most of the album is a variation of the same song stylistically and lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"better","review":"So much better than 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' and they recorded and released it so close. Edge sounds great playing his old style guitar signature. Nice to hear the Eno strings in the background again just like in '...Streets Have No Name'. And Bono... wait... where is Bono... ohhhh... this isnt U2?!?Sorry I was very mistaken...... still, a very good album. Probably the best of the year so far. I am a U2 fan and an occasional Oasis fan - this blows Oasis's new album out of the water!TALK and A MESSAGE are stand out tracks upon my first few listens here.Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily The Worst Coldplay Album So Far","review":"This album isn't terrible; it's just entirely devoid of GREAT songs. Both Parachutes and Rush of Blood had songs that demanded immediate repeat listens. Not so with X&Y. This album just meanders. The catchy piano hooks that Martin is known for are missing. Very, very disappointed. I think a lot of people really want to like this album, so they're giving it lots of stars. Read the Rolling Stone review for a second opinion.

NOTHING stays with you! The die hards will all say how fantastic X&Y; is because they can't bear to think this band might release something horrible. How could they? They seemed to be on top of the world with an endless stash of great hooks and melodies. Well, the stash has run out. I don't blame anybody for being curious since \\"Rush Of Blood...\\" was so good, but this doesn't measure up at all!Somebody was squawking about Grammys but we all know what a wash that is.

No real talent here, just studio trickery. Makes a good coaster though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"Wow....this band plays the safest, most boring music I've ever heard. 4 chords over and over don't make a song.

It's processed mainstream pop, and it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same formula, over and over....","review":"I don't understand how people are so appreciative of mediocre songs that don't have a catch, and sound exactly alike. Chris sounds the same on every album, the music is the same. These songs could have been in any of their albums. This stuff is HIGHLY COMMERCIAL, riding on the same feeling that made people buy 'Parachutes'. They will never top that record if they keep recycling their music. Meanwhile, they think they're making the next 'Dark Side' or 'Computer'. Just look at the album artwork. These guys are full of themselves. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Woe is me. Woe is Chris Martin. Woe unto all who buy this album...This album will likely mark the beginning of the end of Coldplay's success in Europe. Unfortunately, however, it will only heighten the popularity of the band's following in the U.S. This album is not at all good - it is unimaginative and continually borders on cliches and tired \\"already been done (by Coldplay! incidentally)\\" themes.I have become resigned to the undeserved success of Dave Mathews, Rob Thomas, John Mayall etc etc, all of whom use a canned approach to \\"soft rock.\\" But Coldplay produced two GREAT albums.

Well, they are certainly popular now, but I can't say that I really enjoy them. Sure, I'm sure they've got talent. But Coldplay just sounds to me as if they're trying too hard to sound like U2. I love U2, but I listen to Coldplay and it sounds a lot like my boys, only without the magic. What's the appeal? By trying too hard to sound like U2, they lose whatever makes U2 enjoyable to listen to in the process, and that's a shame, because I believe Coldplay has a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"most boring album award goes to...","review":"the hype surrounding this album is exactly like be here now by oasis....the guy who posted that is spot on, i thought it myself earlier today. this coldplay album is perhaps the most boring stinkbag of an album i've heard in a long time. i love the first 2 albums dearly, but this album drags, it doesn't compare with their own stuff and with other albums released recently (new albums by oasis, white stripes, stereophonics, doves, arcade fire, bright eyes - all great albums released in the last few months) i'm hugely disappointed...but what can you expect, hype dies and talent dwindles, they have to rejuvenate themselves somehow, and should have had the balls to try something different. through this whole album i found myself desparately waiting for the songs to end in the hopes that the next would be better...and not as long and drawn out....this album blows, except for about 3 songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!

ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME WITH A washed up boring sound and lyrics that are the worst ever!!!!IT WAS PREACHY AND JUST PLAIN BADTo make it worse I had already bought an overpriced ticket to their concert this year. I just hope they don't play too many songs from X&Y.;Overall, IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE that was created around it.Maybe Coldplay has become just too commercial"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts me to sleep","review":"Sorry...this band is a 'poor mans' U2.

Instead, these guys sound like they're sleepwalking through the music - I know I fell asleep listening to them. The funniest thing, is the biggest hit from the new album (Speed of Sound) sounds just like the biggest hit from the last album (Clocks).I'm not saying their music is bad, I just don't understand how they became a huge sensation.

First, it is painful for me, as a listener, and second, it is painful to realize that Chris Martin actually believes that his adolescent lyrics are worth publicizing at all. A junior high school student could do better. The instrumentals are promising but are crushed beneath the insipid weight of the vocals. Well, at least I can trade my copy of X and Y in for credit at my local CD store. Chris Martin and Coldplay must live with this for the rest of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"X&Y Gets a \\"C\\" (for c*ap)","review":"We waited three years for this? In my opinion, X&Y is overproduced and extremely uneventful. The edge and emotion is gone, and the few and far between guitar riffs get drowned out (or should I say Swallowed in the Sea) by melancholy synthesizers. This is the sound of the fat-n-happy vs. the up-and-coming. Save your money (if it's not too late) and buy Parachutes and/or Rush of Blood if you don't already have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"X and WHY","review":"It pains me to write that this album is overhyped, overvalued, and overdone. This will not be the last Coldplay album and this will def never be considered the best Coldplay album. With such a strong debut and powerful second record, it just seemed inevitable that these guys would continue to release gems. They just didnt quite pull it off this time, unfortunately. However, people will continue to buy their music, they will continue to tour, and they will hopefully continue to make music. Hopefully this wont be their best effort from here on in.

Six years into U2's career, Bono & Co. had already made four LPs with lasting songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day and Pride (In The Name of Love). Whereas these songs have an immediate and unambiguous message, the only message I can derive from Coldplay is that the world is messed up but let's make the best of it.The music on X&Y; tries too hard to be anthemic, stadium filler. I guess they figured now that they're big, they have to write \\"the big song\\". Despite this, these songs still sound like easy listening muzak. There is hardly a trace of the charm Coldplay used to have.If you want easy listening, buy some Gordon Lightfoot or Celine Dion.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Martin has disgraced young Apple","review":"I loved Parachutes, liked Coldplay's second album, and have nothing but disdain for X & Y. It's simplistic and boring and gets old by the second or third listen. It's waaaaay over-produced, and the lyrics sounds like they were written by a third-grader doing his first poetry assignment. There are a lot of great new albums out there, and some of the hyped ones deserve it (for instance The White Stripes). But this effort by a talented band is truly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Let-Down","review":"Where are those instrumental and melodic hooks that defined this band? The haunting, and beautifully simple guitar parts which struck you on \\"A Rush...\\" are either gone or are buried in a wall of dreary washes of sound, and the vocals drone and whine away without the resolution or glorious crescendo of the band's outstanding first two albums. Everything sounds labored and overworked. These poor guys must be buckling under the weight and hype of being \\"the new U2\\"...all those expectations. I actually feel sorry for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere","review":"That title is from the old Neil Young/Crazy Horse album, but it pretty much describes the effort here in comparison to Coldplay's first two products. I agree with others that it doesn't amaze or move me. The music is somewhat flat and seemingly uninspired. The lyrics are often weak and haven't got that catchy phrasology of the previous releases. I will continue to listen in hopes to appreciate it more in time. Some releases grow on you the more you listen. Even the Greatest Bands of all time have had bumps in the road. The key is, Can Coldplay overcome this with another stellar performance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":". . . that this cheesy, boring, Vegas-lounge effort is given so many superlatives by so many people. I can't find a single song on this album that isn't ruined by embarrassing writing or bland production. This is their \\"greatest album yet\\"? The crisp sound and sharp lyrics are gone and have been replaced with a rock opera by The Carpenters. Coldplay was always a bit overhyped to begin with, but this effort is, as one reviewer put it, \\"music for shopping malls and armpit commercials.\\" To say this cd is disappointing doesn't really come close. It's a collection of numb, lifeless, whiny songs that are posing as angst-art but only manage to bore you to death.

The bass is inaudible and the pianos although the strongest part of the band are also mediocre at best. This band got a ton of Grammy nominations because they have bad taste in music.

In my opinion they are eventghe 21st centuries version of the beatles. Parachutes was amzing, as was a rush of blood to the head, but there is nothing amazing about X and Y. I see people giving this album five stars and part of me is thinking that they are giving 5 stars because it is coldplay (imagine giving a beatles album less than 5 stars). The point is the music is stale at most times. There are some good songs, but they all sound the same. The addition of the awful synthesizer is very annoying with that outer space, borderline techo feel. While the album has god songs as said, they are not anywhere near \\"yellow\\" \\"shiver\\" or \\"The scientist\\". There is no hit songs, only a combination of mediocre and above average. I would definitely recommend their other albums in place of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&S","review":"A wayyyy-overrated, merely competent corporate band. Instead of having some bollocks and artistic integrity to find their own sound, they are trying hard to be something between U2 and Radiohead--and failing embarassingly at both. Pretty edgeless, predictable, and limp stuff. They make The Fixx sound like Pantera.If U2 was the Beatles, then Coldplay is The Monkees."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype","review":"Coldplay has a nice solid sound that can be appealing as white noise in the background. Otherwise, this album has no substance. The lyrics are very, very weak. The tone, pace and feel is so similar across these tracks that it is nearly impossible to discern one song from another. As a matter of fact, so many of the songs have the same ryhme pattern and timing that it's almost like the writer kept trying to get it right in each successive song, but ended up with a string of indistinguishable clones. Coldplay has released a couple of good songs, but there are none on this album. At this point Coldplay is surviving on hype. There is little or no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT SUPPORT DRM","review":"Sorry, I used to like Coldplay but now that it looks like they are a band that is at the mercy of a corporations will I doubt that they are still contected enough to their art to make good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"recycled 80s sounds, yet better than the 1st time","review":"Right now I don't think this album is as good as their previous one, but maybe it will grow on me. \\"Fix You\\" and \\"White Shadows\\" are definitely my favorite songs. Most of the other songs you have to be in a mood for, and some towards the end I doubt will grow on me, like some of the songs on their previous albums. Then again, as both they and Radiohead have shown, sometimes a so-so song can sound incredible when performed live and can help you re-appreciate the song.I like \\"The Edge\\"-like guitar riffs, the electric organ mood, and Vangelis/Brian Eno kind of touches. The album almost seems like an homage to U2, Kraftwerk, etc. The drums are kind of weak though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"There are folks hearing a lot of U2 influences within Colplay, and there are some... but this band is no clone of U2, and you really only hear a small amount of it...and it is all good.This cd is pure listening pleasure. I really like all the songs. I think the song 'Fix You' is a great song, and was sorta suprised to hear it as a single.If you enjoy some really emotional lyrics mixed with guitar and moody soundscapes.. I would give this group a listen to.After listening to this CD, I went out and purchased the other material as well.. the Sudden Rush and Parachutes.. they are also very good.Have fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving from X to Y","review":"In this latest outing, Coldplay reinforce their ability to produce radio songs that translate into all cultures and languages while remaining truely English.How have they changed? Production is the answer. This album sees songs that are slightly less polished and a little more wild at heart but production that trims them back into a purist form. This works well on some songs but on others leaves them a little lacking. The guitars of Buckland have been pushed back in the mix on this album and the melody slimed. It mostly works and like Rush of Blood it grows on you and wins you over more with every play.A thread of 80's british guitar rock runs through this album (Square one, White Shadows, Talk)but blends with ballads (What if, Fix you, Kingdom come) and Coldplays own classic sound in Speed of sound.I still hope that the next album lets a bit of the rough through in the mix and allows the band some space to be their own band.Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Fabulous Music... Listen to the Words!!! Very creatively put together. Love it! The cd right before this one is also fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't they mix without OVER-COMMPRESSION?","review":"What the heck is the matter with the deaf people who mix Coldplay? Being an audiophile, I like to be able to hear a clear, clean mix where you can hear all the instruments without distortion. Coldplay's music is great, but you can't hear the delicate intricasise. The comperssion just doesn't stop. I can't stand to listen to it at anywhere near the levels of other bands of the same type.You look up the people who are doing the mixes on the internet, and they are all are talked about in the glowing terms as to there credentials and expireance. Well, I would give anything if they'ed get off the compressors and give me a clean recording that I could actually listen to. I cannot express strongly enough how terrible I think Coldplay music sounds. Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It's extremely good; reminds me of Travis a little bit. I really liked the songs and everything about it. Yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good outweighs the bad","review":"'X&Y' has been hyped and touted to infinity and beyond, but the simple truth is, this album is far inferior to another contemporary release - 'Don't Believe the Truth' by Oasis. None of the songs really rock hard like they did in the previous two Coldplay installments but there are a few gems in this album. The first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", is pure pop/rock, and a very nice song. The title track is also a winner, and bound to be a single as well. \\"White Shadows\\" is a fast moving song, and probably is the most sonically pleasing song on the album. The best song on the album is without a doubt \\"Swallowed In the Sea\\", and it is easily one of the best Coldplay songs to date. 'X&Y' breaks no new ground, and can almost be called a little \\"dull\\". Coldplay makes good music, and 'X&Y' will not disappoint anyone who is already into Britpop. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay's done it again","review":"If you're a huge fan of Coldplay, you'll find this album more of an amalgam of different musical influences.. I think somehow, in a subtle way, Coldplay has tried to input some of the styles in Brit pop music like the 80s and a bit of U2 guitars.. Lyric-wise, i believe it's got a lot of ironies and cliches that Chris MArtin wants to impart to the listeners.. One great thing about Coldplay's music is that you'll never get tired of listening to its melodies.. Surely, this album deserves to be in your CD collection.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain baaaaad","review":"Let me first say I liked the first two Coldplay cds. The third cd has directly ripped off their biggest hit for \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" You probably already know that I'm speaking of the band ripping off their own harmony from 'Clocks' for 'Speed of Sound.'Not only that, but their other \\"hit\\" 'Talk' directly rips it's \\"riff\\" from Kraftwerk's 'Computer Leibe.' That's no joke, these guys are hacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"X&Y is British Pop at its finest","review":"Coldplay's 'X&Y' is British Pop perfection, a beautifully crafted but flawed masterwork not afraid to take musical risks, but alas, not courageous enough to take lyrical risks. The best tracks on the album are the ones that raise the bar of British Pop: 'Fix You', my favorite track for its emotional lyrics and music, 'Talk', for its inventive lyrics and catchy chorus, 'Square One', which has multiple layers of beautiful music, and 'Twisted Logic', with its astounding guitar chords. The rest of the songs on the album follow Coldplay's musical formula in top form while staying safe lyrically (which is strongly the case with 'Speed of Sound' and 'A Message'). 'X & Y'is ambitious, thoughtful, and musically strong, making up for some lyrical repetitiveness that gives the album its minor but forgivable flaw. It is highly recommended for fans who preferred 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' to their debut album 'Parachutes'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow up","review":"I must be missing something or else people are a bit too biased. I was really looking forward to this CD after their last one and their recent single Speed of Sound, but I have listened to it 4 times in my car and am not impressed at all. Other than the single, there are no songs that are intersting enough to want to hear over and over or (like A Rush of Blood) that bring out the emotion of it's predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe The Hype","review":"Folks, this is one time where I can confidently say that the hype is credible. Believe it. It's not fabricated just for your benefit, it's real. This album is authentic, bold, and daring. The quality of this album has been understated. This is a significant improvement over their previous works. Some of the high-brow reviewers have obviously lost touch with the modern universe if they think this album is anything less than a masterpiece. I could just imagine a song like \\"Twisted Logic\\" playing over the closing credits for a movie like \\"War of the Worlds.\\" It's got such beautiful dark, rich tones. I hope this album marks the beginning of an extraordinary career for Coldplay. They truly deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Rock and roll music for all generations.One of the best collections of good rock and roll in a long time. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music... thank you boys!","review":"You know what? Coldplay's biggest, smart-ass critics always state that their music is safe & even, sort of listener-friendly, without taking too many risks. Well, that's just right with me. Their newest, X&Y is by far the most enjoyable album released this year. Great tunes, meaningful lyrics, and swell production. A delightful improvement on previous albums, which were 3 1/2 & 4 stars with me. Money very well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great as an enema","review":"This long awaited CD X&Y is a cure for my gastric distress. When I first hit \\"play,\\" the intestinal fluids began to flow in the most soothing natural way. I especially like the song about meeting a polar bear and sheep and making them all die of boredom. Chris Martin is a lyrical genius and let's make him our polar bear soverign of white icy meleancholy. As my intestines began their regenerative glory, this album whished the bile to and fro, the perfect inspiration for my bowels. This is some of the very best enema music I have yet heard. I am a 78 year old grandmother but I think Chris Martin is hot. He came over last night and let me tell you he is such a gentleman in the bedroom. Thanks Chris from all the grannies who love the foulest of corporate rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is Good, If You're Deaf","review":"God-Four babies banging on Pots is better than this crap. Take my advice, go buy \\"THE BIZ\\" by The Sea & Cake"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album - NOT better than U2(Come on!)","review":"To the previous review. I know Coldplay is an excellent band.It's well known that Chris Martin is a die-hard fan of U2 and due to that Coldplay sounds very similar to U2(not the other way around of course). I understand that hearing your bands new album is a very exciting thing, i love Coldplay and I love the new album too.Just remember the band which takes its influence from another almost always is never better than the original.Examples of this is Oasis. They have very distinctive influence from The Beatles(Liam is a John Lennon, as we all) but i can't compare to the real thing).In conclusion, Coldplay is a magnificent band but it lacks the elements to become the biggest band in the world(job taken and deserve by U2). Chris Martin is no Bono, and they sure don't have a The Edge.Thanx."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"If you liked Rush of Blood, you'll probably enjoy this. However, it would be nice to see the biggest band in the world right now take advantage of it and make somethng besides a carbon copy of their breakthrough album.If you want more of the \\"Coldplay sound\\", this album is for you. If you want something sonically and lyrically challenging, you'd be better served to look elsewhere.One last thing on the lyrics. While some of them are decent, several of the songs are \\"laundry lists of cliches\\", to quote another reviewer. The verses to \\"Fix You\\", for examples, are so cliched and saccharine that they could give you a sugar high."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Disappointment of 2005","review":"The person who wrote the review below me is completely wrong. Coldplay's records always sound excellent on a first listen. It's when you listen to them more to enjoy the intricacies that they fail on so many levels. Predictable song structures, meaningless lyrics, and cheap, cheap U2 and Radiohead rip-off's everywhere. Chris Martin said they were going to be the next U2, but U2 won album of the year and this wasn't even nominated. So for once the Grammy's got it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"There are a few good songs. Otherwise its melancholy background music to fall asleep to. God, FIX YOU has to have the most irritating contrived manipulative lyrics in a song. \\"Tears stream down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace.\\" haha. laughable. \\"lights will guide you home, & ignite your bones.\\" \\"i will fix you.\\" c'mon, this is why coldplay is so popular, peddling this crap to the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldplay's X and Y= ZZZZ","review":"I am not the world's biggest Coldplay fan, but I very much enjoy there brit pop album. This and the new White Stripes album both came out on June 7. I looked forward to both. Both were dissapointing. But \\"X and Y\\" is worse. Songs such as \\" Fix You\\" and \\"What If\\" have absurd lyrics and lack the energy of Coldplay's previous albums. \\"Twisted Logic\\" tries to hard for the emo angle, when in fact, it just doesn't work. The only songs that are good on the album are Speed of Sound and A Message. Don't buy the album. Go on Itunes and buy those two tracks, cuz overall, X and Y is a mixture of material with potential that, together, just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Bono and Thom York poser's most trite work","review":"The pathetic lead singer of this group causes me to give this horrid review. He is nothing but a pale imitator of the pop style of Bono from U2 and the vocal technique of Thom Yorke from Radiohead. People compare his vocals of to the stratospheric Jeff Buckley but he is merely a sissy Thom Yorke impostor. The first album at least had credible power guitar hooks on tracks like \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver\\" that at least gave these commercial mass market music perveyors masquerading as artists the facade of being a rock band. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is simply a reworked version of their previous single \\"Clocks\\". The only bearable song of this guy is \\"In my Place\\" but Thom Yorke has more intensity in one of the flaxen hairs of his scrotum than this flaccid banal pop star has in his whole body."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there were 0 stars thats what it would get","review":"Coldplay is so overhyped it's not even funny. All there songs sound the same. From the annoying song yellow to now the new cd which I have listened to because my dad wasted his money on buying this cd. If you are looking for some good music to listen to Keane would be a good choice as well as Gavin Degraw people who can actually sing and actually don't hurt your ears while singing the same redundant songs over and over again. Note to Chris Martin you're never going to be as big as U2. Never ever. No talent=gone soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new CHAMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"These guys now hold my number one slot for most whinny, wimpy and downright depressing music. I don't care about what they have written before, if it was good or if it was bad. This record is horrid and that is all you need to know. Is it just me or does the lead singer sound like Bono but in a bad way, like one of his little 14 y/o screaming female fans has grabed him by the testy's and squeezed. His voice is so annoying that my 12 year old dog got up and left the room when I was playing and attempting to listen to this self-serving piece of trash. I think these guys recorded this monstrosity just to listen and look at themselves in their videos"},{"rating":"1","title":"This band sucks","review":"Im gonna leave this short and simple this band is the worst band ive ever heard in my life do urself a favor and dont give these guys any more money for their crappy music"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I didn't need Coldplay to reinvent themselves, but this is one long tired album of depressed sounding songs. Chris Martin, doesn't Gwyneth inspire you to write more poetic lyrics? I became such a huge fan after A Rush of Blood to the Head, and songs like Fix You and What If? fail to inspire me as a musician. This band is talented, but this body of work shows little creativity. I'm selling this back ASAP. I feel used for buying into the hype, and for assuming this album would blow me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The simplest way from x to y is a straight line","review":"How can being so mediocre garner such high praise?

It's so unlike coldplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Air Supply of the New Millennium","review":"If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again. They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics. \\"Lost in Love\\" has nothing on this one. I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply. \\"All Out of Love\\" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eventually Every Band Lays an Egg...","review":"so who's ready for an omelette. This just doesn't even come close to the previous albums. The whole album is about Chris Martin's voice, much like every new U2 album is about Bono's voice. I got the sense from the X tracks that they're trying to take their music in a slightly different direction, while most of the Y tracks resonated more strongly with the previous albums. I'm all for bands going in new directions; I'm just not sure this one is headed in the right direction, musically. Puts me a bit in mind of Pink Floyd, actually. When the albums just became about Roger Waters (e.g. The Final Cut), that was the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"\\"Parachute\\"s and \\"A rush ..\\" were better than this album.

That's what I can firmly say about X&Y. Coldplay is one of the greatest bands right now. This is a stunningly epic CD. Each song is a true joy and pleasure to hear. Coldplay has impressed me. While I enjoyed AROBTTH, X&Y has made me a fan for life. The music on the album continues to stay in my head day after day. These guys have really improved and deserve all of their wonderful success and praise. They are setting the standard this year. From the first song SQUARE ONE to the final song TIL KINGDOM COME, you will be hooked. The first great album of 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE it - THAT'S all that COUNTS","review":"I particularly love \\"Speed of Sound.\\"I've never cared WHAT music critics think - what they like or what they don't like impresses me not a whit.

How can this band be so popular? The singles are annoying after 3 listens. Lets just face it. This band is a really poor radiohead ripoff. Get O.K. Computer instead. Coldplay always sounds like they are trying so hard, but they always fail to make anything more than cliche. Their melodies suck. Their arangments are uncreative. They just sound straight up anoying after a while. Don't buy this unless you want to be a pathetic slave to the mass media music market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I was a little disappointed by this album. All the hype surrounding its release literally forced me into buying it and the little snippets I heard on itunes sounded enticing.I found the melodies and arrangements a little formulaic and repetitive.

The music is gigantic. \\"X&Y\\" can proudly stand amongst the tallest giants in any forest on any mountain. This is a classic. Coldplay could write a textbook on how to make great songs and great sounds. Their music is so stimulating, yet so elegant. \\"X&Y clearly came from the hands of master craftsmen, not amateurs.

There is no tension and there is a lack of lyricism found on their first and second albums. The guitars and percussion parts are beautiful, but the album doesn't push any further boundaries or explore new avenues. I loved \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head\\" so much they made me cry with appreciation. \\"X & Y\\" makes me cringe in embarrassment for these talented people in such a unenthused and idle state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some excellent songs","review":"I recently saw an independent movie called Young At Heart.

What do you Coldplay fans see in this band? I would really like to know. Is it because they are on VH1 and not MTV? Is it because they have a pianist? No it cant be. I'll try some more. Is it because the singer got his b**ls chopped off and he sounds no different from an emo singer? Or is it because they are British...yes thats it, you people like them because they are from the same nation as great bands like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Just because they are from a great country musically doesn't mean they will be good.

No matter whining, screaming, murmuring. We have a lot of great bands doing that.A bad guitarist or bassist or drummer or whoever does not mean the band is bad. There are many players who cannot play better than average playing in many great bands.Then what will it be to guarantee a bad band? Bad music.Coldplay is the most famous bad music maker on earth today. However, their music may be more \\"decent\\" than that Linkin Park or Good Charlotte make. But it is worse. Everybody knows that Linkin Park is even retard for a rap metal band. Coldplay is famous because a lot of people including those who consider them with good taste(i.e., not a highschool kid's taste) like this band.

It solidifies what we already knew about them, that their superior artists. \\"X&Y\\" is a breakthrough because it's mature, refined, and distinct. This may be their first step towards excellence. If you can get past your own assumptions and expectations, then \\"X&Y\\" can be a rewarding journey. This CD is a rare treat amongst a sea of uninspired.

They take the ubiquitous pop song and with a few simple variations, turn it into something that peeks the curiosity instead of dulling it with the same old tripe that tends to get pumped through the airwaves. This is a well thought-out recording done by what sounds like thinking musicians. It is an example of what can happen when musicians actually listen to each other and, in those moments, what the audience is afforded when they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deafening Hype","review":"I've tried to hear through both types of hype for this third Coldplay release. Yet with the media buzz, the band itself touting its (playful) competition with U2, and the full ubiquity of their music everywhere, it's near impossible to hear X&Y on its own merits. So let's say this: the lyrics are hopeless, mostly built on cliches and the ache in Chris Martin's voice (their secret weapon, I say); there is a ballad or two that will definitely light up a Bic (\\"Fix You\\", for sure); the best hook on here is appropriated from Kraftwerk (\\"Talk\\" -- best song, worst lyrics). And I think it was all a bit fresher when it was more unassuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind Of Boring - Just Not My Thing","review":"I enjoy rock and roll and I found this album and band to be quite boring. I know I will probably be insulted and such just for my opinion, but I just wanted to write a review that people who enjoy my same interests in music could understand what would be a good buy. It seems like this CD could be elevator music or relaxing, meditation tunes, but not something you could move or connect to. I have nothing against the band or the people that listen to their music, I'm just wrting an honest review. Thank You..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Coldplays Least Best","review":"parachutes and rush of blood are fantastic albums. This album is a bad mixture of U2 and Radiohead. No songs really jump out at you. the albums lyrics are shallow and the music is very bland. This was the album that was supposed to take them to the next level. the only reason coldplay will sell more albums and concert tickets because of this record is all because of hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great","review":"You know, this is an almost great CD. Their first two are a little better. This one does not grow on you. Go and buy the new Oasis album instead, that is a grower"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of 2005","review":"The songs on this are depressing, the singer sounds like a little girl, and over all this record is awful. Hopefully this is their last."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS CD IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"this cd isn't that good i don't know wheather it's because i don't like coldplay or it's because they sound like dave matthew's band (F.Y.I.)(i hate dave matthews band)\\"Coldplay you should have stayed with your song from your last album clocks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lyrics and U2 Rip Offs Abound","review":"I was cringing at the empty headed lyrics on this CD. Chris Martin obvioulsy has too much on his hands to spend some time on his end of the job, it's understandable - but just the same.Coldplay do ballads, and they do U2 songs. The pumping bass and drums, delayed guitars and melodies that sound too familiar. I suspect these guys cringe everytime they might have to bump into U2 socially \\"Hi, thanks Bono - the check's in the mail, mate.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Slow","review":"Granted I just got the CD and maybe it will grow on me. First impression, the CD is boring. I will update my review if the CD grows on me, but reading some of the other reviews it doesn't seem likely.OK, I've listened to the CD about 3 times .... IT'S HORRIBLE! Too bad because I really liked Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head. I would have given it 1 star however there are 2 redeeming songs: \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Till Kingdom Come\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldplay sux","review":"You know I'm not going to listen to your nonsense, and anyway, IDON'T need help. Coldplay doesn't rock. How can you call peoplewho come on stage looking gungy and horrid a band who ROCK?!?!Coldplay are the worst band in the world, and X&Y; is their third and WORST album, not their third and best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, grows on you, but not great (defined as breaking new ground)","review":"First off, I like this album, and can see it growing on me (as I see some of the songs I didn't like at the first glance, now like). However, its not to impact as A Rush of Blood to the Head. Why? Simply the expectations was to great for any work they would release to supress that belief. When ARoBthH came out, it was something new, something adventurous, something that had not much expectations built in, and thus turned great.Buy this CD if you like Coldplay. But buy it without giving in with all the expectations surrounding it. I will say that the lyrics are not Gold as they were on Coldplay's first two albums, but they are worth listening too if you want to see how artists change with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the same-need a little risk taking","review":"Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X&Y is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say \\"Haven't we heard this before?\\" I don't really dislike the sound, but X&Y is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"Coldplay sucks. That out of the way, the singer is a dweeb and he is so full of himself it's sickening. He rivals Billy \\"Pumpkinhead\\" Corgan when it comes to the dork factor. I read about them being \\"influenced\\" by Kraftwerk on the track \\"Talk\\". Influenced? When a song's main melody is used outright, like it is here, it is not being \\"influenced\\" by; it is \\"ripping off\\". How can a band that produces such unoriginal crud be so popular? I think it has a lot to do with hype. They're supposed to be the next big thing. Big deal. Who cares. And if this band is so hot, why can't they buy some decent clothes? I can't stand bands that have no sense of style or pride in their stage appearance. But the bottom line is the music sucks. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring play","review":"The first single's music video is pretty good, but the music are way too boring. I can't see any different between their 1 2 3 albums. Why there's no heavy band in the UK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass, but if you have a little sis","review":"While I'm not a fan, I gave this album one star because my little sister likes it. She's nine yrs. old and she also likes the music by Ashlee Simpson and Lindsey Lohan. Since Coldplay's lyrics are written from the perspective from a 12 year old, they're just her speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"X&Y = TP for my bunghole","review":"Its mind boggling that Coldplay sells records, to me. For a moment I'd like to compare the effect X&Y; has on my mind as compared to the average 26 year old girl.26 year old girl mind: Coldplay comes on the radio. The soft and pleasant piano sound fills her ipod headphones. She loves Coldplay and like a retard imagines the cute singer howling his horribly overdone songs into his microphone.Steve when a Coldplay single comes on the radio:First thought: Holy crap do I really have to listen to this damn song again.Second thought: How is it that anyone thinks X&Y; by Coldplay is anything special?Third thought: Has anyone ever heard U2, Radiohead or Dave Mathews and knowingly bought a Coldplay record?Fourth thought: I think Coldplay makes me very angry because X&Y; totally sucks donkey balls.Fifth thought: God that 26 year old is hot. I think I'll bear this painfully simplistic Coldplay album and hit on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid rock album","review":"As a dance music fan, rock music is not my primary genre. However, this effort by Coldplay is very solid. I love the upbeat songs like White Shadows, Talk, and the overplayed Speed of Sound. I do not care much for the slower songs. On this album I detect a lot of Pink Floyd influence, especially on the opening track. These guys are good and it's why everyone tries to imitate them; it is the ultimate compliment, but there is no substitute for this amazing band."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really whiney","review":"I am a Coldplay fan, but most of the arrangements on this album are very similar & even similarly whiney. I was sorely disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay just keeps getting better","review":"Who would have thought 3 years ago that Coldplay would just keep getting better? Who could have imagined after listening to AROBTTH that there was something more that we hadn't heard before? But alas, there was something brilliant hidden and waiting to surface. Coldpay's third album, X&Y, finally allows them to utilize their talent to its fullest. It provides the perfect platform for them to take their trademark sound and elaborate on it. I can't get this album out of my head. It's hard to even rate the songs individually because I think they're all 10's. Anything on the album is worthy of being called a standout. My only complaint is that the album could have ended at 12 songs. The bonus track is good, but I don't think they needed it. It's going to be very interesting to see how they follow-up X&Y. This is the first album in the past 5 years that really qualifies as being outstanding. If Coldplay ever reaches legendary status, X&Y will be one of the reasons why."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Newest U2 Album Delivers","review":"This is an excellent new effort by U2. Bono's vocals are just as good as they ever were, The Edge is creating some masterful sounds, and it all adds up to another great album. Definately a must buy if you're a true fan of U2.Seriously, what the hell is Coldplay trying to sound like? Sometimes it's Radiohead, then they have this wierd Enya thing goin' on, and this album has U2 written all over it.I expected more from Coldplay. They can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful....","review":"First of all, Coldplay is one of those bands whose albums you have to listen to a few times to like them. Anyway, after releasing their excellent last album \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\", they come out 3 years later with their new album \\"X&Y\\". It is a beautifully mastered album with lovely melodies, stirring lyrics, and the great voice of lead singer Chris Martin. Definitely listen to the song \\"Speed of Sound\\". A wonderful CD to listen to whenever you feel lonely. Highly recommened and much better than the disappointing new White Stripes album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pu@^y Rock","review":"What is the deal? These guys do not rock. This album isn't cool. I was forced to listen to it on a car trip and I was not impressed. There is not one catchy song. Nothing really rocks. The lyrics are faux deep and uninspiring. Chris martin is a tool. He should do some drugs or something. I'm sick of his supposed \\"fairy-tale\\" romance to Gwyneth Paltrow (she looks kind of ratty these days anyway). I hate when we have to see some self-satisfied gazillionaire sigh complacently about how she has found true love with some sensitive man whatever just stop it. I hope he gets caught with his pants down with some 19 year-old groupie in a coke orgy. Plus, Chris, knock it off with the fair-trade nonsense. If you really believed in that tripe you should follow through with it in your own life. In that case you should have been paid like $500 total for making this flat can of Shasta of an album. Coldplay sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold play","review":"I'm not wasting my time writing a negative review. All I'll say to you people passing out 4 and 5 stars like mints is this: Snap out of it. These guys are done unless they do a one-eighty."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anybody like this band?","review":"Chris Martin is the biggest knob on the planet, and \\"Fix You\\" is the most nauseating tripe since \\"We are the World, We are the Children.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good album from Coldplay","review":"I have to admit that I had not heard anything else than one or two songs from Coldplay upon buying this album. With great expectation I put X&Y into my stereo. \\"Hmm, this is ok\\", I thought. One week later I was finding myself listening through the album time after time. The songs are just incredible. The album does not have weak spots. Especially \\"A message\\" and \\"Swallowed by the sea\\" are extradordinary beautiful. It takes some getting used to, but after that you are sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM prevents copy to ipod","review":"The music might be OK, but everybody should noticethat Coldplay makes it impossible to move the musiconto an mp3 player. You are probably smart enoughto get around the DRM crap on the disk - but whydo you want to support a band that thinks you shouldnot be allowed to listen on your mp3 player after*buying* the gorram cd??!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THREW IT IN THE TRASH","review":"This CD is DRMed to death. You're not allowed to play it in anything other than a home stereo system CD player or portable CD player. Won't play in computers, won't play in DVD players, won't play in most car stereo systems. Won't even play in some home stereo CD players.

They sound like a very bad blend of Pink Floyd and the Moody Blues only with out the obivous talent these bands had. This \\"band\\" has no life to it's music, the same old sing song tiredness and dragging rythms, I can think of a minor band from the 70's that would blow coldplay's doors off, \\"Crabby Appleton\\" Check out Reckless Kelly if you want really good all round music of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Dissapointment","review":"I had such high expectations for this album.Power Chords and Zen happy lyrics simply don't cut it.Coldplay needs to re-evaluate themselves musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, and one of the worst albums of the year","review":"I'll start off by saying that I enjoy a fair amount of Coldplay's music.X&Y;, however, I could not get into. It lacks innovation, imagination, and variation. All of the songs are the same melodically. They all start slowly and build into a crescendo, but one that dissapoints every time. If you're looking for similar music, try Rufus Wainwright. He has a very unique voice, but unlike Coldplay has some true vocal talent, and his music starts slow and builds, finishing well. Coldplay, it seems, has tried their hand at this--having already saturated their work with acoustic ballads and piano-driven songs, it seems as if they are doing something new in the hope that it might catch on. They were lucky, because most Coldplay fans ate this album up without really thinking about how atrocious it is. Truth is, Coldplay failed miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a grower","review":"This was album was quite different to how I imagined it was going to be. When I read previews hinting at church organs, violins and the like, I thought this was going to be a very experimental offering. However, it turned out to be a natural follow-on to their other albums (which is no bad thing!)I know Chris Martin wanted to keep his lyrics real and honest, but some lines do seem a bit clich��d. This is only a minor gripe, but I do hope Chris can come up with more Bono-like cryptic lyrics next time.This is definitely a grower, but instantly catchy tracks include What If, Fix You, Twisted Logic and \`Til Kingdom Come."},{"rating":"1","title":"X&Y? More like Zzzzzzzz...","review":"I've never quite understood the appeal of this band and just have to face the fact that I simply don't like them or their music. The songs do sound same-y and I hope that it's just that I haven't given it enough spins yet. Martin's voice sounds whiny and nasally and just annoying. It seriously grates.Save your dough and just buy an old Pointer Sisters record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but this is a rehash of their old style","review":"I am sorry to say this because I like Coldplays earlier work. Unforutnatly this is exactly what X&Y; is -- a cold replay of their earlier work. Based on this album, the Band has not grown in terms of their music or the issues they deal with.I bought this album on the advice of a friend who said that they loved the band and this was the best yet. I guess they did love the band as they were -- because this is what we are getting. Unfortunatly, I was hoping to find a band that would grow and change as I have.If you want more of Parachutes and Rush of Blood, then go for it and revel. If you are looking for something more, then take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Great Band","review":"I would have to say that this CD is definitely not as good as \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" Still it manages still keep to its soft original music they have been producing. The three best tracks on the CD IMO are \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" being my most favorite, then \\"Speed of Sound\\" and then \\"X&Y\\". Overall tracks 2-7 and track 11 are all good. Tracks 12 and 13 to me are just fillers and really are B-side tracks. If you have liked coldplay before then you will surely like this. The lyrics on this CD aren't as romantic like they were in there last CD. To me this CD took time to grow on me and now I like it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to the point","review":"I guess this review isn't needed. This CD is incredibly good and lots of people agree. But anyway- I'll say it's one of those very rare recordings in which you like ALL songs... and can't even decide which is the best... May sound cheesy, but its true. Hey, I got it now, the best one is \\"A Message\\"! No, actually it's \\"The Hardest Part\\", or is it \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Brilliant","review":"The best album of the year so far, by far. Haunting, meaningful and endlessly listenable--a true must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thank those wise enough to see beyond the hype...","review":"...for is not often the case that things which are keenly awaited are such a dissapointment when they arrive?Personally I have never found musical satisfaction in this band and I cannot understand quite how others do. The lyrics are the most contrived agony, anxst and neurosis, they are delivered with the kind of howling whine that would put a dying man in pain to shame and the monotony, oh god the monotony! It's like having to go on an endless walk in driving rain with no hope of ever finding shelter, a warm cosy fire and something nice to listen to!Time Chris the misery hung up his prozac and just stopped laying his highly glossed, depressive episodes at our feet, surely he has made enough money by now to leave us all alone and pay for some decent therapy? Oh and by the way Chris, buy a manual of Children's names while your at it and best you book Apple some self esteem classes, poor kid's gonna need em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example of the Loudness War","review":"This could have been a great album but the mastering is unbelievably bad.The drummer could have a set of rolled up carpets and a stick as a drum kit; you wouldn't be able to tell, as all the drums are a dull thud, and cymbal work is almost inaudible. It's a muddy wall of sound.If they turned the compression up any higher you would just be left with a constant 2 KHz sine wave.I suspect the earlier Coldplay albums dont suffer from this problem as much, but based on my experience this is one worth avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one star worthy","review":"mostly because coldplay has some good work in their past. This is a band that is continually going to get worse until they are like U2. This band pretty much rips off U2 and radiohead and are BORING. Early U2 and radiohead are great, this band just survives by watering down what those bands did. \\"speed of sound\\"? Seriously it's like coldplay covering coldplay, poorly. One of the most overblown albums that I can remember, right up there with american idiot...the only difference is that american idiot is a good album (it just gets way to much radio play).There are bands out there that destroy coldplay in every way....go searching for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"the only songs that are good on this CD are the ones played on the radio, other than that, I felt this CD was way off base for Coldplay. I have both of Coldplay's other CD's and can play them over and over agian.....never tiring of his voice and sound. This one already went into back of the CD book, never to be played agian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the sum of it's parts","review":"I loved Coldplay's first two albums, but this disappointing offering shows us what happens when a BIG band wants to be too big for it's boots, but falls short by producing contrived and laboured songs, too pretentious for their own good.The only songs I like are, ofcourse, Speed of sound, which is a poor cousin to Clocks (which is one of the greatest songs EVER, I reckon) and that hidden track which sounds like Coldplay the way it used to sound before it produced X and Y. Simple but unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan says this isn't as good as the first two","review":"I am a big Coldplay fan, but I must say that X&Y; doesn't approach the first two albums. If you want a Coldplay album, start with either album before X&Y--Parachutes; or Rush of Blood to the Head.X&Y; does show glimpses of the former greatness, but overall it's a bland and uninspired offering from this talented group. Chris Martin already said this was their last album, so maybe they know they've run out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as everyone makes it out to be","review":"When I hear this album all I can think is that I've heard all these tunes before. Not all of the tracks are good, and despite a few semi-excellent tracks [i.e. \\"white shadows\\"], the rest of the album is bland and repetitive. Some of the lyrics sound downright pretentious to me, and none are jaw-dropping, though Chris Martin does manage to make them sound pretty.I see some hope for this band, but they've got to start being a little more innovative/original... the same formulaic rock over and over just isn't cutting it. 2/5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's hard to believe.","review":"Loved both Parachutes and Rush of Blood, but X&Y is one huge disappointment. There is little differentiation in music between songs; it's basically one long, monotonous soundtrack. In addition, the lyrics don't ring true; either completely superficial or most profound, heavy-handed cliche. I mean, is there one song or phrase on the entire album that wasn't written to rhyme? And comparisons to U2, no way, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just listen","review":"Don't get distracted by the hoopla, just let the music ripple over you. I consider the first tracks the Four Horsemen of the album: \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"White Shadows\\", and \\"Fix You\\". I predict that Fix You will become the most popular track of all. The front mix is perfect, and each song seamlessly transitions from one to the other with endings that will remind you of The Beatles, U2, Radiohead, and even Pink Floyd. Listen to the album without distraction, and you will be blown away. The playlist is weakest in the middle: \\"A Message\\", \\"Low\\", and \\"The Hardest Part\\". \\"Low\\" is an irritating U2 weak-sister song with an unbearable vocal, unbearable enough for the hidden track designation. With \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\", X&Y gets back on track with solid vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Corporate Crap","review":"A little known fact - This CD was actually reproduced. It was remade because coldplay thought the original CD \\"didn't sound like coldplay\\". I'm sure the original tapes were Solid Gold material but it probably scared the record company to death. shame for having a soul.I was a huge fan of coldplays first two records. But trust me, there is no song on this cd you'll want to listen to more than 5 times.I promise you, one year from today, you'll have forgotten you've ever bought this cd. This is not good material. Trust me and save your money, or don't trust me and find out after about 3 listens through."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fix You\\" is such an annoying song","review":"God, that song is annoying. It's just such overwrought sugary crap. I feel a strong urge to suck on lemons after hearing that song. And why do all Coldplay videos feature the lead singer walking somewhere as he sings into the camera. Man, that band is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Loved Parachutes, loved Rush. Got this as soon as it hit the stores...never heard Speed Of Sound or anything prior to the release. Absolutely disappointed!!!Their trademark Brit sound is now slagged off for something which comes across as \\"commercial sounds\\" jumbled with \\"A-Sure-Fire Hit across the Atlantic US-type mumbo jumbo rock\\". In tryin to do well in the US, Coldplay has lost their British sounding roots. This is definitely a disastrous record."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This cd is pretty good.

I was so unsure of what to expect, especially after two AMAZING previous albums, but this CD is incredible. The music is almost excruciatingly lush and beautiful. Some of my personal favorites so far are Swallowed In The Sea, A Message, Til Kingdom Come, Talk, Hardest Part, Fix You and What If. This album, in my opinion is just as brilliant(If not MORE) as RUSH OF BLOOD. I am surprised at some of the reviewers mentioning a lack of evolution as far as the music goes, but I am actually thrilled that the band is sticking to a sound that best suits them. They are growing musically, but they are remaining true to the music they play best. I am glad they didn't pull a Radiohead and go all computer techno blip noise on us fans! I have seen Coldplay live and I am looking forward to seeing them play these new songs in person. There is not much more I can say about this wonderful cd...BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"One of the few albums I own where I don't have to skip through.

Is there a more moving song than \\"Fix You\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album - Up to Standards","review":"I am a huge Coldplay fan and listened to their first album over and over again. It was one of those CDs for me that never got old and something that you could just listen to for a long time. X&Y is a good next album with some great tracks such as their single, Speed of Sound (their best song of the CD). It's a great album but I don't feel like it is as good or better than the first. If you like the first one, you will definitely still like this one - the style is the same. Just don't expect something to blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry For The Masses","review":"In an ideal world, all music would have this much style and substance. But it's not an ideal world, it's Coldplay. At least we know of one band that has mastered high art, yet found away to make it commercial and accessible. This has to be one of the most poetic and elegant CD's I've ever heard. It's quite cinematic. It's very nostalgic and has more of an 80's sound. But it's impressive coming from someone that is so contemporary. I thought everyone had forgotten some of music's glory days. Coldplay to the rescue. We should all thank them for being students of great music. In an era when most Rock bands are annoying clones of each other, Coldplay has masterfully found a way to stand high above the crowd. It's hard to make music that's truly captivating and that seizes the senses, but \\"X&Y\\" succeeds on so many levels. This album is truly a diamond amongst ordinary jewels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand Coldplay","review":"What really bugs me about coldplay is people think they're a real band. They sing off these tired sentimental cliches and people think they have substance. To me, they're no different than boybands like Nsync. They're every bit as contrived, preconceived, concocted, and \\"for the masses\\" produced. Actually, they're 10x worse. Everyone knows what Nsync is - a money making machine - and no one trys to pretend differently. Coldplay tries to pretend like their music is for the good of humanity or some sh*t. That clown Chris Martin and his Make Trade Fair B.S. It's all part of the Coldplay package. And idiots are actually taken in hook, line and sinker and buy their mediocre music. They're just another greedy money making machince. Don't be part of their target market. Don't buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was a coldplay fan since their first album was released,but maybe not anylonger after listening to the new album twice. The only word that can correctly express myself is disappointed. They seem to have lost all their musical ispiration to making any breathtaking ballads.There is NOT a single song in XY can surpass or even meet the height of the first two albums. X&Y; is more like an easylistening album than a rock album with \\"depth\\". The lyrics are just forgetable. I tried very hard but still can NOT find a highlite in it. DOn't want to say anymore.Disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Read The Amazon Reviews - Just Buy It!!!","review":"Look, this is a GREAT album. It's better than AROBTTH. The problem with reading Amazon.com reviews is that half of them are written by intelligent people and the other half are written by complete idiots. Anyone giving this album 1, 2, or 3 stars is just a moron. \\"X&Y\\" is a masterpiece. People who can't recognize good music should just cut their ears off. And those tempted to write lame 1-star reviews should stay away from meaningful instruments like computers. They were not meant to be abused by fools and hacks. Any review with less than 4 stars just skip it, because there's a good chance that the person who wrote is has an IQ less than their rating. With this album, Coldplay has put themselves on a path to greatness. But I guess it takes a great mind to recognize another. This is an excellent album. You're really missing out is you don't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"I'm a big Coldplay fan and absolutely adored the last two albums.I can honestly say that there isn't one song in Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head that I don't like.When I listened to this new album for the first time I had big expectations and was basically hoping for more of the same.Unfortunately my worst fears came true in that Coldplay have basically run out of ideas in this album.I've tried listening to it a few times in the hope that it would grow on me like the previous albums but i'm afraid the majority of this album is just plane boring and completely unentertaining.I see a lot of reviewers on this site obviously enjoy this album, one even going as far as claiming it as the best coldplay album yet.I only hope that as the singles are released and i am bombarded with them every day on radio i too will see what these other people see in this album, unfortunately i doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment...","review":"This album was more disappointing than I can even explain. To go from A Rush Of Blood To The Head to this just doesn't seem possible. But I guess it is since it happened. AROBTTH was a phenomenal album, I think most agree. But in this album, there are 3 tracks I can even remember to be somewhat good: Fix You, Swallowed By The Sea, and Kingdom Come. As for the rest, they're just kind of there.Incredibly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing pains","review":"Why the fuss over X&Y;? Because A Rush of Blood to the Head was so good.Instead of wringing our hands over the fact that X&Y; may not surpass AROBTTH, let's just relax and enjoy the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"does not disappoint","review":"I purchased this CD and listened to it for hours on end - and by the next day, I realized that I had still not heard the album in its entirety! The music is so enchanting that I keep replaying certain tracks over and over - and every time I do, I feel as if a part of me is melting away.Musically, the album is on par with Coldplay's second album, 'A Cold Rush of Blood to the Head'; they are indeed perfectionists when it comes to writing seamlessly beautiful melodies. Lyrically, however, 'x&y;' arguably surpasses Coldplay's sophomore release. Personally, the songs seem more introspective. A hauntingly honest look at life, it touches upon feelings such as love, fear, and self-doubt. Certain songs (i.e. 'Fix You', 'What If') express hopelessness yet are uplifting all in one.A must have in anybody's Coldplay collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY....for the love of beauty...REAL BEAUTY","review":"I'll be damned if any of my money goes to the maintenance of Gwyneth Paltrow's fake blonde hair.

It offers an essentially identical sound as its predecessors. Loved the emo of \\"The Scientist\\"? Now we have \\"Fix You\\". Thought \\"Clocks\\" was brilliant? Try out \\"Speed of Sound\\".However, to those who found Coldplay's past albums to be exhaustingly mediocre, X&Y isn't even worth the download nor the flexing of your mouth's musscels as you cringe to lyrics about cutting down a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine for the grocery store","review":"this is not art; this is product....mediocre generic product, at that.

It seemed fitting there among aisles upon aisles upon aisles of product to be consumed and, then, shat out the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Some bands can pull off writing slow, drawnout songs with whinny lyrics. Coldplay can't, as this is the most boring thing that I have ever sat through. The problem isnt that they are slow, the problem is they are slow with no musical creativity. Bands like Radiohead and Pink Floyd have made a living of creating slow, dark, and depressive music. So why does it work with them and not coldplay? Musical integrity, Different Sounds, brillent guitar work...Coldplay does none of that, and I am falling asleep more as the CD goes on...Try on something different then this yucky yukca mess"},{"rating":"1","title":"insufferable I agree","review":"If you are a typical iPod user who only listens to 1 or 2 tracks from an album at a time, this this CD may be for you. Taken by themselves, most of the tracks are enjoyable to listen to.However, trying to listen to the whole disc in one sitting will leave you drowing in monotony...it just all sounds the same and gets real boring real quick!I've heard them compared to Radiohead or U2. With this offering, it's just not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Stink","review":"Predictable and careful. Boring and pretentious. I agree they have some hooks, yet they usually keep playing the same hook over and over again until you feel bludgeoned, a la \\"Clocks\\"I am still waiting for them to \\"hit one out of the park\\" like they are supposed to. Maybe their fourth album will be an \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", and their fifth \\"Joshua Tree.\\" but as of yet they are treading water."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally insufferable","review":"what is it with this band? the new U2? puh-leez! U2 wrote about something, tackled issues. this coldplay mediocrity is nothing but falsetto-driven navel gazing and self importance. if I come across an album with dumber lyrics in the next year I will eat my hat. they have duped millions, and this album is the pinacle of their space-age plinking and silliness. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodic Noise","review":"Coldplay has clearly fallen into a deep creative hole. 'Rush to the Head' was aptly named as that's the effect that outstanding piece of work has had on the band. X&Y is tiresome melodic noise repleat with overdone falsetto and obtuse, trite lyrics. The hype machine is working overtime on this one, so climb aboard with the others; I did. Buy the ticket and take the boring ride.."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"WE'RE THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD\\" - CHRIS MARTIN","review":"The \\"greatest thing since sliced bread\\"?How is making extremely commercial music (which is actually pretty easy to do) & going through no evolution make you \\"the greatest thing since sliced bread\\" Chris?... another example of a rock stars ego becoming bigger than their popularityChris also said that \\"Low\\" was unlike anything they've ever done because of how fast it is.... for him to think that 'Low' qualifies as a fast song proves just how truly lame this guys musical mind is.I believe there was one thing Chris Martin of Coldplay said that I do completely agree with\\"We're just dogs yapping at Radioheads heels\\"- Save your money for the new Pearl Jam album out sometime this year... a band that knows how to do sensitivity, while also keeping their balls firmly intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparison so you can understand","review":"i can only describe this album with the following analogy:its like when you are painting, and you mix every color and you get brown... that is what hearing this album feels like. Generic, brown, nothing shines, nothing surprises you, nothing is interesting, its just brown..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails in Comparison","review":"The highly anticipated third album from Coldplay comes as a huge dissapointment. After all of the hype over it and considering how long they claim it took them to produce this album, I must say I am not impressed. There is nothing new to be found here and when compared to their first two albums, I believe they really took a couple of steps backwards here. I find the lyrics to be redundant, Chris Martin's voice begins to get on my nerves after the first five songs, and the rest of the band does not seem like they improved at all on their respective instruments. Hopefully they will take those much needed steps forward on their next album that I was so hoping for on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Actually not illiterate, just well under ten years old.","review":"In my daughter's defence, the new Coldplay CD is hugely disappointing. Muzak, almost. Spurred on by rave reviews in Q magazine and other reputable journals I gave X&Y repeated listens and almost persuaded myself of it's worth. I then played Sea Change (Beck) which I had bought at the same time as the Coldplay album. The contrast blew Chris Martin and his weary, formularic ditties clean out of the water. There is nothing on X&Y which has the power to stop you dead and and force you to listen as Yellow did,for example. This music is not from the heart,if Coldplay are now reduced to Stadium rock and the brandishing of Zippos then their moment has well and truly passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Coldplay has again showed it's magnum opus ability. I really cannot express my deep admiration for them. Their music talent is extraordinary. I promise everyone that no one will get bored by this CD. Coldplay is truly electric and I say this with my utmost strength that's in my body. Just listening to this CD my adrenaline rushes. COLDPLAY ROCKS MY SOCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPICAL FROM THEM","review":"i gave this album a chance because of it's \\"Rave\\" reviews and i wish i hadn't!!!! this is typical Coldplay, nothing different! this band gives british music a bad name!! i wish i could have gave this no stars!DONT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Like others I prefer not to say much.Not only the best Coldplay's album but most probably the album of the year.Just perfect 100% Coldplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 For Three!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This band is 3 for 3 hands down. At first they seemed like one of those bands that may disappear without a trace after their first album. There's nothing like a pleasant surprise in a 1st album surpassing second album, but now that the 3rd is hear, those fears of the vanishing band are gone! Already anticipating #4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Subjective Review Ever","review":"I'm so moved by the aural space inside my headphones that I've nearly forgotton how to type. X & Y is something else...something great that should not be overlooked by anybody with a real musical taste. Sonically different from anything they've done before, and in terms of composition, melody, harmony, emotion, it continues where Parachutes left off, though somewhere in the far future... Subjective point: Square One is so beautiful I felt tear-eyed. Everything that follows is like a real rush of blood to the head. Speaking of which, this whole review is coming from a man who loved the first album, but thought Rush of Blood To The Head fell short of great; it was very emotionally simplistic with an air of adult-contemporary. But this third effort has shown the band's true nature, and their ability to truly soar - above the same old heard-it-befores and the Hollywood reporters, above buildings and into the sky: into the X & Y."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay - X&Y: Give it Time to Grow","review":"I like the sound of this c.d. Why? Well because plain and simple it is the Coldplay sound. there's nothing really new here, BUT, it is still done well and will grow on you in time. Obviously there's the two or three songs that you would have already heard on SNL or other late night shows, but I am sure that after listening to this cd a few times through it will be just as beloved as their first two.I do wish they had tried a little something different or new, but I guess we can't complain when they continue to do what they do and well at that.4 stars for now, 5 in about a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm, not exactly coldplay's \\"joshua tree\\"","review":"maybe we should look back and consider Rush of Blood to the Head more like the close comparison, but even then the emo-coated lengthiness of the overtones of the...how do i describe these ridiculous songs? it seems every song whose title otherwise suggests a dramatic soundtrack-style masterpiece turns out to be a soppy un-original dissapointment that will forever make the band oasis' least favorite to see in concert, if not everyone's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those of you too young...","review":"...to remember a band from the early 70's named \\"Bread\\", they were a band that produced very nice, never offensive, mellow music that was pretty popular there for a while.JUST like Coldplay, except Bread's singer wasn't annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The songs all sound the same. If you like Radiohead or Coldplay's first albums you will like Keane's \\"Hopes and Fears\\" much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED.....","review":"I was so excited for the new Coldlay album to come out and when I bought I was very disappointed. A Rush of Blood to The Head was intense, emotional and deep and I don't get any of that from X&Y. I expected it to be better than A Rush of Blood to The Head but I'm disappointed to say that, in my opinion, it is not. The music is very good and it is a different sound for Coldplay but the lyrics sound like they were put together without any thought. They seem shallow to me and like they were put together just so they could get an album out. I would have to say that my favorite songs on the cd are Talk and White Shadows only because of the music...the lyrics on this cd disappointed me greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from great...","review":"I must have heard this album about a dozen or so times by now. One thing's for sure - I'm not in a hurry to hear it again). A shame as I really liked both Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood...Aside from the fifth-form poetry my biggest complaint is that the album's been produced to within an inch of its life. And, while it unquestionably sounds fabulous, the end result is an album bereft of any performance, complexity or depth.Great albums have an ability to surprise you despite the fact that you may have heard them hundreds of times before. There are no surprises here, everything happens just as it should and therein lies the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD of the year","review":"Coldplay did this amazing record. You might have heard of it. It's called A Rush of Blood to the Head. This cd, X&Y;, is the exact opposite of that cd. It's amazingly terrible.Let's compare:AROBTTH:Unique sound, XY:Sound like Sleepy U2AROBTTH:Beautiful, creative lyrics, XY:Stupid, dumb lyricsAROBTTH:Great songs, XY:Every song sounds the sameThe only good song on here is the first single off of the record. Buy the single, don't even look at the actual CD. This CD is worth no ones time and is a complete disappointment on every level. I would write more, but why? This record doesn't deserve a review, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"X&Y are next to last","review":"Dissappointment from a great group.. The first 2 albums were fantastic. This is an unenthusaistic followup. I hope they regain their creativity and performance talent on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Epitome of Mediocrity","review":"X&Y; is pretty dang close to being THE quintessential bland music album. The production is pretty-sounding, easy on the ears and doesn't demand attention. This is the perfect background music for people who are indifferent about music.The songwriting for the most part falls flat. The melodies seem to be trying so hard to be something great but ultimately fail to stand out. Probably the strongest melody line on here is the one they copped from Kraftwerk. Most of the songs are forgettable or downright impossible to remember, as they mostly sound very similar. Also, the album is fairly long for how little it has to offer. There are hardly twelve songs worth of musical ideas here.In short, X&Y; is the epitome of mediocrity. The absoluteness of that mediocrity, (ironically) is what makes it both remarkable and despicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy customer","review":"I still haven't received this item.

That is what this album needs is a track with Bette Midler, it might have sold more copies. Coldplay has come a long way since their song on The Bodyguard soundtrack, which was subpar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Absolutely horrible! I'm almost speechless. To think they spent three years putting the album together and their fans waited for *this*. It's mediocre at best, nothing groundbreaking, but wait, they never were groundbreaking. Chris Martin's voice is just whiny and all-around bad. \\"Fix You\\" is the album's only redemming song, but the rest of the tracks are the same stuff you can hear from a million other bands out there on the radio today. \\"Low\\" sounds like a cheesey 80's dance track.God, this used to be a good band. Maybe they already composed all the good music they're capable of..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No true metal here.","review":"I would never tell anyone to buy this.If you like real metal this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band should really be called \\"Empty-headed play\\"","review":"Coldplay's Will Champion and Chris Martin are STUPID!!!Plus, Miranda Sawyer in the Q magazine has no brain. ColdplayISN'T the best band in the world.This is what they need to be the world's best band:1. To be extremely cool2. To care about how they look3. To have great tunes4. To be girls instead of boys5. To not make their music so over-hyped6. To make their music far more exciting7. To make funkier tunesColdplay are sore losers with no sense of style whatsoever.And anyone who says Coldplay's the best band on the planet are sore losers! There are loads more better bands in the world! Like Franz Ferdinand and Goldfrapp and KT Tunstall!Coldplay are the worst band in the whole wide world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional, inspiring, uplifting......take your pick","review":"This is an excellent album. I didn't take to it immediately but after 4 or 5 listens all the way through I warmed to it immensely. Bearing in mind the amount of stale, re-hashed rubbish being put out (For heaven's sake, Nelly singing over Spandau Ballet samples anyone?), then Coldplay's drive to continually push forward, innovate, grow, is something special. It takes longer for them to produce the material but that's true of many great artists and I'm pleased they take their time. The emotional connection that the lyrics, music and general tone make with so many people can be an uplifting, reassuring and ultimately inspiring experience and I for one think the music scene is infinitely better off with Coldplay there. Long may they continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"When I first listened to the CD from beggining to end I was a bit dissapointed. I didn't find many of the songs distinguishable like AROBTTH was. But a week later and now i'm loving the CD more than the two previous releases and have learned to love every single song. My favorites off the album would have to be \\"Square One\\", \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"A Message\\", and \\"Twisted Logic\\". Coldplay have definately established themselves, in my opinion, as THE rock band of our time and have proven that with three consecutive albums that are simply breathtaking. Thank you Coldplay for being the saviors of rock and given me hope for the future...you guys are the BEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colossal & Timeless","review":"Some albums and songs feel dated, but everything that occupies \\"X&Y\\" feels colossal and timeless. This album would hold up anywhere or anytime. You just have to buy it and listen to feel the true impact. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Mello, Smooth sounds from Coldplay. Wonderful Cd, highly recommended and a great follow up to Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best.","review":"I consider ROBTTH their best album. Parachutes was great to...probably better than X&Y;, but in any case ROBTTH is _definitely_ better than X&Y.; This is a good album, but just not a great one. If you're looking for a song as good as amsterdam, clocks, or in my place, this album won't have it.So, if you're a coldplay fan do buy this album and you'll like it, but don't expect a ground breaking album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Disc","review":"Okay, yeah it is pretty nice, but not nearly as fine as Rush of Blood to the Head. Swallowed in the Sea is a highlight in tune, but the lyrics could have been written by a kindergartner. Favorite Song: A Message. Beautiful melody. Perfect lyrics.Fix You is quite nice as well, as is Low.Worst Songs: Twisted Logic(repetitive, tuneless) and Speed of Sound (they played it too many times on the radio)And it's funny you guys are complaining about DRM, because I bought this album soon after release (so it's one of the earlier, supposedly DRM copies) and I can play it on any stereo I want. And my dad downloaded it onto his Ipod and it plays perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like tasting a great wine","review":"This album took a few listens for me to appreciate its advances over Parachutes and A Rush of Blood, but now I can't stop listening to it. The major advances are that overall the album is considerably more epic and that *every single song* is very good, both lyrically and musically. As for Coldplay detractors' claims of influence--so what? Hearing influence in music is like tasting wine--some people taste strawberries and others pepper in the same bottle, some people both, whether in the nose, on the palette, or in the finish. Yet the wine doesn't contain any strawberry or pepper. So, if you like strawberries or pepper, what's the problem? I taste in this album everything from the common U2 to the obscure Nick Drake (and yes, Radiohead, but also even some fun counterbalance from Duran Duran and perhaps a hint of Jefferson Airplane) with an interesting range in every song that has a nose-palette-finish progression of emotions, paired with consistently formidable lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... No","review":"Coldplay definitely has a lot of talent, and prove it with a few songs. I'd like to know what happened with all the other tracks. The two previous albums were better, but you still hit the skip button too often. Speed of Sound is way too hyped.. a great song but not worthy of all the praise its gotten. Talk is good, and so is square one. and the J Cash cover, til kingdom come (the bonus track) is excellent, but not even their own really. So that makes 4 good songs, inmy opinion, out of 13 tracks.. not even 1 out of every 3.I recommend saving your money and downloading some of their songs and making a mix. Unless of course you'll buy a cd for one or 2 good songs.But if you really want to buy coldplay, or are new to the band, \\"a rush of blood to the head\\" is probably the best to start with. It's easily their best cd with the most creative sound. i'd say about half is good and the other half isn't. typical coldplay however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream Mediocrity","review":"Ah, another example of mainstream mediocrity.

And are still releasing amazing albums today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmmm....lazy risk free stuff","review":"I don't know which is worse - Coldplay's corporate risk free reproduction of Rush Of Blood To The Head or Radiohead's total reinvention after OK Computer.A mix of the two would be nice - some risks coupled with some tunes.Coldplay have opted for the safe bet and the fans should vote with their feet.Unfortunately, this is going to be a massive seller"},{"rating":"1","title":"X & Why Bother?","review":"This album is a piece of crap...I don't see how anybody could give this five stars unless they're are just as empty and devoid as this cd. I happen to like Coldplay's last two albums but the music sounds as formulaic as the album title. I thought that Coldplay would try to branch into a new sound that could inspire me more than their more deliberate commercial release of Rush of Blood to the Head but X&Y is as lively as a rotting animal curled up by the side of the highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three albums in and a dynasty in the making!","review":"Immaculate pop, cerebral pop, majestic pop, music for the soul, the moment and the celebration. Art pop, weird pop, progressive pop they are not. If you do not get it, you never will. Now I like the music so I am giving it a 5, but even if you do not, anything less than a 3 is just jealousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Compared to the band's first two CDs this is a piece of junk. There is not one single track with the kind of passion present on Parachutes or Rush of Blood To The Head. Makes me wonder how much time was spent arranging the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't knock the good stuff","review":"Let me start by saying that this album is really, really good. Yes, you can whine about the fact that some of the songs are \\"classic\\" Coldplay - but that's a good thing. After religiously listening to both their previous albums this one in a lot of ways seems like a continuation...Some whiners might say that they are not experiementing enough but why mess with something that works? And please, lets not compare these guys to Sigour Ros or Radiohead; in terms of their sound Coldplay isn't nor will it ever be in the same league.\\"Square One\\" in my opinion is the best song on this album, followed by \\"Talk\\" and \\"White Shadows\\". The current single is really good too. To be honest any one of these songs could become a favourite because they all get better the more you listen to them. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"After discovering Coldplay by hearing and enjoying \\"Rush\\", this is a big disappointment. The music sounds like one long song split 14 different ways, and left on the floor from the previous cd. Coldplay will need to make some dramatic changes to their next cd, otherwise I'll be looking elsewhere for some new music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally! a cure for an insomniac!","review":"The name of the band is like the explaination for that horrible music blaring out of the radio speakers. They are so dull that I'd probably fall asleep before I got thru the first song... The singer's voice sounds like nails on a chalk board. Truly these songs sound like remixes of their old songs (ehhem, clocks).Invest your money into something else besides this untalented man's sad, depressing, sound-like-your-dying, and DULL as sin music.The only reason I'd buy this CD is if I needed a cure for insominia or perhaps some music for a funeral of someone you hated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, nice.....if you like template music","review":"I couldn't help thinking how much Coldplay reminds me of Salieri who tried so hard to be better than Mozart. The problem with Coldplay is that they try just too darn hard... real talent is more effortless and natural. The best bands focus on their art and content; they don't sit around and deliberate which marketing strategy they should take in order to please their listeners. They have their own sounds and styles that will withstand the time. Coldplay writes pleasant music, but it's the type of sound that's liked at the moment but will soon be forgotten, like The Monkeys, like Salieri. In a nutshell, it's just not nice to ripe Radiohead or U2 music and have the guts then to proclaim you're one of the best bands in the world. In this world of mass marketing, maybe you will be \\"successful\\", but you'll never earn the musical respect bestowed on the truly talented. Sorry, but the Radiohead complex is still obviously there."},{"rating":"2","title":"sdl;fkdka;lkda;kda","review":"If I give this album an amazing review, do I get to do it with Guy Berryman? Hopefully. Anyway, this album is beautiful all the way through. I guess Chris Martin's ego is going to get even bigger. Then again, is that possible?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but...","review":"This is a good album, and it will undoubtedly sell millions of copies. Coldplay has a fun pop sound that feels tailor-made for listening with the top down on the way to the beach. Having said that, \\"X&Y\\" for all its strengths lacks in the way of originality. The album pays homage to Lennon and U2, which is cool, but I already have \\"Imagine\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\" Admittedly, what they've done here is very good, but all of it has been said and done before. And I suppose that's okay. Like Paul McCartney (a true original) said, \\"Some poeple want to fill the world with silly love songs. And what's wrong with that?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"X +Y = Ambitious","review":"\\"X&Y\\" could have easily been Coldplay's greatest hits album. There are so many memorable songs like SQUARE ONE, WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, FIX YOU, TALK, SPEED OF SOUND, LOW, A MESSAGE, HARDEST PART and TWISTED LOGIC. Any number of songs from \\"X&Y\\" would collectively qualify them as being better than AROBTTH. \\"X&Y is a stand alone master work. Really, it doesn't need to be compared to other Coldplay previous works. It operated on the strength of it's own material. It is something new, something better. Same Coldplay, but a more ambitious and eager band has shown up this time. I think the songs on \\"X&Y\\" have a higher degree of difficulty. They're performed and executed flawlessly. I can tell that this album was challenging, but they pulled it off. This was hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"and it was all mellow...","review":"I guess this is what they mean by adult alternative rock. Although I will never understand why music which can sell 20 million albums can be anything but mainstream.I kinda liked \\"Yellow\\" but found the rest of Parachutes a little too twee and precious. Now, Rush of Blood to the Head, I hated initially but it grew on me and how! The influence of Echo & the Bunnymen was strong and I loved the psychedelic nuances and wasn't \\"The Scientist\\" simply gorgeous?Which brings us to X&Y; and COldplay is suddenly carrying EMI on its back... the new Beatles, wow!Overall, X&Y; lacks the conviction of Rush of Blood, with Martin and co repeating the formula a little too often for comfort. Do we need a fifth remake of \\"The Scientist\\"? And how do you take the moaning of a rock millionaire seriously anyway? Cobain notwithstanding.So I giving this the thumbs down, it leaves me cold.

Gone are the melancholic romantic songs from the past...usher in U2. I did find the Kraftwork rip-off interesting though...catchy! But not cutting edge, and only remotely interesting. Sorry to all the die hards out there...bring back the old coldplay sound and feel and I'll return to the fray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Fix It","review":"This is an OVER PRODUCED album. I am pretty sure that the four men of Coldplay could have used their money on something a litte more meaningful than this pittiful album.

The boys should stick to what they know; and that is piano, acoustic and base."},{"rating":"1","title":"goodness gracious.","review":"chris martin, give it up already. i was displeased and disappointed with this CD. it put me to sleep; the only song that stood out was \\"x&y;\\" and maybe even \\"speed of sound\\", but that song has gotten old very quickly.kids, it was certainly a waste of thirteen bucks. save your money for an explosions in the sky CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"X&Y","review":"I was not too interested, when I first bought this disc.

I don't really have a problem with any of their music, when it comes on the radio i just sort of tune it out. Until a few days ago when the song 'Talk' came on the radio. At first I thought \\"oh, cool someone covered kraftwerk and it's actually getting played on the radio\\" but then the vocals started and I said aloud, \\"my god, no!\\" I'm still outraged that they had the audacity to blatantly rip off the melody from 'computer love'. This goes way beyond simple sampling. I have now lost what little respect i ever had for coldplay. Do yourself a favour and buy Kraftwerk's 'Computer World' instead. It's a much better album, and it's all original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye earthlings","review":"Any world where the likes of Chris Martin and his completely average band Coldplay is considered genius is a world I CANNOT and WILL NOT be a part of.

I, being part of that generation, cannot necessarily comment, but can say that this CD is worth EVERY cent. You've got your standard Coldplay ballad (Fix You) which is soaring, meloncholy, and does tug at your heartstrings (remeniscent of The Scientist). However, the new, electronically driven sound developing in the band is definately a treat. If you love Coldplay, you'll love this CD....If you've never tried them...you'll still find something to appeal to you, and once that has happened, you'll find that every song does grow on you as more nuances become evident with every listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Musically dull; vaguely reminiscent of The Cure but not as good.

Captured in this unbelievable album is melody and rhythm that are sure to bring you goose bumps. The genius lyrics that these four musicians apply to their music...makes you stop and wonder. There is not a bad song on the album, every song, I guess you could say, has its own special something. Bottom line...if you are pondering whether or not to buy this album, DO!! They have passed any group or musical act out there today. I promise, you will not be disapointed.

It takes a few spins to really come alive. When it does you will be amazed. The most accessible tracks are \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Speed of Sound.\\" The other songs may not move you until you listen to them several times, then watch out! You'll get a rush of blood to the head :) I think this is Coldplay's best album yet. Bigger brighter and packed with emotion. I've been listening to it nonstop for two weeks now and it gets better and better with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Execution","review":"This is one of the best albums ever. Every song is near flawless. Coldplay is on the right track and getting better with each CD they make.

If you didn't give this band a second thought before, now is the time. There's no way you can miss them with X&Y. Their music this time around is epic. Unlike AROBTTH which featured only a bigger sound here and there, X&Y isn't shy and goes all the way. This is definitely Coldplay's time to shine BIG. This CD is wonderful. The bar has now been set for 2005. X&Y makes good look average. You haven't heard modern musical brilliance until you've witnessed X&Y. Don't be left in the dark. Buy this great album today."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I liked the previous two coldplay albums; and as emotionally charged as they were - i found them a little too sad at times. X & Y is a whole new direction for the band. It's new age; modern and most certainly the best album i've bought this year. I found every second song to be upbeat, faster and more energy charged; with every song in between like a come down or break. I really have nothing more to say than this is truly an amazing album; i have no favourite song as i love virtually all of them. Tracks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 i found to be particularly fantastic. This album suits all occasions and can be listened to in car, home or ipod. Buy this album today if you liked their old stuff but wanted something abit more modern and upbeat.Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, ARGH...","review":"The appearance of Brian Eno seals it: we're listening to Coldplay as U2 Jr. on this album, and man... it's a crying shame. I thought PARACHUTES was a pretty decent album, and thoroughly enjoyed A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD (despite the fact that, at its greatest moments, the latter cribs directly from The Chills' criminally-overlooked masterpiece, 1990's SUBMARINE BELLS); however, if you close your eyes, and allow the stadium-sized vocals and the processed-guitar army of X&Y to overtake you, you can almost see Bono and Edge manifest themselves in your mind. I'd suggest that Mr. Martin and Co. go back to The Chills. We've got way too much U2 in the world as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome but buy on iTunes","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this CD, Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and I see them in concert every time they come to Seattle. HOWEVER, some of you may know about the Sony rootkit fiasco, where Sony installed what was essentially spyware on the computers of people that bought the CD, it appears that Virgin is doing the same thing. If you buy this CD and you are on a Windows PC, make sure, before you put the CD into your drive that you turn off AutoRun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect... for a nap","review":"Here it is! The album that Coldplay try to become U2, and Chris Martin bemoans a bunch of troubles he's not actually having. Rule #1 - you don't make lovesick music when you're married to a wealthy Hollywood actress. Rule #2 - U2 is the most bloated band of the last 20 years, and you should not model your band after THAT. Seriously, this is the most over-hyped, overrated, boring music to be released with such anticipation. Guitar riffs are repeated over and over again, and the band apparently tried to recreate \\"Clocks\\" 12 different ways for this album. Their first two albums were a great alternative to the genre, but this is just a shame. By the time I make it to \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" I just feel like yelling \\"shuuuut up\\" and smashing this disc into a fine dust. Kiss your precious Coldplay good-bye... they have become Matchbox 20 (**shiver**)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ON A SCALE FROM A TO D...","review":"I give X & Y a \\"C.\\" I've listened to it numerous times now. It's my least favorite CD from them. Every track is forgettable, extremely ho-hum. With all honesty, I think these guys have way more potential and for some strange reason they're being held back. Take older tracks Like \\"Bigger Stronger,\\" \\"Where is My Boy?\\" and \\"Your Love Means Everything Part 2.\\" This is the Coldplay I love.Don't get me wrong...they're talented as !@$% and put on one hell of a live performance.Just my two and 3/4 cents.

I keep thinking Bono's voice is going to jump in at any moment during any of these songs. I wonder if U2 is getting royalties ?? If not, they should be. Save your money and play your U2 Cd's instead -- at least you'll know it's the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horrible album! Utter and complete rubbish!!!","review":"Coldplay is a very good band. I think the best record they evermade was, \\"Parachutes\\". This album is like a bad mixture of Franz Ferdinand and Beck. I have never really listened to the songs on,\\"Blood rushing to the head\\". X+Y, this album, STINKS!The worst song on the album (in my opinion)is \\"Speed Of Sound. The song, to me, sounds spooky and scary (in my opinion). Who wants to listen to thatstupid song when it sounds like somthing you'd hear when you were at a phantom funeral in your dreams? Well, not me! On theirfirst album(Parachutes), the most amazing song on the album was,\\"Yellow\\". I really hated the first song on X+Y, \\"Square One\\". That's yet another spooky song on the album. Chris Martin's voice gets rather spooky, too. Coldplay didn't do a very good album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than OK Computer by Radiohead!","review":"There are few sounds in this world that irratate me more than the grating falsetto caterwaul of Chris Martin and the talentless hacks known as Coldplay. What is wrong with this man's voice? (...) Either that or maybe he's just been huffing helium. Either way, his voice makes for quite an excruciating listen! This CD sounds like a 2005 version of Radiohead's awful 1997 \\"classic\\" OK Computer. And I hate that album with an extreme passion that can't be expressed with words!Aside from Chris's helium voice, the music is spooky, dreary, and depressing, like something you'd hear during a nightmare. Who listens to this stuff anyway? Hearing music like this doesn't entertain me, it just bums me out! Who actually ENJOYS being depressed? That's right, nobody, so why buy an album that is more depressing than a funeral? It'll only make you miserable, so stay away from this pretentious band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"All the flap over this overrated band demonstrates the sad sorry state of music today. This extremely derivative band throws in a dash of this and a dollop of that and everyone goes gah gah. Geez. I found this lp extremely pedestrian and homogenized.

I think the expectations were that the guys just couldn't go wrong with this album -- after all, their first two were so amazingly great. Unfortunately, X & Y is barely mediocre and just downright boring. There are only two standouts of the 13 songs: \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Square One.\\" The rest just seem to blend into one another, creating a sort of a drone. Thankfully I don't think I'll ever tire of their first two albums, and I've already replaced X & Y in my car CD changer with Rush of Blood. Now THAT'S good Coldplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"coldplay not getting cold at all","review":"A pure sonic blend of beautiful, sweeping guitar-driven melodies, a step up over A Rush of Blood.

Cold Play are a total rip off of U2, same echos, same rythms, and this guy cant sing. As soon as he gets to the high notes, it sounds like he can barely hold onto it. The songs are 'poppy' - Speed of Light and 'Fix you' God, how can anybody enjoy this dribble? U2 set the standard in the early 80s and all Cold Play are doing is cashing in a very spacious market at the moment, cause there aint that many bands out there. If you like this kind of tosh, then waste your money and buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning to slip?","review":"I am a casual fan of Coldplay but I do own both their albums 'Parachutes' and 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' on CD, but after hearing many of the songs on X&Y; elsewhere I don't think I will be purchasing it. Why?I agree with another reviewer who said that Coldplay's lyrics seem to be subpar than the ones on their earlier albums. Also there don't seem to be any real memorable melodies except for 'Fix You' and just (and I really do mean JUST) 'Speed Of Sound'.If you are thinking of buying this album I'd wait until you can get it much cheaper on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"after one listen:","review":"Coldplay doesn't evolve on this album.

I couldn't believe it! Really I couldn't. Anyways, the way I look at it, if you can't be original then why be a cheap imitation of rock's greatest band?? That's what I'd like to know. The only reason that I think most people have any interest in these guys is that the lead singer is married to Gwyneth Paltrow.

If you want to buy British music, and Lord knows you have lots of your own, listen to the Kaiser Chiefs, although frankly if you find Coldplay exiting, the Kaisers might be a bit rich for your blood, you may prefer a mug of hot milk and your slippers. In a similar genre Snow Patrol are FAR superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band should really be renamed Coldplod","review":"Dear oh dear, what a mess this album is. It makes A Rush of the Blood to the Head seem original. Every single song on X&Y follows the same plodding routine, ambling along with lyrics expressing pain and frustration about the world. They're interchangable, derivative, unimaginative and boring. Very boring. A Rush of Cold Blood was not that good but I'm amazed at how much the band seems to have regressed in just two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldplay...or perhaps x & ZZZZZ.","review":"This is cynical 'bored' room music meant to secure high earnings. Martin's half yawn, half yodel vocal style oozes a saccharine sweet sentimentality that many are sure to confuse as passion. Singer Chris Martin is beligerent to suggest that 'X&Y;' is the album that will 'take out U2'. What a slap in the face to their idols.X&Y; finds coldplay teetering between a paint by numbers U2 style and 1980's Ah-ha. It could also be called, clocks the remix album, as every song sounds the same. The music is ethereal, yet lugubrious and flacid. The coldplay formula is simple and by now overexposed.There is no real growth here. Perhaps coldplay have a future mining the past, but the new music shows no growth, or willingness to create.U2... even Ah-ha need not worry, at least musically. Yodel-ay-he-hoo!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They give British Rock a Bad Name","review":"Coldplay is the least rock band of all time, how are they popular? I am a fan of British rock like The Who, Beatles, Floyd, and Zeppelin, but this band just gives British rock a bad name. The lyrics are boring and go nowhere and the music sounds like I'm on an elevator. If you want to listen to some good British rock, go buy Dark Side of the Moon, Abbey Road, Led Zeppelin IV, or Who's Next, but if you need a drug free substitute for Nyquil, then buy X & Y."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"As you probably guessed from the review title, i'm not eaxctly Coldplay's biggest fan, in fact I find them mind numbingly boring. Coldplay have a lot to answer for, not only do they clog the airwaves in England, but they also appear to have spawned numerous similar dull English bands (Keane, Athlete etc..). All their songs are pretty much the same, I mean if you had the album on repeat, you'd barely know when one track ends and the next starts.Along with the likes of Keane they somehow manage to shift multi platinum albums of boring rubbish. In England it's like everyone who is just your average music fan, likes them and buys their mediocre albums. That is all Coldplay are, an average, uninspiring band for average normal people, who happily pass away their time listening to this dross. As I mentioned earlier though, I blame them most for seemingly being the first in a long string of awful dull bands that followed.Mediocre in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"how could you not like their music?","review":"I love cold plays music.

I enjoyed a few songs here and there but none others ever really caught my attention and to be quite frank, I found them quite boring. I've only bought X&Y a few hours ago and have already listened to it back and forth at least 5 times and every song has already become recognizable and memorable to the extent to which I can sing along (or atleast attempt to). Bottom line is, while many fans of the previous two albums might express their grief and dissappointment with this album, open-minded fans and new-comers alike will find something on this album to truly enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Coldplay","review":"This album is simply hypnotic. They've taken everything to another level. It's truly masterful. Words can't really describe how pleasantly surprised I am. The music just glides. It's smooth, vibrant, yet subtle.

The idea about two people getting married, then getting seperated, changing theirs names and then finding each other, falling in love again and not knowing that they were who they were was really great.

There is no lead up or thought on either of the characters parts before they realize who the other is, it just happens.

Adams writes almost like a stream of consciousness but still coherent enough to tell a weird story. It's like if someone actually polished the art of going off on tangents.

Almost every sentence will make you laugh, and the best of them will make you think! My favourite episodes? Zaphod's irritable personality at odds whit an emotive insect, an acrophobic elevator, a soul divorced from its body and the demented captain of an intergalactic ship waiting for lemon-soaked napkins! Then you have Millyway's Dinner, the Science Fiction answer to Petronius'Coena Trimalchionis, and later, after the encounter whit the man who rules(?) the Universe, the absurd fate of Ark B!

In this installment, our travelers eventually find themselves eating at a restaurant perpetually circling the end of all existence. Zaphod learns he's supposed to find the man who runs the universe (which he eventually does). Arthur even finds himself home, back on Earth, but two million years in the past.

I feel this is the book you need from day one of working with SAP R/3 to impress your employer. The first half of the book is very easy to get through and is also easily understandable where ever you are in the organisation. However the majority of the second half of the book relies heavily on HR scenarios, which is not mentioned in the 'Editorial Review'. If you are within the HR activity this is excellent.

It wouldn't always carry a stereo signal so I figured maybe the contact points needed addressing. I tried other sets of headphones and all had the same problem. I really was not rough on the device and really rarely used the headphone jack as I used it mostly to record lectures and then dump them right onto my computer. There's no reason a headphone jack should go bad in that amount of time. I should also add to my list of gripes the fact that the user interface is not intuitive.

Their other albums are Crave and Choking on Sugar (I think this was their last album). The self-titled album by this band contains three songs - three of their best if you ask me - \\"Slow\\", \\"Silent\\", and \\"Middle\\". Though I cannot comment on the Arkansas boys, I really miss Robin, Deena, Charlene, and John. Their songs will always be a part of my life and if you've heard their music, you know what I mean. \\"Don't Remind Me\\" that they're gone! If I ever win the lottery I'm going to get them back together.I ordered this CD thinking it was a new GA-based Skirt album because of the release date (May 2001), but I got their 1994 3-track release.

The raised area on the bottom of the stand is of particular value in allowing the blades to completely slice the fruit/vegetable.

Robin Barker's book is tailor-made for thinking parents everywhere - it lays out all the options (from behaviour management techniques to sleeping to feeding), gives the pros and cons of each, then leaves the parents to make their own decisions. Frankly, I'm sick of experts telling me what I should or shouldn't be doing with my child. What I want is sensible, practical information based on sound research into my toddler's developmental stage - and The Mighty Toddler has this in bucketloads, as well as a relaxed, unpatronising tone which inspires trust and confidence. There's a great index, which means the information's easy to access in a hurry; a thoroughly researched guide to toddler development, a very useful ABC of toddler behaviour, and whole lot of other information I refer to on a daily basis. It's an essential resource for anyone with a mightly toddler in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"I am an Italian mother of a 18-month-old toddler and what I was looking for was a somehow complete guide about small kids.

Thanks to this book I've learned to observe and understand my little girl like I've never done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Although the basic developmental and health information is OK, a lot of the other information is seriously flawed. As another reviewer stated, the author says its acceptable to wean a baby at 9 months of age. She also recommends weaning a toddler from breastfeeding by going cold turkey--something La Leche League advises against. Apparently processed string cheese and bacon are considered healthy snack foods. Depending on your parenting philosophy this book may ruffle your feathers with her \\"cry it out\\" past the point of vomiting approach to getting your toddler to sleep. There are much better options out there for parenting guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by bias","review":"I found this book somewhat useful, in that it has a run down of development milestones which is what I was after in reading it, but overall disappointing.The fact that Barker says it is fine to stop breastfeeding at 9 months if you want to, despite that fact that Australian, American and the World Health Organisation's standards all recommend breasfeeding until *at least* 12 months concerned me. While there are acceptable alternatives for those who cannot breastfeed for whatever reason, her 'expert' view that to stop at 9 months is 'fine' seems misleading.Additionally, although she presents various options for managing issues such as night waking, it is clear where her bias lies (controlled crying) and she does not present any of the advantages of other systems.Basically, this book presents itself as being balanced and giving you options, but in my opinion the 'balance' is very one sided.I will not be purchasing or recommending this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could have earned 5 stars BUT...","review":"My screening test for books on infant and child health is looking up what they have to say on breastfeeding and sleep. Robin Barker is an advocate of controlled crying. I personally am not and find this technique most disagreeable. I do realise that many parents will not agree on me on this one and it certainly is widely advocated amongst paediatricians still.I was most disappointed to see the suggestiong that weaning breastfeeding after 9 months was okay. This goes against the Australian recommendations and I was wondering what Ms Barker would give an infant between the ages of 9-12 months.Otherwise it is a very thorough book. However because of these two areas I won't buy the book and I won't be recommending it.Shame, as she has a lot of good things to say about other things and her book \\"Babylove\\" is very thorough. I can't remember what it has to say on breastfeeding or sleep though, having only flicked through the book at a friend's place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New And Better Ciara","review":"This was a great second coming by Ciara. You can really tell that she has grown and matured as an artist. With the exception of \\"Promise\\", all the songs fit her vocals and style perfectly. The cd has some nice beats and the topics are very relateable.All of them are topics that people have delt with in relationships at one time or another. My only complaint would be the skits. I don't think those were necessary b/c they added nothing to the album. Overall though, this is one of the best female R&B cds out.

This is dance/club music but everything sounded the same to me and not much stood out. Most of the heavy beats on here drown out Ciara's light vocals. \\"Promise\\" and \\"C.R.U.S.H\\" are good tracks, but other than that I'm disappointed. Even though Ciara says she has important things to say in her music, \\"The Evolution\\" isn't helping to get her messages across.

Ciara though is more closer to Ashanti in terms of where she is. catchy dance pop which usually means that a newbie will come along&take over what Ciara is doing. basically a Producer's Act which as long as she can stay in her music lane she will be aight."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! 2.5 STARS!!!","review":"I'm sorry but this album was not good AT ALL! Okay maybe i shouldnt say at all but it was far from what I expected from the \\"Princess\\". Ciara is on some other sheit and change isnt always good.Let me start off with the tracks I thought were hot!!-Like A Boy(#2) is a good track, it's definitely something us girls canrelate to.-Promise (#4) of course this track is bangin! I must say in the song andvideo she has really grown from a cute teen to a sexy woman.-Cant Leave Him Alone feat.50 cent(#6) is good, but it took about threetimes of me hearing it to like it. Im really getting boredwit 50 and his \\"never-changing\\" flow. He always sound the same.-My Love(#8) another song to relate to.Some songs were ok (\\"Thats Rite\\", \\"C.R.U.S.H.\\", \\"Get Up\\") but other than that, I will keep her first album \\"Goodies\\" in constant rotation because I really dont see much evolving on this album. Ciara is my girl and I really hope on her next album she come wit it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolving Into The Past","review":"Ciara's 2nd CD, The Evolution, is very good especially compared to most recent works by other R&B princesses. The beats feel like their just fell out of Salt n Pepas greatest hits. The CD has retro 90's beats that still make you want to dance and feel in their own way, modern. She has many Janet Jackson like interludes that have her doing deep self evaluations and such. Those seem to be nonsense. The songs themselves, whether a slow jam or party thumper, are all danceable. The writting is also very strong with a few Beyonce-like pro-femist songs that take no prosoners. Her voice is still about as weak as ever but she works with that she has. Much better than Goodies. The standouts tracks are Bang It Up, Promise, That's Right (Featuring Lil' Jon), Like A Boy, and Make It Last Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, this CD got a lot of hype but it wasn't worth it!","review":"I liked the singles get up and promise and her dancing was fabulous in it, very much like janet jackson so of course I expected ciara to have gone all out, but I listened to the album and I just couldn't get into it at all. I love r&b and I love freestyle music, both of which ciara sings but it's so bland and boring I couldn't get into it at all. I have tons of friends who were gushing about the album, and I even had to hear it over and over again at a hip hop dance class I took so I thought it would grow on me for sure but it just annoyed me and is already forgotten about. Ciara is a good dancer and has the looks but that's it. She's all hype and without any substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evolution","review":"Artists seem to worship the word \\"Evolution\\" as it not only appears to be the title of Ciara's new album but also Robin Thicke's latest album. Ciara's \\"Evolution\\" is like Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\". It is somewhat formatted like the classic 1989 album. Ciara, clearly influenced by Jackson has done what she does best..make dance music. Dance music that goes hard with vocals that are easy on the ears. Ciara's obvious influence, Jackson can be recalled on the breezy Rodney Jerkins produced, Make It Last Forever. The song is one of the albums many highlights. The hook and melody is pure pop perfection. I could see this as a future single. Unlike Jackson, Ciara doesn't stick to just one in-house producer as she did with her previous album, Goodies. Ciara hauls in big name producers such as the aforementioned Jerkins, The Neptunes, will-i-am, and Sean Garrett to name a few. All of this makes for one of the more enjoyable discs of 2006.Personal Highlights include:Tracks 4-18*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl can't sing","review":"This freakin' girl can't sing. She doesn't even have an average voice. The only reason she got a record deal is because she has a nice body and can dance. This girl needs to go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album by Ciara","review":"The Evolution shows us all that Ciara's matured since her smash debut album, Goodies. While some songs on the album sound like they are in the vein of Goodies such as \\"Get Up\\" (featuring Chamillionaire), \\"Promise\\" and \\"Never Ever\\" (featuring Young Jeezy), some songs sound unlike anything Ciara has every sung before, such as \\"Like a Boy\\" and \\"That's Right\\" (featuring Lil' John). Overall, this album is a great follow-up to Goodies and will please all Ciara fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I think this is one of Ciara's best album. I love most of the songs on the album and the dance tutorial is a plus because I am not such a good dancer and I practice some of the steps. I don't think her teaching method on the dance tutorial is the greatest for people like me who does not dance but it does help a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Pros: I think Ciara is an excellent performer and dancer. I'd go see her live and always enjoy her stage presence. I like her song with Chamillionaire a lot; it's good from start to finish. I also like how in her new video, she shows off her hair length. I think it's cool when women embrace their OWN natural attributes. I thought \\"So Hard\\" had a really nice beat that I could dance to.Cons: I was not into this cd at all. It was medium all the way through. Even the dance tracks were just \\"okay.\\" The song where she talks about how ghetto she is was absolutely annoying, and just embraced the stereotypes that mainstream media already loves to glorify. Minus the song with Chamillionaire and \\"So Hard,\\" I listened to this cd completely confused. The lyrics were amateurish and the beats weren't nearly as exciting as her last cd. I'd still buy her next cd in hopes that it would be better though and balance out the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"evolotion of what","review":"never liked ciara she's cute but not much of a singer she's best known as a p popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO EVOLUTION ON THIS ONE.","review":"IT'S NOWHERE NEAR \\"GOODIES\\" EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T BUY GOODIES (I HAD A FRIEND MAKE ME A COPY) I WENT OUT TO BUY THIS ONE, AND I WASTED MY MONEY.

Ciara is such an amazing singer! She has a great voice and she uses it really well. I luuuv her music, because she doesn't really talk about sex and everything, like really, like, graphically or whatever, which is really cool.

This is not a chill in the crib or cruise down Sunset cd...This cd is more like something you get a good workout to. Vocally, she sounds better on this cd than she did on her debut album, but her songs certainly aren't better. She may have been a bit premature in calling this cd an evolution, since it's more like a throwback. A majority of the tracks have a very 90's Ghost Town DJs, borderline techno/house sound. She would've been much better off sticking with the sound of her first single, Promise. Promise is hands down one of the best songs on the album, if not the best. Other highlights are Can't Leave Em Alone (in spite of 50 Cent) and C.R.U.S.H. Overall, her cd is very redundant, she doesn't really show much depth or range of emotions, and all of the up-tempo songs become overkill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Baking Resource","review":"This is a very good all-purpose baking cookbook. All the recipes are well laid out and they are accompanied with many photographs that help illustrate all the crucial steps in the baking precess. The book uses both the British and the metric units, so it would be a great resource for almost any part of the world (as long as you speak English that is). There are over four hundred recipes in this cookbook and almost anyone is bound to find some good recipes that they love. My one objection is that book's relatively small format doesn't make it the best companion while actually engaged in the process of baking. This is also not meant to be used as a baking \\"textbook\\", so if you are an absolute beginner this may not be the first place you'll look to if you are starting to learn how to bake. But if you have the basic understanding of cooking and baking, and you are in no danger of setting the house on fire while working in the kitchen, then this book will be a great resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photos for EVERY recipe!","review":"This book uses photographs to illustrate many steps in the process of completing the recipes in addition to a (often very tempting) photograph of the finished item.Many ingredients are listed by weight in ounces and grams rather than cups, while some are measured by the more familiar teaspoons and tablespoons. This is commonly done in European cookbooks, and some consider this way of measuring much more accurate for consistant results.This book was published in London, so some terminology in the book is distinctly British, but I don't doubt that Americans can figure it out, and if you have to, you can always google to find out what you can't guess the meaning of on your own. [Like \\"What is \\"castor sugar\\"? Answer: \\"The standard sugar in Britain , equivalent to superfine sugar. It is more finely granulated and dissolves almost instantly. Granulated sugar can be substituted for castor sugar cup for cup.\\"]"},{"rating":"1","title":"lovetobakebutnowithMarthaDay","review":"Review from Mrs. Weiss: I have tried several recipes from this book and time and again I have been disappointed with the whole thing from start to finish. For the pie crust recipe the dough was too sticky to roll out or stretch. It also didn't make enough dough for the pie. Another example is when I tried to make the chocolate chip cookies - should have been very easy - but the cookies turned out to be \\"cookie chips\\". The cookies spread out flat like crepes and toasted to where when I tried to get them off the pan they broke into chips. Sooooo...

But, I have tried a few recipes and was dissappointed with the results. The blueberry muffins were bland, and the snickerdoodles (cinnamon biscuits) were hard. I have been baking for 20 years, and my desserts are usually crowd pleasers. Not the case when I used the recipes in this book. Since it was published in London, some of the the weights are measured in ounces and grams, which is totally inconvenient. Also, there is no conversion table in the book. The two stars are for the great pictures.

I came away wondering if all such videos are so poorly edited. Some of the scenes appeared twice in the video. There was little narration, and when the narrator did speak, she provided no details about the time or place of the scenes. The music made the video laughable at times.The back of the video's cover promises all new material, but a lot of it already appeared in _Mondo Magic_--a video that I recommend much more than this one. Also some of the scenes come from World War II and are obviously not new.

And they've only gotten better over the years. But, sorry Marino fans. While he can't bear blame for being without a Super Bowl win -- the 49ers team he lost to was one of the best ever with a great defense and the 'Fins often had a terrible D in succeeding years -- passing records aren't the sole measure of a quarterback. That's especially true when you're talking about QBs post-1978 rules changes that made it illegal for defenders to make contact with receivers down field. Imagine how big Unitas' numbers might've been if Herb Adderley couldn't knock Raymond Berry all over the place throughout the pattern. Personally, I'd rate Marino as the best passer and the best overall QB to be between Graham, Unitas, Montana, Elway and Favre."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video shots but questionable ratings","review":"I loved the game footage on this DVD. However, I had a problem with some of the QB ratings. I wholeheartedly agree with Joe Montana being the undisputed number 1 quarterback.

We are treated, amongst other things, to an exhaustive list of the author's gadgets (only the ones he can see, mind you, one assumes there are more, stuffed in closets) and an alphabetical arrangment of griefs with annoying cross-refernces in pure hyper-link style.(Doubtlessly to better hide the cobbled-together themes; when in doubt, arrange it all from a to z...) Little effort at sustaining any kind of reflexion on the nature of things lost, just an underlying malcontent.There are some very good pages, he would be well inspired to take the 12 best entries and rewrite the book.Perhaps what the author most regrets losing is his own Childhood Lost.

Supposedly, it is humorous, but you have to be really British or badly constipated--or, probably, both--to think so.

One thing to be aware of ,if your sawblade removal slot in your table comes out towards you while looking at the teeth of the blade(left side of table facing the saw) this won't work on that side of the table (unless you remove it to change blades). Mine is that way so i mounted the fence on the other or \\"right side\\" of the table.

This book was a complete and utter disappointment. The stories, admittedly are not high rolling, upper echelon situations or people but these short stories were down right dull and sometimes repulsive and that in itself is not from good writing. Even the best of authors can bomb out with an idea for a book or collection of stories and Sharon and Steave should have let it die on their kitchen table. Don't waste your money on it. It is an awful bore of a collection. Buy every single other book of theirs, the Millers, but let this one collect dust somewhere else but in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"So SWEET!!","review":"We used these for the birth announcement for our son.

Almost daily use. Then after 5 years it started to have problems opening. It would only open half way and stop. It always closed properly. After a week or so of intermitent problems, it started not opening at all. I had to reset it (pull power) to get it to work. Then it just quit altogether. All the lights work, it just wont open. The green status light flashes continuously.I called tech support and they say the circuit board needs to be replaced. 5 year warrenty on parts is expired. Cost of about $130 if i replace the head unit or replace the circuit board. Either way.I just expect things to last longer. 5 years is way too short for a garage door. Not impressed with Genie. Looking for a replacement with a better brand vs. fixing the old board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Garage Door Open - Avoid","review":"Purchased this item about two years ago and had it professionally installed by the local home centen. BAD MISTAKE. First, don't believe the fact that it raises the door faster than other garage door openers. It does not work at the \\"accelerated\\" speed amost half the time.Second, I've had nothing but problems. Garage door does not stop at top in the open position, lights stoped working, and wall swtich does not work properly. Sometimes the wall switch does not work at all and you have to use the remotes or reset the power.I've tried adjusting it and reading about it. I give up!

The warranty policy statement stated a lifetime motor warranty. The kicker...they really just look for any excuse to not really back the warranty. A spring on my sectional door broke about 3 months earlier (on the down stroke, door opener was not used again until after springs were replace the same day). The door was properly balanced prior to the springs failing (power had gone out in area, and the door had to be opened by hand..a true test of the balance condition). Genie Customer Service claimed that the springs must have gradually lost their tension (I guess they didn't realize I was an engineer that knew better). AND, that we should have been checking the balance of the door EVERY MONTH. Based on these \\"excuses\\" they refused to honor the warranty or offer any assistance what-so-ever. BUYER BEWARE! This is not a company that stands behind their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Problems","review":"I do not reccomend this product. The opener goes up and down at various speeds, at times it goes up or down at 4 times the normal speed and then other times it goes up and down at a crawl without even fully opening or closing.

Jack, Knave and Fool is talky and forgettable, with much of the action and drama happening offstage. The characters change little and never seem personally challenged.

IT SEEMS LIKE ONCE YOU GET REALLY STARTED THE 10 MIN IS OVER. YOU REALLY FEEL IT THE NEXT DAY! THE BUN AND THIGH ONE IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND EASY.

I WOULD TOTALY RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE ANY AGE ANY SIZE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"immediate results","review":"While I'm not new to exercise, I don't pursue it like I used to. Now in my forties, I find that a lot of workouts just don't lead me anywhere. I got this DVD out of the library initially (I own it now), and I was astounded at how immediate the results were! After a week, I felt more toned and stronger from within, and I noticed that my pants fit better. After two weeks, I was noticeably more flexible. And this is just from doing one 10-minute workout a day, 5 days a week! This DVD has really sold me on pilates. Nowadays, I put two or three of the workouts together for a longer session. But I always know that if I'm feeling tired, I can just do one segment and still get in my exercise. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortie but Goodie","review":"I love how this DVD is divided into 10 minute segments. it's perfect to do first thing in the morning to get going or on the weekend for a full 50 minute workout. the moves are pretty basic, but they'll give you a good workout when you do the whole video. I would definitely try another Pilates video by this instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I bought this DVD mainly for the ab workout - and the fact that it had 10 minute segments (I know that I am more likely to exercise if I know it is only 10 mintes.) The first time I tried it, I was saying \\"You gotta be kidding!\\" to almost all the moves. The next day I was sore but within two days I could notice an improvement. It didn't go from flab to six-pack abs, but there was a noticeable difference.I definitely recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not overly challenging; a feel-good workout","review":"I am a retired ballerina, so I demand more out of a workout than the average person. I did not find this video terribly challenging, but it features dynamic workouts that make the body more supple, capable, and deep-fiber strong. If you are looking for definition and muscle build, this is NOT the video for you, but if you are looking for a quick way to reach the deep fibers and produce a great feeling of well-being, then this video is perfect. I absolutely love Lara's encouragement, emphasis on proper breathing, and let's-get-down-to-business attitude. My favorite workout is the abs, followed up by the arm-sculpting workout. The others are simply not challenging enough for me.A great feature of the 10-minute Solutions series is the viewer's ability to mix and match the workouts into a customized sequence. Very cool. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"This is a great little workout for pilates beginners.

Lara's \\"Rapid Results\\" dvd is just as good, and I actually like the legs and total body segments better on that one.

I have lost inches around my waist, hips, thighs and gained strength in my back and upper body. I have been using it for a few months now, about 20-30 minutes a day (a few times a week) and it really works. Just follow along, Lara is really easy to understand and you will see the results after a few weeks. Definitely do this, it works for beginners like me! I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK But not for beginners","review":"I suppose this workout is okay for someone already in fairly good shape, but for anyone overweight most of the exercises are almost impossible to do. Most of the exercises require that you be able to bend really well and if you are overweight and trying to get in shape you should start with something else that doesn't require this amount of flexibility. It would have helped to nost waste money if they had said this was not meant for overweight people or beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel That Burn!","review":"I have been using this video as my main method of exercise when I'm feeling especially lazy. It can't get any easier than 10 minute workouts in your living room! What I love best about this is the ability to customize the workouts; I can do just one, up to all of them, in the order I want. When the exercise feels overwhelming, you can keep going knowing there's mo more than 10 minutes left, so the \\"light at the end of the tunnel\\" mentality is a great incentive not to give up. You can even repeat one of the workouts if you really want to get that area going (cough buns and thighs cough). I plan on buying more of these, just to switch it up and keep my body on its toes (and I mean that mostly literally). Lara is a great leader as well, very encouraging with a great energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This workout is not for beginners or, in my opinion, people with bad backs or neck.The instructor suggests starting with the workout for abs if the viewer is new to Pilates and also mentions that she will have modifications throughout. She starts off with some fairly challenging exercises (which is fine) but doesn't really offer any modifications beyond \\"bend your knees a little more\\" or \\"make sure your back doesn't arch\\". Towards the end of the ab workout she moves on to very challenging exercises that I found impossible to do without wrenching something important. I'm sure the workout is great for someone more advanced and familiar with Pilates, but it seems just too easy to get hurt as a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pilates DVD!","review":"I have a few 10 Minute Solutions and other exercise DVDs but this is one of my favorites.

You call do all the 10 min sessions which is 50 min without feeling like you have worked out that long. It goes by quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective for body/Efficient for time","review":"Great exercise DVD that concentrates on all the problem areas. If you do the entire program, it'll last 51 minutes. If you don't have that much time, you can break it down to those segments that interest you. If there is certain part of the exercise that you simply cannot do, RELAX, and do it up to the point that you can. Keep at it and you will surprise yourself by being able to do it one day. Always listen to your body. This DVD involves hand weights as well. I love it that Lara Hudson also concentrates on the biceps and triceps. Great all around exercise program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"This dvd is just what I was hoping for it to be. I can do ten minutes if I'm short on time or the whole set if I desire. Plus the sessions are succinct; Lara doesn't waste time talking and dives right in. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, mediocre execution","review":"I have been taking pilates classes (mat and reformer) for over four years, and during that time have become familiar with several different pilates instructors and techniques. I purchased this video because of my travel schedule -- I like the concept of ten-minute increments. Although I did sweat, I was quickly annoyed by the instructor's ditsy voice, and her demeanor struck me as unnatural and contrived. I also felt like form was not well emphasized, despite the fact that it is the key to getting results in pilates. All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but it doesn't add much to an ever-increasing collection of pilates videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Variations","review":"The 10 Minute Solution Pilates video doesn't represent the method Joseph Pilates created. Joseph Pilates taught people to workout their entire body because health and well-being come from using your mind, body and spirit. Joseph Pilates did not separate workouts for different parts of the body. For example, he did not say, \\"Here is Pilates for abs,\\" \\"Here is Pilates for thighs,\\" or \\"Here is Pilates for back.\\" He created a holistic system. Try Complete Pilates for Everyone or Classical Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I must have gotten the wrong DVD!!!","review":"I have this DVD at home & in my opinion, I THINK IT SUCKS!!!!I have several other pilates videos & it just wasnt long or challenging enough.

If you value your money dont buy this DVD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back In The Day","review":"I have been teaching Pilates since the early 1970s. I was fortunate enough to study with Joseph Pilates in the 1960s. Joseph Pilates would be happy to know his method of exercise is so popular. But he would not be happy about all the ways people change his method and lifelong dedication to helping people stay healthy. Joseph Pilates created a fascinating and complicated technique of body conditioning. And I never saw him teach a person for 10 minutes. 10 minutes would never be enough. Innovation can be helpful but not in this situation. For me, the traditional Pilates method can never be improved upon because it's too sophisticated and too complete. Please, no yoga-lates no bal-lates no aqua-lates no others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This","review":"Great for Moms with little time. The arm workout is my favorite; great challenge. I also love the stretch workout at the end of the day. The DVD is quick to load, and you can easily bypass all of the intro screens. Each of the 5 workouts is almost exactly 10 minutes long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, now what","review":"I bought this DVD a while ago. I really enjoy that there is motivational instruction without sounding like Richard Simmons. I did a 30 minutes routine 5 days a week that included stretching, abs, and thighs, along with cadio of sometype and got amazing results. My husband even noticed and there are bikini picutres I am not ashamed to show people. The only down side is there is no next step. After a while i got bored with the routine and wanted to move up a level. What to do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough on Tummies!","review":"Lara Hudson really knows how to work those abs! I have been doing her ab workout every other day for a while now and I'm still feeling the burn! I utilize the ab workout the most. She also offers some equally challenging thigh and buns exercises that I love. My only complaint about this dvd is that, though it may be fairly tough on your problem areas, Lara is not really a motivational trainer. She's rather generic personality-wise and I can't help but find myself drawn to other trainers who are more lively and humorous (i.e. Denise Austin). And believe me, a good trainer makes all the difference in your own desire to stick with your workout routine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great workout with an excellent teacher!","review":"I found this DVD at Best Buy and thought why not, I've been wanting to try out Pilates now that it's so popular. Wow, was I surprised as to how hard it worked me out. I was sweating and my muscles were burning, but I felt great afterwards. Now I know why so many people love this type of workout. The teacher, Lara Hudson, does an incredible job of instructing someone like me (a beginner), yet it was really challenging. She shows different levels of the exercises for different levels of experience. I also love the fact that I can change the order of the workouts. It keeps it new every morning I do the routines.

Many reviewers say \\"great reference\\" or something of the sort. But this book is a *foundational* text. It's not a book for mathematicians or a mathematically mature reader -- they should already own the techniques presented here. A book of this kind should be suitable for self study and this book fails in that department. Given the amount of math it assumes, I would imagine those at that level are already fairly assimilated to proofs and the like. Hence my critique that the level and function is confused. Note also that this book is *expensive*.If you want a book on problem solving, go with Zeitz or Engel, or something of \\"olympiad\\" character.

Although recorded live, the sharpness, sound quality and the recording in general could have been much better.The Leningrad Cowboys have better video on You Tube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting selection; difficult references","review":"The introduction to this book states that \\"learning to read a foreign language means learning how to understand texts that are aimed at native speakers and therefore take for granted references, contexts, and levels of understanding that are mysterious to foreigners.\\" In other words, this is not a book with selections written for students of Italian. I have been living in Italy & studying Italian for a year and have a decent command of the language. Even so, I have difficulty with the references in this book, especially in the many poetry selections. I think this book would be even more frustrating for someone who has not spent considerable time in-country. It is NOT written at a beginner level or aimed at casual students of the language. Furthermore, I found the selections rather boring reading. If I had it do over again, I would buy one of the short-story books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"This substandard instrument of torture--oops! I mean of language instruction--is the worst Italian reader I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty of them over the years in my capacity as a high-school teacher of Italian. I used it once with my most advanced students and will never again inflict it on another human being. But it does have some value as a reference book; for example, if you want a list of acronyms of Italian government agencies, go to page 114. Now, you do crave a list of acronyms of Italian government agencies, don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"The CD was excellent.

After reading the note from Asprin, I got a feeling of dread, but I will get to that in a bit.The first part of the book was a little difficult to get into. The cliffhanger from the last book was not addressed until the last quarter of the book, which added a little confusion. Overall it was an OK Myth story. When you get back to the last quarter you really get the feeling of a MYTH story. But once you got used to being back in the MYTH groove Asprin throws you. I am not sure what his intent is. Is this the last MYTH book? I would really be disappointed if this is true. I really did not care for the ending. It leaves options open, but you get the feeling that this is the last Myth Book. I hope this is not the case.For us diehard Myth fans this is a good read, but for the most part is not a typical MYTH book. Hopefully this will be a new beginning like Asprin hinted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but disappointing","review":"After so much time, to write such a brief standalone book which is to be concurrent with Sweet Myth-tery of Life was a mistake. The story here should've been included in that volume. It wasn't a bad story; it just doesn't belong as a separate entity. And the proofreading/editing was horrific! On the other hand, after the jibes I've taken regarding my own self-edited novel, this mess makes me feel better in a left-handed way. I hope Mr. Asprin and his publisher get their acts together for M.Y.T.H. Inc.'s future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Waited a long time for this book. Not even up to the standard of Mythion Improbable, which I thought was a decent, lightish story in the MYTH series tradition. However, this book was a complete let down.

Oh well..David"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Myth Inc.","review":"The something missing was a story. The book appears to be an outline that wound up being published. The only part of the story that had any meat was uninteresting and the rest was unsatisfying.It appears that Mr. Asprin was only going through the motions to complete his contract for this book. Mr. Asprin's writer block was very obvious and the only good comment is that he at least tried to meet his commitment.The book was long delayed (it even wasn't available in September as it was advertised) and should have remained Mything in Action.Since you don't allow 0 starts, this had to be rated 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad ending to such a good beginning...","review":"This series started off so well!

There is a plot, but I use the word loosely, since I've seen sitcoms with more depth. What conflict exists in the book is resolved with minimal effort or description. Very sad. I enjoyed every other book in this series, but with this last one it was almost as if the author wanted it to be over with and dashed this off to fulfill contractual obligations. I kick myself for not just checking this out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! That was painful.","review":"Very disappointing conclusion to the series. The story meandered for a short time and then just gave up.

However it has some of the worst editing of all time. There are HORRIBLE grammar errors (it's/its and you're/your and to/too) as well as spelling errors, numerous typesetting errors and so forth. It's bloody horrendous and reading it is impossible because you'll be so distracted by that.As for the book, it starts of well, ends well, but the problem is everything in the middle. It wanders, rambles, and deviates finally remembering it's a book with a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was really dissapointing","review":"Both I and my son have been great fans of the Myth series for some time and were eagerly anticipating this book. Unfortunately, there was little plot, action, or character development. It reminded me of someone getting tired of reading to a sleepy kid and saying \\"and they all lived happily ever after the end\\" and snapping the book shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have had several water feeders over the years and this one I like the least. The water container comes in two pieces it has a lid that has to be snapped on in 5 places. The snapping takes significant force. I have to hit hard with the palm of my hand in all 5 places to ensure I get the \\"click\\" \\"snap\\" sound. If you don't make sure you hear that click and snap in all five places there is good chance the lid will come off when you turn it over. I turn mine over the sink to be safe but the point is that this feeder takes more effort and work to fill than it should. As I said I have used others over the years that were much less effort and potential for water spills that this. They were easy to fill. So get something else is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this CD intending to play it as my guests arrived at my home.

His best work will be found in his music, not here.I had expected a lot more in this compillation of poetry.Don't missunderstan me, I love the artis and his music. I was just expecting more dept and originallity in the poetry. I think I will stick to the music as his best work! Long live Tupac Shakur!!He gets two stars because I did like the very last poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad","review":"Almost 3 stars. Worth its purchase price.It shows the original poem (as it was written by him) on one page, then the typed one on the next.

No doubt this book will be enjoyed by many in years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I have a lot of respect and admiration for the late Tupac Shakur, and he's actually one of my favorite rap artists, though, admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of rap. Unfortunately, this book of poems does not serve him any justice. He did write these during his teens so he may not have found his voice or his calling quite yet, so that's understandable, but the poems themselves are basically cliches written in the syntax and spelling of most rap artists. This book is mainly for die hard fans of 2Pac or completists who are doing research or whatever. Other than that, get one of his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I purchased this book as a gift and the person has been thanking me ever since ... so I can only assume that it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Poetry","review":"This book is filled with very beautiful,thoughtful, stirring poetry.

Lesane Parish Crooks 1971-1996"},{"rating":"2","title":"For 2pac","review":"I was already a massive 2Pac fan, but after reading this book I found greater appreciation for this late genius. Tupac Amaru Shakur is a well known musical artist, but a seldom appreciated human being. This collection of poems brings to light his genius and in my opinion sets him among the greatest thinkers of all time. It is unfortunate that he was not and is still not listened to and appreciated. His work is not massively influential because many people dismiss his work on face value. He never sought the media's approval and has remained a true gem for true thinkers around the world. Sit back with your favorite 2Pac tracks playing and read these poems, it will prove to be a great experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Rose","review":"I purchase the book to use in my literature class. I have not had the chance to use it in class yet but I know my students are going to love it. I know Tupac was a creative artist and whatever he did stood out. His poems are no different, his word choice helps capture the readers imagination and allows the reader to empathize/sympathize with him. I recommend it for any one who questions what it takes to be a rapper/story teller. This will clearly show that Literature & writing played a major role in the life of a person that is considered to be one of the \\"Greatest Rappers of all Time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Heart","review":"Beautiful book, poetry was nothing short of inspirational and excellent! Im so happy this book was published!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Poetic","review":"This book gives great insight into the mind of a man called Tupac Shakur. I will treasure this book for years to come. A masterpiece, one of many from this great man. I do not write this to try to convince you to buy it. I want to try to convince to at least pick up the book and read the very last poem. I'm positive that you'll end up making this book part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I have completed this poetry book today and I am re-inspired to keep writing my own poetry. I definitely enjoyed reading all of his poems. He is so deep and very creative with his words. My all time favorite is \\"Sometimes I cry\\". I also really like \\"Only 4 the Righteous\\", \\"If I fail\\", \\"Things that make hearts break\\", \\"The tears in cupid's eyes\\", \\"God\\", and so many more. I noticed that he often mentioned how alone and lonely he was. It kinda surprised me because he seemed to have such an outgoing personality and had a lot of friends. But I guess things aren't always what they seem and that you never really know what's going on inside of a person. I can definitely relate to lonliness.

When he was in his late teens and early 20's and had to deal with the corruptions of society, that was when he had interesting, even brilliant things to say. But, not before. I'm a big Tupac fan, but this wasn't worth it. He just talks about love and it's cheesy and the rhymes aren't very well done. Get stuff from his more recent times to really understand his character."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rose that grew from concrete","review":"This is a very disappointing book of Tupac's work. Be reminded that these poems were written when tupac was nineteen. It doesn't account the events tupac encountered in the highlights of his career. I was expecting to see more of his feelings towards other rap artists. I also thought that as a poet, Tupac limits himself but as a rapper, he has exposed his lyrics to a higher level. There are a few poems that are worth reading tho' but they're already all over the net and plus they're all super short. Maybe he put a romantic or sorrow connotation to poetry.

Even today, many years after his death, Tupac still conjures an image of the original gangster. The father of modern hip-hop and one of the first to begin to cross over to the main stream.Unfortunately his life was cut short and we can imagine only what if, but by reading his work we can celebrate the legacy of Tupac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thug Life for All Seasons","review":"For a long time I kept hearing great things about this collection of poetry by Tupac. Well I finally got hold of a copy. I was impressed by Tupac's way with words. What really amazed me was the oh-so-tender side of him. He was able to display such sensitivity! My favourite poems include: \\"If There Be Pain, Life Through My Eyes, And Still I Love You, The Power of a Smile, The Sun and the Moon, And 2Morrow.\\" Tupac you touched me and so many others. Thug Life for All Seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I think that the book is excellent.

I already knew he could write poetry from the few poems that were published on the internet, but I didn't know he wrote that many. I loved each and every poem. Altough I can't say I relate to every poem (after all, I never lived a life like Tupac in my sheltered home in The Netherlands and I'm white, so I didn't have to deal with racism like Tupac did) but still, I feel his pain in a whole other way. I do miss one poem though: 'I've Seen Your Soul Before'. You can read this poem anywhere on the internet. Anyway it's one of my favs so I was just wondering why it wasn't published in the book. Maybe a possible part 2? Tupac, RIP, your presence will be missed, but your soul will always be with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Promising Poet","review":"Tupac's ability to work with words so well at such a young age was his trademark and is what made him a prominent celebrity in the hip-hop world. This publication is fascinating, mostly because of the copies of his handwritten words and interesting use of ideologies.However, as a poet, Tupac really was just a 19 year-old boy writing about his feelings and thoughts. Despite the recent tidal wave of interest in the collegiate community, his poetry is nothing to get excited about.I would recommend this to anyone interested in observing the process it takes to capture words the way Tupac was able to do so well later in life. Don't let this work compromise the talent of one of the greatest lyricists of our day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Poetry","review":"This book is so inspiring.

I like having the hard copy of a book so that I can thumb through, or grab the book and go back to something that I have read to refresh my memory. The many machinist books that I have purchased reveal hard to find information about my profession. This book reveals hard to find information about someone in our society that had an unpopular, but realistic view to convey.

Since then I have bought every other Tom Russell album as they have been released (about 15 in total)and seen him six or seven times when he has toured the UK.

The terrible, lingering death of a slave named Prosper is at the emotional core of this story. The sadistic master, Hodge, is like a character from a lurid novel. His apalling cruelty is described in detail. Hodge was prosecuted by the British Government and eventually hanged.

This commentary is no exception.As for substance, this is an excellent commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians. Stott's emphasis is more pastoral and practical than academic. Though he does occasionally discuss the Greek text, he does so in a way that is easily understandable by those not familiar with Greek. His insights are, well, insightful, and easily applied to the life of any Christian.

That was very premature and I'm glad I didn't.From the writing standpoint, the characters are very interesting and moderately well developed. It's a great story. The problem? The ending. When I read the last chapter I was seriously tempted to throw the book across the room. It's the first time I recall being actually pissed off at the way a book ended.Beyond that, I would also warn that the fight sequences are UN-ENDING. They go on forever. I wound up just skimming and skimming, especially towards the end of the book. I mean really... how many (and how long) sword/fight sequences can you read?This was a great book in concept.

Except for one thing.I despised the ending. It left me confused, dissatisfied, and resenting the main characters. None of their actions made sense to me and weren't consistent with the rest of the story. I even was expecting Pete to wake up and kill Shaunghessy in a lucid fit of rage at the end. Even that would have redeemed the book and partially satified me. But no.I rarely write Amazon reviews, but I'm making a special case for this one.

If this is an apocalypse novel then the gaping plot hole that never gets answered is, what happened to 300,000,000 people that left all of the canned goods sitting around uneaten and no corpses? You also have to swallow hole the idea that the main character wants to hump a horse with a horn. EWWWW! To add insult to injury the author believes that you can learn all you need to about martial arts from library books and a helpful samurai in about a week. Ditto what everybody else said about undeveloped characters, a flat unimaginative landscape and zero development of the idea of magic as an everyday fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I enjoy post-apocalyptic sci-fi. This book falls in that genre but has some unique aspects, such as incorporating fantasy and magic elemeents. I enjoyed it. The character development and the love relationship between the main character and a unicorn would be a strange thing to most people - the author pulls it off and makes it very believable, creating sexual tension in the process. The Japanese sword fighting and martial art philosphy add to the story. Some parts were a bit drawn out for me, but overall this is a great book. I read it on the kindle - only noticed a few typos in that edition but nothing major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but predictable","review":"Good revision of his previous book that could have been updated even better with a current view of New York.

Upon discovery of that alarming fact, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that that the book is in turns twee and testosterone. A katana wielding hombre with a bad-ass unicorn buddy straight out of the daydreams of Napoleon Dynamite. There are some good ideas here and the story telling is a mixed bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly imaginative fantasy","review":"I was captivated by the original cover art - a boy and his unicorn against a city skyline, and picked it up. I've never regretted it. I recently reread the electronic edition with the author's notes, and find that even with the added knowledge of how it came into print, I still really enjoy the fantasy world Mr. Boyett creates - a changed world in which certain things work, mythological creatures exist, and a young man tries to live by fighting, when necessary, to survive. If you're intrigued by magic, have a fascination for mythological creatures or survival in a world where swords are the preferred weapons, this is definitely worth checking out. I haven't read anything like this book since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you remember the first time?","review":"I remember the lump in my throat when I first finished it.

When I finished my book I just ached, my throat tightened and I swore I wanted to stay \\"NEW\\". Now being married and looking into the beautiful eyes of my child. I would love if he could experience this book when he is older but I can't find it anywhere! This book is so special to me. Being raised in a difficult city when being 23 and still a virgin is a miracle in itself. If it wasn't for this book who knows what could have happened.

Allen manages to both sypathize with and damn the characters in both stories. Interesting plot, truly great acting, and a screenplay that makes you think about the common themes of Allen's work (death, humor, love, identity, etc.) in new ways.I'm writing this after years of watching and re-watching because I just saw Match Point, which horribly cribs this movie's characters and plot and marries them with bad acting and a terrible screenplay.

The performance of Martin Landau as a successful opthamolgist who is morally conflicted is one of the most moving and grounded Film performances I have ever seen. He is just magnificent in this movie. Allen deftly weaves Landau's story together with another thread featuring Allen as a documentary film maker who is unhappily married. His brother-in - law is an obnoxious televison producer played to great effect by Alan Alda. This film raises questions of morality , faithfulness and does so in a way that leaves the viewer to think through these issues as the characters go trough their respective moral crises. There are some laughs included but for the most part this is serious filmmaking at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What other reason...","review":"Woody Allen screenplay and directed...what other resason do I need to convince you to purchase or view this film?

I think I've only mildly liked one of his films and I keep watching them expecting that I'm going to have that 'a-ha' moment when it all clicks and I figure out this man's appeal. The truth is: it's not going to happen. Woody Allen's appeal is just going to have to pass me by. From what I can make out of this, the two running stories in this film have nothing to do with each other. There is a theological question posed, I supposed with Martin Landau's character and of course it's left open ended. Allen keeps trying to pass himself as a leading man, but it hasn't and never will work. I was bored thirty minutes into this thing. Watch at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I ordered this book without having seen it before, and was diasappointed at how outdated so much of the information is. For example, most of the references are 1960s and 1970s, many much earlier than that, and practically nothing after the mid-1980s. The illustrations are overrated in the description, most are poor quality B&W and the vegetation map is nothing to get excited about. If you want plant lists of the different vegetation types, you get that, and the information is probably accurate in that respect.

It was not sensual, seductive or smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marta Hari","review":"The blurb on the back cover is enticing enough. Although quite misrepresentational of the plot. You expect one thing and get another. A novel attempting to fit into the literary genre by being 'different'. If intense unhealthily co-dependant relationships bordering on psychosis are your thing, buy it now. If you're looking for a love story that will tug at your romantic heartstrings - forget it. I read the book from cover to cover in the hope the end would justify the means of having to wade through a depressing relationship clearly destined for tragedy. The violent and even more depressing ending did not justify the means. I consider it sacrilege to burn any book, but I'd make an exception in this case. Why have the words 'literary' and 'entertaining' become so mutually exlusive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Name Written on Water","review":"Horrible, I would not recommend, yes it is an erotic novel, but it takes the story far beyond that, sickening parts, I did not expect such a trash in book endorsed by Amazon sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy, sad and brutal","review":"I finished this book reluctantly because I don't like to abandon books half way through, but now I wish I hadn't bothered. It's not what I call a love story, or even erotic. It's an account of a woman's systematic humiliation and degredation at the hands of various lovers, culminating in the brutal and unnecessarily graphic murder of her one true love, accompanied throughout by her belief that she deserves no better. The love scenes between the women which could have been tender in another context, were marred for me by Sofia's passive acceptance of fate and the inevitability of what had to follow. Why would anyone who loves women write a book like this? Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very strange story indeed ....","review":"The author, certainly takes the reader on a wild roller coaster ride as we follow a young Sofia trying to cope with everyday life and certainly efervescent sexuality. She is a young married woman and it appears that her husband and most of the men she gets involved with are nothing to write home to mother about.....Course her downfall is that she likes it rough and tht's why we have a story.Sofia meets, well into the book, Marina a beautiful young Uruguayan girl that could well pass for her twin sister. The two girls hit it off very very very well and theres no doubt in Sohia's mind that she's dumping her husband for this new kind of sexual experience ...The end of the story is both shocking and surprising to say the least ...... all in all it may not be my kind of book since I think it should probably be classed as 'high brow' erotica, but, it does deserve high praise of the author who paints a very realistic picture of sexual struggles with life ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is for all horse lovers!","review":"This is a wonderful story!

Someone steals the hermit's animals and goes to make them into food/furs, and he just lets them. The bad guys hit him with a car, and apparently that translates to \\"Well, he's old, so naturally he's having issues.\\" The poachers kidnap the girl, and the cops and her dad just stand there like idiots. The horse is pretty, but you can see he has mane extensions in several of the shots so it looks a little bizarre. I know it's supposed to be for kids, but why do these kid movies with horses always have the village idiots? Can't they write anything decent anymore and stop hoping all we're looking at is there's a horse in the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Family-Oriented Movie","review":"If you're looking for a kid-friendly movie, this will probably fit the bill for you. The story line is easy to follow and is neither too involved nor intense.Without giving away too much, the plot involves a divorced man's spirited daughter whose mother has passed away. The daughter moves overseas to live with her dad. Their relationship is rather strained because of misunderstandings on both parts.A couple of bungling outlaws and a kindly old man add to the story. And then there's the mysterious horse...I doubt adults will be enthralled with this movie, but it's a cute story for kids.BOTTOM LINE: Buy the DVD, make some popcorn, and enjoy this kid-safe movie with your children/grandchildren...just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Princess Stallion","review":"Even my grandchildren who are 9 and 7 found this movie too simplistic and naive.

Which leaves me a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling of a Nobel prize winner","review":"If it wasn't for a couple of hilarious anecdotes including the encounter with Swedish king and surfing episode after he got the Nobel prize, this would have been a very boring book with a title \\"Rambling of a rummie with a PhD\\". Mullis is eager to share his opinion on almost anythng and he should stick to surfing and molecular biology as he is not doing too good with almost anything else. He should have hired a decent ghostwriter as his writing is still \\"work in progress\\". And it was so easy to notice that his effort dwindled down in last couple of \\"chapters\\" that it became pathetic at times. Better luck with his next book, but I am definitely not going to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof you can win a Nobel and still be a dimwit","review":"I'm wary of people who write outside their area of expertise, and this book is a good example. Mullis is a big fan of astrology, yet he ignores the fact that astrology uses such sweeping generalizations that it could (and does) describe anybody. He also advocates exterminating a type of spider and says that environmentalists are liars. Why? A spider bit him, and he didn't like the explanation for why spiders bite.The one good thing about Mullis is that he made me want to make a few calls to the local university and find out the other flaws in his thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Romp Through Mind of Nobel Prize Winner","review":"One of the more entertaining and disparate collections of 'science' essays I've read in awhile, all from the meandering mind of Kary Mullis. His freewheeling and iconoclastic style often includes hysterical passages. Topics (or should I call them adventures) range from astrology, supernatural occurances, brown recluse spiders, and the OJ Simpson trial to more biochemistry-related (his field) subjects. His often unpredictable viewpoints are interesting, and rarely tied to scientific orthodoxy and his frequent rants against the scientific establishment and status quo are especially delicious coming from a highly honored Nobel Prize winner. Those looking for a solid scientific treatise should steer clear of this volume, but those just wanting an entertaining and somewhat thought-provoking read within a science context should enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use PCR, but read Feynman.","review":"My lab uses PCR almost every day and I thank Kary Mullis for making my research possible. Unfortunately Kary Mullis seems to now have turned his efforts towards convincing the public that scientists are unethical, lazy and stupid. His fascination with astrology and mysticism are acceptable. His misinterpretation and twisting of data are unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfounded, Disorganized, Egotistical, and Bizzare","review":"The possibility for anything profound in this book is far overshadowed by his absurd denial-ism of the HIV to Aids connection, CFCs to Ozone depletion link, and the possibility of climate change in general.. He talks about being abducted by aliens, the ability to be in someone else's mind, and gives credit to horoscopes and astrology.I expected this book to illustrate an interesting life philosophy or, at the least, tell his account of his invention of the PCR. Instead, all I got was a collection of disorganized rants by a narcissist.Pick this book up if you're looking for bizarre stories about LSD fueled trips, alien abductions, and experimentation with drugs. If you're looking for something worthwhile, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN BOOK to read","review":"This book was a very fun to read. I read the whole thing in a day.

But I tend to hold Nobel prize winners in high esteem.The book has pitifully little science in it, ignorant observations about other fields of endeavour, e.g. global warming, lots of sly allusions to drug use. There's almost nothing to suggest much of a character, certainly not a pleasant character that I'd want to talk with.I can't puzzle out the circumstances behind the book: perhaps the author was drunk or stoned, or not Cary Mullis, or the text was cadged together from post-it notes scattered under the fellow's desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a couple of chapters in...","review":"I've only read the first couple of chapters so far, but I find the writing style extremely irritating - I'll read the rest of the book, but I'm dreading what I'll find when (as I've read in these reviews) the writing deteriorates in the later chapters...It strikes me that Mullis is trying to be Richard Feynman, but failing miserably. The same ingredients are there (drumming/surfing, meeting important people and talking about unlikely topics, womanizing, getting into science as a kid, etc.), but whereas they make Feynman seem more human, Mullis comes off as self-centred and arrogant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastatingly disappointing","review":"This is a well-blurbed book, and I really looked forward to reading it. Nearly as soon as it arrived I set aside everything to read it. What I liked about it was his open-mindedness and curiosity and playfulness. What disappointed me were the factual innaccuracies and just general lack of precision thinking. I learned a good bit about Kary Mullis, but I didn't learn much else. A very disappointing, weak book. Can't recommend it, although mericfully it is not a long read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing...","review":"Absolutely amazing piece. Mullis is brilliant, sarcastic, hell-bent.. you see a concise picture of what makes him him. His commentary on the world should reveal a lot to any common walnut, while to those interested in biochemistry and the such can smile, applaud, and appreciate the fact that there is at least someone else in the world who understands..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great man. Good book.","review":"I can dig it. The world can use more people like Mr. Mullis.He will tick you off.The part that bugs me are the contradictions. Global warming is junk science...yet astrology, the astral plain and ESP are fields that warrant more serious research. Riiiiiight.In general, I think Mr. Mullis is a thoroughly honest, imperfect man that has done a lot of great work to help mankind. That's about the best anyone can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mullis' imagination makes the discovery of PCR a certainty.","review":"Most scientists are merely technicians without a sense of humor. Mullis has a mind that a child would envy because he rejects the selfserving pomposity of conventional wisdom and he appears only full of himsef. In 1985 when I first heard of the simple idea of a polymerase chain reaction the concept was as amusing as the application. After talking to Kerry Mullis and reading his book I think I know where both are coming from. The book is funny, irreverant, right and wrong and wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, provocative, original and immensely entertaining","review":"I had no idea someone like Kary Mullis could possibly exist, except as a fictional character. Kary Mullis - a brilliant scientist, hedonist (in a postive and loving sense), mystic and thinker, winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, seeker of consciousness altering insights through psychoactive chemistry experiments - I can only say this book has been my most enjoyable and interesting read of 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing Naked in the Mind Field","review":"A very mediocre and arrogant book. The only benefit I got from it was the feeling that profound scientific truths can be discovered by accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in ages.","review":"It doesn't contain any interesting science, the 'alternative' stuff is pointless, the political views are mis-informed and self-contradicting, the writing gets progessively poorer to where the latter part of the book is hard to read, and I can't imagine that it would be any fun talking to the guy.I did draw one thing interesting from the book: There's no reason to assume that Nobel Prize winners are other than discovers of something that turned out to be really useful. Which left me a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely you're joking","review":"Very lightweight. There are three proto-books in here: 1) A scientific autobiography a la Feynman. These parts are OK, although they tend to support the thesis that physicists are wittier if not smarter than chemists. Mullins has no self-esteem problems.2) Some adventures in druggy/new-agey states of consciousness (astral projection, etc). These episodes are at least cleanly reported, but the implications are not explored from any particularly new perspective, so why bother?3) An attack on certain big-science viewpoints, in particular the HIV theory of AIDS causation. Mullins advances some interesting views. His accusation that the HIV theory came about because a lot of virus scientists were looking for work is alarming, and somewhat believable. But to make such serious accusation in an offhand manner, interspersed with his other random thoughts, is highly irresponsible.In short, not worth the money. It's a quick read so you won't waste too much time, and it is entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is not worth buying for any level of robot builders.

Ferrets are meat eaters and cannot digest corn. From what I've read, corn is actually bad for them and can cause intestinal problems. My guess is that Marshall's is using it as a \\"Filler\\" to save money instead of thinking about the ferrets well being. Sure they warranty the ferrets for one year as long as you keep them on Marshall food, but my thinking is that it takes more than one year for problems to show up in your ferret.I won't be buying anymore of this product.

It is easy to read and understand. I think it is important for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed blessing...","review":"The author presents some incredibly useful laws (i.e. tithing, goal setting, forgiveness and fulfilling your purpose) which will indeed be transformational. The reason they are transformational is that they were established by God and are all biblical concepts. And although Gaines makes the point that real prosperity goes well beyond financial blessings (certainly true), many of her examples seem to belie this (\\"If you want a solid gold toilet seat, you've got a right to it.\\" - p. 96). The truth is that God does want us to prosper and is eager to bless us as we align ourselves with his purposes. I'm not convinced that God's eager to bless us with a gold toilet seat. Gaines ignores the fact that there are also many examples, both in the scriptures and in our world today, of very spiritual people who have not achieved financial prosperity. The bottom line is that while an abundant life is a biblical axiom, it does not always translate into material wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly concise guide","review":"It's like having Edwene in your pocket !

I went home and read this book, and my life was immediately transformed. Transformed in the sense that I knew what beliefs I needed to change to enhance my personal sense of prosperity, to create a higher sense of well-being.If you have any stumbling blocks on your road to success, read this book.

After starring on the sitcom as the clever, lovable Pam Beesly, Jenna Fischer began landing parts in high profile comedies, and with A Little Help, she emerges in her first major starring role. Fischer is somewhat neurotic dental hygienist Laura Pehlke, mother to Dennis and wife to philandering Bob. When Bob suddenly dies, Laura is faced with the task of putting her life back together, both for her and her son. Though that synopsis may not clearly indicate it, A Little Help is a dramedy that focuses on its characters' quirky coping methods, and though Fischer makes the best of it that she can, I mostly felt the film was a bit uneven, with a subpar script and some puzzling choices made for its likable lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"emo hey day","review":"reminds me of alot of emo stuffness.dont get all jelly dick on me,about how emo is sunny day real estate,or how its actually at the drive in before,they sold out.i dont care.this cd is good.has a mix of different peoples,for optimum listening value.try it out broface"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"I picked this up not knowing what to expect, but it was in the punk section and that was my mood.

As strange as it may sound to those who have never tried it, I found the concepts, explanations and exercises amazingly helpful in developing my psi abilities in just minutes.Beverly Jaeger instills a sort of confidence in the reader that seems to be a large part of opening the mind to the process of learning. Small steps lead to cumulative victories. I would have never believed I could read colors after a half-hour of trying! This is amazing.A must-have for those looking to explore their natural psychic abilities painlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This is the first and only, thus far, Mercury Rev release that disappointed me. I'd gotten it specifically for the track \\"Dead Man\\", which I'd never heard before. Seeing how the running time of the \\"song\\" is 30 minutes, I'd hoped it would be similar in style to the untitled track on their 'Car Wash Hair' EP and the recordings under their alter ego band name Harmony Rockets. WRONG! Over 20 minutes of the track is an old recording of a toddler talking jibberish, and there's no music behind it. The version of \\"Everlasting Arm\\" is the same studio version included on their excellent 'See You On The Other Side' album."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to teach math to community college students","review":"This book has been a tremendous help to me to identify some of the problem areas on my teaching.

It excels at this because it gets you to practice, practice, practice and practice some more. Personally, I made photocopies of all the practice pages so I could more easily practice.Secondarily, it covers basic pronunciation, reading, and writing sentances. Just the basics, concepts are explained simply and it provides a good platform for further study. I'm certain the authors intended readers to study other books for these skills.Its one minor drawback is not including info on why machine-made characters sometimes look significantly different than hand-written characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice","review":"The book arrived on time, and in great condition.

Every song is slow and trudging. The vocals are almost all sung, which isn't bad in and of itself, however the singing sounds like an imitation of Days of the New or some other second-rate grunge band.This isn't about keeping an open mind or allowing a band to progress (though, in this case, they've certainly regressed.)

I got this when my daughter was 4 mos old and thought it would be a good read, but instead I found that it made me feel guilty that i hadn't read the babywise book when I was still pregnant and started their babywise sleep schedule when she was first born. This book left a bad taste in my mouth. I decided to toss the book and go at it my own. My daughter is now 7 mos old and she naturally is falling into a sleep routine.

A child is every bit as much a human being who deserves respect, love, and trust as their parents. They are certainly not born sinners needing strict discipline to fit into society. A newborn needs, wants, and craves closeness, the ONLY form of communication he has is crying, to ignore his cries is to tell him that he is not important enough. He will learn to manipulate because he cannot get through any other way. How Ezzo can say he is Christian is beyond me. Christian means being Christ-like, and I have yet to see anything that would lead me to believe that Christ would have treated children with such loathing. Nowhere in the bible does it say \\"thou shalt swat your child daily\\" My rating is- get this book off the market.

I read the first book, which is intended for parents of newborns-5 month olds, when my daughter was 2 weeks old. By 7 weeks, she was sleeping through the night. Babies and moms both thrive on routine, instead of just wandering through the day and night and just surviving. Hey, I don't have anything against surviving! But it's so much greater to have a plan of action. If you haven't read the first book, I would encourage you to read it first, then read this one for 5-15 month olds.

It seems if you want to teach children to treat others kindly and with respect, shouldn't we not treat them the same way? How else will they learn respect and other good habits unless we teach them correctly? A child can't learn to respect others unless he himself is treated with respect!

But at what cost to your child in later life?\\" The reason it works is because by ignoring a child's valid and real needs you crush their spirit, until they become so certain that no one will answer them that they simply give up and stop trying, often to the point of Failure to Thrive Syndrome.There are excellent reasons that the American Academy of Pediatrics, La Leche Leauge, and the American Medical Association (among others) have condemned this book and its \\"methods\\".If you love your children, if you want them to thrive and not just \\"obey\\" like little robots, please don't follow the \\"advice\\" in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"Gary Ezzo's own church has distanced themselves from the Ezzos and this dangerous book, whose breastfeeding information is inaccurate at best and dangerous at worst.

Ezzo says that infants who are fed on demand will grow up to be brats who steal, and that they should be fed only every 3 hours, no matter how much they cry. Most child-health experts couldn't disagree more strongly. In the case of breastfed infants, the practice of limiting feeds by the clock in the early months can lead to breastfeeding difficulties, low weight gain, or even dehydration.Do NOT use this book.

In addition to what others have written about the dangers of following the advice in this book, I found them to have a disturbing underlying message- that children are something to be tolerated and trained rather than loved and enjoyed. My conclusion is that Ezzo doesn't like children much. He doesn't respect their basic needs (like hunger) and labels what is considered by most to be developmentally appropriate behavior \\"misbehavior\\" that requires \\"correction\\". I just went away feeling like the book was written for people who want convenient babies, ones that don't interfere with their lives. Babies are hard work. There are no easy, definitive answers about how to raise them and Babywise is disingenuous to suggest otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dangerous book","review":"I cannot believe anyone would recommend this book, it is dangerous and misinformative. These people are not pediatricians or psychologists and should not be offering advice on children or child rearing. They are right-wing religious fanatics who are trying to promote their beliefs in the guise of parenting tips.

He barely fusses, so some crying before sleep isn't any harm. I work my way into the concepts and some things i am leaving out, but for the most part, babywise has kept my kids ages 4, 3, 1, and 1 month, happy and content. People ask, how do i do it? (handle so many young kids) And, your kids are so well behaved and happy. And, i can give a lot of credit to Gary Ezzo. I bought his Christian version off his website, Gfi.org, and it is even better!

Her grandfather is her pediatrician and is very proud of how healthy and happy she is. I know that it is very popular right now in childcare to recommend that a new mother listen to her baby's cues so that she may know when her baby is hungry or tired, but what about the baby who prefers to sleep through a mealtime? PDF doesn't require that you starve a baby, if a baby fed on a two-and-a-half to three hour schedule is dehydrated, they must be checked out by a physician. I don't think the Ezzo's viewpoint is extreme at all.

Just looking at the sad state most children are in these days, and the horrific acts being played out by our society's children, should be enough of a sign to parents all over that a return to the basics of self control, discipline and moral character development are in great need.

As one paediatrician has written, \\"What Ezzo doesn't know about Child Development Could be Dangerous to your Baby\\". There are so many things wrong with this book that it's hard to know where to start. Ezzo sets up an adverserial relationship between parent and child. Smacking and swatting are the order of the day, and for a parent with low self-control, child abuse can happen easily. In Britain it was described as a \\"Charter for Child Abusers\\".

I knew coming in that parenting takes some work and maybe a little sacrifice. I comfort my child when he cries. I hold him when possible, or talk gently to him. I have never hit or isolated him. When he does something I don't want him to, I stop him. I say \\"no\\" and move him away. As often as it takes. Distracting helps, too. We have childproofed many items to reduce battles, because he is too little. He is just now starting to understand a bit that there are things he isn't supposed to do, and we are working with him.

There is nothing wrong with figuring out your baby's natural schedule and gently and lovingly fitting it into your current family schedule. Also, a parent's job is not to get baby to sleep through the night as soon as possible after birth so the parent(s) won't be so inconvienced.

It assumes that just because you followed the first book your babies naps will automatically fall into a certain pattern. Not the case for my baby. She really is a fabulous sleeper and slept thru the night since 2 months old (11pm to 7am). However, now that she is getting to bed earlier (around 8pm) she wakes up playing in her crib around 3 or 4am, then again around 5am.

This second book picks up where the first Babywise leaves off and goes more into depth on starting solids as well as beginning to parent your child, discipline, morals, etc.Like I said, very helpful, but as with any book/advice should be taken with a dose of common sense.

He's sleeping happily through the night at 8 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned before you read this book!","review":"As a lay breastfeeding counselor, I was surprised to receive so many calls from mothers complaining their babies were not gaining weight according to their doctors' expectations. I never could understand why the mothers would refuse to explain why they would not feed their babies more often, especially on the days most experienced mothers know to be \\"high frequency\\" nursing days, usually resulting in their babies' growth spurts.Since the mothers were holding back information, I always wondered why, until I found out they were not to admit to being members of Gary Ezzo's parenting classes. Sounds cultish to me.Please, before you buy his books, do a quick search on the 'net. Do you really want to chance buying into a parenting manual with that much negative information coming from more reputable parenting sources? Just enter Gary Ezzo, scroll down past his book links, and then do your own research.A concerned mother of four very well-adjusted, grown children"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be misled!","review":"It is misleading to review this book solely as a book providing guidelines on how to get your child to sleep through the night.Ezzo touches on almost every aspect of child development even though he is unqualified to do so. Skim through the book yourself before buying to read about his disrespectful child rearing methods. If you believe that love and parental instinct come first, drop this book because Ezzo does not believe in parent-infant bonding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and terrible!!!!!","review":"The advice offered in this book is not only unfounded, but also dangerous--particullary the suggested feeding schedule for breast-fed infants. The author of this book is not a pediatrician; he is a minister with no apparent knowledge beyond personal experience. While the author had consulted one pediatrician, many other pediatricians--indeed the majority asked--express serious concerns regarding the possible risks of malnurition and risks of developmental delays when following the book's guidelines. While the techniques suggested may be effective in training babies to sleep through the night, this is at the expense of your baby feeling secure in your ability to meet his or her needs. Makes for insecure and despondent children. If you truly wish to become baby-wise, check out: any of Dr. Sears' books, the Continuum Concept, or the Happiest Baby on the Block. Most importantly, listen to your baby and trust your own instincts. AVOID THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so comical","review":"The statement that claims of attachment disorder and failure to thrive are \\"comical\\" by an earlier reviewer are not so comical if it happens to your own child. While I believe Ezzo's concept will work for some children with parents who are careful and mindful about what they are doing, I also believe strongly (and from experience) that if you have a child who is predisposed to react negatively to such input, whether it be from temperament differences or brain wiring, Ezzo's methods can aggrevate a problem that might have been avoided with a more nurturing method. Using Ezzo's plan is a bit like playing Russian roulette with your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention \\"Chrisitian\\" Mothers who like Ezzo's philosophy","review":"To the Washington state reviewer(go Cougs): The next time you are crying out to God in heart felt prayer, maybe He will choose to ignore YOUR pleas, as you have ignored YOUR baby! Dying to self and self- sacrifice on the part of a parent is BIBLICAL..Being too tired and selfish to attend to your baby is very UNBIBLICAL. Didn't Jesus say that what we have done for the least of these, we have done for Him! Children will have plenty of time to learn sacrifice and love- especially when they see the example of your own self-sacrifice( I hope yours WILL see this! ) By the way, I have eight blessings from God who ARE blessings, even though I met their needs as infants!

Their harmonies are something that you haven't heard in a while, invoking thoughts of male and female pop groups of the 60's, with psychedelic bits and kibbles and a certain indie twinge. It's really beautiful music and I think the past 3 generations could really like the sound if they are given the chance to listen. Strings, xylophones, classical music of some sort is thrown in for a new twist but still Those The Brokes is more pop rock oriented, while their last release was just a bit slower and more melodic. I prefer this new one but both are great albums to start with. You could dance in your underwear to this, bop your head in the car, and even make a perfect Valentine's Day mix.

Seagate, which bought Maxtor back in 2006, refuses to replace the drive or honor the warranty. They wrote \\"We have seen this before, and I am sorry to say the drive only had a 1-year warranty\\" -- clearly, the reason they've seen this before is because the drive was marketed as having a three year warranty.A longer warranty doesn't mean a hard drive is less likely to fail. But I would never buy a drive with a one year warranty. And I would never buy from a company that refuses to honor its warranties.That's two good reasons not to buy this drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Reliable","review":"I have had nothing but trouble with hard drives made by Maxtor and now that they are owned by Seagate it does not appear that they have improved on the quality at all.I purchased this 500GB SATA II internal hard drive last November and it started to die in less than 60 days. When you turn on the computer you can hear the drive try to start up but that is all it does. I have to restart my PC 20 plus times before the drive it will actually start up. Lucky for me I was able to get it to start up and backed up before it died altogether.I would not recommend anything with a Maxtor name on it to anyone.

We actually call him \\"goat boy\\" as he bleets out in sharp vibrato. This album is weak compared to Chocolate Kings where Lanzetti's style is at least tolerable.

I'm glad the author was able to develop such a career, but he goes on too much about it and I think the book would have been more useful with more detail on translating script and director's vision into storyboards rather than stories on how lucky the guy was getting to be a director's assistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Think - horrible instruction book","review":"This book is misleading from cover to cover. It is not a tutorial or \\"course\\" as the title may mis-lead you to believe. It is a personal account of finding a job in Hollywood after leaving film school without a plan. This book does not even discuss the basic nomenclature of the storyboard artist, much less present insights or examples into actual storyboards from sequences in films with which you may be familiar.

Never has the hero, in any book of hers, done that before. It was not appealing and the book just went down hill from there.However, Connie Mason is a very good writter and story teller, so if anyone wants to read a delightful Connie Mason book try The Laird of Stonehaven, Lionheart, Pirate, Pure Temptation, A Taste of Paradise or The Lion's Bride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"Ok what happened to Connie?

The fact that he let his mistress stay at the house and then slept with her in their room and not taking any responsibility for any of the horrible things that occurred. The entire time I was reading it I was like I can't believe she is writing this but it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I wanted to know what would happen.

As is always true in his stories, the character development and story tension is full, rounded, and well written. However, I found that this very framework and its pace created a challenge for me as a reader. The storyline presented a picture that was much like the mundane constrained readiness, the minor conflicts, and the day-to-day sameness of operations that forward deployments entailed during the cold war.Page after page of this book, I asked where is the \\"up-and-down\\" ride that I have come to expect from Reeman...

I will be making the gf noodles and pumpernickel type bread again soon, and can't wait to try more of the trial-tested recipes by this ground-breaking author. We just ordered a copy of her final book, on comfort foods.The Gluten-Free Gourmet Cooks Comfort Foods: Creating Old Favorites with the New Flours"},{"rating":"2","title":"its awesome","review":"She has some awesome recipes. I really think between my mom, my girlfriend, and my daughter (all of whom are very picky eaters) this may become frequently"},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll Enjoy Our Time Together Grandaddy!","review":"Ages 3-8 yrs. A tender, warm story spoken through the voice of a grandaughter to her grandfater. \\"When I am old with you, Grandaddy, we will play cards all day underneath that old tree by the road.\\" When I am old with you, Grandaddy...[etc].\\" Neat pictures that blend well with the story. It's a nice story that makes for a great bedtime read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squidward","review":"Squidward was purchased for our 3 yr old grand daughter. When Squidward arrived in the small box, his neck was bent. Bob at BB Toys offered to replace him for us. He told us he thought that's why Squidward was being retired because of his neck not being strong. We figured since a 3 yr old would be playing with him his neck would get alot looser as time goes by so we decided not to worry about it. I will purchase from this company again as they were very nice to deal with and offered to replace Squidward. Thanks Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and exactly what I needed.","review":"My cat, Jasmine, is a shelter adopted cat and had been abused. Therefore she is very upset when anyone comes to my home. She is frightened about every little noise. It took her about four months for her to get comfortable with me. Sooooo! When it came Christmas time and I was to spend a few days at my daughter's house, I had a problem. I defintely couldn't leave her home, but was concerned how Jasmine would react. I bought the Waterer and the Feeder together. We put Jasmine in the bedroom I'd be using, along with her litter box. She was comfortable enough to have me and my family \\"visit\\" her through the day to comfort her. At night she had me to herself just like at home. So it made for a great experience for her, instead of a frightening one. Sooooo, thanks to this waterer and feeder systems it was a great holiday season. The seller was really good and the items arrived on time and in great condition. I will use Amazon the this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of brilliant new information, at least for me...","review":"The comperative reflections with the European time lines from 500 BC and the culture of that civilization and with some Central American ancient cultures (Maya)gave me a new perspective on global developments over the last 3500 years. No small feat for a 60 minutes investment. Wes Studi's commentary is very much to the point and Douglas Spotted Eagle's music makes more than a perfect background. I wish I would have seen this years ago to help me with some of my own thoughts, like if there would have been more of the First Nations people around would they just by sheer numbers also have discoverd the wheel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quelle deception! [What a disappointment!]","review":"This author must think all Americans have nothing better to do but read the gossip columns or watch soap operas and want the French vocabulary to go with such behaviors. A major portion of this book covers romance-horoscopes and other vapid matters. The author insults my intelligence with her choice of topics. In addition, Ms. Heminway uses vocabulary in her pieces not defined in the book's glossary or pages of text which further frustrates the reader. A wonderfully, unusable text!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with the one star group","review":"First of all, I really like Asian cinema...over the past 5 years they have produced unbelievably good movies (Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers, IP Man, Curse of the Golden Flower among many others). This one, however, is embarassing to watch. Maybe it's the genre (outlandish comic book type humor/action that reminds me of a combination of the mob and the three stooges), but it just didn't pass the smell test after the first 10 minutes. I usually can find something redeamable in most movies, but no luck on this one. This baby will be passed around next Christmas to some unsuspecting \\"friend.\\" For those who like this kind of stuff, go for it. For the vast majority I would wager they will find it a waste of time. Machine girl is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This movie was turkey! I stomached 10 minutes of this wasted money and time movie!! Do not waste your money! Whomever made this movie should be fired forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Structure and Function","review":"I ordered a used copy. The book arrived quickly and looked new. This text is highly condensed but easy to follow with great diagrams and pictures. I especially like the examples of how the body systems work in tandem. Not only is the language understandable but one can write a synopsis without too much hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a tad","review":"I bought this option just 'cause it was inexpensive relative to the kreg fence. But when I needed just another 15 thousandth after making the 1st cut (in metal), you were there. It's a must buy with the fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"I found that when you tighten the wing nut it drives the adjustment thumb wheel into the surface of the table. There is only one bearing surface on the side opposite the thumb wheel. I put a shim under the adjuster where the screw goes through the mount. This kept the wheel off of the table allowing it to move smoothly. A real pain, but at least I can use it.Naturally this solution only works if the track is flush to the table surface (or you are using a wide track)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"I purchased the micro adjuster to go with the kreg band saw fence. I had a hard time setting up the micro adjuster, in fact I never got it to work correctly. It hindered the smooth back and forth movement of the fence and actually made the set up more difficult. I finaly gave up and returned the product. The fence on the other hand works great-very high quality and accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Divas RE-covered","review":"Being a fan of the WWE divas, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately this is just an OVERPRICED version of the Divas magazine which comes out once a year. A number of the photos have been seen elsewhere and the cliched quotes like \\"It's what is inside a person that counts\\" really don't give us any new insight into what these incredible women are REALLY all about.If you DO feel the need to purchase this book, wait until it comes out in paperback. Definitely not worth 30 dollars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"All this book is is just pictures of the divas with their dumb personal quotes. dont bother buying this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the cartridge","review":"Save yourself the trouble. I purchased this, went through the whole process and was unsuccessful. First no ink would come out of my cartridge, then the ink would not stop running out! I ended up with ink all over my hands, at least one kitchen towel and printer, only to be told by the directions that my cartridge was defective. I wish I would have saved myself the time and money and just bought a cartridge. If you decide to buy, I hope you have better luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cut above the rest...","review":"These clean edge two-side printable cards are definitely a \\"cut above the rest\\". The look is about as professional as you can get with such ease. The ink adheres naturally without smudge or wet look. These are absolutely worth the little extra you pay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I use these cards regularly and they are the best - I used to have to cut all my cards with a cutter, the clean edge really is nice and saves time. They print up well and being able to utilize the back for printing is an added plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Business Cards!","review":"These business cards do what they say! The print well - both sides - they don't smudge and they 'fold apart' beautifully. The 'folding' causes them to snap which leaves a super clean, slightly beveled edge cut to the cards. They truly end up looking as if you just picked them up at the printers. Great product at a very decent price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound product, inexpensive","review":"I had thought that perforated sheets of business cards must necessarily look cheap. That's not true. These are quite good, although clearly not the product of a print shop.The accompanying software has a reasonable Mac version, but be warned: If you want a set of identical cards printed, front AND back, then you need to specify this; it's not the default. If you forget, you'll wind up with one good business card and seven with the front and/or back displaying the default logo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well - no perforations","review":"For print at home business cards these work just fine. I like that there are not perforations like other cards I have seen. Will buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVERY BC for inkjet","review":"Easy to use, Avery has great instructions and support to get what you need for any office programs. Printed without a hitch in my hp oj 6000. Kind of pricey when i add up price of cards and ink. can get them professionally done for similar price point when all is said it done with my exspenses. Paper quality is just mmmhmm OK. Edges arent to sharp and they break out of paper fairly easy. Thanks to avery I was able to quickly setup and print my first rough draft of a business card. Satisfied customer who will probably try thier nicer product line (glossy finish for a more professional look over matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I've used this product over the years for a good, basic business card that I can print only what I need. I can change the card and print out a new sheet anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thickness?","review":"Boy, this card is thin (still thicker than a regular sheet of paper). Nowhere on the package is the gauge (thickness) and if I knew what I know now I probably would not have purchased this.Printing and seperating the cards was very easy though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product shipped fast","review":"Slight shipping issue resolved quickly. Product is excellent. Cards snap out and do NOT have a perforated edge once finished. Very clean and professional. Using a color laser to make very nice cards, crisp and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond","review":"It's very easy to use, and the paper quality is great, which makes it very professional looking. Also, both sides are made for prints.It's also great for making little cards, such as seating, little card on the gift item, etc. It's very useful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes beautiful, professional looking business cards","review":"I was extremely skeptical that these printer-fed cards would really have \\"clean edges,\\" like you'd get from professionally printed cards. However, I don't know how they did it, but it's true! I handed these cards to a few people who didn't know I'd printed them at home and they were shocked when I told them. The edges are clean and smooth, none of the usual dust or tiny strands of perforated paper. Beautifully cut. Avery even offers free professionally designed templates on their website so that you can make your cards look even slicker. I highly recommend these cards and I will continue to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quality We've Come to Expect from Avery","review":"I have made up business cards with a number of different brand of blank cards and I have to say I like these the best. Colors transfer and show better giving you a nice crisp clean look. Standard size cards that are above standard quality especially for value. Why pay someone else to make your business cards and possibly not come away completely happy when you can make your own just as nicely as professional companies. I have been a long time user of Avery products and have come to expect a certain quality of product from them. These don't disappoint! Buy yourself some and have the fun experience of creating something of quality that you are most certainly going to be most happy with."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"guaranteed\\" to work in any inkjet printer? yeah right.","review":"What they really mean is guaranteed that it might work but you have to pay extra to call the tech support #. Some guarantee. The printed cards did not align correctly despite using the correct MSWord template. They recommend their own software which cannot type other languages as Word can. Why should I pay the extra money to call tech support for something \\"guaranteed\\" to work? I'm not, I'm just going to return them and buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"I wish that I had read this before buying at my local office supplier. My cards print blurred, and I have reset the printer settings for all kinds of specialty paper, trying to find one that works. I have an HP 2200 series. Maybe it is a problem with HP printers? Nonetheless, it is not compatible with MY laser printer, and as HP is one of the most popular out there, it should not be advertised as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy cards","review":"These cards are flimsy and bend easily. They will easily be picked out as a cheap homemade card. Spend the extra money for decent cardstock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke my printer","review":"The 2nd sheet of business cards through my printer, jammed in my printer. In removing the jammed sheet of cards, I broke my printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Custom Designed Smooth Edge Business Cards","review":"The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software. Using this program, one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery. They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly. It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Goods","review":"Cards came bent and do not work in the printer. Plus it took 21 days to get to me. I would never recommend this. Waste of money! Had to go buy new ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't do it again","review":"Not sure if it was the program or my printer but, one side of the cards printed half way between the cards. Tried several times and never worked. Also some sheets come apart in the printer. Might work in different printer or with a different program, but didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclean edge business cards","review":"These cards do not snap apart cleanly at all. I had to keep folding them back and forth over and over again, and they still refused to separate. I had to rip them apart, and no matter how carefully I tried to do it, they were left with torn, messy edges. Absolutely horrible and unprofessional."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"So easy to use, thick card stock, \\"snap\\" apart SO easily, and nice smooth edges. Will be buying more. The free Avery site was very easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage.","review":"None of the templates for the 8371 business cards actually print correctly. You would never notice this unless you have a very nice business card, with bleed borders or custom graphics. However, if you are trying to apply for a job that isn't run out of your mom's garage, you need something better. After messing with these garbage files for more than an hour, I finally managed to get half a sheet of useable cards. I am NEVER NEVER *NEVER* buying avery again. EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight cards","review":"These are economy weight cards, although they may be adequate for some uses. Because of this light weight, I don't think they are a good buy. Avery makes other business cards that are better. The Avery on-line templates are more effort to use than they are worth and most require that you have MS Word 2007 to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very excited by this product so that I could create some low cost business cards at home. This product was horrible however. It was offcenter and all it did was waste my time and money.

Works on both laser and inkjet printers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avery offers a great product for an exceptional price","review":"I am extremely pleased with Avery Clean Edge Business Cards. This reasonably priced package makes it a breeze for everyone to create exceptionally looking business cards at great price. Granted, those wishing to have a selection of paper, embossing, or specialty types of printing will want to have cards made at a printers, this product allows anyone who needs cards-on-the-fly will greatly appreciate the convenience and ease with which they may created. I highly recommend this product and will certainly use Avery products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product","review":"When Avery says clean edge- they mean it. The best I've used so far. Easy to separate and no residual pieces of \\"hanging chads\\". 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They really ARE clean edge!","review":"I remember the ragged edges of prior cards, none of that here. These belong in every office arsenal. When your title or any info changes, you can run a sheet of these off while waiting for the professional ones to arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these cards","review":"I make handcrafted pens from exotic woods and sell them at craft shows. I have a card made up for each kind of wood that I use and give it with the pen when I sell them. I only have 27 different flavors of woods and 10 different styles of pens, each with its own care card. Add to that my own card and that makes a lot of cards to be printing and cutting!I've been doing the cards the hard way and printing them on card stock and then cutting them out. With these its so much easier! The only thing about them is that sometimes they dont separate clean. Sometimes the cards don't come apart clean and it pulls up a little feather of paper on the edge ruining that card. That's why I only gave them four stars. Now if I can get them in different colors I'll never use card stock for them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that I have these it seems Stupid that I was Ordering Cards!","review":"I love these! So easy to use! I am so happy with them. When I run out I have every intention of getting more. The instructions are clear, making this a quick set up. Anytime I need to print some cards, I just open up the file & print the cards. Simple as that. They snap apart really well. I have never had any tear. There is no way I will buy business cards again! I now have my own artwork, I love my cards & all it costs is the package of cards, some ink & a tiny amount of my time.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so.","review":"I like the clean edge cards. The only thing I don't like doing, and I've had to do this on other busincess card paper, was to trim the edges with a cutter. Every time. The calibration didn't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.If you don't mind having to trim them further, than what you need, either that, or don't use any color near the edges. Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product, avoid.","review":"I wanted a durable skin for my new Ipod that would also offer the sensitive screen protection. This case provided neither. It started peeling after a week of moderate use, and the glass screen cover (provided seperately from the screen), didn't stay in place and offered little protection. Overall, it was a very expensive error."},{"rating":"2","title":"glorious, beautiful voice and songs","review":"What a beautiful voice and lovely, rare songs. Quiet beauty and various and deep music! These songs reach deep into the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabi on the roof in July","review":"Enjoyed it. Strong performances. A little raw and in your face. But the uncomfortable things flesh out the humanity, even in an \\"artists\\" world. What struck me is no matter where you are, but especially in NYC, it's hard to \\"Grow\\" up when you're already supposed to be a grown up. That's something we all can relate to. I Like \\"Gabi on the roof in July\\". Worth a watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book","review":"this book was recommended to me by a worker at petco and i did not like the book.

Anne is such a captivating girl! You will enjoy this book. The characters are so real.

I recommend it to anyone, especially preteen and teenage girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Niacin","review":"Great price and strength. Came fast. Will help with my metabolism I am told. A little large on the size of the pills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real niacin","review":"This is real niacin, and by that I mean it's the type that gives niacin flush. However, this means it is healthier. It's better at lowering cholesterol. It's not 100% accepted, but there have been several studies that show that flushing niacin lowers LDL cholesterol a lot better than non-flush niacin.Anyway, this stuff is your typical flush niacin. However, it's the cheapest niacin I've ever bought. It's also hard to find real niacin these days (by real I mean niacin that's not flush-free).I recommend taking these right before you go to bed at first, so you don't feel the niacin flush. Eventually, your body will get used to it. But it will take a while, since these are pretty potent for first time niacin users.I will continue to use this as my primary source of niacin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swanson Niacin 500mg","review":"Best quality vitamins, fantastic customer service from Swanson. Will definitely be my new source for vitamin supplements as well as health foods. Thanks Swanson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, still relevant","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this is good book. It's a well written introduction to stars of our galaxy and does a good job explaining how the structure of the galaxy came to be understood. I've read a lot of astronomy books, and I leaned a lot from this book. It covers the less flashy side of astronomy, yet it's oriented to the general reader not the amateur astronomer.A key question in 2007, of course, is whether this book published in 1995 is now too out of date to buy. My answer is buy it. The last few chapters, which discuss topics like the Hubble constant, are now clearly dated, but history is history, and as far as I can tell (doing some cross-checking on Wikipedia) the core of the book, its discussion of Milky Way stars, holds up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY FLAWED","review":"There were a number of technical errors in this book, but it was easily twice as good as the sequel, \\"Killer Elite,\\" so I gave it twice as many stars! The \\"quick kill\\" chart for use of the blade was fairly accurate, although the effectiveness of these moves was a tad overrated, and the correct details as to how to make these moves more effective were not disclosed (presumably because Bradley does not know them). The garrotte was overrated as a weapon, and its shortcomings (of which there are many) were barely touched upon. This book does offer a number of illustrations as to the \\"best ways\\" to snap a man's neck (from behind, when he's not expecting it), although there is absolutely no safe way to practice these moves. Amusing, but far from accurate in many aspects. I gave my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This stuff was really bad. I bought it because it was cheaper and a new product for me. Vegetarians are always looking for something new and unique. This is not good. Go with the Hains products. Much better there , even if they don\`t have turkey flavor. Yuck! I\`d give this gravy 0 stars if I could........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supa Chill....best with Martini in hand","review":"This is a very smooth album both sonically and mix-wise.

The workouts are in 10 minute sessions, and if you have more time, then you can do more than one workout. The moves are simple, and well explained (great for beginners). You can really feel them working though! ;) Would recommend this to anyone who is looking to squeeze some toning workouts into their busy schedule. This is not a cardio workout, but you can always take the stroller and go for a walk, or a jog to get some cardio with your little one without having to pay for a gym membership and child care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to do and effective","review":"Cindy keeps the workouts simple yet you can feel them. She has a pleasant manner and the 10 min idea is very appealing when busy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased","review":"as someone who hasn't worked out in years and was completely out of shape, i am pleased with the pace of these workouts and the quality of the instructions. this instructor does not assume that you know anything and everything (which i like) and takes the time to keep a pleasant demeanour throughout. very encouraging. i also like the idea of being able to choose what area i'd like to focus on on what day. i always personalise/ customise my workout. good buy definitely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone has 10 Minutes","review":"I first reviewed this DVD as streaming Netflix and liked it so much that I wanted to own it. Each segment really takes ten minutes. You can choose one or more segments per day. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"The instructor is definitely not my favorite, but overall this workout is easy to follow and it's great if you're in a time crunch. What I like most about the 10 minute solution DVD's is that you can personalize your workout before you begin, which saves me a lot of the hassle I have with other workout DVD's where I have to go back to the menu and choose my next workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable","review":"The workouts are do-able on the first try, and all of them give you a nice burn without overworking you. There are things you can do to adjust the difficulty level, but I really enjoy it. The 10-minute segments are a great way to work your whole body without sacrificing too much time that you don't or can't have. I really like the instructor, Cindy Whitmarsh. Yes, she has to encourage you, but i think she's just funny in a very normal-person-trying-to-be-encouraging kind of way, perhaps a little fake, but she has to be, she's a fitness teacher on a dvd. And have you ever seen Denise Austen?Anyway, it's a good workout, worth having, definately recommend it, easy to implement in your day. I especially like the abs and buns workout, but the legs are good too. I haven't gotten a chance to buy handweights, but i've done the arm exercises without them and they're really good. If you do all 4 segments with the power stretch at the end, it's a very good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 minute solution","review":"I really liked the way this video was set up. you can pick and choose wich body part you want to work but the exercises themselves were not very strenuous at all.

Close to 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Professional","review":"I have a collection of over 100 fitness DVDs and although I am not the fittest, I can highly recommend this DVD. The programme is thorough and she has excellent form and cueing. 10 mins on each body area is used to the max and no time is wasted with unnecessary explanations. The production is of high quality and she performs the exercises with no back-up crew. Excellent toning and sculpting DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Effective Beginner's Strength Workout","review":"I like this for its simplicity, but I have grown out of it rather quickly.

I figured that it would be cheaper to rent them than to buy them, only to find out they weren't what I wanted. This one's the one I purchased. I use it all the time. It's fantastic. It got me over the chronic pain from sciatica that I've had for 30 years. Nothing else has worked like this: not acupuncture, not other exercise programs, and not yoga. If you have chronic back pain, try this to strengthen your back and stomach, which supports a weak back. It's worth every penny and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this DVD!","review":"This video is fantastic. All the exercises are do-able for beginners, even if you have limited space.

If you do the ab workouts every other day YOU WILL SEE QUICK RESULTS just like she says!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As an exercise novice and non-enthusiast, I like it.","review":"I've only tried the arms workout so far. I'm taking it slowly because I have never been motivated to stick with a weight routine before and I'd like to change that.This workout is good for me simply because it's 10 minutes so I don't have the excuse of \\"no time,\\" and it requires only hand weights. I don't know if the routine is significiant enough to make an impact on my health but at least I'm finally motivated to do strength training on a regular basis.My only complaint is that the instructor doesn't count the reps out loud, so I have to look at the screen to keep in synch with her which is hard when I'm face down on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"too watery","review":"This conditioner is good in the fact that it doesn't have fragrances, parabens, etc. and is gentle for chemically sensitive, but it is very thin and watery for a conditioner.

Well, I guess that's what I am. But this stuff does a nice job, and I use it along with the shampoo for thinning hair. I can really tell the difference. I just have to be careful to get the fragrance free, because they also carry a scented one.

Your money is better spent buying an official Sega 4x memory card. Those actually work. Even the InterAct Nexus memory cards, with 1600 blocks of memory (twice as much), work!

When I got it, the fourth slot didn't even work, so I only had 600 blocks. Then a few months later, when I tried to open a file from a different slot, it said the the card was corrupted and I had to reset it. In my experience cards made by Performance (InterAct) are VERY unsafe; don't let the price fool you into buying one.

This is a decent set of 2.0 speakers (no subwoofer), and would be a good buy if they sold for $29.95 (or even $49.95). But they don't. And that's the problem.For $100 there are MUCH better products on the market. (I've done A/B comparisons with most of them, so I'm not just blowing smoke). Yes, most of them are 2.1 systems and come with a subwoofer. But a decent 2.1 system is no harder to set up than these speakers, and the sub - which just sits on the floor under the computer desk - is a non-issue.There are plenty of people who are happy to pay what Bose is asking for these speakers, and will never realize they're paying $50 just for the Bose brand. (Which is pretty funny because when you talk to REAL audiophiles, the Bose brand stands for overpriced products, lots of hype, tons of marketing money, and mediocre audio quality - across the board)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great looks, poor sound quality","review":"Bose is well known for their super expensive stuff. These computer speakers are well built, and look great. But, like other Bose speakers, the bass is mediocre, the treble is blasting, and the midrange is non-existant. I can barily hear the vocals in music!!! They sounded so awful, that I thought the problem was with the I-Tunes software.

His new book offers a compelling approach to literature, one that is not common in the academy by trying to de-intellectualize the reading of literature by connecting it to living, not thinking, our lives. His interpretations of Edward Munch's art are particularly compelling and novel, while his readings of literary works such as Toni Morrison's BELOVED are original and make one want to run out and read the book immediately. This is a completely original and human book and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like gospel music","review":"I had heard the Ivy League's 3 biggest hits, which I liked very much (and still do). And I got the impression that Ivy League was something in the neighbourhood of merseybeat era Beatles or the Hollies. But it really isn't. When you take a closer listen to this you'll notice that most of the music actually sounds more like gospel music with lots of choirs and a very \\"old\\" sound. Not what I had in mind.I know some of you might think it's unfair of me to give just 2 stars. Ivy League isn't necessarily a bad group, just because they don't fit my personal taste in music. But be aware that this is not really a 60's POP band if that's what you're after. Their 3 biggest hits just happen to sound that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very limited study","review":"Too many writers (and genres!) are overlooked in this ideologically-blinkered study.She ignores both poetry and Sephardic literature, especially Jewish writers of the Islamic world, and generally discredits writers whose sympathy for deterritorialization or universal justice exceeds the parameters Wisse establishes for Jewish particularity. A very \\"tribalist\\" approach to identity overall, which inevitably overlooks the subversive vigor of modern Jewish literature in important contexts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the workout","review":"I waited a long time for this box set to arrive and I was highly disappointed. I was looking forward to Pilates tapes using the original Joseph Pilates methods and knew that Romana would offer the most authentic tapes. She did deliver in that respect - the techniques are just what I was expecting. What's lacking is the actual workout. One tape offers a workout of 30 minutes. The rest are 15 min or less. I kept watching one tape after another thinking the real workout was just around the corner, but it never was.Bottom line - I do not recommend this box set. It's a waste of money. The tapes are repetative and are void of the real Pilates workout I was looking for. I sincerely wish I could give a better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Effort But.......","review":"I have been studying Pilates with a certified instructor from New York City. My teacher was trained under Romana, and I have always heard legendary tales about this wonderful woman. That's why I bought this video set.I was kind of disappointed. The video was supposed to feature Romana, and it does in a way, but the videos don't have Romana teaching very much. Some of the archival footage of Romana is terrific, but when they place the name of exercises on the entire screen, which is very distracting.It's strange, too, because the woman who does the voice instruction might as well have been an aerobics instructor. It doesn't sound like the voice cues that my teacher gives me. From the voice instruction I heard, it could have been done by nearly anyone. I don't think this person was a Pilates instructor.I am sure that good intentions went into making this video, but I would recommend others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am so happy I did't listen to the negative reviews and bought \\"Romana's Pilates\\". You have to go to the source to find out what pilates really is about.It is like working with your own personal trainer. Lot of instructions! Just perfect!Do not listen to thise negative people! Get yourself this wonderfull gift if you are really interested in doing Pilates the right way. Romana is wonderfull woman and remarkable teacher! What an aura she has! Her teaching style reminds me the teching style one of my russian dance teachers had. It is probably is hard for the western student to digest.Do pilates the right way and get youself those DVDs!I recomend to get Josef Pilates books also if you are serious about pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Romana's High Standards","review":"Romana is surely one of the the most artful, colorful, and extraordinarily gifted of Joseph Pilates' students. But these videos don't show the greatness of Mr. Pilates' method, and I don't think Romana Kryzanowska would really approve of these videos herself. Some workouts don't show the correct exercise order, some demonstrators look uncertain and tentative, and Romana's wonderful spark of life is seldom revealed. Also, there is another person who actually does some of the off-screen verbal instruction. There is old film footage of Romana and Joseph Pilates, which is good to see. But, in general, these videos don't live up to Romana's high standards of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpolished","review":"I had never heard of Romana K. before my instructor told me about this well-known student of Joseph Pilates. My instructor studied with Romana for several years in New York City, and was certified by her. So I thought it might be good to buy this 4 video set. It was strange. There were several---actually many--- mistakes and uncertainties that made me believe they were actually rehearsing for a video. Some of the performers visibly caught themselves making mistakes. It was clear the performers did not know the order of some exercise sequences. The only reason I know the right order is because I take lessons.Romana may be the most revered teacher to study under Joseph Pilates, but these videos don't show it. I was kind of bummed out because I was expecting greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting But Not Great","review":"I bought this video set to have a record of traditional Pilates, and because the old film footage of Romana is good to see. By and large, though, this \\"4 volume gift set\\" is not the best gift.I've studied the Pilates method through both Peak Pilates and Stott Pilates training programs. Since I heard about Romana, I thought I would give this video set a try. The costumes were good, the lighting and sets were good. The demonstrators were accomplished, but something special was missing, that sparkle that Romana is known for revealing in her best students. But I didn't see enough of Romana teaching. Some person---who didn't seem to know Pilates very well---did the voiceover instruction.Since I by a lot of Pilates videos to learn new exercises, and to learn from different traditions within the Pilates method, I recommend \\"Pilates for Dummies\\" for beginners and \\"Classical Pilates\\" from beginner to advanced levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"very little instruction","review":"I was not impressed with this DVD set. I scanned each video and found it very difficult to follow along with the exercises when you have to keep twisting your head to look at the TV so you know where you are and what stage of the exercise you should be doing. The fast pace really wasn't the trouble, it was the lack of instruction. Truly, I think this could have been so much better by using cues, reminders (breathe, belly in, etc) and analogies to complement the workout. Actual teaching! For all the hype of how fabulous Romana is as an instructor, I was sorely let down with this production. It looks like she's great to work with in person, appearing to be a very kinesthetic (teaching/learning by feel & touch) instructor. But that's why others are involved in the production of these DVD's - to make sure the communication makes it across to the viewers. That's why I buy DVD's to workout with and not a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me if I am wrong","review":"But isn't Daria Pace, who wrote one of the good reviews, the granddaughter of Romana Kryzanowska and a teacher of Romana's Pilates?Truly, this DVD series leaves much to be desired. As anyone who bought the full collection knows, the beginning of each DVD is the same. The workouts are flawed in presentation - didn't they rehearse? - and lack the quality of instruction I expected from such a production. Considering that these DVDs feature Romana and some of the best Pilates practitioners in the world, it is a crying shame that they aren't any better than they are, and that Romana's own granddaughter has to deny her heritage to promote them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...What Can I Say?","review":"I trained to be a certified instructor in the Physicalmind system of Pilates. Physicalmind is a farily new school within the history of the Pilates method. We tend to focus upon rehabilitation and have a strong physical therapy component. We also don't encourage rhythm and dynamics as much as the classical style.Most of us in Physicalmind have heard of Romana's renowned teaching style, which is much different than the way I was trained. Romana is famous for bringing life to Pilates movement with rhythm and energy. The reason whay I bought this 4 video set is to experience Romana's excellence and ways of teaching.Unfortunately, Romana does not teach very much. And there is no description of her influence upon Joseph Pilates' method. This 4 video set did not provide the tradition I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Way","review":"I began my Stott Pilates training 6 months ago, and someone told me to get this 4 DVD set because it features the well-known Romana Kryzanowska. Since I never studied with Romana, I thought this 4 volume video set would help round out my Pilates training. Although I'm far from being an expert, I couldn't see the importance of this eminent Pilates instructor. There were moments when Romana was teaching, but she didn't teach enough to justify buying this 4 video set.People say that Romana teaches the classical approach to Pilates. These videos are definitely different than Stott Pilates, but I couldn't comprehend her supposed brilliance. She made me laugh (I used my Powerhouse) a couple of times when she was strict with a demonstrator.I'm sure that Romana is an excellent instructor, but the video didn't really express the specialness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master teacher gives us the best","review":"I had learned for a teacher who was taught by Romana - she is no longer available in this area, so was delighted to have a video made by the master teacher.

Although in the beginning this novel seemed promising (Sarah's story is very lively & well told) later the book dragged on and on...Jong's central themes (women versus men, spirit versus day to day life) were better explored in her earlier works.It seems as if Erica Jong is, yet again, trying to say the same old things in the same old way. Maybe the \\"same old things\\" part isn't what's wrong: the \\"same old way\\" part definitely is. She's an intelligent writer, seems like an intelligent & very lively person (especially from Fear of Fifty, even though that too, was repetitive) so why can't she start writing something different?

Her book appears to be more about not inventing memories, but how we all perceive our past differently, and how we are all a product of our ancestors. The whole mother/daughter relationship is not completely realized until the daughter becomes a mother herself. Her depiction of how a woman struggles to find her identity in a male society, and that she has to understand and be happy with herself before she can be happy with a man, continues to be a prevalent problem in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book got progresssively worse","review":"I loved the book at the start ,the story of the young emigrant sarah why oh why did she not stick with that instead of a boring saga of unbelivable generations of annoying women.did anyone else get sick of the consant literary references the author must think nobody on the planet has read Joyce or Oscar Wilde.Is that impressive to your readers I dont think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this","review":"I really HATED this dvd. I've been practicing yoga for about a year and a half now, and have bought about 20 dvs, mainly power yoga, and vinyhasa flow oriented stuff.

It's about 4 \\"routines\\" all like from decades apart (one seems really like an 80's aerobics video)no connection /coherence btw them what so ever, not a decent warm up, nothing worth getting this. The whole point of this one was to supposedly \\"creat your own routine\\" which in theory sounds great, but this if the routines ACTUALLY worked well together. Also, you can only select 2 sets in a row which means if you want to do more(it has 4 different routines) you have to go back after you're done with those, to the main menu to select another one.If you're into more serious yoga-no matter the type you prefer- I would definitely not recomend this ,.... a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"A good workout that gets your heart rate going, strong moves, usesopposing muscle groups, all around good.

You really get a workout, like the rest of her dvd's, but this one flows from one excercise to another for two 30 minute segments. The flowing without stopping really adds to the workout. Still a little weak on the ab workout, which is at the end of each segment, but at least it is included. As with all of her dvd's, she really pushes you and inspires you to do a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on the workout portion","review":"This is my 2nd Jari Love dvd (Slim & Lean being my first) and quite frankly it would have been my last if I didn't know what a good workout it would provide. The outfits are ridiculous (think 70's disco) and her chatter extremely annoying. Having got past that it will really get your heart pumping and your muscles working. I love the split format of either doing the complete workout or being able to do just one of the 30 minute ones if time is short. It's emphasis is more on the lower body than the Slim & Lean workout and as such you burn more calories, especially if you incorporate the step. It does get a bit boring in parts but as I only do it a couple of times a week that's ok. Just a side note: I completed Shaun T's insanity workout and now mix it up with one of those dvd's every other day and a Jari Love workout on the other days.

I found out she is only 45 years old and her face looks 60. She has great arms, but a pot belly, in her leather pants, and no rear end at all. Compared to Karen Voight and Kathy Smith, plus all the Firm videos, this one is way way at the bottom. I wish I would not have gotten it.

Whoot. Now I get to relive it on DVD as many times as I want.And to the dullards complaining about the whole Super Bowl not being included...you need to check your skull for brain matter. The NFL has NEVER EVER put a SB on tape. They never replay regular season or post-season games in anything but highlight form. Sheesh, go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"an amazing moment of history, sadly not remembered very well on this DVD","review":"As a long suffering Pats fan since birth, we had seen all the misery of losing, losing, losing and finally getting to 2 superbowls and hey.....losing! That all changed in New Orleans 2001 and what a feeling that was. WE FINALLY WIN !!!! sadly this incredible moment of glory and joy is not commemorated very well on this DVD. It's far too short for starters and there isn't full coverage of the superbowl. why?! I know it was a dull game but we still won our first superbowl ever. Why not the full game play by play? I also found the music pretty irritating and the extra's were minimal and lousy. If you were lucky enough to have taped the game as it was on TV that night, stick to that and don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improbable season...a terrific DVD!","review":"As a transplanted (and longtime) Patriots fan who now lives in Packer Country, I couldn't wait for this DVD! NFL Films did an absolutely terrific job in assembling this video. Harry Kalas' narration and the radio play-by-play of the legendary Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti made for exciting entertainment. I am reliving the season from the beginning to its thrilling conclusion over and over! I especially love watching The Snow Game in Foxborough against the Raiders. Thay was one of the greatest football games in NFL history. The AFC Championship Game against the Steelers was sweet to watch, and Super Bowl XXXVI against the St. Louis \\"Lambs\\" is still incredible and exciting viewing. It is no wonder that this DVD (and Video) is the most-purchased sports video ever! Everybody loves an underdog, and the Patriots were the ultimate 'dogs that won the Super Bowl. If you are a sports fan (not just a Patriots fan), this DVD is a MUST-OWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected, THE GAME not included!","review":"I LOVE the New England Patriots. When I saw this DVD come on the market, I knew I had to buy it. Nowhere in the advertisments did it clearly say...THE COMPLETE GAME IS NOT ON THIS DISC....I expected to see all 60 glorious minutes of the game, instead, this disc is just an edited highlight film. So, it doesn't capture the excitement of the game, it has been sanitized and packaged. I think the entire Superbowl portion of the disc is about 15 minutes. Its nice to have, but for those of you who wanted the entire game in DVD quality audio and video, this disc doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERBOWL XXXVI NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS CHAMPIONSHIP VIDEO","review":"I ordered this video as a gift for my brother.

I was also surprised to receive my copy a full week ahead of it's release date. Maybe if they had waited a week longer, they could have put the game on the disc. The best way to describe this disc is the extras they should have put on a Super Bowl DVD, but no Super Bowl.

Growing up in Massachusetts, and only eighteen years of age, I found myself waiting for one of my teams to win a championship. As the biggest Pats fan in the world, I actually have many people that will back me up on that statement, last year's championship run could not have been better. Sometimes at night I find myself watching clips on the super bowl and find myself in tears. It was simply the greatest moment in my entire life. This DVD helps rekindle those great feelings, and I strongly reccomend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Bowl?????","review":"Well being a long time suffering Jet fan I can honestly say I brought this DVD for the U2 performance.

Or should we start with the fact that this DVD is only highlights. It does not contain the actual super bowl game.I would trade all of the season long highlights for the entire super bowl game on DVD.Look at the cover, doesn't it appear that this is a copy of the game? \\"Super Bowl XXXVI\\" ! You would think the (entire) game would be on it.If you want a summary of the Patriots season, post season highlights and Super Bowl highlights - This is for you.If you want to see the BEST super bowl game ever played, watch the tape that you or your friend made of the actual game when it aired.I would change the rating to 5 starts IF the cover used the word HIGHLIGHTS, or something similar.

The best Superbowl that I have ever seen. I was excited to learn that the DVD of this game would come out and was expecting the whole game. Especially after it was confirmed the U2 halftime show was included as a special feature. I was very dissapointed when I found out it had a review of all the Pats games and only a few minutes on the SB. Although the NFL Films productions are good.

However, I was one of the lucky few to go to the game in New Orleans and to see the Super Bowl highlights on the DVD, it was just amazing. The commercials that open the DVD are garbage and it's somewhat repugnant that they are there. They should have had more on Steve Grogan and what about John Hannah?! Why didn't he get a spot on there? He's the only Patriot in the Hall of Fame, he deserved a nice, long, spot on the DVD that showed his horrific hits -- esspecially when he caved in John Matuzak's face mask. Now THAT was a pull block!

Unfortunately this was not the case .Having the highlights from the season were great but not to have the entire Superbowl play out at the end was disappointing .The other bonuses were fine but most fans I think would want to watch every heart-wrenching moment from the early Patriot lead to the Rams tying the game late in the 4th, listening to John Madden's ill-advised advice to just kneel on the ball and wait for overtime . This could have been a great DVD but instead it's just an OK one ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus DVD","review":"This DVD is so bogus, the Raiders should have won that playoff game, this title should be marked with an asterik!!

The only color it printed in was yellow. We could not take it off and throw away because the printer instructions say that if you remove the cartridge before the \\"out of ink\\" indicator comes on it will mess up the printer sensors so we had to suffer and endure thru using the ___ thing until it was used up.

It has many useful mathematical formulas for translating latitude-longitude coordinates on the Earth into x-y coordinate on maps of various projections.

When a murder occurs in the wealthy estate that Blanche is working in at the time, she becomes the prime suspect. I almost fell into a trance and could not keep myself from turning the pages of this book, especially when reading about how Blanche gets herself into these homes. The way Barbara Neely strategically positions Blanches strong sense of humor really helped to keep my interest in reading this novel, and the fast pace helped as well.

With the exception of a young man suffering from Down's Syndrome, all of the white people in the book are despicable. Though Blanche has phone conversations with her friends and family, the people physically present are caricatures of various degrees of evil ranging from worthless to monstrous. We are stuck with a lot of one-dimensional characters and no action to distract us. I found the plot centering around the rich old aunt quite unbelievable.Ms. Neely is a very good writer.

I have read a lot psychology and find the subject interesting. I am educated - professional engineer and attorney. I usually understand what I am reading. But this book forced me to re-read sentences and paragraphs because I could not understand what the authors were saying. Often I just moved on. Either the authors were not sure themselves or I just couldn't get it. But two things were clear, the book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice with high-sounding amorphous words that seem to be intended to leave you either in awe or just completely frustrated.

I got so much out of the scheduling suggestions in Babywise that I was really looking forward to some input (or even affirmation ..) ... so irritating to have high expectations. And I am sorry that I bought the others too... maybe I will get something out of the Potty version. I am much better off with What to Expect in the First Years and / + the Toddler Years version.

Ezzo's books offer a valuable perspective on the MANY different styles of parenting, giving examples of outcomes and suggestions for handling behavior. As you read it, take from it what you need and believe and what pertains to you and leave the rest alone.

There were no failure to thrive issues or eating issues. Now that he is 18 months old, we are entering the fun toddler years with tantrums, not listening, etc. and I wanted something to help with some of these situations. I bought Toddlerwise, even though alot of people said it was useless (because I just loved Babywise). I wanted to see for myself. Well, they were right.

As I read the book I noted many areas where it was obvious that Ezzo was overemphasizing his own pet peeves.Most of the parents I know who support these parenting methods are over-eager for a \\"show-child\\" that perfoms for the parents. They want there 3-year-old playing piano, etc. Most of them put their children in every group activity available, anything that gets the parent attention.I caution parents to consider the long term results.

It is a nice size and does the job pretty admirably, especially for the price.I use this with Kensington Bluetooth headphones, so it is possible that the reception issues are more to do with the headphones than the Jabra. But I suspect it is due to the Jabra, since reception issues come up when I put it in my pocket (if it hangs out of my pocket, no reception issues). Since we're talking a distance of at most 3 feet from pocket to headphones, that any interference exists is a little disappointing. There is a delay with this product, too, which might be due to the Bluetooth protocol.

The device comes with a USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable (pretty standard) and will charge via any USB port.

On a technical level by Mark Epstein in his facinating books \\"Thoughts without a Thinker\\" and \\"Going to Pieces without Falling Apart\\" and Jon Kabat-Zinn on a more interpersonal level. What really ruined this book for me were the constant 'commericals' for her Quiet Corner products. Almost every page had references to what seems to have become a cottage industry for her in Quiet Corner seminars as well as her other books. It quickly became quite annoying so that I quit the book after 50 pages. The concepts in the book are a great idea, but has been done better elsewhere. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita Magnesium Hypoid Saw","review":"This is an awesome saw! It's just what I've been searching for (Finally - Thank you Makita!)to replace my still running Makita 5077B. The weight is about the same as the ol' 5077B. I liked this saw so much that I immediately sold my Mag Skil Saw and my Makita 5277NB although both were virtually brand new. The Makita 5377MG feels solid and the rubberized grips on the guard, bevel and height adjustments are very comfortable. It's obvious that this saw may not withstand the abuse a Skil saw would on a construction site but this is not an issue with me because I tend to baby my tools and not drop them much. This is a smooth performing and quality tool! The only thing I miss with this saw is the blade brake I've become accustomed to on the old Makita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and easy to use","review":"The Makita is a great improvement over my old Bosch saw which, among other faults, seemed designed specifically to direct saw dust into my face. The Makita, in contrast, keeps dust away from the user and the line to be cut. It makes accurate cuts, is easy to adjust, and easily rips through plywood with the standard blade. The Makita is much heavier than I am used to but I consider that a good quality. The base and its connection to the saw frame looks heavy duty. Overall I am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting-edge Review","review":"The saw is great, but the rip fence that Amazon offers for it is NOT the proper one. In fact, I\\"m unable to find a proper rip fence from Makita, but Skil makes one P/N 13896, that fits perfectly except for the locking screw which you have to get from Makita, because the one from Skil won't fit the saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent saw","review":"I use a lot of Makita tools and find them all excellent - this one included. I needed a more powerful saw for a lot of underlayment cutting and this does the job well. Good balance and weight for me. The one star reduction is because it would be nice if it didn't torque twist quite so much at start-up, a soft-start electronic start circuitry would do it. None-the-less, once you get used to it, and anticipate it, it's ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnesium Not for Mesium","review":"don't let the magnesium light-weight come-on influence your buying decision. all these saws cut well. and most will last a long time . i bought this one because i wanted a lighter saw . and it might be .. . but if so its not by much. i was very dissappointed by its weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Heavy","review":"If you are sawing above your head or a long time, this saw is too heavy for a smaller person."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"all the best things from the older makita hypoid, plus all new features and magnesium for reduced weight. every framing saw needs to bevel to at least 50 degrees. well this one goes beyond that and bevels to 51.5 degrees. every saw needs a sky hook. i like the top handle too.this saw is so sweet to use. it's so powerful AND lightweight. i like using this one over the bosch. that cord thing bosch has going is good in theory, but my cords don't fit it. it's a hypoid so you never have to change the oil like you have to on worm drive saws. it has a lower blade guard, so it wont hang up while cutting shims and bevels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really solidly built","review":"I'd love to know what parts that other guy had magically fall off, because I can't find a single fit or finish flaw with mine. This thing is built like a tank, but doesn't weigh you down too badly. I'm a bit concerned about the longevity of the lower guard spring, but for right now, it works fine.I chose this over the Bosch worm drive model purely because of the lack of need to drain and flush any oil out of the gearbox with kerosene, and I have no regrets. It ploughs right through wood, doesn't jump around when it starts up and has a really steady base. Not sure what else you'd need a circular saw to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hypoid saw","review":"This is a really good hypoid saw. The magnesium makes it very lightweight, it's got an integrated rafter hook, the over-sized adjustment handles are easy to use, the lip on the blade guard doesn't catch or grab even on angle cuts, 15 amps is plenty of power and the balance is good.So why only four stars? I'm a bit tweaked that this saw doesn't come with a rip fence. There is a slot for a rip fence and other Makita saws I've purchased have come with a rip fence. If it came with the fence I'd give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sand Art Burner Covers","review":"The Corelle Sand Art burner covers that I bought on Amazon are great.

In the tournament Botvinnik dominated Keres, Smyslov, Boleslavsky, Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. He then set about extracting the ultimate secrets from every game by dint of the most precise analysis.

The author uses concise vocabulary and explanations, and gets straight 2 the point. The best part of this book are the ref. that are at the end of each chapter. To understand and appreciate the richness of this book, you have to have an understanding 'bout the topic of data structure (preferably in C++). The author does a very good explanation about the topic of graphs, the logic used is simple by following his examples and explanation.

It just dawned on me today when I couldn't understand the Shell sort on page 256 - this is a simple concept. I had to reference another book in order to understand it and as it turns out, it was a simple concept. A second example of the confusion is the Huffman coding sequence on page 398 - I am having to go onto the internet because I just plain don't understand the example.

This is evidenced in the last couple of shorts from 1945, especially in \\"If A Body Meets A Body\\", where it's painfully evident by watching Curly that his mannerisms have slowed & his speech has begun to slur.Hopefully Sony will continue with the remarkable roll they've been on in releasing the shorts in order, especially the ones with Shemp shorts & even with Joe Besser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate turkey","review":"This has to be the ultimate turkey of all time.

It's actually worse than worthless because having one of these in your car for an emergency will make you think you have the capability to inflate a flat spare, for example, when in fact there's a good possibility you might not be able to. This cheap compressor took 10-15 min to get a few psi into a tire a year or so ago when it was new (it bounced around on the ground a bit if I recall correctly) and I just tried it again today and ran it for 15-30 minutes and the needle didn't even get off zero, even though I tried repositioning the hose nozzle on the schraeder valve. It was relatively quiet though but that doesn't matter when it won't pump any air. I'd suggest paying a little more for a better compressor that will suit your needs best (~$40-$130) or consider using a good foot pump (~$10-$30), depending on what your needs are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great White's Jack Russell shows he's just as gifted solo!","review":"Well crafted songs by Great White's lead singer Jack Russell.

It presents the climax of Bram Stoker's overrated novel from Mina Harker's point of view and shows us what happened to her and the other characters afterward. It turns out that, with the blood of Dracula flowing in her veins, Mina has far more sympathy for the Count and his minions than was hinted at in Stoker's novel. Furthermore, all is not quiet at Castle Dracula despite the destruction of the famous vampire...Stoker's original novel was overlong and frequently dull. The characters were one-dimensional stalwart men and fainting damsels. Author Ellen Bergstrom has filled out these characters and added a feminist perspective, not to mention a healthy dose of sex. Purists may shudder at her approach, but I found it to be an interesting take on a novel that really doesn't deserve to be treated as sacrosanct and untouchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seller Delivers!","review":"great seller... book delivered promptly. would deal with again in a heartbeat. thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A desecration of a classic!","review":"There have been some pretty lame attempts to write sequels to Bram Stoker's classic DRACULA, but this is one that borders on blasphemy!

It's a shame that Stoker's novel was never officially copyrighted in the U.S., and that the international copyrights have all lapsed. At least then the Count would be safe from well-meaning clods and talentless hacks like Bergstrom. You want good DRACULA pastiches?

Buy this book and you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent no bull","review":"Well written and excellent, great info in the first 50 pages. Much better than the Ajax on Java for the nutshell which seems to worm around. This book tells it like it is. Just my opinion. I think anyone who is being inundated with Ajax boasting should read this and see what its all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Pragmatic Ajax: A Web 2.0 Primer (Pragmatic)This is a very good book, if you want to jump into Web 2 development.

It turned out that I was expecting way too much. With the only semi-recognizable character (Dean Cameron, whom I still consider brilliant) having to carry the movie, which consisted of an awful plot and even worse acting, it really turned into a one man show. But, if you have an hour and a half and you think you need to punish yourself, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Nothing like the classic ski school, that made you laugh. This was a waste of film, and amazon is going to charge you for it. Save yourself the pain I had to endure, nothing like the orginal, not that I expected to be, can't replace a classic. Acting was shoddy Dean tried but couldn't cover for the hideous attempt at acting from the other characters. No Fitz, No Johnny, No Ed. You can see what is coming from the beginning so makes it a no brainer he is going to get the girl, or at least thinks he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed sequel","review":"NO comparison to the first one.

Bean and O'Malley bring the characters perfectly to life. The great thing is that this is period costume drama that isn't exclusively for the girls; Sharpe marches with Wellington through Portugal and Spain (eventually to Waterloo) and there's plenty of mayhem for the lads. They're films you can watch on a cerebral level, learning about the historical events portrayed (with no more than a little dramatic license). On the other hand, the visceral engagement of the hard life of a nineteenth century soldier means that you can get the boys round with a few beers and cheer Sharpe, Harper and the riflemen of His Majesty's South Essex regiment on as they fell Frenchment left, right and centre. This is a world where the problems are all the sort that can be solved with raw courage and a volley of musket fire. Turn off your jaded modern sensibility and enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Sergeant Sharpe saves the life of Sir Arthur Wellsley soon to be the Duke of Wellington.You Need to have a sense of history to understand what is going on, and to understand that the Duke of Wellington was a upper class snob that hated common soldiers.Coming from a Grenadier Guardsman based at Wellington Barracks in London, this is quite a complement. Very Enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent one for avid war fanatics...","review":"Fictional soldier R. Sharpe to me, seems almost a historical and factual figure after watching the series. Sean Bean gives one heck of a performance. I had an interest in the Napoleonic Wars before, and this video series caught my eye. I decided to watch it. Turned out to be pretty worthwhile. I encourage everyone out there to view it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"I stumbled upon this series when they first debued on public television. Although I am not a big fan of the the Napolianic Wars, I was captivated by the story of Richard Sharpe and company. It has something for everyone: romance, action, comedy, and tragedy. \\"Sharpe's Enemy\\" is my personal favorite. For the \\"Sharpe\\" fan out there, I strongly reccomend \\"Horatio Hornblower\\".

After being playing guitar for about 16 years now and being only an intermediate or upper-intermediate player, I find this kind of teaching just a nonsense...The concepts are barely explained and 80% of the time the guy is telling you \\"play 12th fret on 5th string, then 10th on 4th...\\". IS THIS A JOKE? He tells you how to play the exact solo he has played, but not HOW TO USE the modes, harmonic minor scale, etc.I can't understand why he keeps on telling you the EXACT NOTES he is playing as it is just a waste of time. Instead, what I wanted to know is how to spread the patterns through the fretboard, how to construct the chord progressions and when and how to use each mode/scale.Skip it, there are much better instructional tools out there. (Fretboard navigator by Jamie Humphries is much much better, for instance).Greetings from Spain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This intake for the dodge durango 4.7 L was a joke form the time I took it out of the box.

So I called up Volant and these guys are completely clueless they told me that they knew about this problem and said I could send it to them and they could drill into the intake and make a spot for the sensor and and send it back to me.

The Center City Brass Quintet plays mostly works written for brass quintet, with the exception of the Maurer piece (which is not very interesting), rather than the range of arrangements so common on brass recordings.

How disappointing. BTW, the normal Chinese air hose failure is a leak in the inner liner that causes a giant bubble and then a burst of the outer jacket.

She was a cook. I had never thought about how much of her identity would be built on that. I had never thought about how \\"cooks don't get sick\\" - especially in a time where sick days were unheard of.Mary Mallon didn't feel sick, didn't recall ever having typhoid, and lived when disease prevention was just begining.Bourdain tells her story from a cook's point of view. He is sympathetic but doesn't make excuses.Personally, I quite enjoy his writing style and found this to be a quick, intelligent read that made me reassess my opinion on Typhoid Mary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book like the plague","review":"I read this book with faith that the book would pick up, that the plot wouldthicken, that, at least, everything would come together at the end.None of these happened for me.The earth did not move.I would rate TM a 1: don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about bad conditions in turn of the century kitchens","review":"The author seems to be covering up his lack of research with a rather maudlin bonding with a fellow cook(i.e. Mary). I now know more than I ever wanted to know about turn of the century kitchens and the abused psyches of chefs,but very little about Mary Mallon. Better sources are Biography magazine's article about her and Leavitt's Typhoid Mary: Captive to the Public's Health."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to bourdain's usual standard","review":"Bourdain is a brilliant writer, but his heart doesn't seem to be in this book. It feels as if someone asked him to write this book as an assignment, his usual style of pop-culture loaded hyperbole only takes off in a few chapters. Several entire chapters are filler copied from other sources.'Kitchen Confidential' and 'Cook's Tour' are definately his most inspired books. If you have read those as well as 'The Nasty Bits' and are hungry for more I highly recommmend his crime fiction novel 'Bone in Throat'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"I could hear Tony telling the story!

It was an interesteing peek into a difficult life, very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANTHONY BOURDAIN DELIVERS","review":"Anthony Bourdain provides a good, solid story, written in his fluid, irreverent prose. Too bad he says he'll not revisit this genre (non-fiction, historical), because he makes history fun to read. He puts Typhoid Mary in an historical and culinary context, as only he can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless fare","review":"As a substitute for thorough research and intelligent reflection, the author offers up a full course dinner of \\"probablies\\" and \\"maybes.\\" Then, to disguise the lack of substance, he adds liberal dashes of personal invective and Political Correctness--he decides a photograph of a leading figure in the story reveals a \\"geek\\" and a \\"nerd,\\" who furthermore, for undisclosed reasons, is also a \\"racist.\\" (There are no photographs in the book.) Any woman is automatically oppressed and heroic. You get the idea.So much better to stick to facts and let the reader judge.Worst of all, the style is bizarre. The book reads like a first draft by an author convinced that anything he puts down on paper is pure gold. New York is full of competent editors, and some honest ones. Next time, use one of the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...","review":"I read this book for a project for a Criminalistics class for a Summer camp. I was looking forward to learning about Typhoid Mary and all about her problems as she lived her life carrying the deadly typhoid. I was a little disappointed to find out that a lot of the book was about the context of the life she lived in. I'm sure that for some...that would be a nice touch, but I was looking more forward to reading about the case than about society. But other than that, I thought it was a good read. I found myself laughing quite a bit, thanks to the clever way that Anthony Bourdain narrated this novel. Not a Number #1 choice...but not the worse i've read either. I'll let you decide....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good","review":"Based on the cover and the name, I wasn't expecting much from this book. But when I flipped through it, I very pleasently suprised... I would say at least 50% of this book is unique. I've never seen anything like the Abstract chapter (which is mainly why I bought the book). Some of the chapters that contain material I've seen before were done better than I've seen in any other book. The buttons chapter, for example, is better than anything in the Wow book or the Down and Dirty book and the Interfaces chapter is more detailed and informative that anything I've sen in another Photoshop book... on the Earth, Text, and Trimmings chapters--which are just more polished versions of tutorials you can find on the Web.

There are many holes in motivation, plot, and history. The author can't decide if Lily is Jackie Chan or Florence Nightingale, and when Lily does kill in self-defence ... it goes nowhere. Lily grieves for her Great Lost Love, Rafi (Ralph Landon), for about 5 minutes after learning he died a year earlier, and hastily acquires a new suitor about twice her age.

My guess is she's locked into a particular religious dogma that doesn't allow for free thought. Hence, the title is misleading. That which is sacred to some is soundly mocked. At the same time, the information about the minerals is excellent and the photographs are beautiful. Guess it's true - that which we fear most in ourselves, we mock most in others. Maybe she's a closet shaman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"This could have been a very excellent book but the author spends way too much time beating a dead horse. To her \\"facts\\" are only what can be measured by machine and everything else is \\"fallacy\\". While she is very knowledgable on the stones themselves, her debunking of the myths seems to center around information from questional books proporting to give the history of Atlantis and Mu.

I also highly recommend cholesterol-and-health.com as a great place to bust the myth that saturated fats and cholesterol are the cause of heart disease, a pair of yet-to-be-proven hypotheses supported and reinforced by this book.

Love and ALO, Matt Costa belongs to a select group of artists that can call themselves musical friends of Jack Johnson. You get that same positive feeling when you listen to this first full Matt Costa album (not an E.P.) as when you listen to Jack Johnson. But Matt Costa is more diverse. A song like Whiskey and Wine is not a song that Jack Johnson would have made. You could say they went to the same school but they got their own styles after graduation. My personal favourite is Astair. Shimmering Fields is a close second. Other highlights are Yellow Taxi, Sunshine and the title-track Songs We Sing. And because it's an album that is so fresh, open and pleasent to listen to you will listen to it a lot when in doubt what to play. The result is that you'll end up singing these songs (along)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.","review":"This is really a great cd.

His simple, unaffected style of singing was the appeal for me. However, after listening through half of songs Matt sings, I had to turn it off, for two reasons. His songs are derivative, musically speaking, and his singing style bothered me.

It worked great the first day until I leaned over to pick something off the floor at my office. The pedometer popped off my waistband, fell about 2 feet to a carpeted floor, and stopped calculating completely. Needless to say, I was disappointed that the pedometer didn't even make it through the first 24 hours and sent it back. I understand that pedometers should be \\"motion sensitive\\", but given the punishing that runners and hikers put them through, they should certainly be able to survive the occasional drop -- especially to a carpeted floor.

Somehow Arthur manages to tie all of the above subjects together into a fascinating, adventurous, educational work of fiction. Aside from a few contrived additives to the plot to make everything work, Arthur does a wonderful job in this highly descriptive and literary narrative of drawing you into an adventure which is used as a metaphor for life itself.I found myself limiting the number of pages I would read per day toward the end of the novel, because I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ LE GUIN INSTEAD","review":"If you want to read about an all-female expedition to Antarctica, read Ursula LeGuin's short story, \\"Sur\\" -- it's amazing, and much better than this.

I think that all this competitive parenting is out of control. Now I have something to point to when we get into a discussion. Dr. Guthrie looks at the big picture - something too many of us parents forget to do! And it helps to see how we're being sold this idea of 'perfection' for our kids and to know that you don't have to join the herd and in fact your kids will be better off if you don't. I've recommended this book to a couple of friends. I think if more people read it and relaxed about their kids 'achievement' in sports and school and everywhere, everyone - parents and kids - would be better off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible adaptation of the book","review":"Like many other reviewers here, I loved the book and was anticipating the screen adaptation. To my utter disappointment, this Lifetime movie version was just a hack job, and did a complete disservice to the wonderful work in was adapted from.The movie leaves out major characters and plot threads, and made me feel like I was watching a disjointed movie. That is what this movie is - disjointed and confusing. There is no real character development and because so much of the original novel has been deleted or changed, we are left with unanswered questions and puzzlement as to why some characters behave the way they do.I would recommend reading the book first and if you like it, then you'd probably want to skip this poor excuse of an adaptation. I hope someone will eventually give the novel the right cinematic treatment it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"No need to stress the point further as I think the other reviewers have done a good job. Same; I have read the novel and was really compelled and fixed on it as soon as I started getting deeper into it. The movie was indeed terrible, and left out SO many crucial key points in the book that led to the [unsettled or not] conclusions at the ending. Actors were okay, but the way the plot was laid out; ugh!Not worth it. Rent it from a library or something, but read the book first.

While many of us don't have the access or funds for beautiful antiques or a head gardener, Williams is refreshingly unpretentious. She wisely took her time, taking each room in her home at a time, lovingly creating rooms with vibrant color and immense charm.

In addition to the outstanding photographs, there are recipes, advice on living with dogs, and integrating exotic plants into the garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected...there should be a 6 star category!","review":"I am a collector of reference books on home decorating and an avid gardener.

The text is so informative and interesting to read and I love the way Bunny talks to you like you are sitting across from her having a cup of tea.

I cannot wait to sit down again and slowly pour over each beautiful page. Thanks Bunny, your home is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! WOULDNT IT BE NICE !!","review":"I've enjoyed seeing other decorating by Bunny Williams in various magazines. A couple of years ago I saw her conservatory dining room featured in a magazine and fell in love with it. Wonderful!!! I understand the concept of the \\"decorating\\" done in the main house but wish it would have been a little more - can't think of a good word - maybe polished. Would love to see the whole compound. Especially loved the Barn. What a wonderful room to enjoy alone or with lots of friends. I am much in favor of a large room with difference sitting areas. Makes much more sense for enjoying and entertaining when everyone can gather together in one area rather than in 2 or 3 rooms. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, rich and inspiring","review":"My sister, an avid collector with the incredible gift of using great taste to create a homey atmosphere, recommended this book and I can see why. The author's love of \\"home\\" permeates every stunning page. Those wanting a \\"how-to\\" book should look elsewhere; this is the book for \\"why-you-should\\". It teaches one of the biggest lessons one must learn when creating a home, that of patience.Of course, like any \\"affair\\", the object of affection will barely be tolerated by some. If you don't understand why you wax the legs of a chair with a hole in the arm, don't buy this book. If it's strange to you that someone is satisfied with a color that fits the room rather than matching the Pottery Barn palette, you'll be happier with a few copies of this month's decorating magazines. Otherwise, invite the dogs to curl up next to you while you slowly turn the pages, luxuriating in the lovely fun, at least vicariously, of knowing how you want to live and having the means to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She finally admits to having a gardener!","review":"I had high expectations for the book and did read the entire thing. As other reviewers commented, her rooms were done beautifully, then crammed more full of just too much stuff. She seems to be such a collector, unable to delete anything and even going so far a buying the house accross the street because she couldn't imagine anyone else owning it! It is now the guest house, basicly the third \\"guest quarters\\" outside of the main house. But what really irked me was how these really magnificent gardens unfolded in front of me, chapter after chapter, all introduced in the first person, ie \\"I decided to do create this\\" or \\"I love to do that with my gardens\\". The volume of gardens is far beyond the ability for one working woman who just lives onsite on the weekends. Not until the very end of the book does she 'fess up to having a \\"gardener\\", a \\"head gardener\\" no less.

Even after numerous nozzle purges, ink splattered all over the page, there were veritcal discolored lines in the photos.Worst of all, it didn't quite fit properly. When I tried to remove it (following the instructions in the Epson manual meticulously) the Dataproducts cartridge got jammed in the cartridge housing (actually stuck onto the \\"spikes\\" the open the ink wells... my guess is the covering is not quite the same thickness as the original model) and so the cartridge cover (the purple plastic lid over the cartridge) wouldn't pop up.

Walker has done a great job with wonderful attention to detail. This book is good for the novice or more advanced people interested in Feminie/spiritual studies. Granted the information contained is contrary to what I had been brought up with my whole life, I find the information revealing and mentally inspiring. I am no historian, nor bible thumper.. I have read some of the other reviews her book has generated. That is what prompted me to write this review. I had to speak out on the books behalf. The material in her book is going to be controversial. History has long been censored and rewritten by the winners. You know, the people who only want you to know 'so much'. Show me an author who does not write with a point of view and I'll show you a phone book. So in order to wake from ignorance one must educate themselves. This book can have a nice part in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get the Myths and Secrets one instead","review":"I LOVED her other book, Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets, and so I snapped this one up, but was hugely disappointed by it. The content and the research in it are just not as good. And the artwork that accompanies stuff is not very good, nor is there very much of it.Frankly, I think this book was churned out in order to cash in on the success of the Myths and Secrets book. A lot of the material in it is a re-hashing of that book, which I personally can't recommend enough. It really realigned my whole perception of all different kinds of religious and cultural stuff, and I sincerely recommend that if you're wondering whether or not to buy this book or that one, go get the Myths and Secrets one instead. I don't think this adds substantially to her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have her other Dictionary, it's great, too","review":"Barbara Walker's research so resonates with me that as soon as I saw that this book was published I jumped to buy it.

I hope she keeps doing more and more research and writing more and more and I have an opportunity to buy her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recapturing Women's Art","review":"This massive compilation of symbols that used to belong to women and the goddess is a book I keep on my desk, next to Birds of Michigan, and Wildflowers. This is a reference book writers and artists can use often in their work. Walker doesn't take up room with justification for interpretation - history is in the potsherd. Consider that the ubiquitous modern use of \\"god\\" and male sacred imagery claims preeminence in antiquity, although the masculine role in procreation wasn't known for thousands of years. Most symbols, and iconic depictions were feminine; representative of the power of nature that was observable, even before the written word. Like most of recorded history, the powers that took the power write the books and redrew the pictures. Walker changes that here. I would have liked to have discovered this book a few decades ago, but I'm glad it's here for me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailormoon SuperS: Genious or Piece of Garbage?","review":"This video begins SailormoonSuperS: the most controversial season of Sailormoon.

Randi carries his arguments too far and when they don't fall in line with the evidence in hand, such arguments can only be called personal prejudice or opinion. Randi can explain the surgery part but what about the medicine prescription ? How can an illiterate prescribe medicine that too in such unusual and strong doses? And above all the prescriptions were effective. The number of cases that were cured defies any explanation like placebo etc. Even if such high success rate could be 'explained away' as placebo then such placebo effect should itself become a focus of fresh research. Yes, as a last word on this subject, we cannot subscribe to blind beliefs especially in matters concerning human body for it may lead to tragedies and men like Arigo and Rasputin should only be regarded as exceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Painted Pots","review":"This book is wonderful!

When it arrived I eagerly opended the box and wrapping, and began my inspection. I was disappointed overall.Yes, it was just as ugly as I had thought. Worse than this though, was the fact that when the case was lying flat, I could depress the top with the palm of my hand with ease a significant way, so much so, that I felt any impact to the top or back would certainly result in a damaged guitar.

You'll scratch your head - and perhaps behind your ear - wondering who really is whose pet.The author, Mr DeVito, has given \\"10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me\\" the added dimension of training tips and thoughtful insights, which are balanced with life lessons learned from our relationships dogs, and how to apply these lessons to that truly difficult and untamed animal, the human.If you haven't bought \\"10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me\\" you're barking up the wrong tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Osborn Skews Evidence for a desired result","review":"This guy should go into business writing for faux news with this kind of cowardly research:1. Osborn defines an atrocity as the murder, torture, or mutilation of civilians, the wounded and prisoners. Different definitions would obviously produce different totals.2. Osborn does not count Indian deaths on the Trail of Tears (because these were allegedly unintentional.) Probably looked at old US Army documentation, go figure.3. However, he does count episodes of post-mortem mutilation, even of combatants killed in open battle, because there were more instances of Indians doing this.Osborn does a great job spinning history to his desired white man not as savage as evil Indians approach.A special thanks to Wikipedia for highlighting Osborns fantasized reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Jiped","review":"I bought this dvd, to find out I got the dvd case with no dvd in it.

I like mindless action and I like gross humor, but this was really tasteless."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's.... yeah.... bad","review":"Let me start off by saying that from time to time I do enjoy a film that is light on plot and heavy on action and style. This film got the weak plot aspect taken care of and it DOES have a TON of action... but too much over the top action to even make it enjoyable for me (and i liked the first Transporter!). I wanted to enjoy this, i really did. I love Clive and Paul but they couldn't save this for me. The jokes and one liners were eye rollers and the action just too outrageous. I understand the concept but feel it was poorly executed. Come to think of it, i was rolling my eyes during all the action sequences too at how ridiculous it was. Some people enjoy that... i guess this time i'm not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only lasted 20 minutes and that was enough","review":"Well i only lasted 20 minutes with this crap. It was so over the top and rediculous that it wasn't worth watching beyond 20 minutes.Ummm.....jumps through a glass window holding a baby and noone gets hurt.

Written and directed by Michael Davis. Without a worthy screenplay, the film is nonetheless an interesting homage to the cinema of John Woo and his colleagues from Hong Kong. So quit the idea of counting how many bullets a gun can shoot and don't try to understand how the mean guys always manage to find Smith and the baby. Such details are not important in this kind of movie. Relax and Enjoy !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection (?) renders this unplayable--stay away!","review":"I tried playing this on all three of my DVD players at home. On all three, all I could get to play was a \\"New Line\\" animation.Perhaps others will not experience the same problem I did--but I am using new technology players--and after doing a little reading, I realized this disc contains some sort of all-new copy protection that makes it unplayable on a large number of players. What a PITA. Had to return the thing--and still haven't seen this movie.Ridiculous. I really don't think customers should support things like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the name implies, lots of shooting...with Carrots?","review":"A very different action movie. Litterally, the movie is esentially about 90 minutes of shooting. I am still confused if we really know the main character, or if he really is just a strange mysterious guy that tries to help a mom and baby. At any rate, mindless violence for the action flick fan. Worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"the award for the best use of a carrot goes to...","review":"This is a cartoon for men. A looney toon on steriods. It is a comedy and I haven't laugh so hard since Clint Eastwood's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. Think of this as a parody of all mindless action/gun battle movies that are cranked out for direct to DVD. It is a hoot. That's right a hoot! There is a plot and it is ashame that it gets in the way of all the violence. Giamatti is a wonderful villian and his wife..... Is is grosse? Yes. Is it bloody? Yes. Is it violence? Absolutely. Is it fun? Oh yeah! This is movie for men and no women are allowed. Especially pregant ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous,but fun","review":"What is wrong with you people? This was one of the most \\"unbelievable\\" movies I have ever seen.It is pure fantasy,and if any of you thought this was going to be an action movie with a believable plot,you were badly mistaken.At least this movie knows it is silly and far fetched,not like the regular action movies that really insult your intelligence (outrunning explosions etc..)Those are the movies you should be mad at.Unless you actually believe that garbage,but I'm sure you're too clever to be fooled by those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't look away","review":"I happened upon this movie just passing through and suddenly I was spellbound. Partly out of concern for the baby and then I had to know the \\"why\\" of it all. I sat on the sofa thirsty and wanting out of my work clothes but I could not take my eyes off the screen. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, exciting, and bloody.","review":"This movie is exactly as its title states. The movie is action packed from beginning to end. If you enjoy henchmen getting killed, and Paul Giamatti playing a bad guy, then this is the movie for you. Its silly and over the top, so if you're in the mood for heavy character ties and development, this is not the movie to watch. If you are however in the mood for a good ol' fashion \\"Shoot em' Up\\" then I suggest not reading any further and just adding this gorgeous piece of work to your cart. Seriously, stop reading this. Knock it off. You're starting to get on my nerves. Knock it off already! You know what, you're rude, you're a jerk, and I'm done talking to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The name says it all","review":"Shoot 'Em Up is straightforward right from the get go: It tells you before you even watch it what the movie is about. And it delivers just that. This movie prefers to be vague and mysterious rather than spend time on pointless back-story banter, which means more of the movie is pure action. If you liked 300, you'll probably like this movie as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone...","review":"Certainly not for me, or most people who enjoy stories with an actual point. (btw worst first date movie EVER...seriously, don't do it...)Sex and violence is the game of this movie, and honestly, the over the top action scenes got to be a little too much. I can only watch so many guns going off before getting bored. What little romance there was was ridiculously fake and half left me confused.However, if you're in to massive gratuitous amounts of violence, constant action, guns, and death by carrots, go for it. I give it two stars because it's worth watching if you like that sort of thing, and as some other reviewers have pointed out, it is SUPPOSED to be over the top. However, if you're looking for some deep meaning worthwhile movie to watch, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Raunchy and Rambunctious!","review":"It is amazing that this film is not rated NC-17. I don't know how much down and dirty sex and murder you can have and still be \\"R\\", but this movie definitely pushes that envelope for all it's worth. In any case, keep the kiddies away from this one and enjoy a full-on nitro-fueled rocket sled of a movie. One of the most intense action films of recent years and a real treat for fans of that genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, Mindless Action Movie","review":"This movie wants to be a comedy, but it's not funny. It wants to be an action movie, but it's all mindless action and you don't care one way or another. It wants to be a crime thriller, but you don't identify with the characters or any meaningful motive for the crime as it tries to be funny at the same time, you just can't take any of it seriously. This movie wants to be a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but other than the carrot, everything else is missing here. I gave it too stars instead of just one, because it kept me sitting through all that non-sense regardless. I now only have no one but myself to blame for wasting time and money on this movie. I think the main characters are capable of doing better, but some all encompassing force is preventing that from happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shooting Blanks","review":"If this is supposed to be a homage to the Hong Kong action genre then John Woo should feel a little slighted. This flick is of little discernible style and no substance. The over-the-top action is boring, the plot is convoluted, and the constant stabs at humor drop like a thud. The usually dependable Clive Owen cannot even save this turkey. He has to work overtime to stave off embarrassment. But, then, Clive can pick and choose his own projects so you can't imagine what drew him to this one. Paul Giamatti lays an egg as the film's heavy. Be careful, Paul, or people will forget that you made good flicks like \\"American Splendor\\" and \\"Sideways\\". Monica Bellucci as the requisite femme fatale is the only performer here to make a visceral impact. The hilarious love-making scene between her and Owen is about the only time this film engaged me. Otherwise, this flick is a complete waste of brain cells and not in the good way that some popcorn flicks are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend money on this one!","review":"this one blew me away! aside from Clive being smokin hot, i truly loved this and watch it over and over. it isn't much on the story line. it's short and to the point. you fully understand what's going on throughout the whole film for sure. the action is all shooting and escaping and will truly take your breath away. the sex scene was hilarious. he doesn't want to care...but gets trapped into it every time. look out jason statham you got competition on the hot scale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ammo Burner","review":"A fun ride in the style of Peckinpah and John Woo. The smell of burning gunpowder and bullets flying.

Tons of style withABSOLUTELY no redeeming value. I really felt some good actors were completely put to waste here. Maybe a good rental but was very sorry I wasted the money on it for blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, lots of action, shooting, and fun","review":"This is a fun film to watch. It is filled, more than any other film I saw, with unbelievable shooting, one man against dozens of professional hit men. The sheer impossibility of the shootings and of the other actions in the film makes this film into a parody, fun. The hero is sitting eating a carrot when the film begins. Since the film is filled with shootings, it is rather remarkable that he has no gun, at this time. He sees a man apparently trying to kill a pregnant woman. He intervenes and kills him by stabbing him with a carrot. He is then chased by many armed men. When he kills them all, the head man of the chasers hires another fifty, yes fifty. Beside the fun, we wonder who this man is, who is the woman he joins up with, why are the gunmen after the baby that the pregnant woman give birth to."},{"rating":"2","title":"7.1 Channels of Pure Adrenaline","review":"If you love action films and have a 7.1 channel sound system, order NOW! The first time I watched this disc, I was as giddy as a child on Christmas morning. Awesome sound track. Very well engineered.While I liked Clive Owen as the hero, I especially liked Paul Giamatti's counterpoint portrayal as the villain that gave Clive the perfect enemy to battle. I'm not a video game player, but this movie was just plain fun. Clive does the impossible, and why not? It's a fantasy. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OTT and fun.","review":"This film does have a plot, but to be honest it is hardly important to this sort movie. The action is frantic and completely silly that puns are hilariously bad. It really is one of those films that once you have seen the opening you will know if you will like it. It isn't for everyone, it is the definition of high octane dumb action movie. Clearly made as a blokes movie, although my Missus loved it as well, it ain't no date movie.Is it a worthwhile Blu ray purchase? If you like the film sure if not then you would be dumb to buy it anyway, and if you aren't sure, rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot \\"Em Up","review":"OMG!!!

This movie sucks! I'm a big time movie fan with a collection of about 500 dvds so don't take my warning lightly.

A GUY THAT SHOOTS PEOPLE WITH AN OBVIOUS FAKE BABY IN HIS HAND (PAUSE IT WHEN HE'S RUNNING WITH IT)AND KILLS WITH A CARROT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ACTION PACKED. CLIVE OWEN SHOULD'VE JUST DONE A MOVIE THAT HAS A GOOD STORY PLOT AND A DESCENT ENDING. FOR REAL...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INVEST INTO MOVIES THAT ARE CLASSIC ACTION.

The story was so unbelieveable and unrealistic. The characters were very undeveloped. There was a lot of shooting and violence, pretty much 90% of the movie.

Not even the Perfect picture of Blu-Ray could save THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!! DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just watch?","review":"Before beginning I must admit that I found myself rooting for the stars of this movie and thats why I finished it but I must also say that of all the movies I have seen I would put this in the lower 5. I mean lets see- this guy kills people, slides all over the place, and rings down a rope all while holding a baby. He catches things on the highway while driving a car, he kills people plenty of people while parachuting. He has s-x, holds the girl to his body and apparently cu-s while assasinating more people. He kills people with carrots! He flies out of the front of a car and breaks the window of the car behind him landing straight into th van and kills more people- and the killing continues- from the first to the very last scene. Also, the plot left me slightly confused. Blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, that was a bad movie.","review":"This movie ranks up there with \\"Ultraviolet\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line\\" as the worst movies I've seen.Mindless action is cool with me but the action isn't even good.The plot is non-existent, yet it still manages to be political in a very immature, childish way.It had a few funny moments, but overall it was a really stupid movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's entertaining, funny and full of action (and gore :D). I liked Clive Owen in Sin City (King Arthur-not so much) and he was the perfect choice for \\"Smith\\". Monica Bellucci was a pleasant surprise because she's not the typical skinny helpless damsel in distress. And they had some chemistry. I've only seen Paul Giamatti in Man on the Moon but he was a fantastic villain in this movie.You really can't take this movie too seriously or you're going to hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Clive Own 'stinker'","review":"What is it with Clive Owen and his choice of films to do? He was great in The Croupier and interesting as an assassin the first Bourne film, but here and in several other films (I'll Sleep When I'm Dead) he just isn't believable as a dumb, sadistic, violent guy--he's too smart to play that.Here in Shoot em Up his character has no back story; his action scenes are fine but too unbelievable to be more than 'cartoonish', and his gorgeous love interest (Monic Bellucci) seems way too smart to be with such a simple 'thug'.Add to the continuous action a bad guy (Paul Giamatti) who also seems unbelievable and you've got a mindless waste of time. And one more thing; this movie has a scene of nudity that is really disgusting and should have been cut--and I'm not speaking of any scene involving Monica Bellucci."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining","review":"When I first saw the preview for this movie, I thought, wow they are really making a movie called shoot em up, this is going to be the dumbest movie ever made, HOWEVER after a bunch of my friends went to see it and liked it, i decided to rent it and form my own opinion. Within 5 minutes someone is stabbed in the eye with a carrot, which shocked me because I had never seen it before. The whole movie in itself is pretty cheezy, but, its not a academy award movi its supposed to be a fun unrealistic movie, Clive Owens 1 liners are probably the best i've ever heard, and Paul Giamatti did a terrific acting job. My only concern is why Clive Owen did this since he is a phenominal actor, I didnt get it. But its easily a cult hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic mix of ridiculous action and just as ridiculous humour!","review":"This movie was fantastic, I've must have seen it at least 6 times. It has just the perfect amount of awesome kicka$$ action perfectly paired with the writer's hilarious and twisted sense of sarcasm and humour. It even has subtle jokes you don't get until you see it another time. It's brilliantly put together and doesn't take itself too seriously at all, but still has enough action to fulfill your NEEDS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"know what I hate...","review":"I'm a lil' late to the party, this film is a few yrs old now.....Ok, I like action movies & gun fights as much as the next guy... just not when its so incredibly over the top & ridiculous as this film is.

Sorry, 2 stars for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible - walked out of the theater","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible. I walked out of the theater after 10 minutes. I never walk out of theaters.

Clearly we are meant to understand that \\"Mason = Evil.\\" But it is not discussed anywhere in the movie and I don't get the point for making this lapel pin displayed so prominently in so many scenes. Also, the end of the movie reveals the entire plot, if you can call it a plot, is about a man (Clive Owen) shooting hundreds of people in an attempt to assist an anti-second amendment agenda. This makes no sense whatsoever. Save your money. Save your time. Save your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite frankly the worst movie ever made","review":"I missed this movie in the theatres so when I saw it for sale on DVD I had to pick it up. BIG MISTAKE. This movie is beyond over the top. The plot sucks, the action is sooooo far fetched it makes this movie ridiculous. Watching this movie was like torture. Please save your hard earned money and DO NOT buy this movie. If you don't believe me, rent it first. I guarantee you after you watch the first 10 minutes you will turn it off.

Despite all the gun play, you can expect to either fall asleep or drift to thoughts of other things within the first ten minutes. It is fortunately rare for a film to achieve this remarkable level of suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Somehow","review":"I am a fan of some over the top movies like the Crank and The Transporter. I liked the look of the trailer for this movie. Clive Owen is one of my favorite actors and Monica Bellucci is just plain hot. But this movie just seemed to miss the mark somehow, some way. The action was completely over the top and ridiculous which it was suppose to be but it really didn't get me going. It was just missing something. And there was plenty of over the top wild stuff that was suppose to be funny but just really wasn't. Owen usually can pull off some funny stuff. I liked his reaction to things that annoyed him but it just wasn't enough. I can't put my finger on it but this movie just was not 'on' and was missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic politics meets Hollywood absurdity","review":"'Shoot Em Up' is full of those humorously ridiculous action scenes we know from movies like The Transporter. That's the good part of the movie.This is combined with a pretty strong guns-are-bad theme. It's not just an argument against violence, it's an argument against the 2nd Amendment, which is mentioned specifically.Hypocritically, the Good Guy makes use of hundreds of bullets (and a few carrots) to defeat the evil government conspiracy to allow people to have guns.Ironically, the Good Guy makes a pretty firm statement that hypocrisy is one of the things he hates.And if that's not quite enough garbage for you, the writer of this multi-million-dollar production can't control his leftist impulse to include a message about not trusting people who stand to make money.If you can shut your brain off completely while watching movies, which I can handle sometimes, this is fun to watch. But it really pushes the limits of ignoring stupidity to have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti 2nd Amendment and mediocre action at best.","review":"This is really pretty awful. It has some decent action sequences but the movie is marred by a blatant left wing agenda and some unnecessary gore. Oh and the way he handles the baby in all of the shooting sequences is so stupid it's almost impossible to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainless & Boring","review":"I'm all for mindless action when it's done right but this was just brutal.

I thought I'd love this movie. But I have never seen such a misogynistic piece of crap. Women are clearly considered only good for one thing (and they don't even have to be alive to be good for it). I was thoroughly disgusted. And by the way, the action is so cartoonish, you'd be better off watching the Coyote try to drop anvils on the Roadrunner's head. I don't recommend this movie for anyone with a functioning brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just lost a couple brain cells watching this","review":"I have never seen a movie, where the opening scene is so terrible that, I wanted to walk out and not even attempt to watch the rest. If you like dull, aimless characters who literally \\"shoot\\" everything.. from umbilical cords to gunshots during a sex scene, this is the movie for you. It even has lactating prostitutes and the main character acts like bugs bunny, always with a carrot in his mouth.I can't believe Clive Owen made such pointless trash. I normally find something redeemable about bad movies.. but this didn't have anything to save it, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GIRLFRIEND LIKED IT...BUT IT REALLY SUCKED.","review":"Okay, I like over-the-top sometimes. But this was total eyecandy for stupid people. The new Bond flicks are 10 times better than this crap.Stay away, Clive is taking all he can get. The carrot thing was really dumb as well. Not cute like my girlfriend thought. Maybe this is an Action/Chick flick?Monica is just a smokin' hot mama, even at her age. But seriously,this is what the Bush Administration will be remembered for.

From start to finish it was totally rediculous. The humor was poor, the action was really poor and so far fetched. The only ones who would think this would be possibly entertaining would be people who get off on watching people get shot. No suspense at all. Just mindless shooting. Would not recommend this movie. It went straight in the trash !.There should be a A, B,C, D, F raiting. One star is not acceptable at all to review this movie.It is a total \\"F\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dumb","review":"Now, I like a good action film as much as the average male. But I have a rule--if I turn off the DVD before the film ends, the film gets one star. What stopped me here, about 20 minutes into the film, was where this baby was placed on a children's merry-go-round, the baddies begin to plunk away at it, and our hero empties a clip to make the merry-go-round go round and (once more) save the infant from harm. This is the epitome of dumb. Nothing before that sequence was any better. I suppose some people will write this off as my not being able to take a joke. Well, I'm a big Johnny To fan, and his flicks are as wild and crazy as this one. But To doesn't take the cheap way out and wink, wink at the audience. Shoot 'em up is simply stupid in so many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS movie is Ridiculous!","review":"I watched this movie the other day with my friends and it feels like some very bad video game where one guy is invincible. The plot makes no sense and the blood and gore is overdone. It is basically about some British Agent that kills around 500 people by the end of the movie mainly by a Magnum. Too much sexual stuff; definitely not for under 17. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...

The main hero of the film will have 50 (said to be) professional killers shooting at him, and yet they always miss, even at close range.The only reason why I rented this film was because I like to see Monica Bellucci films, but even she couldn't save this ridiculous \\"tongue in cheek\\" shoot \`em up.

I can't believe the three main actors would even have consented to be in this garbage. Clive Owen, for whom I always enjoyed in films, has been in a couple of really terrible movies.

This flick still had all the action that you can squeeze into an action movie and then some but, while taken to excess, it wasn't as engaging or interesting as the two previous movies and the acting was so bad it actually hurts to watch (except for Paul Giammani, who I enjoyed).Now I understand that Shoot 'em Up is supposed to be a bizarre, over-the-top movie where action reigns supreme and things like plot, scripting and acting are second seat but the action itself wasn't enough for this movie to stand on. Nothing about it was new, innovative or engaging, it was just dumb, balls-to-the-walls stupidity and I don't know if that was by design or not.

With out a doubt I am fortunate to haved trained with both of these famous Pilates instructors.When I first heard that Romana was going to be on video, I thought, WOW, this is great! Unfortunately, this video does not live up to the excellent teachings of Romana. It seems like the producer and director didn't have a focued purpose: did they want to create a documentary, or, did they want to creat a mass market Pilates video? It's a little of both, and somehow, this video is neither a documentary nor a mass market video. Watching this video, I wondered if Romana had control.As I watched the performer demonstrate Pilates, she seemed self-conscious and a little nervous about which exercises were coming next sometimes.I was hoping to get a first rate documentary, and a good instructional video. Instead, I bought a lackluster mixture."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an exercise class!","review":"While I appreciate the historical value of this video and its explanation of classic Pilates history, it is erroneously marketed as an exercise class. The content is particularly dissapointing for anyone with a low-to-moderate fitness level.

If you're looking for a carefully guided class for beginners, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practice Footage","review":"I thought this video might actually be practice footage to study before filming the final version, then releasing this video to the public. Sometimes the demonstrator seemed to not know which exercise was coming next. I confess that I bought this video because of the beautiful cover design. It goes to show, you can't judge a video by it's cover. Although the old film reel footage is good of the woman named Romana, I wasn't satisfied with the workout section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Comprehensive","review":"I've been trying to learn Pilates at my gym, and through video tapes. This one looked good, and I was told there was a famous Pilates instructor on it. So I bought it. This video was ok, but it only has fundamental Pilates exercises. Since it's good to have a goal to work for, I found that \\"Pilates for Everyone\\" and \\"Classical Pilates\\" showed many more exercises. They even have intermediate and advanced exercises. So I was somewhat disappointed after buying \\"Romana's Pilates.\\" The famous person on this video was wonderful in her prime. There just wasn't enough material to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"informational only","review":"While I enjoyed the documentary aspect of learning about Pilates and about Romana (who is very inspirational), the workout included in this DVD was only about 5 minutes long and terribly disappointing.

I will share it with friends so they can see the background of the workout I've been enjoying for over a year, but I won't mind if it never makes it way home to me again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"I started Pilates last year and enjoy working out. This video was recommended by some of my friends who are 'in the know.' They said the Woman named Romana is famous, and that I would be glad to study this video. This video seemed too basic. Why sell a video that only shows the basic mat? Other videos have basic-intermediate, or intermediate-advanced levels, which provide inspiration to achieve more and learn more. Although Romana is probably an excellent instructor in person, I didn't see what was supposedly so special.

I use it different than the instruction. Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up. Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes). Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes). Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries. Try the disk. If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does. This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.

The reviews here are somewhat mixed but for us the stuff really has worked, though I have had to use it a lot more liberally than the directions state. I normally cover the whole bottom of the CD with a thin coating of the step 1 scratch remover, then I let it dry completely (more than 5 min) before I clean it off as directed and then I move on to the step 2 cleaner, polisher & sealer.Try it - for the random small scratches that come from childlike love - it has worked great for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, unfairly maligned.","review":"Before I start, allow me to point out one thing. This cleaner is an ABRASIVE. That means that it repairs the scratches by rubbing them off. If you use it incorrectly, then it will create new scratches instead of repairing the old ones. It's not a problem with the product, it's a problem with how you're using it.On to the review: The directions were straightforward, and it repaired minor scratches in one application.

The liquids are 1.5 oz. and I doubt there is enough for 100 disks there either.Step 1 is a brown liquid you apply and let dry for 5 minutes and then wipe of with a cleaning cloth. Then you spray on step 2, which smells like it is nothing more than Windex, and wipe that off.I used this to try and repair a DVD that would stop playing half way through.

I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply \\"Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer\\". This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.The only good thing that I use the \\"Scratch Remover\\" for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.Last Word:I hate Maxell."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure it works","review":"I followed the instructions but it seemed to make the scratches worse.

Last night, I looked at recipes for quiche from three books before I finally turned to the recipe in this book. I didn't need a recipe with a ton of ingredients--I just wanted to know how many eggs to how much cream and how much cooked mushrooms I could add. This book gave me the exact answer I was looking for! I love that this book gives you the methods of dishes, gives you a little direction, and gives you the freedom to add your own creativity. When I read other recipes with many ingredients, I wonder if I'll screw up the proportions if I change the recipe. This book is the best reference I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"(ALMOST) EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW!","review":"This brilliant little book distills all of Julia Child's years of experience into just over 100 pages. But instead of scratching the surface of cooking and its techniques, Ms. Child tells you everything you need to know. Whether you're an expert in the kitchen or a beginner with only three favorite recipes, this book will help you expand your repertoire. Its quick reference structure makes it a snap to check the best way to cook, say, a pork chop, or how to make your vegetables tastier than ever. And interspersed among the chapters are Julia's \\"Master Recipes\\" for those classic dishes that never go out of style. A real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book with great stuff!","review":"I know that several reviewers before this one were concerned that this cookbook was not detailed enough, or that it was just a repeat of what Julia Child had written before, but for me, it is perfect. I'm not really interested in expensive, prolonged moments in the kitchen. All I needed was the idea of how to cook some basic things - \\"mother recipes,\\" as Julia calls them in this book.Your everyday French cook (your basic French mom or dad fixing dinner) does not normally use cookbooks, per se. French moms learn basic techniques and get creative from there. That's what this book teaches you. That's why I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia's Kitchen Wisdon","review":"Glad I bought this little help book on my favorite passtime...cooking. She is really right on with tips.

I thought I had reviewed it here but I guess not. Anyhew. . .You don't realize how restrictive the factory air intake is until you install this one. Installation was simple with good instructions for a non-mechanic like me. Throttle response was much quicker after installation. It did not do anything for gas mileage. I have yet to clean the air filter and instructions say don't do it anyway. I could detect little if any increase in noise, but then I have a flowmaster exhaust so that could be one reason. It did make the exhaust sound a little more \\"throaty\\" which is nice :-)I would definately buy again.

Okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disney short coming","review":"After making such a great movie as the first Hunchback, it is hard to beleive that Disney would try to pass this off as a movie we should rush out to buy. It has a great cast, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Jenifer Love Hewitt, what not, but the songs were too horrid to endure, the animation worse than a Don Bluth flim and some situations contrived. What it did have was a beleivable plot as far as cartoons go, which saved it in many places. And there were places where you could tell that animators spent a bit more time than others. I just thought that who ever directed this film should have watch the first one before doing the second. It gives sequels a bad rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching and emotional sequel, especially good for kids","review":"I must admit that I shed a tear or two during this unlikely but well-told love story. The story is a lot more simple and straightforward than the original 1996 film, but that seems to be a necessity considering that the Disney videos are targeted at a younger audience. I think the adults watching with the kids will find a lot to enjoy, and the message (not to judge a book by its cover) is told beautifully and convincingly and is a very good one for kids. And the bonus features on the DVD are a plus, for both the adults and kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as they say...","review":"This movie is as bad (or worse) than everyone has said. the animation is shoddy, and the storyline is boring.

A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney is hard up for material","review":"This movie really stunk, especially when compared with the original Hunchback. It was so boring I couldn't get my five year old to stay in the room to watch it, and she's a video watching fanatic. I wish Disney would stop making these lame...really lame....sequels. There's enough good literature out there that they haven't even tapped yet. They care nothing for entertainment anymore, all they care about is making a buck. Well, we rented this one only, (thank heavens!) and that's all the money Disney's getting out of me on this really rotten flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Doesn't Compare with the First","review":"Okay, I love the Hunchback of Notre Dame...one, that is. I rented this movie from my local library, and was so glad that I didn't actually pay money even to rent it. I looked on the back, and it said there was only a runtime of about 68 minutes. That told me something right there. The movie has no plot, no evident storyline, and the animation is just awful. I'm not an expert or anything, but I've noticed that a lot of direct to video sequels share this quality. If you're looking for a villain as good as Frollo, do not expect it from this movie. The first movie is always the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Sequel","review":"I read some of the reviews of this movie and found mixed reviews about the movie.

Why didn't Disney just stop with the theater version of the Hunchback? To make a few more pennies on this SAD sequel? The story is weak but what is worse is the horrible animation.

I can't comment on the Mayan section (which is very small), but the Egyptian section is woeful.As a trained Egyptologist, I have often thought the Teach Yourself series should have a volume on Egyptian HIEROGLYPHS (NOT hieroglyphics!), so I grabbed this when I saw it. It is hopeless. The author has not realised that Egyptian hieroglyphs can be read from left to right OR from right to left, depending on which way the signs face. Therefore he has transliterated all his examples backwards.DUH! BASIC mistake.There are other mistakes in the book. If you want to learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs, read Collier & Manley's How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Step-by-Step Guide To Teach Yourself.Teach Yourself Books did not do themselves a favour by publishing Ron Bonewitz's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Summary of the Hittites (circa 1950)","review":"There is not a whole lot of general interest action on the Hittites. Despite the fact that they appear in the Bible, the Hittites were basically unknown until the mid 19th century. Since then much of the interest in them revolves around the \\"are they or aren't they\\" question of their indo-european origins. Although that question has been resolved in the affirmative, Gurney points out that the link is limited to the grammar of their language, while much of the vocabulary owes a debt to the more civilized people's to the south.Gurney's discussion of the chariot is pretty limited- would have liked more, but I think that debate (where did the chariot come from? who invented it?) dates from after this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful, this shatters into 100s of pieces!","review":"Be careful, this shatters into 100s of TINY pieces that even my vacuum can't pick up.

Cinderella II, however, does not even deserve to be called a sequel. The idea of a sequel to Cinderella had good potential, but in Cinderella II, a coherent storyline is replaced by three uninteresting tales; it's blaringly obvious that Disney is simply out to make more money.Even for you die-hard fans, Cinderella II is not worth seeing. Buy something else. (Cinderella III, for instance, actually looks good.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time ( for the most part)","review":"ok. although everything was alright ( except the horrible gut wrenching songs) and it's cool to find out what happened to everyone, what the heck? this movie is like remember when type of movie. where there are three or four segments of cinderellas mishaps as princess. the animation is pretty good, but the plot and story are kind of weak. i think it would have been better to see a whole movie on where everyone is and developed it into one major story. it's a good rental, and actually pretty good for young kids, if you're an adult, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"Yeah, it is true what the other reviewers wrote: this movie is pretty bad.

There is practically no violence, a rarity these days, and the colors are much brighter than the original Cinderella movie. Even the music is kind-of catchy.

I wish I had... All the other sequels to Disney classics have been very good, but this one isn't even a sequel; it's three different short stories that don't have anything to do with the original. I was bored after the first 30 minutes of the film (that has never happened to me before with a Disney movie). The animation is awful and the stories are boring, the only story in which Cinderella is the main character is the first one and she plays a secondary character in the other two (this is supposed to be a Cinderella video). I regret not renting the video before buying it, it's money wasted that I could have used buying another one.I can't believe it's a Disney video.

So I decided to find out for myself if this movie was any good. And it wasn't. All my brothers and sisters thought this was BORING. Plus the animation was horrible. It looked more like a Saturday morning cartoon. Even worse, the voices were disgraceful! They were not even close to the original. Cinderella's voice makes me shudder. I also can't believe one of the stepsisters \\"falls in love\\". They weren't supposed to have any emotion! Lucifer's back too yep. I know some people love him but he was killed in the first one!

I read in one review that Walt's films were designed to leave a \\"happily every after\\" feeling in the viewers. that certainly is true for most of them. even the spiritually uplifting Fantasia Finale accomplishes this.the sequels to Alladin and Lion King Are OK, because they were made by the same people. but today's disney should not even attempt to sequelize Walt's Films. I will never see Peter Pan 2 or lady and the tramp 2, and I will never buy a \\"snow white 2\\" or \\"aristocats 2\\" or \\"pinnochio 2\\" remember what George Lucas said he wanted to do with the Star Wars Holiday special?

This is one of the stupidest shows I've ever seen.

They know they can't do it the way he did the first one. My brother and I borrow shows like these just to laugh at them. We do give them a chance, but they don't usualy earn it!

I am 17, and I happen to be a big fan of so-called \\"children's\\" movies, because many of them have beautiful, deep storylines, lovable characters, enchanting music, and gorgeous graphics. This movie has none of that. Not only is this the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is the worst form of any kind of entertainment I have ever experienced. This includes video games, television, music, books, and of course, movies.Don't get me wrong; I'm a huge Disney fan, and I love Cinderella. However, this movie cheapens it and somehow manages to make its predecessor seem WORSE than it actually was. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It will RUIN everything Cinderella stands for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella II - Dreams Come True","review":"This was the biggest waste of a movie. Do not waste your time purchasing this. There was no purpose to make this movie except to make money. The qulity of the animation is terrible.

She loves all things Princess, but the original Cinderella has too many scary parts (same goes for Snow White, Aladin, and Beauty and the Beast).

They took the point of the view of \`story telling' literally. The mice and fairy godmother tell \`stories' as to what happened to Cinderella after her big ball. The problem is - not much happened and there was not much change or growth. In other words the mice tell a story - but there is no story to tell.The mice try their usual slapstick and comic routines, but they no longer have the charm. The movie has its heart in the right place - its just not Disney to me. It's a wonder why people say \`doesn't anyone read the script anymore'.There are some fun stuff on the DVD for kids - like the storybook with an interactive menu. There is also a music video and a DVD link. Overall this was a little disappointment. But it is good for the really young kids. (8-15-02)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck were they thinking!?","review":"I could say it over and over again, this movie stunk! This movie gives a bad name to the original Cinderalla. This is a horrible movie! The mice are the real actors in this film, Cinderalla looks and sounds like a teens cheerleader, the prince (i don't care what they named him) looks like his face just got run over by a lawn mower, you call THAT cute! AND, one of the \\"evil\\" stepsisters becomes \\"good\\", and just to add on to that, the music is pop, get real! IF matters are not worse enough, the prince (in one of the story's) is riding a BMX (pumpkin) bike, please spare me already, I live only once!DO yourself a favor and don't get another movie to collect dust!0 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of Disney animation and I must say that some of the sequels have been quite well done. But this is not one of them. This is the absolute worst sequel to date. There is no coherent plot, just three loosley connected stories that seem like they popped out of Saturday morning cartoon fodder. The quality of the animation is average at best, even for direct to video. Only one of the stories is even about Cinderella. The other two concentrate on th mice and step sisters. If disney keeps cranking out these shameless duds they are going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. It pains me to sya all this as I am a big disney fan but Disney has been slipping lately in many ways and this video is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella II","review":"Smartest move here is to find the original Disney classic CINDERELLA and leave this bad Disney straight to video Cinderella II alone. This is just insulting. It really is. The plot of this movie is to find out what happened to Cinderella after she married the Prince. Here I can answer that for you, they lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!! Geez!Really people, whenever Disney releases a straight to video movie that right there should be an indication that you might be disappointed. Beauty and the Beast II = bad. Hunchback II = worse. Lion King II = not bad but I won't applaud. I think you see where I'm going here. For all of you that are fans and admirers of the original Disney classic, leave it at that. Just stay with what you know and skip this one.

I was overjoyed (and a little wary) when I heard about Cinderella II. I rented it first. While watching it I felt a thud as my heart hit the floor and broke. I wanted so much more from this movie. It is disjointed and jumpy, has not consistancy. It completely lost the magic of the orginal.

After about 20 minutes my daugher said come on daddy lets play. The animators must be the same one's that worked on Speed Racer, and the music just doesn't fit. On the plus side my daughter likes the picture on the cover. Unfortunately I promised my daughter I would buy this video so what could I do? If you haven't made the same mistake rent it first.

The movie's called 'Dreams Come True' but for me it was a nightmare. The movie is pointless and a large waste of time, and the characters act insolent, barbaric, arrogant, hostile, dispicable, and too happy to be realistic.Sorry, Disney, you make good movies, but this one's a bad egg.

Though I did not expect it to be as well-done as the original, I had hoped that the animation quality would be at least as good as other Disney sequels (Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.). The quality may be compared to modern Saturday morning cartoons. All the animation staff seem to be Japanese--what's the deal with that--do they come cheaper? The promised new songs were nothing more than background music--no new musical productions here. My four year old seems to like it okay, but I think it's because she loves the characters so much and I feel she will quickly tire of it. I just feel that Disney wanted to make a quick buck off the current \\"Princess\\" craze and lowered their normally high standards to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the part two disasters","review":"I was so disapointed (VERY VERY)it's the cheapest and worst cartoon I have ever seen from disney.. truly it was unexpected to do such a bad quality.. it was one of my favorite classics.. and they ruined it.. why do they have to make 2's! it's not always aproperiate.. it's really so sad..the animation is differet.. spirit of the movie is waay different.. the voices are different too.. and seriously if they make snow white 2 dunno what's gonna happen.. hope they make wiser decision.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle Walt wept!","review":"I wanted to say Jesus wept. this movie is that awful. I'm glad I grew up in the era of good children's/family movies. This movie is made for the TV generation aka I'm bored mommy change the channel. I can't believe Disney made this [junk]. I know not all Disney sequels are bad. Toy Story II and Rescuers Down under, Aladdin and the King of theives are the best Disney Sequels of all time. I cringe every time Disney makes a movie with a II behind it.

My 4 1/2 year old daughter, who loves to get caught up in pretend play about characters in books and movies, and re-watch favorites over and over, proclaimed this movie \\"silly.\\" She watched it once, and wanted to take it back to get a different one.

But contrary to the misleading title, hardly any dreams come true in this film. There is no storyline; all the time there's the Fairy Godmother and the mice, who write three stories about their memories with Cinderella. Thus, this is no sequal.Each time you watch this, you'll have the feeling to roughly punch your TV. This is supposed to be a movie, so why does the animation resemble the animation found in cartoons? The songs and score were weak, and the characters just plain stunk. The main problem with this film is that it was released on DVD and video, not in theaters. At least, this could've been a TV miniseries. It will be impossible for you to keep your eyes to the screen when you're watching this. Overall, this is a poor film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella \\"Cartoons\\"","review":"I was a little leery of anything Disney puts out \\"direct to video/DVD\\". It usually indicates an inferior product. While I can't really call this DVD inferior, it is disappointing. It is not an entire movie, rather three short stories (cartoons) revolving around Cinderella after the honeymoon. The cartoons (as I refer to them) are not up to the animation standards of the original, but then few things these days are. The stories are cute for children, with a few lessons hidden within. As an adult, I would rate the DVD an overall two stars.My five year-old daughter (a HUGE Cinderella fan) however, gave it five stars.My impression of the DVD is: Little girls under 8 will LOVE the DVD. Most everyone else will be lukewarm about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney should stop making Sequels","review":"When is Disney going to learn that you can't make sequels to classics. They should have left Cinderella alone and let her live happily ever after. Instead, they made a sequel and Cinderella didn't even look like herself! The voices didn't match, the storyline (or lack of) was extremely poor and I still can't figure out why on earth they decided to make this film. No interesting plot and you saw the Prince all of two minutes the entire movie. Don't waste your money and buy this film. You'll never watch it again after the first viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess Disney will do anything to make a buck","review":"They certainly prove that with the release of the horrible Cinderella 11.

However, I was disappointed by this disjointed, incoherent movie. My sister and I had to turn it off halfway because we got bored.

My husband took one look at it and threw it back on the coffe table. I will give you some examples of how aweful this book is. In the very beginning the book gave examples of how men can enjoy the \\"practice\\" of getting pregnant without getting the wife pregnant. It suggests purchasing a hot cup of McDonalds coffee, placing between you thighs, and spilling it on yourself. Another example is: Ideal places to look for adoptive children - The ladies room at a high school prom. I didn't even get to page 10, I was in shock.

But, like most books that compile everything and everyone known in a storyline series, it becomes sort of out-of-date immediately after being released because new information is released all the time as the author continues to expand the universe with new books. The Discworld Companion is still a worthy tome to have due to the vast amount of highly detailed information within it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideological bent","review":"The book was well written, and it was nice to see the original documents in their proper context. A small matter, though, is that the book is definitely left of center. The authors portray much of American history as a class or racial struggle.American heroism, such as in WWII, are given a few paragraphs at most. Modern Republican Presidents are seen as imperialist, even to the chapter headings.A good book, but definitely designed to present a more liberal view of American History."},{"rating":"1","title":"America Past and Present","review":"There were 30 pages ripped out of the middle of the book.

It lacks staying power, does little for the imagination, and almost all of the songs are commercialized to have a poppy feel. Plus all these songs can be found as singles easily at any record shop. Where are the rare minimal beats that really get the crowd going? Not here.Louie Devito is a DJ that spins re-mixed popular music for the masses, hardly underground as the title suggests.

You need to read this book to know the true and imparcial phylosophy of Zapata, a person that shaped and still shapes the Mexican History in the last century. More than a simple biography, an excellent way to understand why the Mexicans love and will love forever their land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mexican Revolution","review":"This book is part on a series of books about Mexican who participated in the Mexican Revolution.

Hope you decide to try Everlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlife is great!!! READ THIS!","review":"Everlife is a great Christian band of three sisters. They have a great harmony and cool songs. They are different than most other pop girl groups because of the lyrics. In Angels Cry, they say, \\" When you cry, 'cause it hurts, it doesn't mean that you're not heard. Because aloud in heaven, the angels cry with you...\\" Really true!!!

This is a very rowdy, rocking project, but it is good. Petra's John Schlitt lends a guest vocal to \\"Take A Ride\\", and he just blends in with the group; I didn't pick up his vocal at first, until I knew he joined the ladies. My favorite songs on the project were \\"Heaven Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Evidence\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"Even When\\", and \\"Getting Closer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky band","review":"This band stinks!!! They start off the songs with a great dancy beat but then, once you really listen to their songs all of them are pretty terrible. They are a cheap imitation of Zoegirl. I think with a new sound, and some vocal coaching that might BECOME an ok band. Basically, they hook you in, but the song isn't what you are hoping for. They should have waited about 3 more years before coming out with their first CD. Maybe then they would be ready to release a CD. Buy Zoegirl, Krystal Meyers, or Joy Williams instead. These bands/singers are worth listening to more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in every way . . .","review":"Ok . . . I could complain so much about this group, but to not be too hard on them - I'll just give you a few reasons. They are, of coure, just a very cheap immatation of ZoeGirl except for the fact that they're sisters. Their music is horrible - I absolutely couldn't stand it!! Every single song - I hated it! And they don't at all dress very appropriatey - especially since they're SUPPOSED to be representing CHRISTIAN singers. Their pictures (which they have a lot of) are terrible - their poses and what's with the girl and her cell-phone all the time?? I wish CHRISTIAN singer -as they call themselves- wouldn't act this way. I'm glad to be rid of the CD - I don't know how anyone could stand it enough to write 5-star reviews about it!

Its images of the real people of the carnival life, just trying to get along, trying to make a living, with many of the same motivations as you and me, are painted in their true colors. The embarrassment of the author, a genuine fire-eater, burping a tongue of flame at the pharmacy clerk selling him a bottle of olive oil; the cowboy walking out to check on the 'stock' (the family car); the \\"Impossible Possible,\\" never far from the line between moral and immoral, legal and illegal, working on both sides.

Didn't work. It fell off so many times the battery compartment covering got lost and now I'm holding the battery in with a tightly wound rubberband. Classy.

It's a shame, because otherwise it's a good pedometer -- I liked the ability to change between modes and easily reset the counter. While I never did any scientific tests to confirm the accuracy, I have checked the route that I walked on Google Maps against what the pedometer recorded and the results have been pretty close. As many others have mentioned, the clasp is too weak; I would also add that I think the relatively long length makes it even easier to accidentally pull off. I wonder if it would be more secure if it were a bit shorter. If anybody out there finds mine, hope you enjoy it, but if you're shopping for one, I'd suggest looking for one that's more secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedometer","review":"This worked fine, but the design of the clip did not keep it on the belt line.

Otherwise, you'll put up with this company's statement, hidden in the instructions, that this unit is \\"designed to always be on.\\" Yeah, nice electronics, right? The aforementioned battery cover will also break, in time, as its little prongs will snap off, and then you'll have to tape the cover on. Without tape, the battery will spring out and get lost. Spend a few more dollars and get a better unit. As far as the actual distance calculator, step sensor and mechanics, this unit does what it needs to do.

For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me! It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor? I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground.

It simply does not stay on. I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it. Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate. I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day. One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300. Which is accurate? Are any of them? I can't rely on it.

Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007. Too bad I bought it in December. This is a piece of junk. I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer. (It was $12 at that time). I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate. I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time. So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000? I never knew. The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000. I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.

I took it hiking for my first trial. I got to the end of the trail and checked to see how many steps I had gone. It told me I had only gone 20 steps! I noticed that it was slipping off my belt, so I secured it and continued my hike. Along the course of my day, I had the pedometer actually fall off and hit the ground at least 5 times. I got tired of picking it up and trying to keep it secured. I finally just put it in my pocket and forgot it. The round clip naturally slips. It is very frustrating. It could be a very nice little unit, except for this major flaw. I am taking it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pedometer that falls off is no good!","review":"The step function works fine, but the pedometer falls off.

Garrett helps us to realize that a facet can be a portal to understanding an entire era. One walks away with a fuller appreciation of just how a 12-inch-square silk weaving can determine how a person was regarded in Dynastic China. Garrett helps us understand how these rank badges of the ruling Mandarin class helped dictate the amount of respect show by others. We also gain understanding of the meanings of various emblems, as well as a great appreciation for the painstaking and artistic work that went into the weaving of these official marks of status."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent source towards healing and recovery from abuse.","review":"Jan Frank has written an exceptional book to help lead women through their recovery process as they may move from victim to victor. This book contains a wonderful recovery model that should be a reading priority of any therapist with clients dealing with sexual abuse issues, yet the focus is practical and a source of understanding for any victim of abuse. I consider this a must reading if you or anyone close to you has experienced the pain of sexual abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"an offensive book","review":"I bought this book based on other customer reviews. I was sorely disappointed and very offended. The author presents a clearly homophobic bias, even implying that one becomes homosexual due to abuse. This is outdated, stereotypical, hateful information. It seems that if abuse caused homosexuality, there would be lots more homosexuals. I was hoping for healing and instead found a \\"blame the victim\\" mentality. The author clearly presents christianity as the only way through this issue. If that appeals to you great, if not, do not waste your time. This book should come with a warning label that clearly states its christian/religious message. If anything I have written disturbs you, don't buy this book-there are other very good books available on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of all on the subject","review":"Of all the Christian recovery books, this is the most helpful on this particular subject matter. Not only does it contain everything the other books have, it covers additional pertinent topics other books leave out. One will find the author speaks only as someone could speak who has personally suffered such abuse. Jan Frank offers a handle to grab as her words become a healing balm to the soul in its journey to recovery.

I think it is good for victims to find their way to healing and writing a book is often a helpful tool, however this author leads one to believe this book is about others, when it is really about herself. She dangles the stories of other people but uses them as a vehical to return the story to herself.

The storyline, if you can even call it that, dragged. The action was not exciting and it quickly got very old. The characters seemed two dimensional, not well written at all. I didn't connect emotionally with any of them. All of the songs, the slang that was used, and the way they always cooked such wonderful food bothered me as well.

The book had some storyline problems, as the other books have reveal different points of the series, but Dragonball/Z/GT has lots of plot errors and everybody loves it, why not this book. Not only is this book strong in every aspect, but gets the readers thinking. I never cry when I watch a sad movie, I laughed at Titanic and Ben Hur, feel little when I watch soap operas when nothing else is on, but these series almost made me cry as it deals with loss and death and herioc sacrifice, and makes you feel happy when they they have a festival or something.

I love it when the books (and the maps. I love the maps) explore new places of the world Jacques has made. It was also a good plot but pretty much the same plot outline as all previous books. You know, first, they worry about an enemy. Second, they go exploring. Third, they fight the enemy and win. But there's always a different twist in that plot in each book. Anyways, if you like Redwall, then read this book. But I would suggest reading Martin The Warrior and Mossflower before reading this book. You'll understand it a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of Luke","review":"This is probably the best Redwall book yet, the good guy doesn't mind killing bad guys and he doesn't use that old 'it was self-defense' bit, and the bad guy is a genteel, evil mastermind who doesn't lose his temper or make stupid mistakes like the ones in almost every other book.

Luke's mother, Windred, and son Martin are two of the few spared from Daskar's wrath. Luke sets out for vengeance against his wife's murderer.

I'm with C.S.Lewis in saying don't take away the dragons, but show the knight that can slay them.This tale meanders, wanders, introduces pointless characters and events that have nothing to add to the progress of the tale.You want to read Jacques, go back and read his early work, then you'll have a much more satisfying tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted \\"Legend Of Luke\\", not \\"Legend Of Martin Spending A Couple Hundred Pages Trying To Find The Legend Of Luke\\"","review":"Ho-hum.

Maybe if they just had the Prolouge of Martin arriving, the next two Acts/Books of Luke, and maybe a short-ish third Act/Book of Martin's reaction/journey home. And too many characters accompany Martin on his way to the Arfship, I think. Maybe just him, Gonff, Furmo, and Trimp, nobody else. The focus should be on Luke.

A big chunk of the story is a tale being told. Also there is no regular villan to fight. This is one of the better Redwall books because it has less fighting but more action and suspense. I especially liked when they first met Folgrim. He looked weak but he killed two rats in the blink of an eye.The book started with Martin living at Redwall. He takes a trip to the North shore. He leaves with some close friends. They find a band of weasels that are going to cook a squirrel. Once they free the squirrel, they find out his name is Chugger. His grandmother died one day so he went out on his own. They soon find shrews and an otter name Folgrim. Once at North shore, they take a ship to the tall rocks. There they find part of Luke's crew. One tells the story about Luke.You must read Martin the warrior first. This was another great book from Brian Jaques and an awesome book from Redwall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet?","review":"I think that this could very well be the best Redwall novel yet. At the beginning I didn't think much of it. But when Martin reached the Arfship it got really good. I loved hearing about Luke and how he defeated his enemy for his tribe and son. It is also very interesting to read about when the abbey was first built. All of my favorite characters are in this book too, Gonff, Bella, and Martin. I love Gonff. Brian Jacques must be really creative to think up all of those poems that Gonff always chants. Well, all in all, it is a wonderful book. The first and third parts of the novel aren't worth much unless you are really into Redwall. But the third part is extremely good and will keep you seated motionless for hours until it's over. I can't wait until Lord Brocktree comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques scores again!","review":"I purchased the UK edition of \\"The Legend of Luke\\" a few months ago because I'm such a Redwall nut. I've had the opportunity to re-read this gem a few times. If your a fan of the series, then all the reasons you are a fan, are in the 12th edition to the series!Brian Jacques is the J.R.R. Tolkien or the Richard Adams of our era. His material will be being read and thoroughly enjoyed generations from now. As for right now, his works are some the most cross generational pieces of literature on the market today. What's not to love about critters with swords? :)Everyone whom I have recommended and pointed towards the Brian Jacques Redwall series, have come away saying thank you! If your already hooked like me, then the purchase of this book is a given. BUT if your new and wondering what all the hub bub is about Brian Jacques and the Redwall series ... why not find out for yourself? It will be some of the best money you've spent in a while for entertainment.

I saw a side I never did see otherwise.Let me see. . . oh yes.A sunny day outside, inside, a torrent of rain and rope burns from the book. I felt it. The cold, wet sea water, the rain, the rope burns. . . Book Two in The Legand of Luke let me feel how Luke (Martin's Dad) must have felt. . . It was almost too much. Jaques leaves the reader hanging after each page. . . your heart screams for more and your mind sees it like you were there. When it's finally over, you feel like you've been through ever scene. . .Five stars isn't enough. Six stars isn't enough. Maybe ten. . . read and be swept away by the incredible world of Brian Jaques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, enjoy it.","review":"The Legend of Luke is a great book and you can finally find out what happened to Martans father Luke. The story is interesting and filled with excitement and adventure.A couple of close friends go with Martan to his childhood home where they hear the story of his father Luke from some of Luke's old friends.

Francis Yates has created a detailed examination of memory techniques and their evolution over the course of generations. Beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages, Yates shows how the art of remembering began as a sort of parlor trick and developed into an important skill in both religion and the occult. The influence from both individuals and cultures is described in a scholarly (yet not annoyingly so) way. While this book is not for everyone, its intended audience should be delighted.NOTE: This book is not a \\"how-to\\" manual for memory. It provides only a very general description of memory methods and is instead an exploration of the history of the art.An excellent companion piece to this book is _The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci_. Both books were listed in the acknowledgements of Thomas Harris' _Hannibal_."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very profound historical analysis of memory techniques","review":"I found a reference to this book after reading Hannibal. I have been very interested in the memory techniques and wanted to find out more.Even though I was looking more for a how to book, I was not disappointed by the Art of Memory. It was not an easy read for me but I still found it illuminating. It only provides a basic description of the techniques with the main focus of the book actually on the history of the techniques. If you are looking only for a how to book and are not interested in the history and evolution of memory techniques then this is not really for you. I would personally recommend this as a companion to a how to book on the subject of memory improvement because knowing the history (especially historical applications of the techniques) sheds a great deal of light on the techniques themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anthology of essays by a wide variety of expert authors","review":"Audio Anecdotes: Tools, Tips, And Techniques For Digital Audio is an anthology of essays by a wide variety of expert authors concerning the exciting field of digital audio, lessons that can be learned from its past, discoveries directly applicable in the present, and anticipation of new changes in the future.

I do not recommend any of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASP Printers - (update) - Working OK now.","review":"My company purchased the Wasp WPL606 printer but it died after only 6 months of occasional use. The printer stopped detecting the paper and constantly failed for a paper jam and no paper, when it clearly was not jammed or out of paper. After going back and forth with the service department at Wasp, they had me return the printer for repair but they couldn't find anything wrong with it so they sent it back to me. I now have it back but it still doesn't work. *UPDATE*: All of the problems turned out to be an issue with the power. This printer is very sensitive to noisy power, so replacing the surge protector with a UPS (which filters the power) took care of the problem. The printer is working fine now. The only complaint I have is that the printer could have come with more internal memory. Other than that, this device is working fine and up until the power problem, I would have recommended it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough detail","review":"What is needed in a book of this type is a lot of detailed information on variations of settings and examples of what effect on the pictures changing the multiple different settings would have. This would take a lot of the trial and error out of working with a complicated new camera and shorten and simplify the learning curve by detailed suggestions of settings in various situations. Unfortunately, this book fails to do this and mostly comes across as an expanded version of the owner's manual. There is very little detailed information given on the various settings and even the pictures and examples given do not have details of what settings were used. I found the book to be mildly helpful in familiarizing me with various settings and options, but poorly helpful in giving suggestions or examples to get me off to a fast start. I am left with learning by trial and error, something a book like this should help you to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as I would have liked","review":"The book serves as a minor re-introduction to photography. I minored in photography in college, but have let the hobby slip since losing my equipment many years ago. I got a digital camera some years ago, and was frustrated by the lack of control over the image. I finally moved back into SLRs by purchasing a D60 (which I love.)This book was a brief re-introduction to basic settings, but shows no real comparative results between the various settings, as a previous reviewer had already mentioned. There is SOME usefull information in this book, but none of it unique to this particular camera. General information about aperture and speed control can be gotten from better general books. Don't bother buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of errors","review":"This book is not describing the Canon 60D camera!

She immediately hated it. The sisters start out insulting each other and are quite violent. We do not have TV, and she is not exposed to popular cultural cartoons. Perhaps we are just too sensitive. Regardless, it goes against our message of kindness and sisterly affection. I prefer \\"The Very Brave Witch\\" (although she and her sister find some of those stories rather boring). \\"It's the Great Pumpkin,Charlie Brown\\" is hilarious, but those kids are really mean to each other too. It is easier to talk one's kids through it though--the plot and animation are much slower.

An 11-week-old fetus has eyes, ears, fingers, toes, nose, mouth, heartbeat, hair, fingernails, genitalia, and spinal column. Logic would tell us that all resembles a \\"human\\". For further confirmation, check out \\"A Child is Born\\" by Lennart Nilsson.This book also makes the choice of abortion look like something that every woman should experience as a rite of passage. Example: Lucy, a girl who decided to get an abortion in college, said she was \\"proud of the first real choice she ever made\\" since her parents had always \\"made all of her choices for her\\".

Please remove this book from your list or provide an accurate review, one that reads more like this: \\"This book provides a one-sided view of the topic of abortion.

She often went off pitch. Her vocal portrayal fell flat (reminding me of Netrebko's equally unsatisfying recent rendition).

When I try to rewind the tapes 2 of the 4 tapes stop rewinding and shut the VCR off. When I turn the VCR back on, the tape pops out and I have to go over to the set and push the tape back in and hit rewind again. It takes about 3 or 4 times of doing this to get back to the beginning of the tape. VERY annoying. It's not the VCR as I have tried it in a couple of different machines with the same results.

It's loud and cumbersome for him to play with. We ended up returning it to Target and purchasing the smaller version of this toy from Amazon. Not only was the scale much better (this Slinky Dog is HUGE and CLUNKY) but he liked the smaller one much better. It is the only time in his life he has ever let me return one of his toys.

The pull string does come out between his eyes but there is a little hook on his chest where you could put a string through if you wanted to. We tried this but his head was too top heavy and just hit the ground when my daughter pulled it. She sits on the floor and just pulls his string that way, there's no way you can stand up and pull him as the string is too short.

Not a big deal, but if you're annoyed by the way any and every thing outdoors seems to stick to the round laces, be ready to replace them. Overall very sharp with a thick sole.

It is one of those \\"quickie\\" books that takes only a superficial look at its subject. There is little on how Meyer was able to pull off the feat of going from the professional disgrace of the porno flick racket to becoming a big budget Hollywood filmmaker.

The recollections are short, to the point, and tell stories that will remind you of your own front porch, or that of a loved one.

Because the majority of the stories are written by adults about their childhood, it is one of those books that can be enjoyed by anyone, young or old alike.And because the stories are short, they are wonderful fillers -- just enought time to read one during break or lunch. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Missed","review":"Each story in Forget Me Knots...from the Front Porch is told with such vivid detail that the authors' memories jump right out from the pages.

These and other stories in this inspiring, satisfying, engaging collection combine to show the many ways we have of nurturing a legacy that lasts, creating a family of faith where spiritual roots grow deep, and where wisdom, values, and the sensibilities of love are passed as a kind of spiritual legacy from one generation to the next.

This is a favorite in my household, and we laughed at Amelia Bedelia's attempts of playing baseball.Our favorite part was when she hit the winning run, 'stole' every single base along the way, and she ran home like everyone told her to with all the bases.

Whether \\"stealing home plate\\" or \\"dressing the turkey,\\" Amelia always surprises and delights. Children will be begging parents to read these stories again and again.

Because of Amelia's literalness, will there be a disaster? Will Amelia's team win or lose? Will Amelia need saving?I love Amelia Bedelia books. If you haven't been lucky enough to discover her, I recommend these books.Amelia Bedelia is one of my favorite characters.

Perhaps all of the scenes?I then stopped the DVD, removed it from my player, and put it back in the Netflix return envelope. I then went to the Netflix website and posted pretty much what I've written here.Right now I'm thinking of a movie from the early 80s entitled \\"Student Bodies\\". It didn't make a lot of sense, but it was OK. At least it was amusing.My take on \\"Slim Susie\\" is that, after 30 minutes, it didn't make a lot of sense either, but I didn't find it even remotely amusing.It just isn't my idea of a good movie.

The leather patterns are a bit weird, but the coat is so dark no one should really notice. If the smell is too much, put fabreze or colon on it. They work fine. Buttons are a bit weak. The quality of leather is beyond the price. I dragged the coat in dirt and mug to give it that old dirty worn look. I even ran over it with my car a few times and it's held up nicely. Also typical leather aging techniques will not damage the coat. Just be gentle and patient. If you are looking for a Martix style coat. this is not for you.

I say for a year and half use it is a pretty inexpensive toy! Especially since it is her absolute favorite!!!We live in Michigan and I really think what has done ours in is the snow. She will abandon it in the snow overnight so then it gets water in the small \\"bite holes\\". These holes will fill with snow, freeze, and cause more damage. Also - if we have another dog over in the winter and they start tugging on it they will pull it apart because of the freezing.

She still knows how to \\"move\\" her voice but it sounds really different, it's so powerless and it makes me sad as a fan and mostly as a listener. You can realize what I'm saying listening to \\"Joy to the world\\" and \\"Who would imagine a king\\" that she has recorded years ago for the soundtrack of her movie \\"The preacher's wife\\", and where her voice is at her best.

I can't believe she would release this sounding an absolute wreck.\\"The First Noel\\" & \\"O Holy Night\\" are the only tracks on here that are tolerable. Besides that Whitney ruins gorgeous classics such as \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" & \\"Little Drummer Boy\\". The album's sole new single \\"One Wish\\" is awful and one that showcases Whitney's new lack of talent.Skip this album, it is a complete waste of money and one of the most depressing albums in the world (because Whitney's gorgeous vocal talents are gone). I used to think the worst thing that ever happened to Whitney was her marrying Bobby Brown, but I retract that statement, cuz this is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would Have Imagined....a Drug-Induced Voice?","review":"I'm been a long time fan of Whitney and it is sad that this current album wasn't well conceptualized and delivered. This album was produced with little or no thought in the selection of tracks and interpreting the song. Whitney sings like she is rushing to get done with her performance. If you have her first few albums, you can clearly see the talent that could have made any horrible song come to life. But this time around, Whitney tries and fails to deliver. Her rendition seems rushed, deep, hoarsy (and sometimes even raspy) vocals make us wonder why she chose to not to invest on her gifts but squander all her god given talent on drugs and be with a wife beater. Almost like she is headed to a path of personal destruction. Her deteriorating vocals truly mirrors her self destruction, judged from her erratic tv appearences. I am extremely dissapointed with this latest release of hers.

I used to be a die hard HOUSTON FAN (I even enjoyed parts of her last studio recording), however on this CD, we witness an artist slip sliding down the \\"SNOW\\" trail.Vocally, this CD does not present HOUSTON with a strong artistic achievement. This holiday cd is terribly cliche and a product most could live without.MARIAH released a better holiday CD in 1994 as did CELINE with her seasonal CD of 1999.The once impressive Houston now sounds frozen in time partly due to the horrid 1980's musical arangements.For your money, you would be better off purchasing the new holiday CD from HARRY CONNICK JR ~ HARRY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.One wish: EARTH TO HOUSTON ~ Get your act together it's a sin to waste a talent like yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Have Some SnoooOOOoooOOOooow and MistletoooOOOoooOOOoooe...","review":"There's not one single note of joy or warmth or sincerity to be heard on this miserable Christmas record. Whitney's singing is every bit as stagnant as the second rate r&b arrangements that desecrate these once beautiful Christmas standards. Being the greedy songbird that she is, her voice has a tendency to go all over the place, as if her wet finger were stuck in an open light socket. The end result is a crass and tactless product, a pathetic excuse to wring a few bucks out of her hopelessly adoring fans during the holidays. I have One Wish as well; that Whitney never makes another Christmas album. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!!!","review":"This is a wonderful Christmas cd. I'm not a music expert so I can't point out all the \\"flaws\\". I can only enjoy it for what it is.....a great cd. If you want something to listen to in the car or nice background music, this is it. A couple of my favorites are One Wish and O come O come Emanuel. How people can say Mariah Careys' cd is better I don't know. Even when Whitney is not at her full capacity, she is still a far better singer then most of the people out here today. Let's not judge anyone by their personal struggles but by their talent and abilities. Listen to it...and I think you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain weak","review":"the people on here who say that whitney's voice is just as strong as ever are nothing more than die-hard fans who don't want to except the truth. whitney's constant drug abuse has clearly taken its toll on the diva's once flawless voice, making it very raspy and scratchy, a problem that she never had to worry about.for those who have heard whitney's live performances as of late (especially the disgustingly horrific performances from VH1's 2003 Diva Duets) that is exactly what she sounds like on this album, only with the digital enhancements which still don't do any justice to the crystalline voice she used to have.its such a shame that somebody so gorgeous and so talented has allowed drugs to ruin her life, and the worst part is she is still using, regardless of what she says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney is very talented, but this is a very annoying album...","review":"Whitney is very talented, but this is a very annoying holiday album. There is too much back-beat on nearly every song making it sound more like a Muzaked soul album than a Christmas offering.

Not a single song on this CD will be added to that list, which really bums me out because she has an amazing voice. I was so rooting for this to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"A must have!!!My family hasn't been able to stop playing it. This CD is absolutely beautiful, and I wish the jealous hater's would stop writing hateful reviews. It is quite obvious that they haven't listened to this wonderful CD.

I GUARANTEE IT WILL PUT YOU IN THE HOLIDAY MOOD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listerine Gargle","review":"I ordiarily love Ms Houston and just knew this would be a good one. Boy was I ever wrong.

It is completley AMAZING..everyone who doesen't like it should go 2 hell becuase she sounds great and it looks like she is FINALLY in a good place in her life. From \\"The First Noel\\" to \\"O Come O Come Emanuel\\", you will NOT be disapointed with this CD---A MUST BUY TREASURE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney: The PREMIER Vocalist","review":"With the release of \\"One Wish,\\" Whitney has proven once again that she is more than equipped at effortlessly singing any style of music. Her luscious vocal cords wrap themselves around such holiday classics as \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" with such emotive grace that it will leave the listener stunned in amazement. She not only conveys the meaning of each song with her unique vocalizations, but she brilliantly finds the HEART and graciously transports us to another place... far, far away. On more religious offerings such as \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel,\\" and \\"O' Holy Night,\\" Whitney outdoes herself with spine-tingling interpretations that are AWE-INSPIRING.Whitney Houston is THE Premier vocalist of her generation.Easily a ***** star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again.","review":"Once again Whitney has proven she is still the best. Even with dealing with the media constantly trying to get into her business she has proven she can sing.This is a great collection of music where you can hear Whitneys strength. She has outdone herself. This Holiday album will be around for years to come.Great Job Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just confirms Whitney's downward spiral","review":"This album is horrible. Why her voice is still beautiful the vocal arrangements are horrid...like she hit the crack pipe before she went into the studio. This is a lazy effort with too few songs and two recycled songs from the Preacher's Wife. She needs to hire a decent producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"whitney \\"crack\\" houston is going down","review":"Not since 1998 release my love is your love have she done anything worth getting.

Shut the hell Whitney and retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but Not the wonderful voice","review":"I know Whitney can sing but in the past couple of years she has not been up to par. One Wish is a prime example of her singing woes. Not the best but it is better then her recent past live performances.Hope Whitney can get her full voice back. She was once the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Once Again","review":"I have supported Whitney ever since she dropped her first album. She USE to be one of the best vocals out there. However, this CD is just average.It's not filled with her high pitched hitting notes and several times she sounds like she is straining! Most of the songs could have been produced better. She shouldn't have recorded Freddie Jackson's christmas song, \\"One Wish.\\"I'm so glad that I listened to this CD at a friends house before I spent my money. The project before this christmas CD had given me plenty of warning. I like to warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON't BELIEVE THE HYPE!","review":"I would use caution when reading the reviews here. While some are legit, there are some (including this one) whose ranking means nothing. If you take a look at reviews for a lot of the Holiday CDs that have come out this year, as well as previous years, you will notice that someone (or several people) having been using the reviews to advertise for Whitney's album. It is sad. I haven't heard the album, I'll bet it is great, but I don't like the tactics her fans or her \\"people\\" are using. It is wrong and rather pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least she didn't Swear","review":"At least she made it threw the 11 Christmas Songs with out swearing.....but it's hard to accept these songs from a woman who can's say 2 words without swearing....Sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Whitney","review":"This is a great listen for Christmas holiday songs.

I thought to myself, Whitneys doing a Christmas Album how nice. While out shopping one day I noticed it and picked it up. I was skeptical about what i was going to hear when I put it in, but I WAS BLOWN AWAY. Everything from the production to her magnificent vocals is well put together. She sound so wonderful singing such joyous songs, and you can tell she really had her heart into it. She even does a little duet with her daugther Bobby Kristina, which is cute. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YET, GO OUT AND GET IT, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC FOR YEARS TO COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Heaven Sent","review":"One Wish is the Christmas album, that the public has been waiting for.

Apparently Ms. Houston-Brown just released the album of a lifetime. Well, I'm here to say that this is a HORRIBLE album that never should have been recorded.

Miss you Whitney....."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wish...Whitney Is On Her Way Back","review":"Although Whitney's performace on this CD is not as perfect as ALL of her other work, we must consider she was working with L.A. Reid, the head of Arista at the time and as with the CD Just Whitney... it is just a different kind of sound and production than what Houston usually delivers. Even on Whitney's worst day she can, AND DOES out-sing any other performer living or dead. My favorite track has to be Little Drummer Boy, I love the arrangement and Whitney Rocks. I am so glad Whitney has dumped that loser of a husband and I have no doubt she will rise to the top again. Whitney is and will always be the greatest vocalist to ever live. God has blessed her, and has blessed us with her talents. THANK YOU NIPPY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Wish a Major Disappointment","review":"I should have known better than to listen to the so-called music experts and critics who stated that this is a good CD. It is overproduced, Whitney screams a lot, and it lacks reverence and depth. The only bright spot is \\"Who Would Imagine A King?\\"Don't be a fool like me and waste your money. I am so sorry I bought this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this 0 stars I would!","review":"This CD is so bad it's funny! What the Hell was she thinking when she made this crappy album! She totally blew Oh Holy Night and the best thing about this whole album is her daughter sining \\"Little Drummer Boy\\". Whitney should never release another Christmas album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how the mighty have fallen","review":"It seems the once powerful and classy woman we know as Whitney Houston has fallen even further. This album needed a different producer. Her voice sounds terrible on almost every song. I don't know if she will ever regain her \\"edge\\". Her career needs help, and this album is not going to help. I hope she tries again because she has so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"A much anticipated failure.","review":"I was extremely excited when I realized Whitney Houston was releasing her first Christmas album. I have studied voice for years and have always considered Whitney to have exception range and depth in her music. However, the album One Wish did not represent that same old Whitney Houston. Her songs are breathy and airy. She doesn't seem to be able to maintain proper breathing technique. And I found it quite amusing how she adds her own words when she can't remember the real words. I loved Little Drummer Boy with her daughter (I would have bought a whole album of her daughter's) but then Whitney can't even let her daughter sing without adding comments in the background. The only saving grace for this album would be Joy to the World, which was recorded when Whitney filmed the movie The Preacher's Wife. My mother actually gave her album of this cd to me not knowing I too had unfortunatly bought this album. My advice is to stick with Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought It Would Be","review":"Mariah Carey released a great Christmas collection years ago and I saw that Whitney now had her turn at it! It was a turn in the wrong direction! This album is nothing I thought it would be, Whitney tries to sound like her old self but struggles, resulting in a hoarse belt at the end of O Holy Night (which is a very boring and uninspiring rendition.)I say save your money and purchase Mariah Carey's 'Merry Christmas', it's full of traditional sounding Christmas songs that put a smile on your face, not make you cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE WISH REVIEW","review":"1.)

So sad to see a living legend like her lose her voice.The only good song her is \\"O Come O Come Emanuel\\" the rest of the songs are nice but Whitney's raspy voice cracks to much so it's difficult to enjoy it. You are much better off with Christina's Christmas album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See what drugs do to a diva","review":"Now, if you have been a Whitney Houston fan since the beginning of her career, the first thing you would notice on this disc is the degradation of her voice. It sounds as though she has lost the danty fluidity which gave her voice that soft yet powerful strength during the 90s. Similarly, there are instances where it sounds as though it is such a struggle for her to belt the high notes. The deepening and hoarsening of her voice are likely due to 1. her drug use and 2. general vocal stress over the years.Of course, the disc is not entirely disappointing. Luckily, Joy to the World and Who Would Imagine a King were barrowed from the Preacher's Wife soundtrack to give listeners a taste of her voice when it was in top form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and Saddened","review":"I eagerly bought this cd, thinking 'it's about time', but I was sorely disappointed. I will admit that I was a big fan back in the 80's, but my enthusiasm had waned, despite any drama and/or bad publicity in her life, I think she is an exceptional singer and was really excited to hear her Christmas cd. I was, however, shocked and saddened by her voice - oh my god - what has happened to that beautiful instrument? Make no mistake, she still can sing, but it doesn't even sound like the old Whitney, in fact, if I hadn't known it was her, I would have been hard pressed to tell it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas songs","review":"I was hoping this would be as clear and perfect as her version of the National Anthem--I was disappointed and will recycle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Christmas CD","review":"We have several Christmas CDs.

This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor whitney","review":"well, i know several people who purchased this cd and they all returned them. i listened to it saying it couldnt be that bad..well it kinda was. the only really good songs where the two from THE PREACHERS WIFE soundtrack. those where recorded when she still had a great voice. once again the new songs find her reaching and screetching for notes that at one time were effortless for her. ive read some of the reviews here and wonder what cd did some of these people listen to. i guess those are the die hard mrs. brown fans who refuse to believe that she has lost it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Whitney","review":"I bought this album in spite of the lukewarm reviews. I was not disappointed, however, Whitney's voice certainly struggled a lot on the high notes. This is not classic Whitney (talentwise), \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", \\"The Bodyguard\\" soundtrack, etc...Whitney of the 80's/very early 90's or when she made everyone cry when she sang \\"The National Anthem\\" at the Superbowl...way back when. But if you love Whitney the artist then you can overlook her career setbacks and appreciate this album which I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all impressed","review":"with the expection of 'o holy night' & 'o come o come emanuel' this is album is an absolute disaster of extreme proportions. whitney is a coke head who lacks the vocal prowless that america once fell in love with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wish...I Love It, I Love it, I Do!","review":"When I purchase Whitney Houston's \\"One Wish\\" album...All the good reviews, I've read about her product is true. Whitney really have out done herself on this christmas album. I have so many favorites on \\"One Wish\\" thats its so hard for me to just pick one that stands out. When I play Whitney Houston \\"One Wish\\" I keep it going from start to finish. I would recommend this Holiday cd to anyone its good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wish...Five Stars","review":"If you're looking for a great christmas album that will touch your soul, and keep you wanting more look no further then \\"One Wish\\" its a great christmas album from begining to end. Every traditional song Whitney sung she did it with such classy, style. I will definately be playing Whitney's \\"One Wish\\" every year for christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Message to all the Naysayers : WHITNEY IS BACK","review":"For the guy who reviewed with one star..sir you are SADLY MISTAKEN! Whitney Houston is definitely back with her new Christmas Album. I was just like you, waiting for another horrible performance but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! This is a MAJOR STEP UP from \\"Just Whitney\\" . Whitney has had her problems and we are all human :)..anyway its proven in this album that her voice is back to what i recognize it being long ago. She still can vocalize well and the best songs on this album are: Joy To The World, Little Drummer Boy (w/ her daughter Bobbi Kristina), The Christmas Song... thats just for starters. You Will love EVERYTHING about this album! Her Daughter's featured solo on \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" was excellent and just shows that those vocal skills run in the family..shes going to be a great singer. Go and buy it and see for yourself!This is one of her best works yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 'Just Whitney'","review":"Good!

Personally, I think her last album \\"Just... Whitney\\" did not get the credit it deserved, just like this album will probably not get the credit it deserves either. \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and \\"The First Noel\\" are my favorite tracks. I have to admit I think Whitney has either lost her higher register or just decided not to use it that much on this album, either way it is a shame and why I gave the album 4 instead of 5 stars. Mariah Carey's X-Mas album is still the best out there, but Whitney's runs a close second. \\"One Wish\\" is definitly an album not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always wanted and never had.","review":"This was a desire to have for holidays and glad to have gotten it for a bargain.

What I got instead was a bunch of Krugman talking about himself and why he thinks he's such a great person (maybe he is, but he should have instead titled the book \\"Why I'm So Great\\").

It helps parents know their options as to treatment in therapy, diet, and medication, etc. It also gives a much-needed success story to lift parents' spirits when they are just recently adapting to the diagnosis of autism for their child.My only reason to give the book 4 stars is that I cannot relate to the concept of radical diets because my son has never shown the symptoms of toxicity or allergic reactions to foods. Although the author was very straightforward in admitting that a casein-free, gluten free diet may not help all autistic children, this is a very prevalent topic of discussion with parents of autistic children -- and my point of view is that there are quite a few children who are autistic without any external factors contributing to the autism (i.e. toxicity to wheat, or MMR shot problems)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I had a child with special needs in my preschool class. And I know very little about autism. This book was a very informative way to begin learning about this developmental disorder. The author shares much information that would be helpful and practical for parents who are beginnig the journey with a child with this didsorder and many references are given for organizations and other books that could be helpful. I liked how she took her journey with her son and shared all she learned. A great resource. Got it for a very cheap price on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you even suspect autism read this book!","review":"I had a suspicion our son had autism long before it was confirmed by any Doctor. I bought this book, hoping for some clues and answers. It was fabulous! If you have a suspicion that your child might have a form of autism, get this book, that way when you do go to the Dr. you will be ahead of the game. There are so many great resources in the book, and for the newly diagnosed the chapter,What to Do First is an excellent place to start. Another nice feature of the book is being able to pick out specific chapters you want to read, you don't have to read it cover to cover. It has been such a blessing to me, I cried when reading of her early experiences with her son, thinking of how I could relate, and in some cases wondering how the outside workd can be so cruel. It has given me a wealth of information and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Present I Ever Received!!","review":"A friend bought me this book shortly after one of my twin daughters was diagnosed with Autism. I was touched by the gift, but after reading the book I have thanked my friend many times over. The book is a very easy read & I managed to finish it within a week. That is really saying something considering how hectic my life gets dealing with twins & one who is a special needs child. Lynn Hamilton does a great job explaining her life experiences along with giving accurate information on therapies and treatments. There are many times I still thumb through the book to look up a phone number, name or web address. There is so much information packed in this book. At the time I was very new to Autism & her book was the best starting place for my family. I have recommended this book to several friends who have children with ASD. I have also encouraged family members to read it so they have a better understanding of Autism & how it effects families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal with a lot of grasping at straws","review":"The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists. It is informational and a good read - for what NOT to do. Try - 'Overcoming Autism' as your first book - Lynn Koegel and Claire LaZebnik. I give it two stars since it doesn't really educate how to approach autism so much as how NOT to approach autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This book was an awesome read. Many interesting short stories about lots of MY childhood heroes. The book took me back in time and also let me catch up on what has happened to so many of the players I grew up with.

The work out is only about 20 min but it never fails to make me sweat. It took me a few times to catch on to all the moves (even though I've been doing Pilates for a few years) and to keep up, but now that I know the sequence, I hardly look at the tv.Some reviews didn't like all the intro's and history...but if you buy the DVD you just go to menu and go right to the workout each time. I have about 8 Pilates DVD's and this is my favorite one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight Loss & Pilates?","review":"When I heard the famous Romana Kryzanowska was going to make videos I jumped for joy! I live on the West Coast and have been fortunate enough to study with teachers who were students of Romana's.The strange thing is that I've never heard my instructors talk specifically about weight loss as related to Pilates. One day, however, I asked my teacher about this subject. She told me that tradtional Pilates should never be thought of as a weight loss strategy. That Pilates is a complete cross-training system within itself. And that if you study the classical Pilates method, then your body naturally changes and becomes slimmer as result of good form.This video is OK, but weight loss doesn't seem to be part of the traditional Pilates technique that I studied. I wonder what Joseph Pilates would think. And I wonder what Romana would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Endorse This Video","review":"I am a certified instructor who trained with Romana Kryzanowska during the 1980s and 1990s. I revere Romana like thousands of other hard working and talented instructors. I feel we share a special bond by experiencing the Pilates method through her greatness. There is no other individual in the world (who actually trained with Joseph Pilates) who is as creative as Romana, and who preserves the true method with beautiful musicality and authenticity.Having said these things, it is seriously discouraging to know Romana is casting the Pilates method as a weight loss approach. It's hard to believe that Romana actually approved this video, and it's suggestion of weight loss through Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners: don't try this at home","review":"I'm fairly new to Pilates and I had a difficult time keeping up with this exercise program. There provided little instruction on how to perform the motions correctly. Before I had a chance to understand a move, they were going on to the next move. It was hard for me to keep up.Also there was a 9-minute information segment at the beginning of the DVD that I forwarded past. It appeared to be about Romana's Pilates experience and the history of Pilates. I wasn't interested.This DVD is probably good for the people who are familiar and skilled at Pilates. I'm not one of those people. I wouldn't recommend this tape for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilates Is Excellent, But...","review":"I totally love Pilates and enjoy working out. I have been taking lessons with Pilates equipment because it feels so good. Because of wishful thinking, I bought this video because I'm a little overweight. And because I heard the woman featured teaches traditional Pilates. From my experience, no type of exercise can help you lose weight, because you must be eating a healthy diet---regularly. But, as I said, wishful thinking led me to buy this video.Well, I was disappointed because this seems to be yet another video that capitalizes upon our desire to loose weight. The Pilates method is great, there is no doubt about it. But this video cannot help you achieve the implied message of weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelated to Weight Loss","review":"I've studied Pilates at Drago's Gym where Romana Kryzanowska has taught for many years. And I've taken some lessons from Romana herself. I never heard anyone talk about Pilates that suggested it has weight loss benefits.From my understanding, Pilates was not created as a weight loss method. I'm curious why Romana Kryzanowska released a video that promotes Joseph Pilates' legacy as a way to lose weight. Romana is a one-of-a-kind teacher who embraces the brilliance of Joseph Pilates' tradition. Romana is clearly one of the most important communicators of the method.The Pilates method is awesome because it can transform your body and mind into better health overall. When Pilates is practiced properly in the original \\"East Coast\\" tradition (Joseph Pilates started his studio in NYC in the 1920s), you actually evolve into a more complete and satisfied human being.So, this video leaves me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best singles by Blur.","review":"This is a four track single, which includes a legitimately creepy instrumental \\"The Horrors\\", a cynical track about a husband who prefers TV to his wife \\"A Song\\", and a heading-down-River-Mississippi-blues-inspired \\"Saint Louis\\", which is somewhat a departure from what the band did before AND after.Four great songs from one of the best British bands of the 90's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"Just so you know, these are not the \\"original hits\\", most of these tracks are TJ's vocals over souped-up karaoke-type arrangements.

One of the discs that I was sent was \\"Peaks and Valleys\\", and next to \\"Wayfaring Sons\\", it's one of my favorite recordings. Primarily an acoustic album, it's filled with thoughtful and intelligent lyrics penned by a true romantic. Though it isn't really fair to compare musicians of Hays caliber, I find that the same qualities that I enjoy in songs by James Taylor are very evident in Colin's music.

This book has a several page description of object modeling. This description is the standard description that probably can be found in hundreds of other places. If you want to read an honest attempt to explain an object-oriented approach to data warehousing, read \\"The Data Warehouse Method\\".Beyond that, the author has almost nothing new or particularly insightful to say about data warehousing. A large part of the book is given over to a discussion of dimensional modeling. Rather than build on what Ralph Kimball has written on the subject, the author just regurgitates what others have already written.

Although I didn't bother to explore it much given those problems, from a quick skim through the text it seems a bit dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disc did not work but the content is one of my favorites.","review":"Neither the disc nor its replacement were viewable.

Granted, I only shave 2-3 times/week, but I think six years is still a long time for a razor to last. The power button on my old razor finally stopped working, and this is no longer sold in stores in the U.S. It is basically like the women's version of Gillette's Fusion ProGlide - Power.It is identical to the non-power Venus or Divine razors that are still available. There is not that much difference in the quality of leg shaving, but I find the vibrations really make a different for shaving my armpits, and although I've tried half-a-dozen others, I have not found any other razor, either manual or power, that does as good a job as the Venus Vibrance. I'm glad I was able to find it online, but Gillette, please bring this razor back...I'm going to need another one again in a few years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shaving with ease","review":"I've used this razor for years..with excellent results.

I bought it last year when my trusty old regular Venus broke after several years and was instantly smitten. The vibrations make it feel like an electric razor. I think it does a great job, better than the regular one (which is a big compliment). It's also very lightweight, a trait of the Venus line. I decided to buy a second one to put away for vacations but had a hard time finding it. I have been lucky to find 3 or 4 on clearance racks since and bought them up.

So I was really happy to see it in print again - that is until I received the volume. Part of the charm of this story were the illustrations and, apart from the one right at the front, they are missing entirely. Where is Marmaduke Scarlet and his geraniums; Wiggins; the 'dog' Wrolf; Zachariah et al?I also preferred the original dust cover - it was more mysterious - but that is just a matter of taste I suppose.I shall now be looking for an old copy and keeping my fingers crossed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic...","review":"I have been looking for this book for twenty years as I gave away a copy printed in the 1940's.

I was an avid reader of horse stories then which is undoubtedly why I read it. But this one was special and much more than a horse story. In rereading it as an adult, I found the writer to have created such lovely imagery and characters that must have been what drew me as a child. The book is truly a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Tale","review":"I put off reading this book for years (it was on my bookshelf as a child), and now I wonder why. Clearly written for children (albeit with some big words, especially as spoken by Marmaduke Scarlet), The Little White Horse is a delightful tale of love, forgiveness and restoration. Maria, the heir to Moonacre and its accompanying village of Silverydew, is led to discover the history of the locale soon after her arrival. I really enjoyed uncovering the secrets with her, and likewise how she came to resolve the problems that plagued the land and the people living there.The thought that I wish to take away from this book is this quote: \\"...nothing worthwhile in this world is achieved without love and humility.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrolf Reviews 'The Little White Horse'","review":"I am, of course, prejudiced in favour of this book - I am named for the central lion character.I have reread it a few times as an adult - my wife got it via an antique book store.

It was only after I was reading the book that I read where J.K. said only girls should read it.Well, I don't recommend anyone read this book. Even girls.

No matter how bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Of Cavities","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of J K Rowling who, according to the cover, \\"absolutely adored\\" it. I can only conclude that Ms Rowling has a sweet tooth for there is enough sugar in this book to sink a battleship.To summarise: Poor orphan comes to a magical manor house. Forms loving relationships with one and all - usually at first sight. Everything she touches turns to gold. And they all live happily ever after. (Oh, puh-leeze!)This book is not a patch on Rowling's own work. Don't make the mistake of thinking her recommendation suggests that it is. It is neither a mature work nor complex. After a strong opening it simply turns to mush and so many empty calories.And now I'm off to the dentist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little white horse","review":"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language. I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs. Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years. Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite book of all time","review":"I was stunned to find recently that J.K. Rowley named \\"The Little White Horse\\" as her favourite book when she was growing up. (I'm in the best of company.) I had no idea the book was still in print and am about to order a new edition from yourselves, not because I don't have a copy, but because I would like to preserve my old one in reasonable condition - insofar as that's possible, as I read and re-read it myself over several years. My 9-year-old has just read and loved the book. I am now reading it to my 5-year-old, who is trying to guess some of the mysterious links between characters which build up so dramatically throughout the story. I am not surprised, now, that I enjoyed it so much. Not 'til we read \\"Harry Potter\\" recently did I enjoy again such a plot development, or such delightful, brave, and unusual characters. This book deserves to be much better known. If it took filming it to make that happen, then so be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second look","review":"At first glance, years ago, I thought this was too \\"cutsey\\" for words. J.

Sounds awesome! But I was truly disappointed. The plot is idiotic, the art is passable, the writing is awful (written by Dave Gibbons, the illustrator of Watchmen... maybe this gives us some insight as to why he endorses movie adaptations of Watchmen and the Watchmen prequels coming out this year).

This is all wrong). Besides, her childish hints at erotica with Argentine men lead nowhere, and her comments about Paraguayan workers in the streets are nothing but racist.

It would be as hateful and inaccurate as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You said what?","review":"This book is untrue.

Perhaps she was with the wrong people?"},{"rating":"2","title":"perceptive if a bit too condescending","review":"Like many English travel writers, Ms. France blends very well in the society she describes, and captures masterfully all kinds of moods, nuances and details. Her choice of subject for the ten chapters is a happy one, perhaps with the exception of the chapter on the pampas, a bit out of pace with the rest. Unfortunately, despite all her (I am sure, genuinely) best effort, English travelers abroad can never leave home a sort of superiority complex so that foreign ways of doing things inevitably end up looking just a bit silly! This book reminds me of Tim Parks' books on Italy: both France and Parks clearly love their subject countries, but can not help looking down upon it... albeit perhaps unconsciously! A great collection of pictures well worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The writer sounds like unexperienced about cultural issues.","review":"For me the writer does consider the things in Latin America right or wrong or black or white but forgets to thing everything is just different from London.There are too much generalizations involved to her book that may not be agreed with most of the people who are living in Buenos Aires. Last, A classic British view to Buenos Aires. Do not loose your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me!","review":"Nobody can say this is a very good book. Nobody can say this is perfection.

I am not a fanatic nationalist and I think this book is so unfair.Some British hate Argentina and some Argentinians hate Great Britain, because of the Malvinas (Falklands) war, because of the Soccer World Cup, because of Maradona or Beckman... who knows... and who cares.I gave this book to a canadian friend who was curious about my comments about it, and he agrees that this book is awful to read.I am sorry for the writer, she lost lots of time in a beautiful city and she did not enjoy it at all.

I know that my city is not perfect of course, just like any other, and have many peculiarities, but one thing is to make a constructive critique about the real problems of the city and its people, and other very different is to invent and see things where they aren't. What this woman has done is to take some preconceptions about Argentina and its people and make them come true in an incredibly delirious way. This woman is nothing but a liar and a fable teller. The book can be entertaining to you, but take in mind that you are making a false image of the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy","review":"A perfect image of a frustrated writer.

Ontop of that the wire that connects the plug to the battery carrier somehow got twisted, and now has come entirely off, naturally making the headphones useless. At $50 you'd expect a product to last more than 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"these are awful","review":"what you can't see from the images is that the battery pack to power the noise cancellation is in the middle of the cord, which is just plain stupid and annoying. you have to stuff the battery pack in your pocket, so if you're taller than 5'7\\", then every time you reach in to your pocket to grab your ipod or whatever, you run the risk of pulling down the battery pack, which in turn jerks your head down and to the side. if you leave the battery pack out of your pocket, it's heavy enough that it swings around and hits stuff if you're walking around. i haven't even put batteries in the battery pack yet so i can't imagine how much heavier it will be with batteries in 'em. avoid these and look for noise cancellation headphones where the battery is on the actual headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise cancellation?

They're not a bad headphone if you compare them to the cheaper types that fall in the $10-15 range, but the fact that they claim to \\"eliminate up to 95% of ambient sound\\" is quite ridiculous.

The headphones are not bad quality, and though these headphones do provide some degree of noise reduction, there are some serious drawbacks -- at least for me. These include: (1) When you engage the noise reduction, noise is reduced, but so is the frequency range of your recording! (2) Either the headphones are relatively insensitive or there is an insertion loss even with noise reduction switched out. I assume the manufacturer assumes you'll be listening to heavy metal from a powerful amplifier. Well, I'm listening to classical through a flea-power anplifier. With ordinary headphones/earbuds, things are \\"adequate\\". With the Maxell, the volume is inadequate. And (3), with noise reduction switched in, the volume is even more inadequate.

Great for plane rides, train, or just long car trips with your family.

In fact there's a scratchy noise when it's on. The plastic has a cheap feel to it and the packaging is that impossible to open unnecessarily plastic non-recyclable stuff.

I had another pair previously for my flight to Hawaii from the east coast. The over the ear design reduces cabin noise and doesn't start to bother you for about 6 hrs of constant wear. Take a break for food and you're ready to go again. They had reasonable sound and adequate noise-cancellation to drown out crying babies and cabin noise. Add earplugs if you need total quiet to sleep. The price was right for my occasional needs and for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I purchased these for medical transcription and they work great. My only complaint is the annoying on/off switch is right in the middle of the cord, which is obnoxious. But I would buy again for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, good quality","review":"These headphones are worth the price. Although quality isn't up to bose standards, they still work and are noise-cancelling. I got them really cheap at a local Rite-Aid for only 30 bucks which is a great price. The only thing i find lacking is the volume of the headhpones. The volumes are very low and i have to turn up my volume almost two times as much as i normally do on any other headphone. As for the headphone breaking as people are saying, they arent that hard to break, just take care of them and your fine. I've had mine for 5 months and they are in perfect condition. I recommend these if you dont want to pay the $200 Bose headphones (although if u have the moolah get Bose) otherwise if your saving money these are a great alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"These headphones have a good sound, although they are of poor quality -- the wires easily break rendering them unuseable.

I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while they last, which isn't long","review":"I bought these in the second week of February. Today is April 3 and the right headphone is already on its death-bed. If I fiddle with the cord, I can get it to work, at least until it dies out again. It's an endless cycle of fiddling with the cord over and over again, only to have the right speaker die out again and again. I finally give up. I've read other reviews where the same thing happened, so it's not like it was an isolated incident.Any headphones that can't even last 2 months are not worth your money. Needless to say, I will not buy any Maxell headphones ever again and I suggest you don't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Effective NR; not bad headphones, either","review":"The noise reduction works as advertized. Low frequency sounds are _greatly_ reduced. Higher frequencies -- human voices, in particular -- are less damped. But if you spend time around machines (airplanes, air conditioners, etc.) they make your life a lot more peaceful. As headphones (for example, for a stereo) they are OK but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship!","review":"Within a month of purchasing these headphones, I was hearing loud bursts of static, as if the wires were shorting out or something. And the cord was a major nuisance. Since the batteries are housed in a compartment on the cord, this made it weighty, causing it to swing around a lot, and not doubt stressing the wires inside. I use noise canceling headphones a lot, for TV, listening to music while I work, etc. Although the manufacturer honored the warranty and replaced the headphones, within a month and half, the same problems developed. Maybe these headphones are better for short term use, on a plane flight. They definitely don't stand up to everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for the money","review":"I purchased these as a cheap alternative to replace my Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones, which were fantastic, but which I managed to break. The positives of the Maxell HP/NC-II: 1) they're very comfortable 2) They're fairly inexpensive, 3) battery life. The negatives: 1) they really need a volume control on the headphones to boost output, 2) they don't seem to cancel anything- they just put out a \\"white noise\\" regardless of your environment.If you're uncertain about whether to buy noise cancelling headsets and don't want to spend a lot of money, these would be an ok investment, as they'll leave you aware of the possibilities, but leave you hungry for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"So they're the best and they may not be the worst. I took them overseas and I was thankful they were there but it does not eliminate 95% of anything. The cord was not a problem for me as others have stated. I liked the length. Wish it had a volume button on the headphones to adjust sound. Battery life was fantastic. I took a 15 hour flight to and fro without having to place new batteries. Probably good for a lot shorter flights. Very compact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while...","review":"I actually like these headphones, when they're working. I believe someone else mentioned how folding can cause the wire to short, i've been through three pair of this particular headphone and each one has had that problem. All sound from the right cup dies out, and i'm very careful with use, they stay on my desk at all times, but do tend to fold them after each use. Anyway they're nice enough for me to try three times but i'm going to switch to a different brand that may last more than a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Noise-Canceling Headphones!","review":"I have owned these for 1-1/2 years now and have used them mainly when flying on commercial jets. Their ability to cancel noise is better than the several other low-cost models I have tried, especially on jets. They are very comfortable. Their sound quality is good but I wouldn't say excellent. They appear to be more durably made than most other low-cost headphones. I have had no problems whatsoever, in spite of them getting squashed in my briefcase many times. They are relatively large, closed ear cup headphones, but fold up and store easily in a provided bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - LOUSY MAXELL CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"I bought these in September for use on long flights.

All this rolled-up into one book!

Some people complain about the production of this album, but I think it's the rawness of the first album that helps pushed that particular recording into excellence. This time around, with more keyboards and a glossier sound, it seems more pedestrian and stale than its predecessor. It sounds more like a colllection of songs, rather than an album; it lacks a certain consistent intent, and as a result, the final payoff is anti-climatic.Nevertheless, his vocal abilities still have much to admire, and I still think he has potential. Nevertheless, Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another failure","review":"This Meade Skelton character produced another sup-par album. It wasn't technically as bad as his first, these songs aren't the classics that he butchered on his first album, but still musical atrocities.Believe it or not, there is a ray of hope for this \\"singer\\", as bad as this album was, and it was very bad, on the title track, 'They Can't Keep Me Down', I detected a glimmer of talent. If he gets a voice coach, and works really hard, he might not be that bad, but he's pretty far away from being 'not bad' right now.I am glad there weren't any stalker songs on this one, like that Nicole Kidman song on the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's So Much Good Here It's Scary","review":"Meade Skelton's Keys are superb.

I'm must say, that it doesn't strike me as a conventional \\"Country\\" voice, but more of an original one that you recognize right away like Sinatra or Elvis.The songs are this album are as varied and fresh as Meade's delivery. You get any style you want: fast, slow, and a nice mix of Modern and Progressive Country, with even Rock and Pop/Folk fusion. Not one of his songs sound exactly the same, and his vocal delivery is different on each song: He's not just one note. I reccomend this CD to fans of Singer-Songwriters with honest, yet non pretentious lyrics, and strong unique vocal stylings. I'm not a big fan of Country- loathe some of the stuff, and he can even sell the most hardcore of his Country flavor on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful just awful","review":"This music is incredibly dull and pointless not to mention Meade Skelton harassed numerous people on the internet to buy into his garbage that he's a great musician and he went on to verbally assault lots of people who didn't think he was as great as Elvis, a pathetic cd and an even more pathetic human being"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Knee Slapper","review":"Truthfully, I didn't know how I would like this album at first. I have several stand-up comedy albums that I've purchased over the years from various performers, and none of them have been as funny as I would have liked. However, Ray Romano's Live album had me laughing throughout the entire cd. Where does this guy come up with this stuff?? He uses examples of everyday life and puts his little \\"twist\\" on them, and it comes out enormously funny. I particulary enjoyed his story about what men do in the shower. How true, how true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say \\"F---ing Hilarious\\"?","review":"This is one of the funniest comedy shows I've every heard. I love that Ray Romano doesn't need to have a potty mouth to be funny! His timing is as always impeccable. My personal favorites are the bits on turning 40 (aka the prostate exam!) and Olestra (I have since introduced \\"anal leakage\\" into my social vocabulary). We want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good comedy, lousy recording","review":"The previous reviewer hit it on the head -- the lone problem with this CD is in how it was recorded. Ray's voice bounces between being loud, as if he's right at the mike, to softer, as if he's set back a few steps demonstrating something. The crowd noise also changes periodically, with the laughter sometimes being as loud as Ray. This makes it difficult to listen to the CD in the car without playing with the volume.That being said, I really enjoyed this CD and listen to it periodically. Some of the routines remind you of Ray's character on his show, but some of it is not for kids' ears. It's not because of language -- although the first track contains the only curse on the CD, the F*** word -- but it's more because of some of the topics around his kids and their diapers, or his twins ability to...well.. just listen on your own first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound check ... one ... two ... testing ...","review":"My wife has me addicted to his television program Everybody Loves Raymond, so when it was approached to listen to his stand up on a very long car ride, I thought it would be of some humor. Boy, was I wrong and the car ride suffered for it. It isn't that Romano isn't funny, it is the sub-par quality of the CD. Listening to it for about twenty minutes I could only hear about three of his jokes. Either he wasn't standing close enough to the microphone, or the company that published this release didn't spend the time to correct the sound. I didn't get past the twenty minute mark as nothing was making me laugh and the jokes that I did hear were average. Nothing much to write home about, but I would borrow a friends before buying this one just to check the quality of the sound.Grade: ** out of *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"still love Ray but not worthy buying this CD","review":"as other viewers commented, the sound quality is extremely bad in the way that you have to turn the sound volumn very very loud in order to hear Ray but in the mean time, your ears could be hurt by the crowd's clabbing. Bad recording unfortunately, but no discout on Ray's sense of humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Funny, but one problem","review":"Ok so I say its super funny then only give it 4 stars. Thats because the jokes are great. I have listened to it so many times in the car and I still laugh. My husband and I even tell the jokes to each other and laugh. But it loses a star because of the quality of the cd. Be ready to play with the volume. If you pop the cd in as normal all you will hear is laughing. Maybe Ray\`s mic wasn\`t connected right to the recording booth or however they record it but you have to turn the volume way up to hear Ray, then turn it down since the laughter gets really loud. Other then that it was great. It was such a great comedy cd that I would buy another cd of Ray\`s even with the same problem just to hear the jokes. Also I liked that other then one word in the very beginning that is beeped out, the cd is clean to listen to for the whole family. Other comedy cds, like Chris Rock have way too much swearing.

Mitchell's dry humor and pithy observations about the joy and frustrations of growing things are delightful. I loaned this book to a \\"budding\\" armchair gardener (who doesn't even have window-box to plant) and she loved it. She ran out to give several gopies to every gardener she knows.

It seemed convenient to have a device that combined the tuner function and the metronome function. Initially, the tuner and metronome functions performed as described; however, very shortly after we started using the device, it began to exhibit a variety of problems. In particular, it would refuse to go on, or when turned on, its display was populated with nonsense (basically, all of the LCD elements were on at once), and you could not put it into either tuner or metronome mode. Inserting fresh batteries might revive it for a few days, but then it would start to fail again. It has only been perhaps six months, and the device now fails to work entirely. Would recommend trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"Maybe I just got a duff one, but mine is far too quiet. It has lots of very useful functions, and tuning to it is fine because you don't have to hear the note, but when I'm getting the speeds of pieces for my pupils to play at we can hardly hear the beats and have to do it visually. It is also useless for trying to play along with the beat as it cannot be heard enough. Has anyone else found this, or have I just been unlucky?

He guides the first-time reader carefully through Joyce's (famously difficult) novel, but does not not challenge the mystery that make Ulysses a joy to read. Blamires's book will make your first reading of Ulysses more rewarding and enjoyable. Then you can read ulysses a second time--that's when the fun really begins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, VERY Badly Formatted Digital Edition!!","review":"This pains me to do this because I generally abhor one-star reviews in Amazon, because they're usually from clueless people or people with an axe to grind.However, I want to call attention to a problem with the Kindle edition of this book.Put very simply: the text of the digital edition I downloaded is littered with numbers - unlinked and extraneous - throughout the text of the first 20-30 pages, which is as far as I bothered to check.Proofreading prior to release would have been a very good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Needed Help And I Got It","review":"I too, like countless others, could not get passed Proteus, chapter 3, line 1: \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\". Complete frustration set in and I felt I had no choice but to set aside Joyce's masterpiece - that is until amazon.com sent me my copy of The New Bloomsday Book - A Guide Through Ulysses. With Harry Blamires' help I was able to make substantial progress in a very difficult but rewarding book. Blamires helped me overcome my initial frustration and understand the masterpiece that Ulysses is. By no means am I now an expert on Ulysses; however, I was able to enjoy Dublin through the eyes of Joyces's famous characters. Oh, how I am looking forward to visiting Dublin again, but on some future June 16th. Take the leap - join those of us who are already fans of Ulysses but let this book be your guide. You will not regret it. By the way - there is a $25 paperback version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Companion piece","review":"I am still digesting \\"Ulysses.\\" I read it while walking around Dublin a few years ago. It was marvelous to trace the steps of Leopold and Molly, and to see what they \\"saw,\\" but the novel remains a distant pleasure to the reader. I must admit it is not the most accessible book ever written, but it gets four stars for its intent ... and that it is better than \\"Finnegan's Wake.\\" Be warned: This novel is not for the casual reader. This is one of several excellent accompaniments to \\"Ulysses\\" and well worth the price and the time to explore the various perspectives of Joyce and this seminal work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with Blamires Bloomsday Book","review":"Blamires Bloomsday Book is a huge disappointment. It provides an overview or summary - when what you really need is a guide to help understand the language, the syntax, images and allusions. If you really want to learn Joyce and appreciate Ulysses, you have to get inside the language. I agree 100% with the reviewer who said go with Sparknotes if you're looking for a summary - it costs far less than Blamires, and is more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Thank you Thank you","review":"This item is one hell of a collectors item and I am so glad to have found and ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SOUNDTRACK FROM DEATHROW RECORDS","review":"After watching the movie \\"GANG RELATED\\" i really loved the songs by 2pac and Outlaws which was \\"LOST SOULS\\" & \\"STARING THROUGH MY REVIEW\\", those songs are awesome and to me were worth the price of the soundtrack so i did pick it up as soon as i saw it.After listning to some of the songs i was impressed, especially at the song \\"MADE N*****\\" by 2pac which is outstanding and a classic song called \\"GREED\\" which is performed by Ice Cube.They are the songs i mostly listen to.All the other songs are also brilliant, so if you are a deathrow fan i suggest you pick up this masterpiece featuring: Kurupt, Young Soldierz, Nate Dogg, Mack 10 and many, many more.In my view this album is worth the price as it has 2 cd's and a total of 24 tracks thats doesnt dissapoint.HIGHLY RECOMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rap soundtracks there is","review":"90% of all the songs on here are real good, but I hear there was a \\"re-release\\". with a couple new tracks from a new Death Row rapper(Y.G.D.

Murphy's portrayal is nebulous, and the best parts from the preview do not carry the whole film.

It's advertised as a comedy, and we are supposed to accept Eddie Murphy as a serious character after being told otherwise? Watching paint dry was more entertaining than watching this. Oh yeah, one more hot top- if the focus of the film is really on Jeff Goldblum's character development, you don't cast a major star in a supporting role because it takes the spotlight off the main character. If you want comedy, grab \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\" or \\"48 Hours\\". This is a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick","review":"The movie is not funny, but it is well written, and I particularly enjoy seeing Goldblums thought process, wrestling with himself over right and wrong, while G is always one step ahead of him, knowing that Goldblum will ultimately do the right thing.

We haven't tried creating the actual townhouse yet, (there is a thick booklet that looks like it might take a while), but my daughter and 8yr old son love creating their own houses. It comes with 3 books to make 3 different houses. It is definetely a fun child-parent project. The only thing I wish it came with was more of the little decorative pieces like more flowers, doors, and windows. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I liked other lego houses much better than this one. You can build the model and it looks just like the picture. What I did not like is that I felt limited in making up my own designs with this set. The 2 doors are differnt colors and I would have liked to have more windows (none in the back of the house). I'd even be willing to give up the car for more windows. Also, in doing my own design, I don't have beige bricks, so I had to use what they had and could not add any from my collection. So, that is why I gave this a lower than usual rating for a lego set. It is OK, but I like other sets a lot more because I think one can be more creative with them and get better \\"special\\" parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"teaching kids great lessons without them even knowing","review":"My son got this for his 12th birthday. He wasn't allowed to pick any lego that did not have over 1000 pieces or else it would not be challenging enough for him.

THis is a great sequel but I still found \\"FEel the fear and do it anyway\\" to being the best self help book of all time. This is still a great book, but it's just a big extension from her first classic.One of the more rememerable moments in this book was when she says over and over again. \\"What a great reason to do the exercises!\\"It's a great sequel and will help you all that are suffering from anxiety and depressive related illnesses. You just gotta give it time and make sure you aren't allowing your fears to get in your way of making you healthier and stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling the Fear","review":"Half way throught the book there are a lot of exercise and personal work for the individual reader.

It dropped off my couch on a carpeted floor and froze. When I got text messages it would say the text is from another person in my phone book, not the person who actually sent the text, It also sent random picture messages to people.

With fully customizable softkeys. The only gripe I have is the MP3 player software. I have a 2GB micro SD card. The phone works with it with no problem. But when I try to load more than 800MB worth of music in seperate folders, I think the MP3 software has problem generating the directory of songs.

Contributors include all the leading Galileo scholars, including William Shea, the late Mariano Artigas and McMullin himself. While the authors are rightly critical of the Church's role in the affair, they point out, given the documentation and testimony, that Galileo's own actions ---over the course of the initial general injunction against Copernicus (1616) to the time of his own abjuration (1633) --set himself up to at least the credible perception of having dealt deviously with the Holy Office even if he did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"another useless karaoke cd from disney. do they not get without graphics makes it just an instrumental track & not karaoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, terrible sound","review":"I would have had heart attack if I paid more than three dollars before s&h.;No effort of sound recording.

This wok is highly recommended. It is cast iron and heavy, so I can heat the wok to high temperature then add cooking oil (a Chinese stir fry tip: hot wok and cool oil).

Filled with emotion, this book gives an honest perspective of a citizen soldier serving our country with dignity. The author, Steven Manchester showed how courageous he is by sharing his innermost thoughts and feelings. And he did an outstanding job specifically describing the physical environment in the Gulf region. His ability to help the reader visualize and feel what he experienced is remarkable. Veterans, or not - people of all ages should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredibly Emotional Journey!!!","review":"At the strong suggestion of a friend, I picked up this book...and never put it down! At first, the author poured the foundation with some very real and honorable characters. As the story progressed, to my own surprise, my tears of laughter were replaced with tears of compassion. Throughout this heart-wrenching (and heart-warming) tale, the author painted some very descriptive settings in which the Gulf War was fought. And it seemed that just as I finished the book and wiped my eyes, reality struck: This author didn't just escort me on an exciting adventure that he took ten years ago- he actually taught me to FEEL what he and his comrades endured...and continue to endure. He taught me why it's so important to remember! I think it's time to offer the same support we gave our Gulf War Veterans ten years ago. After reading this book- it is clear that they need it even more now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unexpected Storm: The Gulf War Legacy","review":"The Unexpected Storm was not only educational and emotionally provoking but also an eye opener. It was difficult to put down and the pages continued to turn. This book will be appreciated by not only the men and women who have fought for all of us, but the book will also be appreciated by friends and families of those individuals. It opens closed minds to facts that many of us don't want to even consider never mind believe. The author with his admirable courage has given a voice to those soldiers who have been silent for so long. After reading The Unexpected Storm, I have a greater respect to all those who have chosen to fight for our freedoms clearly at their own expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good player, bad lifetime","review":"As everone else said, it's good while it lasts.

This is a classic, pure and simple, and should have you falling out of your chair laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUTHLESSLY FUNNY","review":"The AZA express (the Airplane/Naked Gun) team was in full force in this uproarious comedy from the eighties. There are so many hilarious scenes, and the cast performs them with slapstick gusto. Aside from the leading roles helmed by Danny DeVito and Bette Midler, we get great support from Bill Pullman(\\"possibly the most stupid person on earth\\"); Anita Morris as DeVito's sexy mistress; William B. Schilling as the athletic chief of police; lovely Helen Slater as one of the kidnappers; and even Judge Reinhold (whom I've never really liked that much) is fine as the inept kidnapper. Midler's raving and ranting is worth the price of the movie. A trendsetting comedy, RUTHLESS PEOPLE should leave you in stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny, Possibly Danny DeVito's best!","review":"If you like a silly comedy then you will love ruthless people. This movie is about a wife(Bette Milder) getting kidnapped and her husband(Danny DeVito) not wanting to pay the ransom. The kidnappers treat Bette Milder so good that she loses 20 punds and even has her own tv. Danny DeVito pops the champagne and and sheds tears(of joy). The kidnappers lower the ransom from $500,000 to $10,000. It's a nice light comedy. My dad and I call it the \\"Headache Cure\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"'I've been kidnapped by K-Mart!\\"","review":"Extremely funny movie. Danny Devito plays the part of a husband who married his wife for her money and now wants to get rid of her (he's got a girlfriend on the side). Bette Middler plays the loud-mouth rich wife. Just when Devito decides to put his plans into action, she is kidnapped. He is thrilled and refuses to pay the ransom hoping the kidnappers will follow through on their threat to knock her off if he doesn't pay up. While he's laughing and celebrating, the police think he's mourning. The kidnappers find they've taken on more than the average kidnapped victim, especially since they are really a soft-hearted couple who felt Danny owed them for ripping off the wife's idea. Bette Midler is no tame, soft spoken woman.The movie is one of those side-splitting comedies that is great from the start to the finish! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"Now one must know that anything with both Bette Midler and Danny DeVito will not only be a rather good movie but a funny one as well. THis movie is both of those as Bette continues her hit movie standing here. Bette again plays a rich wife who is kidnapped by some inept people. Once she discovers that her husband does not want to pay the paltry ransom, she combines forces with the kidnappers to turn the table on her husband and get the money. Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater are great as the kidnappers as they do a fine job. Bette once again steals the show with her red hair and fiery attitude. She is also very funny which helps the movie alot. Just a great movie from the 80s!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The era of Bette","review":"1986 to 1989 were big years for Bette Davis on the movie scene. In 1986 she filmed Ruthless People with Danny DeVito and the lesser known Helen Slater (Supergirl fame). Ruthless People, while a bit dated, has some hilarious moments and needs inclusion in any Midler collection.Who could forget the kidnapped Midler lifting paint cans to keep fit and lose weight. Well, it's one way to keep yourself busy while being kidnapped.Bette went on to star in the funny, but not as good as, \\"Outrageous Fortune\\" with Shelly Long.DVD SUMMARY: Ruthless People is a bare-bones DVD. However, worth owning for the Bette factor alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore","review":"What a funny movie!!!These days all comedies use the same tired formula, filled with low-brow humor.

So I decided to try this one, and was sorely disappointed. My 4 and 6 year old girls also did not like the Kernel Season's seasoning and prefer the other one. My 4 year old actually said \\"Can I have the cheese in the blue thing?\\" The Kraft cheese topping tastes more like real cheese, and whereas the KS seasoning is a much finer powder that has an odd taste to it -- we use the topping mostly for popcorn, but since the KS tastes odd, my girls will take plain popcorn over popcorn flavored with this. However, I lucked out and found that Amazon carries the Kraft cheese toppingg and got it on sale. Cannot beat the deal.

This is cheese salt. If you are looking for that cheese popcorn that turns your fingers orange, this isn't it. Add that much of this product and you'll end up with very salty popcorn you can't eat.Retail stores offer very few popcorn topping products, but you can find this Nacho Cheddar flavor and many other flavors locally. Try dog/bullseye and rollback where it's only $1.99. The internet has a ton of products, but you are either going to pay dearly for one bottle of something, pay outrageous shipping, or have to buy in bulk and possibly be stuck with 6 bottles of something you don't like.So know what you are buying if you order this product. Check your local bullseye or rollback first. You can try many different flavors without buying in bulk, yet pay roughly the same price as if you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats not what cheese tastes like","review":"Its ground too fine.. I inhale it when chewing and it burns my airway. Also the flavor is very artificial, salty, and strong. Tried on veggies too. It just tastes so much more like fake flavoring than anything else. If I closed my eyes, I would never guess this was supposed to be a cheese flavor.I like Molly McButter brand better. Its more flaky than dusty, the flavor more closely resembles cheese (or ranch or whatever). I pop the corn, spritz with a bit of aerosol oil, and sprinkle. Helps it stick. I probably wont buy this one again.

Added this year are hidden pathways and the ability to take out traffic in front of you and send cars and vans flying into other cars. This ability allows you to simply take out your aggression.

Then it tells the story of how Elbert was able to figure out what a message said, when no-one else was able to.I was completely nonplused by this book. I can find no clear plot in it, and nothing to excite interest. The thing I liked the most about it was the names. I especially like Elbert's name. The illustrations also are not the best.

Shame on Biograph (the reissuer) for not giving us the entirety of what is arguably Cohn's best work on record and a simply stellar example of mainstream modern jazz as played by five masters in absolute synch with one another (trombonist Frank Rehak's inspired solo work equals Al's). Regardless, there's sufficient material from a truly exceptional session to demonstrate convincingly why at least one of the three featured \\"Tenor Sax Masters\\" deserves the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Battlefield Earth of music.","review":"I try to see the value in every song. I am a songwriter who has had his work both praised and slammed by critics. Therefore, I don't make blanket statements about someone's art unless I strongly feel they apply. I try to see the value in every song. I see absolutely no value in this song.It may be too soon to say this, but this might be the worst song of the millenium. This is the Battlefield Earth of music.Good Intentions do not equal Good Music. In fact, they often equal the polar opposite... case in point \\"We are the World.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"with God on his side","review":"There is a song on Bob Dylan's third album, \\"The Times They Are A-Changing\\", released in 1964, called \\"With God On Our Side\\". \\"You never ask questions,\\" Mr. Dylan sings, \\"with God on your side.\\" He means his song title ironically of course. Conversely, in \\"Freedom\\", released in 2001, Paul McCartney sings, \\"God gave me [Paul McCartney, that is] the right to live in freedom,\\" and there is no irony apparent.It's rather surprising to find Paul McCartney invoking God at all. When in 1970 John Lennon sings of God, he is grappling with the notion intellectually (\\"God is a concept by which we measure our pain\\"). When in 1971 or so George Harrison sings of God, he is grappling with it emotionally (\\"I really want to see you, Lord, but it takes so long, my Lord\\"). Now we find out, after all these years of silence on the subject, that Paul McCartney doesn't NEED to grapple; he and God are best buddies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the point","review":"I believe most of the other reviewers are totally missing the point of this song. Sure, it's not one of Paul's best but I have news for you folks, you can't write a \\"Let It Be\\" everytime. Take the song in the spirit in which it was intended, to show Paul's support of the American people. He didn't want to get bogged down in sentimentality and he didn't have months to write one, he was hosting a benefit concert and needed a catchy tune. In that, I think he succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"You wanna like this....but....","review":"In the spirit of patriotism and heroism, it almost seems wrong to not support this record, but reality is reality and this is a poor song. Poor by Paul's standards, lyrically poor by any educated 5th grader's. The spirit of the song and the event was, and still is, touching. But it would have been nice if the first sounds of \\"Freedom\\" weren't stolen off \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". And in light of the historical context of the event, you'd expect Paul to come up with something a little less Sesame Street-ish. But alas, this was Paul \\"I can write a song in 10 minutes\\" McCartney, and odds are he was just looking to have something, anything to play that could relate to 9/11. Given his talent and previous credits, something more emotional or powerful was expected. Instead we're stuck with \\"Anyone who tries to take it away, will have to answer, because this is my right.\\" It's not a Civil Rights case Paul! Neil Young's \\"Let's Roll\\" stands up much better as a tribute song."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"This song has the musical value of a Budweiser commercial. If you want a good patriotic song then go and listen to \\"God Bless the USA\\" by...well the name escapes me but it was written a few years ago.\\"Freedom\\" is simply a painful song. Watching the 9-11 benefit concert, I felt even more embarrassed for McCartney during this song than I did during the Backstreet Boys' acapella fiasco.Apparently, Paul did not take too much time to write it, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-serving political propaganda","review":"Guess what? An attack on the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, or Wall Street, though certainly criminal, is not an attack on \\"freedom\\". I am not, of course, in a position to divine the intentions of the perpetrators of the attacks that precipitated Mr. McCartney's song, but it is reasonable to suppose they had something to do with resentment of the United States's military aggression and economic imperialism. It is not reasonable to assume they had anything to do with opposition to democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. Mr. McCartney and Mr. Bush would have you believe someone exploded airplanes through the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Magna Carta. No.In any case, this is an awful song. Its lyrics are nonsensical (considering the circumstances of the events to which they allude) and insipid, and its music is pretty much non-existent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless","review":"We've got NSync and Backstreet Boys CDs, etc., in the car, but my 7yr old and 12yr old keeping asking to hear \\"Freedom.\\" There is a God."},{"rating":"1","title":"thorougly disgusting","review":"Can you imagine anyone who knows anything whatsoever about music taking more than two minutes to compose this cynical jingoistic exploitation piece?

I understand what the author is trying to achieve, but she doesn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penhallow","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I didn't like any of the characters, and it was incredibly predictable. Sorry about this since I really liked her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Well-Written Book Ever","review":"I was very excited to find this book, having loved all Heyer's historicals, but now am afraid to try any more of her mysteries. Her writing is excellent: fully formed characters, great descriptions, spot-on depiction of the surroundings and times. Very atmospheric, so why did I hate this so much? The family tyrant , Penhallow, has absolutely no redeeming features. I could hardly wait for him to be killed off so I wouldn't have to read any more of his rants. None of the other characters, although beautifully depicted and described, are at all likeable either. Well, maybe one, a minor chacter named Clifford, but even he has a hateful wife. I definitely did not expect the humor and style of Heyer's Regencies. In fact , I was very impressed by her skill with a modern-day story, but what a slog this was !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I'm addicted to mystery / thriller books and this one kept me on my toes to the last page!Good plot, well written without unnecessary side plots this book will take you to a \\"unexpected\\" end!The \\"who did it\\" taken to a very high level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"This is a surprisingly bad book. For example, its awfulness is the only surprise in it. Furthermore, the characters are dull, the dialogue is false, the predictable plot is unbelievably slow -- probably because it's so lame -- and to add insult to injury, Penhallow is a very long book with a rushed conclusion. I kept on reading only because I couldn't believe that Georgette Heyer could write so badly. Ms. Heyer, especially in her Regency romances, has proven again and again that she can delight and amuse the reader with sparkling characters who speak remarkably period dialogue. She is one of the few authors I count on to make me laugh out loud. But alas! not this time. Nothing redeems this book -- not good ideas suffering from bad writing, nor poetic descriptions, nor any moral to the alleged story. Dear reader, spare yourself the miserable trip to Penhallow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull read","review":"Usually G. Heyer's books are lovely and enjoyable. Penhallow was neither. It went on and on with unpleasant people with nothing to recommend them. A sure disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not likeable, but its good","review":"I have to totally agree with the above review. This book is excellently written! It is similar to Agatha Christie's 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas' - only Heyer wrote her version about 5 years earlier. An old man is the tyrant of his household. When he is murdered, everything comes apart. Georgette Heyer conveys the emotions of dispair and hopelessness and regret much better than Christie does in her version. The murderer thought things would be better, they're not, but the old man can't be brought back to life again. I didn't like it because I like more light hearted books - and this is not Heyer's normal light-heartedness, admittedly, but it is very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegory?","review":"This surprising book might be the product of England's Darkest Hour (an Americanization of Churchill's \\"Finest Hour.\\") Penhallow himself might be Hitler or Mussolini. His numerous offspring could represent Axis or occupied nations. It would be a game to try to piece all these elements together, But, I think it's a mistake to try to analyze the book outside the context of WWII. The Blitz had just ended, though I suppose it was difficult to be certain of that; Heyer and her family had just moved into bombed-out London. England had apparently lost a major war. The times were too serious for Regency frippery and I think Penhallow may have been the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upside down murder story","review":"Penhallow is an odd story. Heyer spends about 200 pages introducing Penhallow and his browbeaten family, most of whom want to murder him, before he is finally murdered - and the reader gets to see the murder happen. The police are a side-plot at best.It's a creepy story and all of the main characters have nasty flaws that they let run their lives. I won't go through the list in case I give you a clue about the murder and the final twist in the end. They are compelling enough characters to reread the story but be prepared to do something cheerful afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual Heyer","review":"By far the darkest of Heyer's mysteries, Penhallow is more a psychological study. The intensity of the environment is a departure from the rest of her writing. Probably her best from a literary standpoint, but if expecting Heyer's usual comedies of manners, the reader will agree with last line found in the book...\\"A very unsatisfactory case.\\"DL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great study guide from Progeny Press","review":"We thought that this was a wonderful literature guide and bible study in one!

The special effects were lame, the actors were poor, Stephen King must be really embarresed because the book is no way near as bad as this. At some points I thought it was a spoof because the things that were going on were just silly. The film failed to scare me once, whereas other movies based on Stephen King's work (e.g. The Shining) have been excellent. If you want to see a 'not too incredibly scary' film based on a Stephen King novel then watch The Shining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible bad special effects..","review":"While still having memory of the book, I rented this movie. It was okay, but some of the actors was sort of bad. Especially(I don't remember names) the tough hero and the guy that wanted food all the time. What made me give this movie only two stars, was my expectations of the arrival of the langoliers. It was so bad when they came, it was like watching a 80's game of pacman! I fell of the sofa bursting with laughter, and afterwards coulden't take the rest of the movie seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"A remake would be a box office smash","review":"The movie was made for TV, intended to have many hours. On the big screen, it would have to be a maximum of 100 minutes. It would have better effects, but I would be careful, overdoing it can ruin it. In the version for TV, you easily see the movie could be shorter, many scenes were useless or just too long, shallow dialogues, too still. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The langoliers DVD","review":"A classic timeless (sorry) story with adequate acting and dated special effects. Nice to revisit now and again. My only complaint regarding this purchase is that it would have to easily be the worst DVD image quality I have ever seen (and I own over 2000 movies on this medium). For this reason I have rated the entire experience quite poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, I would choose zero stars if the option was there...","review":"I saw this miniseries when it first came out on T.V. a long while ago, but last night saw some of it again on cable (my boyfriend was curious and kept flipping to it) and was reminded of how horrible this movie really is. It is incredibly cheesy, and not in a good way. I am a huge fan of Stephen King and recommend some of the other miniseries that better personify King's work such as The Stand (though it is quite long) or Storm of the Century. While these other movies are better, Stephen King's books are always much more stimulating. There are just too many things going on in a character's mind that cannot be filmed. The only saving grace of The Langoliers was Bronson Pinchot who brilliantly played a psychopath. Just to see his previously hidden capabilities was almost worth sitting through that horrid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a JOKE??","review":"I am an avid SK fan but found myself being deeply disappointed in this joke of a movie.

As yet I havent read the story in night shift, my mother tells me it is very good so I feel i ought to give it a chance, but without her advice, based on the film I would give it a miss.

Then there's the psychic deus ex machina girl who saves everybody. Yarggh.On the other hand, if you're a fan of genuinely bad CGI (computer-generated imagery) effects, be sure to see this--these are hands down the worst you'll ever see in a mainstream production! It's like they got their rendering software in a box of cracker jacks--everything's all shiny because that's the easiest to render. It's a wonder they were able to remove hidden lines.

And Albert goes in search of a stretcher for young, blind Dinah (who has been stabbed by Mr.Toomy), armed against anyting with a toaster! A toaster, ladies and gentlemen.

Container holds plenty of soap (about 3/4 of a bottle). But, the sponge holder has no ventilation or drainage. There's always moisture at the bottom, and sponges get moldy, despite being well squeezed.

It is a simple, sturdy, and practical design.NEGATIVEThe major flaw with this product is that the scrub pad/sponge holder has no holes at the bottom. Even if you ring out the water from a sponge, as best you can, placing it in the attached holder creates a mildewed sponge in a short amount of time. I end up just placing my sponge on top of the holder rather than in it to avoid ruining the sponge and getting mildew odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS!!!","review":"I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this since I had an earlier model which I liked and lasted about 5 years.

I just went and bought a replacement because this is just awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks from the bottom if you can believe it...","review":"One of the best and long lasting pumps I have ever had, but it now sits on top of a sponge to absorb the soap that leaks out of the bottom. Such a shame too... It's an all metal bottom but they managed to leave a little hole in it. It I had a soldering iron I might try to fix it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Entertaining, Nostalgic","review":"\\"Cursed by a Happy Childhood\\" is a memoir about growing up on the eastern end of Long Island (the North Fork), 100 miles east of Manhattan, in a rural setting. (This is not the Long Island of suburban/urban Nassau County, but of a far more rural, sheltered place, east of the corn fields and north of the touristed Hamptons.) The author wrote the memoir as a series of vignettes filled with both reflections on his own mostly innocent childhood paired with advice for his own tween-aged daughter. It is sweet, largely positive, and endearing. The ten-page postscript is the largest detractor of this book: it appears to have been written separately from the rest of the memoir (perhaps an earlier, shorter version), often repeating vignettes, examples, and phrasing from earlier in the book; it seems to have been incorporated last minute and appears to have escaped the red ink of the editor as there are numerous typos. Read the book, but skip the last 10 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like promised.","review":"I read other reviews and I have used this item app. 25 times now and it works just fine, it workes like my old original one did 15 yrs. ago.

I had one of these back in the day, and I know how they are supposed to work. Shame on this seller for peddling this junk. I am wanting to get my video projects going. This took my time and my money.

One little nudge and this thing slides quite freely across a counter top. Not good for a product meant to hold six quarts of scalding hot food for long periods of time. And if the ceramic pot liner should break, you can't get a replacement - everyplace that once sold them stopped because they almost always break in shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crock cracked after approx 2 mo","review":"My previous crockpot lasted 10 yrs with on-going use. Needless to say, they don't make things the way they used to!UNTIL the crock cracked and ruined my pot roast, I loved everything about the Hamilton Beach Store N' Go slow cooker. Crock cracked straight through the bottom while cooking my pot roast! It was not cracked when I put the roast in but when I lifted it out, the juice started running out the bottom. Needless to say, I threw the meal away b/c I did not want to take a chance of a piece being in the meal.I was considering buying a new crock until I saw a review of the price of it. By time I pay shipping, it would be better to buy a new one. Even though I was very happy with this slow cooker b/c of its locking top, I will not buy it again as I do not want to take a chance of the same thing happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crock Pot Extraordinaire","review":"I LOVE the Hamilton Beach 33163 Stay Or Go 6 Quar6t Oval Slow Cooker.

When the rubber gets hot it leeches an unpleasant flavor into your food. This product should have been recalled. Everything I have cooked in this crock pot tastes like burning rubber. The lining also absorbs odors of things you have cooked in it and is very unpleasant. I contacted customer service about a replacement lid without the liner and was told that they don't make a slow cooker lid without the liner. I guess I will be purchasing my slow cooker from another company. I urge you to do the same. Do not buy this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beach 33163 Stay Or Go 6 Quart Oval Slow Cooker","review":"The best purchase I've made in quite awhile.

It is perfect for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"impulse buy goes awry","review":"I bought this crock pot, one, because it was on sale at a local store for 19.99, and two, because unlike most crock pots out there, it has those sturdy metal handles. Before I bought it, I noticed the rubber gasket around the inside of the lid, but didn't think twice, because, well, $19.99! But then I took it home, washed it, and filled it with some already cooked pot roast and vegetables and set it on \\"warm\\" for a couple hours. Long story short, the nice hot condensation built up on the rubber and then dripped down into the food and made it taste like rubber. For all I know, the smell/taste diminishes after awhile, but it occurred to me that this item is made in China (of course), where manufacturers don't have a great track record for product safety when it comes to lead, etc. So why take a chance? I packed it up and returned it. I've ordered a Rival crockpot off of Amazon (no gaskets, thank you), and I'm keeping my fingers crossed inside my oven mitts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks way too Hot","review":"I rarely use my crock pot. It has a hot spot that burns the food everytime I use it. So needless to say I don't use it as much as I would like. Burns the food in the hot spot area on the low setting, never use the high setting way too hot. Also I think the crock is really heavy and hard to handle for clean-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Good Movies I Purchased from Amazon","review":"\\"Hanover Street\\" has excellent actors - Harrison Ford and the beautiful Lesley-Anne Down. It is a romantic action/drama that takes place during war-torn Europe. You see how three people's lives are unintentionally intertwined, and I felt sympathy for each of them. The movie has a very surprising ending, and it made me realize how often fate comes into our lives.\\"Random Hearts\\" is an intriguing mystery and, again, Harrison Ford plays his role very well.I felt this double feature 2-DVD set was a good buy from Amazon for the entertainment it provided and for the price I paid. I will buy several more to give as gifts to my famiy members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This product did not work for me, when I inquired to the company about this product, they informed me that maybe I needed 2 to bring about the desired effect.

Molly just got a new dog, Bennett, and she has been bragging to her friends how Bennett loves her and comes when he is called. When she gets home with her friends she realizes her brother Rickey has been playing with Bennett and Molly thinks that Bennett likes Ricky better than her. So Molly decided to not share Bennett with Ricky, and Bennett dose not like it. One day Molly had girl scouts and she doesn't come straight home to Bennett, and he tour apart Molly's room. So Molly had to stop her after school activities. It was too much for Molly, so she decided to share Bennett with Ricky.The author wanted to write about a dog because she has a dog just like Bennett. Her dog is loving, and friendly. So far he chewed up five welcome mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid mix with some sparkling highs","review":"It's easy to see why the Blue 6 dub is the centerpiece of this mix; the track is so banging and gorgeous that it almost eclipses everything else here. There are other high points, though (the opener by Fluid X, the Attaboy remix of \\"Touch\\"). I have to admit that I've always been a bit baffled by everyone's love of \\"Earth is the Place\\", though. It's an O.K. tune, but nothing special. There are a few filler tracks here, but overall this is a real solid set w/good mixing by Francois K."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"One of the best mixes ever and more than lives up to its title.

The title \\"Yellow Peril\\" is well taken, although perhaps \\"Yellow Snow\\" would be more apt. The Dan deserve the royalties they earn from their legitimate releases. I wish Amazon would stick to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look to the source","review":"This book may not be one of Graves' best but in the spirit of Gibbon, he captures his sources well. However, for entertainment and a more immediate sense of the history, you may find it more worth your while to read Graves' source: Procopius, The Wars (not The Secret History!). It is less sentimental and gives a more edgy account of Belisarius' struggles and incomprehensible end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't worth it","review":"As a huge fan of Claudius and a lesser fan of some of Graves' other works this one comes at the very bottom of my list of preferred RG titles. The plot is ungainly, the action is plodding and the overall point to the novel seems obscured by Graves greater interest in the wider view of Roman society, which is all very well but goes unexplored in the text.After the directness of the persona in 'I, Claudius', I was shocked by the boredom induced by this book.Re-read 'Claudius' for the thirtieth time, its a better and more entertaining use of time than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An outdated work, neither very useful nor entertaining.

Low low quality - I think it may only be appropriate for 3-4 year olds.Yes my kids were hitting it hard, but not hanging off of it or doing anything other than punching it with their hands. Its a punching bag so I assumed it could handle a pummeling from two little kids. Obviously not.Also the gloves would never properly fit any child - the room for the hands is proper but then the wrist straps - essential to keeping them on - are made for adult size wrists. I ended up using tape to keep them tight on each child. This was fine but also disappointing that the people who designed this product didnt bother to check the wrist sizes of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Just fell apart, plus no where to hang the thing!

(The gloves were normal size and seemed to be sturdy) But I'm 5'5 and the actual bag comes to my knees. It's obviously shorter than a 6 year old (or a 2 year old for that matter). So I figured I'd try to hang it, but there is nothing at the top to hang it by? It's just tied off at the top.I never send anything back, so I will end up keeping it for my son to use his imagination with, but I was let down with product this for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!!!","review":"This punching bag is very small.

(I don't have it in front of me to measure). I was very disappointed as I thought this would be a great gift for my 6 year old. The material it is made of seems durable, but then again it hasn't been played with. I was trying to keep from buying a leather/vinyl bag as they are really too big. I am looking into returning it as I don't see it being big enough for him to play with. I would say it is more for a 3 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size for a smaller child","review":"This bag was the perfect size for my 4 yr old. The gloves were way too big - even for my six yr old. My 11 yr old is running around with them. The bag is surprisingly lightweight, but durable.

Unfortunately, it wasn't even worth that price. I purchased this for my 2 year old for fun, since he likes to hit my 100lb bag.

Stores reimburse you for products that don't work. You should stand behind a product that don't work too. My advise is don't buy this because if anything goes wrong they don't stand behind there products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped after a couple punches by my 7 year old","review":"The straps for hanging this bag broke after a couple of punches by my 7 year old. (The thread they used to stitch the bag and straps is too fine and fragile.) Description states \\"Ages 7 and up\\", but it's probably more appropriate for a 4-5 year old. (However, the gloves are plenty big, even for a 7 year old.) Also, you need to get creative about finding something low enough to hang this from.

Elaine could have done so much better with the storyline, and left out about 100 pages of filler. Imagine having a heated discussion with your mother and all of a sudden yelling \\"GBH\\". Everyone stops what they are doing and saying and gives a \\"Great Big Hug\\". Gag me.The premise of the book was good, but there was too much time spent on dialog with Josie's mother, which went over and over the same things.

This was not heavy reading, but brought me a smile and pleasure. I wish Josie would konk her mom, though. Amelia was \\"sweet\\" to quote her. I could identify with the main character.

The special effects are good when considered with due regard to the time the movie was released. Guy Williams is at his swashbuckling best, the villians are as over the top as one would hope for. Suspend your \\"grown up\\" notions of what makes a \\"good\\" film, kick back, relax with a bowl of pop corn and indulge yourself with some solid escapism.

I can't imagine what he was thinking. what a stinker!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy & Fun","review":"Guy Williams is in this movie. That gives it three stars to begin with. The fact that he plays the lead character with style gives it a fourth star. The costumes, historical value of the film and the fact that it is just a great deal of fun to watch gives it the fifth star. Guy Williams and an escape from reality for a while - what more do you want? If you like to have a bit of fun - buy this movie.

It is NOT a \\"marine\\" battery charger. By marine, I mean one that can be used aboard a vessel (ship,boat) that is in the water. It does NOT have isolation and you will make a battery out of your entire vessel and what will suffer is your underwater metal fittings. A proper marine grade (isolated) charger will cost more initially, but is much less expensive than a new prop or a sunk vessel due to a thru-the-hull metal fitting being eaten away.

I like the fact that it will charge my Optima batteries as well as conventional ones too. If it would do 6 volt batteries, I would give it the addition star. The circuitry makes it lighter and more versatile than the old box of bricks charger, I never found it getting hot as others suggested and the fan runs fairly quiet in the shop, though I haven't used it as yet on charging the trailer battery while we slept the night away.I found that you have to run the de-suffication cycle a few times to bring the battery up to full life. I am presently experimenting with bring back a dead cell battery, I have that cell up to 1.04 Volts from a .2V starting value, if it makes it back to 2+ volts, we'll see.

From the \\"thump-thump, thump-thump\\" of the running to the \\"a-whoosh-a-whoosh-a-whoosh\\" of the baby's heartbeat, Creech's utilization of onomatopoeias bring the story to life. The flow of the verses also lends itself well to developing Annie's voice. Heartbeat is without a doubt quality poetry/children's literature. The novel portrays emotion, insight, and a fresh viewpoint. Creech's effective usage of language and poetic devices gives Annie a sincere voice that readers can connect to.

I was excited when I heard Heartbeat was coming out, but I was disappointed when I actually read it.If you ask me, it was way too emotional. I like a little emotion, but not that much. I think it should have been more about running, instead of going into so much detail on the baby. It was written all in poetry format, which can be confusing to read, and somewhat odd.

I find the \\"musicianship\\" of some of the \\"artists\\" a rude \\"homage\\" to true American Appalachian music; they sound like caricaturists from a 1930's vaudeville act hamming it up as to what this type of music \\"should\\" sound like.

Sting wrote both the music and the lyrics for the song 'My Ain True Love' and will perform it for the Golden Globes but he is not on the albumn. In my opinion this is a travisty! When are people going to learn that no one should cover Sting's songs. EVER!The third dissapointment is Gabriel Yareds score Tracks are way too short.

There are no dedicated midi thru ports; instead, edirol has provided switches which, when enabled, echo the input ports at the output ports. This would be great, except, when you have the thru switch enabled, the device doesn't capture midi from the input port (at least not with my software). snaaaaaarfoh well, at this price, just buy a couple.

I tried it with four different computers, four different drivers, four different operating systems and got no response at all. The warranty is 3 mo/ 1 year. I'll have to see if I bought it on a credit card with extended protection. The moral to the story is do every thing you can to try out a piece of gear right after you receive it, even if you don't have time to really get into it. This model is discontinued now. It's getting harder and harder to find a good mid-level midi interface. The 1-in-1-out midi interfaces are a dime a dozen, and the high end jobs are also available.

I can't imagine a grad student at that age being so introspective about marriage.

When it was handed to me, it seemed almost too heavy for just a bunch of poker chips (around 30 lbs). But besides being heavy to lug around for periods of time, it's fantastic. The only thing that would make this set absolutely perfect would be $50 chips. They have a number of $25 and $100 chips, so it's not really a problem, but just a nicety.

His name was Raymond Carver. Day's stories stand on their own -- in fact, when you read these stories you can't help but wonder if Carver didn't first learn his habit of careful observation in Day's writing workshops.These are terrific stories and they deserve many readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Pop-ups...not much else","review":"I got the book mostly for the pop-ups.

The warranty is only 90 days and then they charge $100 to fix it. Plus, the Audiovox customer service people were totally rude and unhelpful.

I tested it out at home with the wall plug that was provided in the package. It worked great so i charged up the battery that night. Used the car adaptor the next day. The DVD cut off 15 min into it, and would not come back up. The player started to smoke so i returned it back and exchanged for another one (same brand). This one did the same thing except i used the battery instead of the adaptor and it started to smoke again. Even at the store it was smoking when the employee checked it out.

This product was definitely a worthwhile purchase. We have had no problems with the player so far, after use on 2 roundtrip plane flights as well as daily usage for a week in the hotel.

However, I plugged it in and charged it up. On my first airplane trip after receiving it, I foolishly packed the battery piece in my luggage and the player itself in my carryon bag. Sure enough, you can't use the player without the separate battery charger! After recharging and further investigation, I found a strange little switch on the side of the player that has to be in one position or the other for the screen to display your DVD. Also, I found the on/off switch to be less than obvious. If I had it to do over, I would follow the other reviewer's advice and get a Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT An Update of 20 Hot Potatoes","review":"I had used the book 20 Hot Potatoes Christians Are Afraid to Touch as a resource for teaching a Sunday School class years ago, and found it to be provocative, discussion starting, and yet grounded in the Biblical tradition of which Tony Campolo is a part (American Baptist). I thought this book might be an update of that book, and ordered it for use in teaching a class. I find it to be difficult for the participants in the class to understand. The chapters are longer than the earlier work, and the discussions are less thought-provoking.For a reader interested in the sociology of religion or theology and its relation to current controversial topics, this is a good book. For the general reader, I'm not sure it's the best of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campolo delivers","review":"Tony does it again! In ths book he has succeeded in inspiring, offending and educating. If you are a die hard evangelical you should read 1 Tony Campolo book a year just to give you some balance from the ultra right wing Christian media you normally subscribe to. Toney is a prophetic voice in a very sterile Christian communityI loved this book, It was well thought and bold. His chapter on universalism was the only chapter where I felt he rambled and made no sense. He basically laid out the cause for universalism and thin in 1 paragraph said he doesn't believe in it. Besides one weak chapter I would recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the comfortable Christian","review":"Tony always makes you think about what you believe and what Jesus would have you do. Fantastic book if you want to take Jesus' words seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Gray","review":"Essentially, this book boils down to this: the further off in the weeds we get, the less likely we are to have a monopoly on the truth. Tony's assertion of evangelicalism boils down to the Apostle's Creed and the authority of scripture. We're in C.S. Lewis-land at this point. The fights begin once we start getting into how those essential beliefs (the 'mere' in 'Mere Christianity') inform our action: our social and political world views.Tony gives us a glimpse into the formations of many of his world view lenses. It's a fascinating process - one that many of his self-righteous critics have probably never bothered with. Why, when some bumper sticker at the Christian Gift Center will tell you all you need to know? Tony knows enough to know that he doesn't know it all, and I'm thankful for that. Plus, he's not waiting until he's got it all figured out to make a difference: shaking things up and getting us out of navel-gazing ways.Preach it, Tony. This seeker is glad for your voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"The design of the trap is logical, but has proven to be ineffective for me.

Reading William S. Cleveland's The Elements of Graphing Data, you can see where Tufte drew much of his inspiration, and where he expanded, clarified, and improved upon Cleveland's ideas. Much of this is simply due to advances in computer graphics, personal computers, and printing and display capability - it's been 27 years since Cleveland's book was published, and the WWW didn't even exist then. Cleveland certainly isn't at fault for the technical limits of displays in his day, but for the modern reader and chart-maker, Tufte's work is more instructive and is a better starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Performance","review":"Although I wasn't pleased with the phone order process, follow-up conversations with Customer Service were good. The assembly wasn't difficult, but not entirely simple either. Took about an hour. I've had the bike (female) for three weeks. I regretfully say, I'm not pleased with the bike's performance. I had great expectations. I thought the bike was unusually slow and the auto-shift is loud and rough. Then yesterday, I participated in a community bike ride. My bike was the slowest! Even slower than the kid's. I pedaled faster, and the bike makes minimal advance. The shifting is convenient, but doesn't make up for the bike's performance. It's a shame I'm going to lose the shipping cost, because I paid that much for my old bike and I prefer it to the Landrider. Oh, and I forgot to mention, and one point, while shifting, the chain slipped off.

I have been born and raised in Alaska and even though I lead a more urban life, I could relate to and picture most of the accounts in this book. I think the more time you spend in the wilderness, the more you would appreciate this book. Hopefully, those of you who have not been in the wilds of Alaska will still get a lot out of this book. This book is without question one of the best books I have ever read (And I'm comparing it to classic literary works as well). I am not an emotional reader, but I had tears in my eyes more than once while reading it. One should pay special attention to the section on wolves - it is the real story - the one the animal rights activists don't want you to know. Sidney bridges the native and white cultures so well - I think both cultures would be better off if we lived to his ideals."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"these headphones sound good in print but they're not. they stopped working shortly after i bought them and i never took them out of the house! seriously, they are really funny looking when you put them on and you would not WANT to be seen in public with these on. people would point and laugh but it wouldn't last long because then the sound would go out of one ear and the other ear would be all muffled sounding. do yourself a favor and buy something else.also, don't fall for that \\"self-adjusting\\" noise, they don't adjust, there is just a piece of elastic [like in jogging pants but weaker] if you have big head it will work for you but otherwise it won't. it'll just sit there waiting to slide off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you value your hair!","review":"I also bought these headphones for work.

It just didn't have that \\"ring\\" to it or crispness. I tried them on my computer and through my receiver/stereo. Only if I cranked the treble to the max and dropped the bass to pretty low did it sound \\"fair\\". Even my wife agreed, who always shakes her head at my audio pickiness! I'm going to look for another brand or upgrade a few dollars-worth!I *will* miss the volume control on the cord, and the \\"mute\\" button, though it only drops the volume substantially, rather than completely removing the sound.

The sound is actually really nice, and crips with nice bass. These headphones are comfortable for like about an hour or so, but wearing them for a long time will make your ears heart A LOT. There is also another flaw. IF you have a small head, these headphones make you look like idiot because they are exceptionally big, and look weird, kind of like some alien communication device.Overall though there is nothing extremely bad about these headphones and they will suit mostly everyone who buys them, and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headphones for the money.","review":"These headphones are excellent quality for the money.
