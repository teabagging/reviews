Great buy and I would recommend it to anyone! They are not perfect and fall out of my ear occasionally, but they are good for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good","review":"This earbud came quite earlier than I expected and the date set by the system. As to the quality of this earbud, I think it is very good as compared to its price. I don't use earphone very often. I have not tried other very expensive and quality earphones, so I don't know the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull sound","review":"I own a pair of Sony earbuds, but wanted something to keep at work. The price was right on this product, and they looked similar to the Sonys, but boy what a difference! Compared with the Sonys, these sound like the music is muffled under a pillow. I don't know how else to describe it; music does not sound crisp with these. Vocals are dull, guitars are muted, bass sounds like a hum, and drums thud. Everything kind of sounds like adult contemporary.I am giving these two stars because the buds do stay in your ears (better than the Sonys even, and MUCH better than iPod earbuds) and are noise-canceling. So the two stars are for ergonomics, not sound. The cord is also longer the iPod buds and shorter than the Sonys, so not too short or too long.Anyway, the point is the Sony ear buds are worth it - perhaps not full price ($39), but certainly worth $20. Unless you aren't really particular about your music and just want general sound, I'd steer clear of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value Headphones Ever","review":"These are a steal for the price!

I use them often but treat them well so I can't account for their breaking except because of relatively cheap craftsmanship. It's disappointing because, before breaking, they perform really well especially for the price range. I won't be buying them anymore however because it's too frustrating to have a pair of headphones that need replacing every month or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veryong Reviews","review":"Arrived before expected, In one day and half to be exact.

There is no high end response and the low end is poor as well. They are essentially nothing more than a mid-range filter - awful sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap for a reason","review":"Thing is a piece of junk. Plastic earpiece kept on falling off. I had to put it back on until it finally didn't stay on any longer. Called company and rude supervisor said they would give me another one only because it was under warrantee but I would have to pay shipping and send in money order for more than the thing costs on amazon. Waste of money. Do no t buy in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for a great price","review":"I <3 these.Overall: These headphones are great. I love the way they snuggle in your ear and block out the sound while playing good quality sound.Sound: I'm no music expert, so I cannot really comment with credibility the quality of the sound. However, if you're just a normal person looking for good sound, these headphones are more than satisfying.Fit: These headphones are a perfect fit for me! They go into your ear deep enough to block out sound but not deep enough to smash your eardrums and get covered in earwax.Price: For 5 bucks, you cannot find any better.Durability: The first pair of head phones I received lasted over a year. The next one lasted a few months. I just bought another pair and so far, they're great. It really depends on how you take care of your head phones. I've been using my iPod Touch like crazy lately, so I really wore out the last ones.Recommended: Very much so. Get these headphones--you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw them away","review":"The earphones that came with my player kept falling out, so I tried these In the Ear types, but the sound is dismal.

This product is cheap but not durable, after 3 months of normal use, the left side ear voice went off. Dont buy it try something durable"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Has Its Moments","review":"These really are solid earphones. They've given me great sound whenever I call upon them to do so. My only real complaint is the fact that they don't stay in my ears as well as I would like. There are times that I must have to readjust the buds to continue listening. If there is any movement like this, the sound quality changes, as can be expected. You also kind of have to jam these into your ear for them to fit like I think they're supposed to. Overall, pretty good product. Great for its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great value","review":"These earphones fit perfectly in ears making them so snug they keep sound in and disrupting noise out. But unlike many others these don't jam in your ear or cause any kind of discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coby earphones","review":"Purchased with an mp3 player and really love the sound quality. Coby is a consistent brand. Will buy Coby again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isolates little, plays poorly","review":"My husband asked what was wrong with them, and the best description that I could give was that it sounds like I am listening to an old-time radio through these earbuds. I had the JLab D buds for more than a year and loved them; these were my back-up. For the original price (more than $20), these were more expensive, but the quality is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"Really can't go wrong with these headphones. They're comfortable, produce a clean sound, and do a decent job of blocking out outside noise. They are also pretty comfortable. For five bucks, what else can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the money only when it works","review":"I bought two: first one in 2009, broken in 2011 where one side is not working. then bought the 2nd one as a replacement - it has the same problem after the first week's use.I don't use it a lot. Maybe averagely 3-4 times each week: each day when I ride my train and in office for just one or two hours each time. I was not even used it while I exercise. I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones for the price","review":"Given that there were many more expensive options, I'm pretty pleased with the quality of these headphones given the price. The covering over the earbud insert is pretty cheap material, but it's not uncomfortable and they do a good job of isolating the sound. Unless you're an audiophile, these headphones should be just fine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're cheap and don't care about sound quality, these are for you","review":"I only bought these because they were cheap and had free shipping and I needed a replacement for my worn out earphones.First off, I'm a bass person, and with these earbuds you don't get much bass out of them. For as cheap as they were I would expect that, but the sound quality is also not as good as it could be. I could really tell the difference between these and my previous skullcandy earbuds.I think I'm just gonna fork up the money and go with something that gives me the guaranteed premium sound quality i need."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you exspect for under $10.00","review":"They're comfortable, they sound good, but they don't last very long. In less than a month you will have a short in one side it will quit working in one and you will end up throwing it away. But it doesn't cost very much. If you just wear your MP3 around the house you'll be ok. But if you work with them on or get a workout in then buy something a little more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"This purchase was a waste for me. Amazon won't cover the price of the return shipping which would cost me more than the price of the earphones, so I'm stuck with them. I threw them in a drawer to use as an emergency backup. No sound isolation for me since the phones don't fit in my ears. The sound is \\"tinny\\" like an old transistor radio. Physically, the plugs feel very hard and \\"fuzzy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"the product is exactly the way they discribed it,and it was on time.thank you so much and im willing to have business to you guys again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look yes, sounds great but falls out of the ear","review":"I think the porduct has good quality but it you wear these to workout.

If you just want to listen to your iPod and want a similar-shaped/colored earphones, then these are perfect for you. You can take them anywhere and not have to worry too much about breaking them because they're extremely cheap.The bad news is that I broke my first ones without doing anything. The left earphone just fizzled out without any warning. I threw those away and gone another set, so I'm rating this product as if the price I paid was twice that listed.They're great beater earphones, and should be treated as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for a great price","review":"When I saw these headphones for an unbelievabel price, I thought that it wasn't a good buy. Although they looked decent, I bought them anyways because come on... it five dollars. When I recieved them, I tried them out right away. I was surprised! They are actually really good! They have great sound and quality. They are durable, comfortable(unless you wear them for a while, then it starts to hurt), and are nice and comapct for travel. As for noise cancellation, it is decent but not the best. Although I didn't seem do have a problem with it. All in all its was a great buy. If your looking for great headphones for cheap, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"One earbud always stops working","review":"This is the second set I bought and the same problem seems to come up each time. After a while, for no apparent reason, the sound in one earbud stops working, or starts being very touchy and intermittent. There's no visual breakages along the cable or the connection into the audio jack. But when I move the position of the wire around just a little the sound will either come back or go away. Like I said, I can't see any place where it looks like the connection is frayed, or I could just solder it back. I bought my most recent set March 1, and now it is the end of June and one ear is no longer constantly working. I did use these a lot for exercise, and they stay in the ear fine, and maybe the sweat has caused some of the problems. But the same problem happening on two sets of earbuds, I would no longer recommend this, except for the cheap price tag makes it sort of worth it. It's like spending $20 a year for earphones if you keep buying a new pair every 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in only a few weeks","review":"They were fine at first. I liked the sound and they felt good.After about 2 weeks of daily use, one ear went out. A few days later, the second one went out.Tossed them in the trash during my run.Never again will I but this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the bang","review":"Great earphones for the buck. As long as you are not sensitive to sound qualities, this is your earphone. Very good overall given the price. Given the price, there is low chance of regret...If you care about great sound quality then go get an expensive earphones like BOSS but if you just want to hear clear sound this earphone is FINE :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones","review":"I am so disappointed with these earphones. It is too much of a hassle to send them back, or I would have. I used them about twice before one side stopped working. The reason I replaced my old two sets is because they were only working on one side. These sounded like a great buy, although the shipping and handling cost about as much as the earphones. I wouldn't order them again. I thought the price was great, but that's the only thing that was good. I have to admit the sound was great when both sides were working."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For.","review":"I was a little disappointed with these but it should have been expected given the price. The quality is poor. They sound like rattling, blown out speakers from the minute I first used them. There is no cushioning at all for the part that goes into your ear (the picture makes it appear as if there is but don't be fooled; its just a thin film shaped to look puffy and cushioned, its actually hollow though). I could have spent $4 more @ walmart and had an awesome pair earphones (which I did). I bought these to replace a pair I bought at Walmart 2 years ago for $9.97. I just went and bought the same ones again and there is a world of difference between the two. These Coby earphones will just stay thrown in the back of a drawer to serve as a last minute replacement should I run out of other options. I should have known better than to waste my money. If it seems too good to be true, it always is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds better than my last one","review":"The headphones work great. Simply put, compared to the last headphones that I received that were earbuds, these appear to be more durable. The noise reduction part of the ear set does it's job, and the sound quality is better. The sound adjusts accordingly and bass is stronger than standard ones. It's like I can hear more details to the song than before with any other earbuds. Cheap and well worth the cost, the earbuds fit firmly in the ear and hold in place, so that it doesn't fall out of the ear over and over again no matter how much you run, jump or shake ur head up and down. The audio jack is shaped at a 45 angle so it fits in the areas where you need a straight port, and areas that you would need a L bent shape port, so any audio player with a case should work. If there were anything wrong with the earbuds, it would be that you couldn't tell which buds are left or right in the dark"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I purchased these headphones because they had decent reviews. However, they do notstay in my ears and two days after receiving them the right ear bud no longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor audio quality","review":"I bought 3 of these headphones based on the reviews. My son likes it when he is using it with the laptop. My sole use of the headphone is while I work out. Apparently these do not stay in your ears even for a minute.

These have been lasting about 3 weeks before the wiring fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, yes, but still not worth it","review":"The sound quality isn't spectacular, even when sitting in a completely isolated sound-proof/wind-proof/other-elements-proof. If there's wind, all you will hear is wind. Whilst walking around, if the cord at all rubs against your clothing, all you will hear is the rubbing sound. They're pretty good at isolating noise as far as the actual earpieces go, but what's the point if all you hear is wind? I've had them probably around 2 months, and one of the earpieces broke as well... They're probably worth the $5 they cost, but if you are at all particular about the quality of the sound, invest in better head phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I go through a 1-2 pairs of this style earbuds a year (the wires always end up failing over time since I wear them all-day every day).These are the worst. The rubber pieces that go in your ear are are stiffer then most of the other ones, and they don't stay in my ears well at all. Also, the cables are a little too stiff, they hold their shape too much so they bulge out and don't lay flat. They're just ok once I started using them with leftover rubber pieces from an older pair of headphones, but those ones keep falling off these headphones and I either lose them or they stay in my ear when I pull the headphone out.I've had Koss The Plug (I had to modify the earplug part of these to be happy with them), Razer Moray (Looks exactly the same as Creative EP-630), and Skullcandy Smokin' Buds and Ink'd - I'd recommend any of them over these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, cheap, comfortable earbuds","review":"These headphones are perfect for someone who misplaces things very often. I've been through a few more expensive pairs of earbuds, and regretted ever spending so much money on them. These have been a very worthwhile purchase, and come with no buyer's remorse because of the extremely low price tag.I'm not an audiophile or anything, but I can tell when I'm using really crappy headphones. Luckily, these are NOT crappy, even for a relatively fussy listener . The sound quality is perfectly fine for the casual listener, and will replace your MP3 player headphone with a better product for a lot less. And they're REALLY comfortable.So for those of you on a budget wanting headphones that you won't mind listening to music on the way to class or riding the bus, you'll want to give these a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 1-2Weeks - not durable","review":"I bought these because of attractive pricing plus the fact that they seem to fit inside my ears. First few days they seem fine but then they started slipping off my ears because they were getting too slippery. Once I put them in my pocket and when I took them out - I could not find the rubber tips. Both the rubber tips had fallen off. They are useless without the tips --- total waste of money. Put couple bucks extra and buy something that can last for sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price.","review":"The earbuds are of very good quality, producing very good sound even at high levels. They are comfortable in use. Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves.For most uses they are amazing value for money.For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice... But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed. They fit very nicely in my ears under my helmet. And for a very few dollars instead of $100 and up... :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"You GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!","review":"Well it's only been what, 4 weeks? The volume and audio quality have decreased through time. The left ear piece first began showing signs of deterioration, the sound being hardly audible.

The sound went out in one of the sides due to a short in the wire. I guess these are good for short term use, they're cheap, and a good price.

I put the iPod earbuds back in and all the highs of the song came back. What a difference.Later when the Jbuds came in I performed the same test.

My left ear hurt extremely for the next two days - I didn't even think it was possible for it to hurt that bad. But then again, these are $5... not surprising.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply underwhelming","review":"I know not to expect much when not paying much. However, these headphones simply were underwhelming at every turn in my mind. They never seemed to have a very good fit, and the sound always left me wanting. I think the single earbud size fits all approach of this set is a poor decision, I have immediately noticed a more comfortable fit on the default swappable earbud of another similarly priced pair of Coby earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit my ears","review":"If you have small ears these are not the headphones for you. The right ear bud would not fit all the way in and kept falling out when I was running."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for 3 weeks, landfill afterwards...","review":"i am not basing this one one or even two copies of these - i/m around number 8 in my ordering - for the price, they are very good for 3 weeks or so. then the right earbud dies. on 6 copies so far. consistently after 3 - 3 1/2 weeks, dead right ear-bud. why do i keep buying them ? the sound is great while they work. they are cheap. by the time i get to 10 badly manufactured copies, it/ll be time to step up to the good apple ones, but 3 for less than $20 for good sound is pretty cool, *IF ONLY FOR 3 WEEKS*. (when the next ones get here, gonna actually look for a warranty...).just watch. 3 - 3 1/2 weeks. right earbud is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"My son loses his ear buds at least twice a month, so I bought several of these purely based on price, and every single pair fell apart within a week (the plastic padding came off and wouldn't stick back on). Definitely don't stand up to teenage wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wortht he price even if the price is low","review":"I got these ear buds for my daughter who is addicted to her i-pod and uses it every day. She goes through ear buds pretty quickly so I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and these were very reasonable. The sound was good and she said they were pretty comfortable, but these lasted even less than the cheap ear buds you buy on an airplane for $2. I know they were not very expensive, but I expected them to last at least a little longer. They stopped working in less than 2 months! Not worth the price even if the price is low!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones do not stay in place!","review":"I bought these headphones based on the reviews but so far I've been very disappointed. They do not stay in place in my ear, I have to jam them in until it hurts for them to stay put. They are so uncomfortable! And if I put them on normally, they fall out within 5 seconds! I can't have them on when i'm on a stationary bike, and running is impossible! It's been very frustrating for me. I purchased these to replace my Apple iPod headphones and those are much much better! I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"The headphones were pretty good for $5. The sound quality was pretty good, of course not as good $100 klipsch or other high quality IEMs, but comparing a $5 product to a $100 product is unfair. I ran with the headphones for about six months until they broke on the end with the jack. So theoretically, i would expect them to last if you are careful with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw them away!!!!","review":"Man all i have to say is that whenever i put these headphones on, the next hour my ears would ache with pain and sometimes this things even made me get a stroke of pain whenever i yawned or moved something in that area close to my ears. Weird.. I know... but then again it might just be me but i never had problems with any other headphones b4, but u'll have to try it for yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for this price range!","review":"Seeing as these were #1 (popularity) in headphones, I decided to give them a shot. They aren't the best headphones by any means but they are definitely great for the price. I personally find the bass to be mediocore and the lack of different sizes to be a minus but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price","review":"After having used Bose headphones for a long time, I was skeptical about getting a cheap pair. However, these are a great deal. The sound is actually pretty good and the buds are fairly soft. Great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Earbuds","review":"I purchased these cause my \\"stock\\" ipod earbuds actup at times. I have had the stock ones for several years now. These Coby CVE92 sit in my ear differently yet comfortably. The sound quality is really good especially since you aren't spending a fortune on these. I think I spent under $10 for these. Delivery was about 5-8 business days. I don't need these to sound like Boss earbuds, just something to listen to my ipod while at gym and that cancels out the gym noise enough to enjoy my workouts. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for what it cost!","review":"I desparately needed a new pair of headphones when the crappy ones for my ipod broke. Saw some great comments on this product's cost-effectiveness and thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. I am very pleased with the sound quality (especially the bass) and actually think that they deliver sound better than the many more more expensive, comparable products out there.The only thing that bugs me is that they come off my ears really easily, or perhaps it's just that I have smaller ear-holes... Anyways, if you are planning on wearing these when running, or even walking on a windy day in a city like Chicago, they might not be it. But again, for what it cost, I totally would give this product a 5 star overall : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"The earphones were too big for my ear.

Best purchase and a great value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earphones","review":"Sound was fine; mediocre, but generally above crappy average. My problem was the durability; I bought two of these, thinking that eventually I'd have to buy another pair anyways as I use headphones a lot and generally need to replace every two - four months. Neither lasted more than two weeks before a line broke and sound came out of only one ear.Two weeks.Horrible, won't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I would suggest spending a few more bucks for better quality earphones. First and foremost, these do not fit very comfortably in the ear and do not come with multiple ear buds. The sound quality is far inferior to $10 Skullcandy Earbuds I previously owned which also had a volume control switch on them. For the price I could not expect too much, but next time I will definitely pay a little extra money for a better quality product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips out of my ears","review":"I had the exact same experience as Brandon E. Baker did (see his review). I had the same motivation as he did and bought both the jbuds and this Colby because of the price. And while they are not that bad sound-wise (though I am not a sophisticated audiophile) the plugs keep slipping out of position. At that point it does not matter how good the quality of sound is, since it does not sound that great anymore. It does not quite slip and fall off. It lodges itself in the ear in a position where the sound is not what it would be as when it is tucked in. Guess I should have listened to you Brandon but got persuaded by all those positive comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"For the price these earbuds are a great value. Yes, they fall out of my ears from time to time, but that didn't stop me from ordering more at this fantastic price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby black earbuds","review":"First, I did not receive the headphones that I ordered. They came and they were not the style pictured so I don't really know where the fault is with that. However, they were only $5 so I figured I would use them. But I advise that you don't even spend $5 on these. They are extremely uncomfortable, don't stay in your ear, and they are already starting to fall apart and I've had them for about 4 weeks. I recommend checking out a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA: defective item received and no replacement from the vendor.","review":"The earbud came in defective: the 3.5mm plug is too thick (the middle ring portion) to fit in standard 3.5mm audio socket. When I tried to use a bit force to fit it in, it damaged my iPod's port! Failed to request the vendor for replacement or refund. Manufacturer's warranty service requests $6x2 round trip shipping that is double the cost of the item itself.

Very muddy sound. Cheap but not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst earphones ever","review":"I recieved these earphones about a week ago and i'm shopping for a new pair right now. the sound quality may be okay but they fell out of my ears constantly. i thought i was doing something wrong and eventually took the little rubber protusions off but that just made them more uncomfortable. I went back to my original zune earphones with only one working side. it was better to get half the sound than deal with these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"About a month ago I bought these when they had about a 4.5 star rating at amazon. I figured they were cheap enough that even if I didn't like them it wasn't much of an outlay and with all those rave reviews.... Well I am thoroughly unimpressed with them. I don't understand how they could possibly have gotten so many good reviews. The sound quality is as poor or worse than any factory included headphones I've gotten with any portable music device.. I haven't had ear bud earphones before so I don't know if I just happen to have small earholes, but I find these painful to wear for more than a few minutes even when only gently rested against the opening of my ear...and I'm over 6 feet tall so this is not an issue strictly for petite people. Take a chance on them if you want to take a shot with the cheapest alternative first, but I suspect that you'll end up disappointed like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"health hazard???","review":"I thought these would be great earphones until I read the warning on the back of the box that states: Warning - handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling. So just another great item made in China that is going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Suck","review":"These earphones suck. The suck is good but they just dont stick in your ears. I would not recomend this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little ear buds","review":"I'm generally not a fan of ear bud earphones because I don't like sticking things in my ears, but these were a pleasant surprise. I bought them to use with my Nintendo DS. The soft cushion makes it feel like they're barely there and the sound quality is great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this product based on the customer reviews on Amazon, and so far I'd have to say that it pretty much lives up to the descriptions that you see here.I bought them mainly for use in the gym with my iPod, and they do what I want them to do - block out background noise, and hold in my ears when I'm jogging on the treadmill. That said, I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the sound quality is somewhat bass-heavy. This is fine for listening to music (hip hop, R&B;, reggae, maybe not alternative or rock), but not for listening to podcasts, or any other voice recordings.So if you're planning to use this product while you exercise, great, but just know that their usefulness won't extend too far beyond that type of listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colby earphone","review":"The cord / line of the earphone is too long and doesn't have a clip to clip it onto clothes, so it gets into the way of work. Also, the sound in each of the phones cannot be adjusted and sometimes it's too loud, even though the sound has already been adjusted to the most minimum in the MP3. The cord becomes a nuisance at times because it's too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs To Be Longer Lasting","review":"I saw these headphones at such a good price that it was possible to resit. I got them sometime in January and its now April so in about 3 months one of the headphones already starting to break! Before I bought these I did my research and I saw that many people said it was starting to break after just a couple of months of use. But, the good reviews on sound swayed my doubts. The sound quality and perfect size and comfort in the ear is great. But these headphones are by no means meant for long term use. You should get these to save up for some 20 dollar headphones like skull candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome price, works for me","review":"For the price, it's a great product.

BUT the sound quailty is way off. I compared with my HP and Zune earphones, I can clearly tell the difference. Coby earphones output \\"high frequency\\" sound, my rock music sounds like they are screeming at my ears. Same music same volume, my old Zune earphones sound way better than the Coby ones.

The sound quality is great since they go pretty deep into your ear, which is surprising given the cost. I use them to exercise and to run and they very rarely fall out, even when you get sweaty... it only becomes a problem when they catch on something (which is to be expected, I would think). Overall, an exceptional product for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Were They Worth It","review":"These earphones where pretty good i found that, especially days on the bus they blocked out the sound really good, but there is a lot of flaws with them which makes me wonder if my purchase was that wise. The first flaw was the little rubber peice to stick in your ear fell off numerous times but did pop back on, although i did end up losing it later. A second flaw was that the cord from the jack to the buds was too long which made it difficult to take biking around town and run. ALSO IF YOU JUMPED THE BUD WOULD FALL OUT OF YOUR EAR BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE CORD. Finally the worst flaw of them all they broke within 2-4 months. Now I realize they last pretty long but i didn't use them that much and now they only play in one ear and thats the ear with no rubber piece on it.I still question if I made a good purchase or not, but it is your choice to buy them or not, but most of the time I wish I hadn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable due to poor quality","review":"The sound is fine and the whole thing is actually quite comfortable.. But terrible quality. Because it was cheap, I bought two, expecting a short life span of about a year or two. Both broke within a short period of time.

In fact, they're on par with pretty expensive headphones as far as the noise cancelling is concerned.They just don't sound all too good, but then again, what do you expect from $6 headphones?

I would say the earbuds that came with my iPod actually sound better--this in and of itself, says a lot. Needless to say I will be using these to listen to sound coming from my computer, or maybe at the gym to help drown out the noise there, but they will not be used for listening to music through my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Comfortable than I expected","review":"I went looking for a new pair of headphones after my original iPod ones died out.

These ones lasted me about 6 months before the sound started to cut out in the earbuds. You have to hold the wire in a certain position or else you will get sound in only one ear or none.In the short run...it seems like it is a good deal, but you should really consider the long-run quality of these things. Spend an extra $20 or so on reputable headphones that last you years rather than spending this much 2-3 times a year. It may seem odd to be buying headphones that are more expensive than video-games...but anyone in finance or econ would tell you its the better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect a product life of only 6 months","review":"These earphones were pretty darn cheap, and now I understand why: One of the earbuds stopped playing any sound at all after only 6 months of use.

That's probably because the \\"soft ear cup for maximum comfort\\" really is not that soft.

Because of how good it sounds, I postponed my search of the real replacement.HOWEVER, 2 months after I purchased it, the right side stopped working.I already noticed some of the reviews complain on its short duration before I purchased it, so I used it with extra care.But it didn't work. Like it knows it's only a temporary replacement and it decided to suicide after a short period of time.There is not much I can say here except IT WON'T LAST.My conclusion is, you can get a sound quality that is better than its price.

Haha, shame on me.1. The earbuds have a low volume on any device even when turned all they way up compared to any other headphones I own.2. Ok, so they call these things earbuds, so why don't they stick in my ear?3. So after you get your music going, have the things burrowed into your skull, have the volumed turned all they way up, and thank the maker for making the cord long enough so it won't at least jerk out and blaze your music if you have speakers, you lose any sense of comfort and sanctity that headphones would have taken away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall sound quality sacrificed for base quality","review":"Most inexpensive products like this have tradeoffs, and the ones here with these earbuds were obvious the instant I put them on. All of the mid- to high level tones come out very muddled and distant-sounding, but the base tones are clear and powerful. So much so that fiddling with the EQ can't improve the upper levels, and don't manage to make the low levels any worse. On the other hand, they are pretty comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for on this!","review":"All I can say is that I got what I paid for here. Cheap!

That's right. Never dropped, never pulled on, just simply used going to and from work. Today, they decided to stop working. I thought I could beat the system and find some cheap headphones that were decent quality. I was mistaken. Looks like I'll break down and buy a better name brand.

If you're using it for your mp3 player, it can become frustrating to have it become caught on everything.However, I often use it when I'm at a school computer with the tower on the floor, and the extra length is extremely useful.My major concern when it comes to purchasing earphones is: does it stay in my ears when I run? Yes these do! I can't stand taking a jog and every two second, shoving the earphones back in my ears.The price was another major plus.

Headphones have a shot life expectancy around me due to heavy use and hazardous conditions, so I got this pair because it was cheap and seemed like it would let me hear my music.Quality - The sound output is quite acceptable, nothing to knock your pants off but as good as any other pair of ear buds.Comfort - I'm going to be honest - The shape does not fit my ear very well, and the bud's padding is next to worthless. It still sits in my ear well enough, but it doesn't block out as much sound as I would have liked.Cost - If you want to get really nice ear buds, then go buy really nice ones. These are cheap, but as good or better then comparably priced ear buds.If you want something more comfortable and more affordable then iPod headphones then this is the product for you.

AFter a few days of use they began to make this horrible crackling noise. They only lasted 2 months before the cord gave out. I would recommend the Panasonic RP-HJE200 (now called RP-HJE240). They are well worth the money because, the treble is unmatched by any headphones i've owned, and the bass is strong, nearly overwhelming if you have the EQ set right, but it is very precise . My second pick is the JVC Marshmallows, which are still very good but they don't match the Panasonics clarity and I don't think they are as visually appealing (yeah... superficial, I know).Spend 2-3 times the amount and get a good set that will actually last.

I plugged in a 5-year old iPod headphone, which is all straggly and wiry, into my iPhone - and both buds work fine. So it's not my iPhone.So, these Coby earphones may be cheap, but they don't last. Also, they're too long to use on the go with your iPod or iPhone.Next time, I'm buying another headphone. I'm giving it two-stars because it was comfortable in my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but broke easily","review":"First off the ear buds sound great. The problem is they broke after normal, everyday use in a couple of months. The right ear bud no longer produces any sound. So I can't recommend purchasing these even after the low price. If Coby produced the exact same earphones in a reliable build I will be the first to buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat 'em for this price!","review":"Best sound quality I've heard in earbuds. (Granted I haven't listened to any worth more than $40.) My first pair only lasted a year, but for five bucks?!?! They're awesome. This time I bought two! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap products do not work well and cord has lead.","review":"Sound quality is ok, poor fit in ear canal (falls out occasionally while jogging), silicone bits easily detach from earbuds.The fact that this is a cheap Chinese product that contains lead on the wire makes using this product rather disconcerting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was really excited about receiving these earphones because of all the reviews. And because I was interested in the J-Buds and seen these were much cheaper with lots of good reviews. These earphones are not the ones for me. I have small ears and the earphones won't stay in my ears. Not matter what I do they constantly fall out. So in my opinion if you have small ears these earphones are not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work","review":"They really do isolate the sound, which is cool.

I would purchase them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"First day: amazing. Then they slowly declined from there. Sadly, you get what you pay for. Originally I laughed - HARD - when I saw the price. But, I needed new headphones and these had incredible reviews for the price. Sad to say, they lasted about a week and a half. Pretty dang good sound, and I couldn't hear a thing with them in, but by the end of the week, the sound was breaking up, and finally the comfortable plastic sleeve came completely off. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, simply incedible!","review":"I bought these things on a lark. I've been a headphone freak since my service days. While on leave in 1969 my uncle had a pair he said cost forty dollars. A princely sum I thought to pay for a pair of headphones. But as I listened to HEY JOE by Wilson Pickett I was amazed by what I heard, and I have been hooked since. I own some of everything. Sennheiser, Koss, Sony, Radio Shack, Panasonic etc. And of course multiple and assorted phones that came with Ipods, CD players etc. But none can come close to matching these cheap buds in value and most not in sound quality, which is truly amazing.I plan to order more, before they realize what they have and raise the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good purchase if was $1","review":"My my expensive headphones that worked fine for months suddenly stopped working only for the left side. I was away from my normal home, so I decided to buy these Coby headphones as a cheap replacement until I got home to solder my old ones. Delivery was fast, but by the very second day, these headphones sounded like they had gone through a year of rough abuse. Audio was only present on the right side, never the left, and even then, only about 90% of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"From China with LEAD","review":"From the back of the package: \\"Handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.\\" I'm glad I saw the warning before opening the package.Update 5/3/2009: I sent the earphones back to Coby with a letter demanding that they get rid of the lead. A few weeks later they sent me a new pair of earphones with the same lead warning! They apparently assumed that I was doing a warranty return (even though the package wasn't opened) and ignored the letter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Sound/HEALTH RISK!!!!!!!","review":"Good sound, great price! whats not to like? oh yeah, the high amounts of lead stored in the wires. Careful folks, I tried digging into this with Coby and the Better Buisness and they are none to happy some one noticed there hidden warning. Yeah, your susposed to wash your hands after EVERY time you use this product. Use with caution and DO NOT buy this for children. Headphones are in very close proximity to the head (obviously)and chewing on the wires can lead to serious health problems. Beware, theres a reason its so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a month","review":"Only lasted a month - not even worth the $5 or $6 paid. Wires are thin and break easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THESE EARPHONES","review":"They have noise cancelling features. Also, they do not break easily compared to other earphones/headphones I had before. I had been having them for almost a year and they are still in great condition. Plus, they are alot cheaper than the expensive ones that have the same quality as this! I recommend to get these earphones if you want to hear your music and to cancel noise/distractions around you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable, even for picky ears","review":"I ordered these more than a year ago and still love them. They're super comfortable, and I'm picky. The sound is really good too. If/when these wear out, I'll order the same pair again. Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"While obviously the sound quality is not as great as more expensive earbuds/headphones, these are a major step up from the tinny earbuds from Apple. The quality is definitely worth the extra few bucks. I like that I can take these around everywhere and just shove them in my pocket, not having to worry so much about breaking them as I would with a more expensive pair. I use these every time I need to listen to music and see no need to purchase a very expensive pair. Overall, these are definitely a good buy at least for exercising or using as a backup to a more expensive pair. Just don't throw them around too much because sometimes the tip of the earbud falls off and can easily get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"Just bought these - most ear buds fall out of my ear but these do indeed stay in ... nice. Problem is, sound quality is pretty bad. Midrange is OK so they're alright for listening to voice but for music they're atrocious. I also bought the Koss \\"The Plug\\" Portable ear buds - for only $3 more you get far superior sound AND a lifetime warranty...\\"no questions asked\\"...can't beat that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!!","review":"I have tried a lot of different earbuds, in several different price ranges, since I got my first mp3 player last year. These are the absolute best that I have found. They are so soft and comfortable that I can even sleep in them. I use my mp3 player primarily for audiobooks, but recently I started downloading music and discovered just how good the sound quality is. I would strongly recommend these earbuds....they are a STEAL for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Good Buds","review":"These little guys are cheap, comfortable, and sound good. I bought some \\"big name\\" active sound isolation buds and they didn't do any better than these. The Coby obviously doesn't cancel out ambient noise, but they do a decent job of blocking it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent earbuds for the price","review":"I wanted inexpensive earphones for myself and my daughter, and we are both very pleased with this Coby model. They have held up, so far, to fairly rough use (in and out of bags, worn in bed and slept on). We are both pleased with the sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible sound quality","review":"like many others have said before you, you get what you pay for. do NOT buy this, unless you really do not care about sound quality at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sond is ok but the earphones are not very durable","review":"Generally good sound in terms of earbud quality but they are not very durable the earbud thingy tears ratehr easily they are not very comfortable after more than a hour and the cord itself is very weak causing the sound in one ear to vanish from time to time. Other than that full sound and very loud. I may be biased as the earphones i wore before these were RAzer's and over the ears so the sound was much better and louder not to mention way more durable (lasted almost a full year before i experienced problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad... but not great","review":"Pros:-Sound is decent. Although the name says Super Bass, bass is just OK. High frequencies a little muddy. But still, overachieving for its priceCons:-Annoyingly easily gets entangled. You find yourself often working on how to remove it from knots and twists.-Buds easily separates from the earphones. You will not be able to use it if you lose any of the silicone buds because it will hurt your ears. Also, the silicone buds are too thin.-You have to adjust the volume a little harder to hear-Looks cheap-Design. Does not look too appealing on your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I ordered these headphones on August 19, 2012 the estimated delivery date was August 23, 2012 - Tuesday August 28, 2012, and they just come today \\"September 1, 2012\\". I am very displeased. They sat in Elkridge Maryland for 6 Days. Plus now it's past the day of what I wanted to use them for. Ordering there has been a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about a dozen uses.... then it shorted out.","review":"The sound quality is very good for the price but after only a few uses the wire that leads into the ear set shorted leaving only one ear plug functional. I was not abusive to the set it is just cheaply constructed. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't cancel noise at all","review":"I bought these after my other Sony noise-cancelling headphones were stolen. Maybe I just don't have the right size ears, but these do not cancel any noise out. I have already ordered a different pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I've gone through my fair share of earphones and I think this is the best in terms of sound and price. The only negative is I'm currently on my third pair; I think I averaged 4 months with every pair before the sound died on one side and the other side followed. Although I do use them heavily so that might be why. Even still, I'm probably going to stick with this brand because I'd rather destroy a $5 pair instead of the $15 pairs I used to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great economy earbuds","review":"No complaints so far. The thin rubber covering that fits inside the ear is very comfortable. The bass is a little weak, but the mids and treble are crisp, with no detectable static. The noise bleeds out a little more than my previous earbuds, but still not bad for economy earphones. I like 'em. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I read the reviews and thought this is a great deal, but when I bought it, it doesn't feel good. I can hear the outside noise even with little noise and it always fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought these ear buds four months ago and they've already broken. Everything is still intact, but the individual buds simply quit working, first one and then the other. I subjected them to the same day-to-day handling that I have other brands, and this is the first pair that have broken so easily. I hesitate to buy another Coby product in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought these because I had hoped they would fit in my ears but they don't even stay in. I'd suggest earphones that go over the ears rather than earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good... If You Don't Like Hearing Bass","review":"For the price, these are not bad. That being said, they really aren't a good choice if they are to be your primary headphones.The Good: Crisp sound. Nice long cord.The Bad: Very little bass comes through on these. Are not ideal for use while exercising as they are prone to fall out.My thinking was that for about five bucks, you couldn't go wrong. Now that I have them, I wouldn't say I've gone wrong by getting them, but I wouldn't buy them again nor would I recommend them for regular music use. If you are going to use them with a Nintendo DS or AM Radio, these would probably be fine. Beyond that, pony up a few more bucks for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last","review":"They're inexpensive; I bought several.Within a few months the plastic becomes stiff and one or both buds quits working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly comforatble","review":"The sound quality is not crystal clear but still good.

I was so hesistant to get them but went with all the positive reviews. What a disppaointment (because I bought 4, stupid me).My earlobes aren't particularly big or small, it's just 'normal'. And these plugs have to be shoved in just so they stay. If you don't understand what I'm saying, just look at the damn thing. It's like a miniature barrell. I've ordered some sound isolating earplugs to replace the ones they come with. Hopefully I'll be able get something out of it.I haven't written much about quality because it's almost irrelevant.

You must pay $6.00 shipping for any warranty replacement. Not much of a warranty if the replacement shipping costs more than the original purchase (including shipping).UPDATE: The right ear cut out altogether after about a month of use.

I could do without that.The sounds played by the ears are way way way too loud and tinny sounding. I hope my daughter doesn't figure those out or like to use them because I may have to disable them.Also, the sheep tilts to the rear somewhat, making my daughter gradually slip off the back. I was also looking at the frog because I liked the bright colors, but I thought the back rest might get in the way as she grew ... I'm thinking it may have been nice to have that back rest, though.

Algebra was a pre-requisite when I took this course, but being familiar with algebra and its concepts won't help you much. Topics are not explained thoroughly which leaves the task of finding the missing pieces to understand the concept to the reader. Working the sample problems provides you with an answer, but doesn't walk you through the steps to solving the problem.The book also skips over some topics that are in other broader based basic statistics books. Some of which I feel are important for business majors to know as they work with their clients, who may not be business majors. I had to purchase another book to de-code what this one was saying. Once I did, I was able to understand the material better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"I have a basic statistics background before I read this book. For me, the book is useful for my basic quantitative research. Last few chapters apply the statistics rules in earlier chapters to the real business environment, which I think it's really practical and interesting.

Be warned that this is a shoddily produced DVD that doesn't even have a subtitle option that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"insultingly cheesy","review":"So badly made that it is unwatchable without fast forward.I had wanted to learn more about this 731 biological war program of the Japanese. This film was so very poorly made in every respect that it is worthless. It has the look and feel of an exploitation film and doubtless it is, and I find that insulting to history and to the people who suffered in the tragedy and to their families.Aside from bad acting and incoherent script and poor direction, there is no effort to put the material into any framework that tells much of a story past what one might find in bits on the web. It does not seem to have a perspective. It is not a documentary or a docudrama. It is just a lot of \\"stuff\\" thrown together with plenty of gore for people who thrive on gore. Cheap thrills for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was the stupidest (if that's even a word) movie I have ever seen, and believe me, I have seen THOUSANDS of movies. First off, it's dubbed in English. There are no options to have the correct language with English subtitles. Given that, and it wouldn't have been all that bad, if the voices weren't so comical. I actually found myself laughing in places because the voices were totally wrong for the mood of the movie. Secondly I found the movie boring and not as good as another film I had seen about the same subject matter. Trust me and look for other movies with this subject matter, there are far better ones out there. The \\"cat scene\\" that every one talks about is disgusting and I felt they really could have done without that. What purpose did it serve? I don't get it and wish someone would explain it to me.

I strongly disagree with any attempts to justify such unnecessary cruelty as art and I think that one scene waters down his the entire message of the film. After watching that scene, the rest of the movie is simply about the shock of seeing an innocent animal being slaughtered for entertainment.I am missing point? Probably. But when someone spews out garbage like this one, I hardly can be blamed. In the interest of art, I would be more entertained in seeing the director being thrown to a pack of hungry rats. That would truly be educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Film for people who don't like cats and rats","review":"I had read all the hype about this film. How shocking and disturbing it was.

There is one slightly nauseating scene involving an autopsy of a supposed REAL corpse.

The Samsung warranty policy on dead pixels for a 19-inch monitor requires you to have at least 7 dead pixels for a replacement - which means that you will be stuck if there are only 6 dead pixels or the 7th pixel appears after the warranty expires.The TV quality is very poor, although the monitor and speaker quality is pretty good. The monitor also runs too hot compared to most others models I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"I've had really good experiences with Samsung LCD monitors, so when I saw this model I really didn't think twice about picking it up. Unfortunately, I've learned my lesson the hard way to always do the research first before buying anything like this. The monitor case itself is very nicely designed, but the picture resolution while watching television was unbelievably poor. At first I suspected loose cables, or perhaps something was misconfigured but that wasn't the case at all. Then I flipped through the manual and found a section that tried to explain WHY the television reception was lousy (not a good enough explanation). Needless to say I returned it. If you are looking for a solution that allows you to watch television on the same monitor and speakers you use with your computer I would highly recommend as an alternative AverMedia's \\"TVBox 9\\".

However, as a fullscreen television it is not at all acceptable. Samsung would have done better to disable this feature and sold the item for what it actually can do.I wanted to replace both a TV and a monitor; this unit will NOT satisfactorily do that.

That's the best motive the author could come up with??!! Talk about making preteen girls look quite stupid. I could buy the ringleader, Jenna's motive, but the two friends Clair and Suzanne? It was disappointing how little thought was given to making their story more real. Why, besides the act of friendship, would they like about something like that just because their friend asked them too.

First, this book is very, very dated. But that's not what was so annoying. I have a few favorite books that are rather dated, and they are still good reads. The fact is that there is simply nothing memorable about the storyline or the characters. I'm not even sure what the climax was. When I got to the end, I was surprised something so bland came from Crichton.Finally, since I read this book right after Sphere, I was a bit turned off by the thread of similarity that seems to run through Crichton's characters, namely those who are female professionals. They seem to have a chip on their shoulders about trying to survive in a \\"man's world.\\" I.e., Janet in The Terminal Man and Beth in Sphere.

Another case of the \\"escaped experiment\\" goes bad when Crichton tries to pitch a moral about the dangers of technology. The whole book is one big cliche, that is almost saved by moments of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowers for Algernon in ain't","review":"I just finished The Great Train Robbery and looked forward to another Crichton novel when I had the bad luck to pick up Terminal Man. As some other reviewers mentioned, this isn't a terrible book but when it comes from Michael Crichton it leaves you disappointed. It had some interesting ideas and showed some promise but it never did completely take me in like Train Robbery did. The theme also seemed to be loosely based on Flowers for Algernon, in my opinion a better book by far. But don't let me dissuade you from other Crichton books. He is a talented author and has written some great books, just not in this case. One last thing, what was he thinking with that ending? Ouch!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Palatable Pulp","review":"*Terminal Man* was originally serialized in *Playboy* magazine and it shows... While the novel maintains typical Chricton characteristics (lots of jargon, some interesting science, and characters with only as much depth as is necessary to not drown in the plot), the original publication format shows. Despite being intended to carry you through on a sweeping suspense ride, the book is quite episodic -- it feels like a serial. Moreover, there are bits of sexuality and so forth thrown in at random times to titiliate the readers. Obviously, *Rising Sun* had a much more sexual plot, but it was purposeful. Here, the occasional sexual elements seem more gratuitous than enything else.As for the plot of medical responsibility, it's interesting, but not carried out as well as in *Jurassic Park*, which deals with a similar theme. (Just because you can do something -- should you?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No stimulation here","review":"This is a medical thriller. While the medical stuff is quite interesting (like the idea for the novel) the thriller-stuff gives the word by-the-numbers a new meaning. Easily the least (not counting the screenplay for TWISTER) book in Crichtons otherwise impressive canon.Crichton readers expect a page-turner. This isn't one. Though one of his shortest books, it seems like his longest.p.s.: Film director Mike Hodges did a very faithful adaption of the book for the screen. He managed to caputre the boredom of the book in the film..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!!!","review":"Michael Crichton at his best. With today's technology digging deeper and deeper into our brains this book should make everyone stop for a minute and wonder if we need to leave that unexplored frontier alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment coming from a Crighton fan.","review":"The idea of this book may have been something that blew people's mind back in the seventies, but by the last page I sat thinking, \\"Is that it?\\". I can see this story as some Sci Fi channel tv episode that might play at 3 in the morning. Besides the tecnological aspects, it seems like I've read or seen this story a hundred times and the whole book is just moment after moment when you think some kind of climax might be about to happen but instead it turns into some lame scene leaving you wishing you would have bought Crichton's \\"Sphere\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book-Great Plot- 4 STARS! * * * *","review":"Although one of Crichton's first novels, this book has an interesting plot that will keep you reading for hours on end and have you in so much suspense, you will not know if Harry could be waiting at your door-step. The content inside of this book made it all the better, written in the 1970's it was extremely technologically advanced for it's time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame...","review":"I just finished this book...finally & with great disappointment. What a lame ending. I thought about not even finishing it, but kept hoping that it would get better. Well, it didn't. Many other reviewers mentioned the outdated technology, which is true, but outdated technology isn't what ruins a story, a lame story is what ruins a story. And speaking of lame, Andromeda Strain is just as bad as Terminal Man. If you want suspense & action, read Jurassic Park & The Lost World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, not Crichton's best","review":"I have been an avid fan of Crichton's for a long time and decided to peruse his older material. Terminal man was written in 1972 and Crichton's writing skill has come a long way since then. Well, perhaps the audience is much different from that of the 1970's. I couldn't finish this one. Characters were not engaging, a majority of the book was spent on describing the technology, so very little plot actually occurs until the end, at which point, I no longer cared. Would not recommend to those who are fans of Crichton's faster paced books like Jurassic Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined the whole stinkin' book","review":"I thought it took quite a while for this book to get started and I thought it was okay until the end. For me it seemed like Chricton was eager to finish this book and get on with his next novel wich was \\"the great train robbery\\".

As I remember, it was very entertaining and compelling - a real page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic","review":"Crichton does great job of conveying a sense of realism.

This is one of his earlier books and isn't quite as refined as his later offerings. A good example is character development. It's decent in this book, but Crichton gets a lot better at it. Also, the science is more complex than in other Crichton books, but still not beyond a collegiate level.It's interesting to read this book 30 years after it was written and compare Crichton's vision with the actual course of computer advancement.Don't make this the first Chrichton book you read, but do read it if you like the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminal Man- a so-so book","review":"I didn't enjoy Terminal Man as much as the other Crichton books.

Fortunately, he wrote other great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Ages...Dud Dude!","review":"I just read this book in 2008 so its from like from the Dark Ages.

I give it two stars just because of the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I enjoyed this novel emensly. We don't really think that our sub-concious has such a big influence on our bodies, as to make us get what we really want, but it does. This book does a very good job of telling about that, and was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overview, Description","review":"I think this was a good book, if you are in to big Science Fiction stories. It is about a doctor that is supposed to give a brain operation to a patient that runs away. Most od the book is the Scientist looking for the man, and asking the patients friends to describe him and his intrists. The book really packs a lot of suspence, but, like any other book, had its boring parts. Mr. Crichtons description of the character, and the actions taken, are thoes you can relate to, and are logical. I rated it a \\"9,\\" because I really enjoyed it, but there was something missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and scary","review":"Oooh, do not read this. I hated it. When I read Jurrassic Park in sixth grade, I thought Crichton's books were pretty good. I liked the Lost World, Timeline, Prey, even Rising Sun was pretty good.

Lou Gramm is just as good as he always is, backed by very ho-hum music. The only decent track worth hearing, in my opinion, is the last one, Russia. And that, only if you are a major Lou Gramm fan. For a couple of bucks, it's probably worth it for that one song. Again, only if you are really enthused about Lou."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Duper, A Must!!! buy, regardless of price.","review":"What to write.

Everyone with COPD knows we are going to die and that we are going to die younger than our cohorts.

This was all compounded by the once again grotesque illustrations by Kenneth Axen. Far better and more hopeful is the \\"Courage\\" book that offers a story of hope, dignity, and the ability to cope. As a licensed psychotherapist I actually think the \\"Handbook\\" could be psychologically damaging to some patients.

Such was the effect on me that I immediately sought out work of the man who had inspired this, and have been a fan of Cohen's ever since. Tribute albums can always be hit and miss affairs, but there are no misses on this. There is a strong feeling of deep respect for the man throughout the record. It is difficult to single out particular tracks, but Geoffrey Oryema's Marianne, The Pixies I can't forget and John Cale's Hallelujah are probably the cream of this bounteous crop. If you are into any of the bands on this, or looking for an easy route to enjoying Cohen's music, or even an ardent fan of the man, this is certainly worth having. A similar tribute album called \\"Tower of Song\\" also exists, but this is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were his fans","review":"Leonard Cohen was rocking -if I may say- my craddle and I still love the old cracking LPs I stole from my mother. Hence the shock in 1991 when my then fav' magazine (Les Inrockuptibles, then a glossy Paris fanzine with an obsession for English/US alternative music, now a more muddled catch-all weekly)somehow managed to get some of the most influentials indy artists of the late 80s to pay a tribute to the old master... THe result is now interestingly dated, as many of the bands are well past their prime or have disappeared (who the h*** was Robert Foster any way?). Although none of the songs here approach the iconic status of Jeff Buckley's rendition of Hallelujah, some are extremely good (Ian Mc Culloch's Hey that's no way to say goodbye, Who by fire by the House of Love or That Petrol Emotion's Stories of the Street - my personal favourite on the album) and some are funnily anachronistic duds (James's trademark yodelling)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulless, pointless","review":"\\"Chelsea hotel\\" by Lloyd Cole may very well be the worst cover in history.

The rest is just awful and will disappoint fans of both the bands or Cohen.In addition to original sins, this disk suffers sins of omission.

The highlights for me are \\"The Stories of the Street\\" as performed by That Petrol Emotion, \\"Take This Longing\\" by Peter Astor, \\"Who By Fire\\" by the House of Love and John Cale's heartbreaking rendering of \\"Hallelujah\\".

It was his debut novel, so the vetting at that stage of the game is excellent. Or should be.Dave Freedman really needed to have a good editor tear it apart. But I doubt even that could save this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"P U","review":"This book is a stinker. I would have given it one star, however if I am able to read through the whole thing I have to give it two...and I did. I have a crazy imagination and am willing to accept most any premise when it comes to fiction, however a flying, air breathing manta ray with an Einstein IQ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintelligently designed book","review":"I wanted to like this book because it combines science fiction (one of my favorite genres) with oceanography and marine biology (my favorite science, next to astronomy). I really, really wanted to like this book; it looked like a decent weekend read. But, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, this book sucks.The scientific facts that are commonly present in sci-fi books are missing here. The author didn't do his homework in marine biology and it shows, unfortunately. He also didn't do his homework in basic writing and this is probably why the book has 13 chapters of little more than characters conversing. The opening of Jaws at least introduced you to the title character and had action.The book takes itself way too seriously, which is why it's not a fun read (like Steve Alten's Meg series) and in my opinion, it's not worth buying. If you're bored, check it out from the library. But check to see if one of Alten's book is also available and, if so, read that."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 actually....","review":"This was one book that has been calling me for a while and I finally bought it. I've read books with fast plots before but... DANG!!! I loved how Dave just keep everything moving like lava. You can sorta tell that this is his first novel but... well... it IS his first novel and a beautiful start it is.Publishers Weekly put \\"an awesome beach read\\" on the cover the the cloth version which immediately makes me think of some cheesy beach romance. This was anything but and I'm glad they changed it when they published the mass market. Anyway... reading about this new animal was fascinating and learing about the science (fact and fiction) was pretty thrilling. The story did slow down a bit for me when the animal makes it to land. That was a bit of a letdown but it wasn't long.I stayed up many, many late nights enthralled with this story. I have a feeling you might as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, poor execution","review":"An unknown, predatory species related to the manta is a perfectly good idea and should be the basis for an entertaining novel. Alas, the execution is too flawed for the results to be enjoyed. Freedman writes in a kind of Dan Brown style, with short chapters and far too much foreshadowing, giving the novel a repetitious feel. The characters aren't bad, but don't create suspense: the reader knows very quickly who will turn out to be lovers by the end. There are generous dollops of scientific background introduced to make the flying, intelligent, amphibious mantas seem possible, but these are either irrelevant or manufactured, and so the tale must survive on the writing. It does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the positive hype?","review":"I've read numerous books of this type over the years since JAWS was first published.This book, at best, is a good way to waste time, which could have been spent reading something else, perhaps re-reading JAWS.It started on a fairly good note, but didn't quite hold together until the end. Not a terrible read, but I expected something a bit different."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN PAGE TURNER","review":"It's been a while since I read a book that had me this riveted. Like Michael Crichton on his good days, the author here takes a spectacular and yes, unbelievable concept - a new species of predator evolving to fly right here on earth - and through a very clever combination of research, science and fiction makes it absolutely believable. This is an extremely entertaining and truly frightening read. It's done so well it actually makes you think that a species like this could evolve. People often call books \\"page-turners\\" but sometimes they're just not. I actually had to force myself to put this book down, it was that good and that riveting. Every step of the way, I just wanted to find out what happens next. Natural Selection was just a lot of fun! I think it will make an amazing movie. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun - Odd - Scary - Hoot","review":"Fun story. But a story nonetheless.

However, parts of it were so stupid that it was hard to continue. I couldn't really remember who 3 of the main characters were, and the rest were really pretty one dimensional and not exciting.The book wasn't complete crap but close. I would say it had it's entertaining in parts but the believability factor is just so out there.Besides that, there are so many clueless characters (including a forest ranger couple who go looking for a hiker with their baby but the mother doesn't bring any baby supplies like bottles or diapers, BUT BRINGS A BABY SWING and leaves her kid in a tree trunk [don't ask], a couple of color where one is part native American and therefore has mystical powers of some kind but will only help if money involved, and the list goes on.mildly diversion. stuck with it to the end only because i had committed so much to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I started it, but I couldn't finish it. These kinds of books are right up my alley, but I could only make it to about page 100. All the things mentioned by other reveiwers (poor sentence structure, cheesy dialogue, etc.) just made me regret the purchase. The cover, which is what caught my eye initially, was good. However, I fell prey to the old adage, you can't judge a book by its cover. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at best-if you know nothing of science","review":"I have no problem suspending a certain amount of scientific belief in the creation of a monster creature, but I do need the author to get basic facts right. Crichton has some \\"out there\\" ideas, but the supporting science is there, especially in regard to the non-monster info. Raccoons aren't rodents, great whites can't dive 4 miles, and how are a bunch of phd's that stupid and lazy? If you don't care about this, or are completely oblivious to all things science, go ahead. This book should be mildly entertaining. Everyone else, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ENTERTAINMENT! AND VERY SMART TOO ...","review":"I read this from start to finish over the weekend. It's a fast read to say the least. It was surprisingly well researched, smart, and thought-provoking. And so very readable. Who'd have thought learning about viruses, details on how brains works, what distinguishes lungs and gills, and so many other technical subjects could be so much fun! The action scenes are tremendous! The characters weren't wonderful but fine for the genre. The prologue wasn't great either. But overall this was a very exciting, speedy read; enthralling and engrossing and the pages JUST MOVE!! One weekend and it's over. My 15 year old's reading it now and he's riveted. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bilge...with stereotypes galore!","review":"A previous reviewer rightly points out the authors poor treatment of the two Black characters in this book with awful stereotypes. This is just so blatant that, in my opinion, it leaves no doubt as to what the authors views on Black people are. Leaving that aside, the book is simply not that entertaining and better science and story is to be had from 'Fragment' by Warren Fahy, a superior book in all respects and without the racist stereotypes. Readers may also wish to check out authors such as Scott Sigler and James Rollins."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quick read","review":"I agree with others that the science in this book is questionable at best. In theory, the demonrays are plausible. Could something like that fly? I think not. However, this is a book of FICTION. If one tries not to get too haute about knowing more science than the author, one can actually enjoy this book, which starts out as a rolling drama and crescendos into a rather scary horror story.I've been in science all my life and know animals well, since that is my job, but I enjoyed this book as just a good quick read. Might be a bit scary to read on the beach though. And that last statement is coming from a snorkeller! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of bit good","review":"Bit cuts good.

Once the CD starts playing, Emily recites all the words to the songs, which I was very surprised to hear. The original songs like \\"Mommy & Me,\\" \\"Shake My Hand,\\" and \\"Take My Hand,\\" written by Marty Panzer, are quickly becoming cherished favorites in our family. Panzer has also written fresh new lyrics to classics like, \\"If You're Happy And You Know It,\\" \\" Head Shoulders Knees and Toes,\\" and \\"Row Row Row Your Boat,\\" among others. It's shocking that this wonderful CD has replaced the Wiggles as my daughter's new favorite obsession! Even my husband hums the tunes to himself when we get in the car for a family outing.

But she also enjoys Sesame Street and Disney stuff. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Testimony Is Very Powerful!","review":"What a wonderful book! Some say it sets you up for a letdown if you experience pain during birth. A thinking woman would know that God will give her the birth He wants, be it with or without pain. A painful birth certainly does not mean you failed during childbirth. But Jackie encourages us to stretch our faith to the limit, to not rule out the dunamis power of the Holy Spirit! He is able. Able to do ANYTHING, and we can rest assured He will give us the birth HE intended if we surrender to Him. Another useful book is Christ Centered Childbirth by Kelly Townsend. Both books helped me immensely during my births! Supernatural childbirth should be read by every pregnant woman, with the understanding that anything can happen and God can be glorified, no matter what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural Childbirth was super","review":"An excellent book!

I even went on a search to find the authors to order the cassette tape to go with it. No luck though. I read this book before becoming pregnant in June of 2000 and I read it as I was losing that baby. I feel that this book has such an annointing on it that it used to lay at the head of my bed. Our young marrieds group gives this book out to all our newly expectant moms. So I have given my share away also. My husband and I have been through 11 years of infertility. We have one daughter who is 3. She was conceived after seven years. We have also lost two babies early in our pregnancies. This book is such a reminder of the promises of God. It is a definite book to have in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspiring","review":"I was very blessed by this book.

This book gives hope to women who need to know that there is a Doctor who can do anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and unbiblical","review":"I was just given this book by a friend, and boy am I disheartened. My husband and I used to hold to Word of Faith doctrines (we came out of a Kenneth-Hagin-following church) and now I am just weary of these false teachings and sad for those who believe (like we used to) that they can \\"speak things into existence\\" through \\"positive confession.\\" Or that they can have a pain-free life (including childbearing), and if they have pain in their lives, it is their fault for not having enough faith. These teachings are simply untrue.Although they sound liberating (\\"childbirth without pain? sign me up!\\"), in fact they produce more anxiety, because if you do suffer, then you are, like Job, blamed for it. No, sometimes, we suffer in life, and sometimes it's not our fault.I am going to pray that God gives me a trouble-free pregnancy and labor, but if that does not happen, I will trust Him anyway. Not my faith. Not my words.

This book demonstrates and confirms the mighty working power of God. It shows that if God cannot do something for us, no one can. Every born again, bible believing couple should live this book because it expresses our redemption in Christ - the \\"Annointed One and His Annointing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly disguised prosperity doctrine","review":"Contrary to all other reviews published, I found this book to be most unhelpful. It basically talked about childbirth & conception as commodities that God 'wants' us to have. While I'm sure that God is good & blesses us richly, this book simply is western capitalism revisited in another form. I'm really glad that others found the book inspiring, but to me it seemed very much along the lines of 'God is a vending machine, there to give you everything you want'. There was no suggestion that sometimes there is no earthly resolution. If you believe in the God who answers all prayers with a yes, buy this book. If you believe that God is a loving, merciful & suffering God who connects with people in their suffering but does not always give us what we want, then read the book of Job instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously questionable theology - do NOT purchase this","review":"I cannot say how strongly I disagree with the theology of this book. The author takes scripture so far out of context to show a real lack of understanding of the Bible. This book is well known for doing so much damage to the faith of sincere Christian women who suffer pain in childbirth or infertility, as according to this author all she had to do was 'believe' and she was pregnant and suffered no pain.If you want a more sound theological book on infertility, go to Hannah's Hope.Please please please do not pass this book around women who are suffering, you add a burden to them that Christ would never do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blessing for all women who hope to become mothers","review":"A fabulous book of hope and faith!

Thank you Jackie and Terry Mize for being obedient to God and thank you Judy for sharing this with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This is a story about one woman's experience with bearing children. I felt her answer to everything was to pray about it, which isn't bad but she didn't really offer any other advice. There were 2 parts that I found hard to take seriously... 1. She wanted her third child to be a girl, so she prayed for a girl and that's what she got. I think that is a selfish thing to pray for. 2. She didn't want to be induced so when her care provider scheduled an induction she prayed that she would go into labor before her appointment. I think that it was irresponsible for her to not seek out a care provider who is against unnecessary induction, if that's the way she felt... In the end this book just wasn't for me. I wanted more practical advice on how to birth naturally. Personally, I really like Ina May's Guide to Childbirth by Ina May Gaskin and Hypnobirthing by Marie Mongan, which teaches relaxation techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word of Faith Theology","review":"I would not recommend this book. Jackie believes in the Word of Faith doctrine. As a Christian we can ask God to protect us and give us a healthy childbearing experience, but we CANNOT command it of him or of ouselves.

Other books that exist that are more educational and beneficial to the novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent effort","review":"I'll keep it short... This album by Foreigner sounds more or less exactly like Bad Company's \\"Holy water\\". Best song is \\"Low down and dirty\\". It's decent polished rock of average standard from a time gone by. Maybe it's not Hair Metal but sure it's close to.It's not bad but it's not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end","review":"I listened to this album and found that it is a really struggling album. I have no problem with singer \\"Johnny Edwards\\", it's more the song-writing.The songs are either a generic rocker or a long, generic ballad. There's no surprises and the song-writing is no longer catchy and concise but instead the songs seem to meander and take too long to get to the point. Every song is somehow dragged out over four minutes, leading to a long album without much variation in tone.It's true this album could get 2 1/2 becuase the guys really tried to rock, and the singer is in fine voice. The opening track 'Low-down and dirty' has that classic foreigner sound but the album soon descends into early 90's hard rock mediocrity. The ballads never do anything to stand out as original or well-thoguht out.Overall, the production is weak and the finished product sounds very fromulaic."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song","review":"I really like Johnny Edwards vocals but sadly there is really only one good song on the CD -- \\"Ready for the Rain.\\" My advice is buy that song as an MP3 and skip the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"5 stars? 4 stars? 3?

My girlfriend and I read it together and we found it interesting but certainly not erotic.

I love that the weight is adjustable so I won't have to run out and buy more weights when I'm ready for something more challenging. They are pretty comfortable; my only complaint is that if the velcro closure is not lined up perfectly, then sometimes the rough side of the velcro rubs against my skin. Sometimes I have to adjust the velcro in the middle of my work-out, a little annoying. However, given the choice, I would have bought them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danskin ankle weights","review":"The product is robust (I thought it might be kind of wimpy coming from Danskin vs. say a product called Everlast).

I liked them at first, but very quickly they became stretched out, and they would frequently fall off as I was walking. Over about only 6 months of use (two or three times a week), the material was gradually stretched longer, and then the velcro does not secure compeletely. They have fallen off many times as I was walking in the gym and/or crossing the street in NYC, which was very inconvenient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the Picture, Made in China","review":"I purchased these weights to wear on my ankles during daily work and replace another brand that I have. I own a pair of Valeo ankle wieghts but hated them. They were huge and filled with sand pockets. Now I understand why they want sand in those things, its to be easy on the skin and tendons. But what happens is that the sand accumulates on the bottom of the sacks and you have a massive bulge that undoes the velcro.The Danskin Weights look nothing like the picture here on Amazon. In reality there are two small rods of metal one pound each and the three pound that are left are sand! Again with the sand.How hard can it be to make a non-sand one? It will reduce the size by more than two thirds. If they are worried about the comfort they can coat them with gel.I guess I expected too much from a Made in China product."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE WEIGHT ADJUSTMENT CLAIM","review":"The description for this item claims that each weight is adjustable from 0.5 to 2.5 pounds. THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE. Each ankle weight contains 1-1/2 POUNDS OF FIXED WEIGHT THAT CANNOT BE REMOVED AND then TWO 1/2 WEIGHTS THAT CAN BE ADDED. Each ankle weight can only be one of 3 different weights:1-1/2 pounds2 pounds2-1/2 poundSTHERE IS NO .5 POUND CAPABILITY. Look elsewhere if you want weights that are adjustable from .5 or 1 pound and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ankle weights","review":"the fact that you can adjust the weights is great, the idea to wear them on your ankles doesn't work well. they are huge even on the biggest ankles of the whole wide world.i made them into above the calves weight, and that is the only place they stay on...so adjustable ankle weights means, you can adjust the weight, nothing else.the material they are made out of is great, it's super soft on your skin..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the description first below in product details","review":"I ordered the product based on what I read at the top of the page. At first glance, I thought I would receive (2) five pound weights for each leg. That is not the case. Each weight is maximum of 2.5 pounds. So this is misleading if you don't scroll to the details. I was lucky to cancel the order."},{"rating":"1","title":"On The Pow Wow Trail","review":"I was disappointed in several aspects of this documentary. First, very poor production values and technical quality. The recorded voices and the film are out of sync throughout. Pow Wow drumming and singing are used minimally during film of the dancers. More often there is a Robert Mirabal-ish New Age soundtrack. If you enjoy this type of music you may find it less a negative for the film than I did. If you're collecting a lot of Pow Wow films, you might want to add this one...but find it used or at a sale price. $16.00 is a high price for a 30-minute film of poor technical quality. If you are looking for an introduction to the Pow Wow Trail, or to Pow Wow music, I would not recommend this film for you. Overall this views much more like somebody's home movie than like a professionally-produced film, although it evidently was the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"My 9 year old son was so excited by the commercial for this product. He met me at the door with his money to order it. When the order arrived he was jumping up and down. When we took it out of the package, I immediately noticed that the plastic seemed flimsy and the tubing was a little too firm to make it fit into the base correctly. After many tries, we finally got it all to snap into place. We followed the directions word for word, and it would not work. The pressure did not seem to build and water was leaking into the base. There was no way for us to fix it ourselves. Looking online I finally found a phone number for customer support. The manufacturer sighed, and said that when they had gotten one in, they had assembled it and been unable to get it to work properly either. They recommended that I return it for a refund as they had no replacements. My son was in tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This product is very misleading. The commercial is so misrepresentative of the product. Nothing about this product is fun. The directions are hard to interpret and the \\"arm\\" itself could not crush a cottonball. Poor packaging.

It seemed like a neat idea for a toy, however, once out of the box it was clear that this toy was poorly designed, poorly constructed and nothing but a piece of junk. The components would not fit in the base correctly, there were multiple leaks and no part of the claw worked at all. What a disappointment. The only reason I gave this toy one star is because I couldn't give it zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Local Band Around!","review":"Having seen these guys at Small's in the Detroit area and meeting them, Hi Vince and Dave!!!, I have to say they are the best sound in Detroit! If you are tired of the White Stripes sound or any of the usual heavy garage sound coming from Detroit, The Singles are your best bet! They're fun, great to dance and sing along too and just a plain downright make you feel good band. It takes you back to the early days of the British Invasion sound with a mix of the early Beatles, Kinks, and to me, a bit of the Hollies in there. So local or not, check these guys out. As to quote John Lennon, they are on their way to the toppermost of the poppermost! And you local fans, they're playing the 19th<next fri> at Jacoby's downtown, GO CHECK 'EM OUT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toronto Life Review","review":"The Singles' vintage sartorial style, sweet vocal harmonies and shiny pop melodies are so old school you might suspect they were cryogenically frozen in 1966 and only recently defrosted. Luckily, the Detroit band sounds more lively than logy on last year's charming debut, Better Than Before. Little Steven-star of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and The Sopranos- is among the band's biggest admirers, plugging the album regularly on his syndicated radio show. He's on to a good thing-the Singles will thrill any listener who believes rock attained its purest form when the Beatles recorded \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" Singer and rhythm guitarist Vince Frederick has an impressive ability to channel both Lennon (on Better Than Before's \\"Until You Came Along\\") and McCartney (the title track). Plus, with their suits and bowl cuts, they've got the look down pat.-Jason Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uptown Magazine Review","review":"If a band is \\"informed by the Beatles\\" these days it can mean anything from simplistically twee pop to pseudo-Sergeant Pepper-informed nostalgia. Detroit's Singles, however, have crafted a wonderful album full of choice Mersey Beat reference points that looks forward rather than back. There are plenty of girl-guy dynamics in the songs - a topic that naturally lends itself to the kind of powerful, straight-ahead pop that this band handles so effervescently. Track for track, Better Than Before employs the kind of singalong harmonies and driving guitar hooks that put it a mop-top ahead of any competition. Comparisons to the brilliance of The Rutles seem more appropriate in that The Singles weave just enough musical clues into their crafty songs to remind you that they have a pretty tight handle on their muse.

Margaret Barker provides an insightful look of Israel's Second God in this impressive, small book.One of my favourite sections is her discussion of Deut. 6:4 (the \\"Shema\\") and 1 Corinthians 8, where she argues Paul, and contemporaries, understood the Shema as a verse supporting the unity of Yahweh (henotheism), as opposed to the Trinitarian eisegetical interpretation by mainstream Christians or the ultra-strict monotheistic interpretaion in modern Judaism. As a student of theology in Ireland, and an active Latter-day Saint, I have a great appreciation for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Again","review":"This is wonderful book with lots of groundbreaking ideas that every Christian should read to understand the New Testament. Barker posits (based on extensive textual and historical evidence) that Israelite theology placed two powers in heaven, Elohim and his representative Jehovah (Yahweh). She shows that the first christians could accept christ as God because he was Jehovah, and Elohim was his father. While it may challenge some preconceived ideas, this book sheds lots of bright non-secular light on the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let this book go out of print!","review":"If you want a yearlong daily journal this is it.

If you love England and enjoy historical fiction, this is one for your \\"to digest\\" list.

As a look at the development of the city it could have been quite interesting. However, I found the extremely brief glimpses into what were essentially flat characters lives very irritating. Especially hard to swallow was the repeated interaction of two or three family lines with the great figures of history, I mean Chaucer as godfather?? I finally gave up when Shakespeare entered the picture. It was just too much. To encompass the entire rich and varied history of a city such as London is a massive task, one not satisfactorily completed here. I'm not sure that it could be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I read New York the Novel and enjoyed it, I read it in 9 days. The characters are just confusing. I am stuck home, have had the book for 3 weeks, am on page 360 and plan to return the book to the library tomorrow. I give up. The characters ruined this book, the building of London was interesting. I am going to try Sarum, because I did enjoy most of New York, the Novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are all the Women?","review":"London is the type of book that I generally love. However, I find many missing elements in the book, namely - women. Where the author is very meticulous with most details, he seems to skip important events where the central players are women. Henry II made an excellent marrige... never mentioned to whom! Only one of the most famous women who ever lived in England. This is aparant all over the novel and I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michener Redux","review":"This book can be easily classified for the reader; if you like James Michener's oeuvre this is for you. Historical fiction that makes up in detail what it lacks in heart, multiple families whose lives mysteriously repeat themselves(reincarnation?), and a heft to make you think it is more than a giant soap opera. However, Michener is not for me and this book left me cold. The history is pretty solid though, so at least it's well-researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very long but fascinating book!","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed 'London'. What a fascinating city. I found the characters in 'London' to be very interesting. I liked the way that the novel would follow several families from generation to generation. I did get confused with the number of characters in this novel, though. I had a tough time keeping track of them. Overall, an excellent read. This is the first novel of Edward Rutherford that I have read and I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"With more skilled writing, this would have been a great book","review":"While the stories are interesting and the book seems to be well researched, it becomes boring soon. The writing style is rather bland if not wooden. With more skilled and creative writing, this would have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"History as a Soap Opera","review":"The book provides a broad history lesson about the city of London and is, from that perspective, quite interesting. I have spent a good deal of time in London and know the city quite well. Rutherford's pages are fact-packed and the more familiar you are with the streets and districts of which he speaks the more interesting the book will be. I was just back in London a few weeks ago and recalling those factoids gave me a different perspective on places I've know for many years. The problem with the book, however, is just that: it is a book of factoids. The vignettes are, to be kind, trite and contrived. The book is eposodic, by necessity I guess, but it is unengaging because of this. In my view, the reader not very familiar with London will find the book unfulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"This book is poor imitation Michener, largely due to the fact that the writing is incredibly bland. While I learned things about the history of London, I had a hard time finishing the book, and only the curiosity whether or not the famous coins were going to be rediscovered kept me reading to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rutherford's book is good, but just too long.","review":"I have enjoyed parts of this book by Rutherford, as I enjoyed his earlier work Sarum. The only problem is that the book is way way too long. While being comprised of short stories makes it a little easier to read, it is also a problem. You find yourself wanting the stories that work to continue, and those that don't to end as soon as possible. I'm stuck about 3/4 of the way through the book, plodding along, just wanting to get it over with, but bullheaded enough not to quit the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read...especially if you've been there","review":"Excellent book. Yes, you can probably guess many of the elements (corrupt clergy, greedy merchants, whoremongering, capital punishment, plague, filth - what a great time to be alive!). But the chapters (each of which are separate stories, tracing family members through the centuries) are very skillfully crafted. I also enjoyed the way the author incorporated major historical events into the fiction. While some history buffs may scoff at mixing history with fictional characters, I thought the author did a great job of delineating between the two.One caveat, however. The author weaves many landmarks and names from modern-day London into the plots, thereby explaining their historical origins. If you are not familiar with the city, these references could become annoying background noise. But if you have been to London, these tidbits add a great deal to the enjoyment of the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this mess?","review":"Who wrote this mess?Certainly not the same Edward Rutherfurd that wrote \\"Sarum.\\"I finished it just because I wanted to prove to myself that I could read this AND \\"Underworld\\" in a year, but I cannot and will not recommend it to anyone!BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I was so looking forward to Rutherford's next book.

I orginally read it on a plane trip coming back from Britian, but have reread parts of it again. The way this novel is set up is ingenious, the character's lineage and the way that the plots weave together is great. This book really gives one a sense of London's history with in a work of fiction, it's funner then reading a stodgy non-fiction history book. This is a big thick read, great for a plane ride, but breaks up into individual stories, so that you don't have to read it all at one time to enjoy it. I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially if you will be traveling to London, or have traveled there in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Summer Reading!","review":"I found this book to be interesting while at the same time informative. This is perfect summer reading because it kept my attention for five weeks of traveling (yes, I was traveling in England and I did go to London) and will most likely keep your attention with it's intricate tale. Also, since it's a long book, it will give you something to read for the whole summer. However, I thought there were a few flaws within the story but, don't let that stop you from reading this book. Just find some time and be prepared to be engulfed in the history of London. PS. If you ever see a copy of London floating in the ocean, that's my copy which went overboard when I went boating. Thus, I'm here to buy a new copy of London."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating!","review":"A wise sage once said that history isn't about a bunch of boring facts and dates - it's a good story. London is certainly that and more.

If you see this book in a bookstore you'll think:\\"Oh my God, what a bulk!\\", but as soon as you start reading you'll find that you forget its size. The 1305 pages in the paperback are all filled with entertaining stories about life in London, and you'll read through them as easily as you'd read through the latest Crichton. Pity though that the author is very much interested in the Stuart-age, and it seems he thought when he reached the last hundred pages :\\"Oh, well, it's just the twentieth century, we all know that! I won't give it too much attention.\\" The Victorian era is also given too little attention. But despite these things, it is a wonderful picture of life in London through the ages. This book is one of the rare books where it is thrilling to read about a man who's almost bitten by a flea.

It seems that Rutherfurd committed to historical accuracy at the expense of attention-keeping activity. While most chapters finished in an interesting fashion, it felt a labor to get there. I must admit that at times I found the book informative on various points of London's history, overall it is not an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as 'Sarum', but Worth the Read","review":"Written in the same structure as Sarum, Rutherfurd's London comes alive with the same historical scope and breadth, though not with the same level of warmth and enchantment.

From the Invasion of the Romans to the Glorious Revolution to the present day, Rutherford manages to trace important historical events by followimg several London families throughout the ages. The scence changes from chapter to chapter, never letting the reader have a dull moment. Although the chapters (and the book) are quite long, you will be captivated at the incredible tales and characters that you find. These tales of adventure, intrigue, murder and love are all realistic and yet at the same time extraordinary as are the characters. Some, like the Silversleeves, you will learn to revile and others,like the Duckets, you will learn to love and root for. I recommend this book to anyone who likes learning about history and likes a riviting story at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evolution of a grand city","review":"Rutherford takes on a handful by tackling the history of London and the many permutations the city has gone through since the Romans, but he really does it in style. By tracing a few conspicuous genetic traits, we follow several family lines through the Norman Conquest, the Reformation, Shakespeare, Elizabethan times, the Industrial revolution, WWII, and everything in between. Although events in the lives of the various family members in the novel is written in such a way as to pique one's interest in the parallel historical events of the time, at the end of the novel no one character stands out. It seems, instead, that the same heros and villians are just reborn every chapter. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable work of historical fiction that will probably become an enduring classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure!","review":"Don't let the length of this book put you off, it is very well written and a pleasure to read. Starting with the conquest of Britain by Julius Caesar to the present (1997), this book will captivate you all along the way. My only complaint (small at that) is the fact that in the later years (1750 and beyond), the author doesn't spend as much time as in the earlier years and you don't get the same detail and feel as earlier in the book. It is hard at times to follow who's who, but the charts in the front of the book are great aides and despite the fact that chapters often jump hundreds of years, overall the book flows well. Well worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but predictable","review":"I enjoyed London much more in its early stages - while the families and their predicaments truly fascinated me and held my interest as they interwove with the historical aspects. After about 600 pages, however, the constant repetition of families, characteristics, and the way their surroundings affected them began to lose their initial thrill to me. I finished the book and still have good feelings for it, but the novelty definitely wore off after a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long and boring. Like a text book. Gave up","review":"I could not continue with this book any longer than 200 pages. Did'nt care what happened to the people. Found that I was speed reading just to get through it. This book is not for me. Can't give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant read it.","review":"Unfortunately my wifi connection faded as I was downloading this book so although I have paid for it I cannot read it and therefore cannot report on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily the city is not as boring as the book!","review":"Over 800 pages....I've only been able to force myself to read the first 133. Yes, the history of England, and especially London, is fascinating. No, the fictional characters over the generations are not! The only common thread is the inheritance pattern of ancestors over the centuries, which is trite and meaningless description. The problem is that none of the characters or their historical situations are explored in any depth. I just couldn't bear to waste the summer plodding through another 700 pages of the grey-haired, webbed-fingers ancestors who lived in what is now London"},{"rating":"1","title":"38 pages was my limit - BORING!!!","review":"The 800+ pages of this book did not deter me at all. I read Sarum and liked it. It was not perfect, but it was good enough for me to seek out this author again. London, however, was a different matter. I read - DRAGGED - myself through the first 38 pages and found the initial characters so completely boring that I could have cared less what became of them. My normal rule is 100+ before making a decision to close a book, and I think I've only ever closed 1 or 2. This one is now added to that short list. In fairness, it may get better - it may have turned out to be a thrilling, moving piece of literary work. Unfortunately, the beginning was SO bad that I don't even care if it gets better. I not only closed it - I donated it to the library. Maybe an nice insomniac will find it helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Hard for a City to be the Hero","review":"If you feel that finishing a book is prerequisite to reviewing it, stop here! I had as much of this book as I could stomach and put it down.This book is more a collection of inter-twined short stories than anything else. Maybe the genre of historical soap-opera can be established, for this book certainly has enough fans. I just can't get into it.Rutherford should have picked a newer city for his biography, so that he would not have to write so much \\"filler\\" in order to get to the end. Pillars of the Earth is a much better novel (built around a central theme of the building of a cathedral) but only takes place over a few decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Repeated beatings with a stick to the head are more fun than reading this novel. I had to read Rutherford's other novel, Sarum, for History class and experienced the same results. The scenes in London become dull and repetative after the first 300 pages or so(there are 1,100 all together)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one question--could it BE any more boring?","review":"I evidently don't have the patience of the other readers who posted here. I have rarely read anything so dull, with characters so wooden and impossible to be interested in. Not since \\"And Ladies of the Club\\" have I encountered a novel so absolutely a waste of precious hours of my life that I can never get back. Needless to say, I can't finish it--could hardly even begin it. I'm giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frayed, Chewed Upon and Ratty","review":"If you pick up this large book please take a close look at the genealogy chart. From the top down it looks like the unwrapping of a rope. As the rope unravels it becomes frayed, chewed upon and ratty. That is what happens to this book. I must confess that I just had to finish it because I wanted it to end not as I had predicted. But, it did end as predicted. For example, once you looked at the chapter titles and saw that the end was titled \\"The Blitz\\", when reading the chapter where the Romans hid the gold you immediately knew that it would be found after a German bomb hit that place in World War II - it did and it was!This book is NOT Follett's \\"Pilars of the Earth\\" nor is it any one of Michner's - not even \\"Poland\\"! It is too long, to frayed and not small enough for an airplane read. I cannot recommend it to anyone. I have not read Sarum, and now I won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writer","review":"Like his others, this is a great book. The author gives accurate information about the time period and brings the reader into the many interwoven stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"After reading wonderful reviews of this book in many places, I bought it to read during a cross-country trip. About a tenth of the way into it, I found the writing to be uneven, the coincidences unbelievable, and my natural desire to identify with and care about characters thwarted. Rutherfurd's book alternately lectures on British history and provides barely connected narrative from century to century (his chosen method of exposition). Frustrated, I struggled to finish the damn book. After a man at a movie theatre saw me carrying the book, told me of his similar frustrations with it (and with Rutherfurd's Russka as well), and suggested I simply abandon it on the nearest table, I took his advice, and did. I've read a dozen books since then which are infintely better than Rutherfurd's London!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to read it","review":"The opening chapters were fairly interesting, but by the time I was half-way through the book, I found that it was not holding my attention. Though the book seems exhaustive, in fact most of the subject matter (and the characters) are glossed over. I found the chapter about the Elizabethan theatre so annoying that I pretty much gave up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alchemy in reverse: gold into lead","review":"Being an Anglophile of long standing, I particularly enjoyed the author's previous work, \\"Sarum\\". Furthermore, I regard London as my most favorite place on this planet. Therefore, I was deeply disappointed in \\"London\\", and overlong telling of the city's history through the eyes of a multitude of mundane characters on fictional family trees growing through the centuries from pre-Roman Britain to the present. This was alchemy in reverse: London's golden history transformed to leaden boredom. There were too many characters about whom the reader could say, \\"Who cares?\\" I certainly didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A turgid london","review":"For me this book is just too slow and ponderous. There are some excellent sections with light, snappy dialogue but then long sections of almost historical text. It has some interesting historical perspectives - perhaps it never sorts out if it is a historical textbook or a narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is fun, History books are boring","review":"Pros: Rutherfurd always manages to pack those history lessons we should have learned into an entertaining tale. London is his best (up through 2008). If you want to learn most of your English history without the boredom, this is the book.Cons: Look, you got 2000 years of one of the most important cities on the planet.....it will be long....enjoy the ride. If you don't enjoy the \\"Now, why did that happen, what were they thinking...\\" of history, then look somewhere else. This is not purely a story book...it is a history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting complete historical overview of London...","review":"This book was fasinating. Once I began reading it, I realized I knew very little about the extensive history of London. Now having read it, I, for the first time, am really interested in visiting London to see first hand everything I've been reading about. So interesting were each of the chapters, I often found myself going onto the Internet to read more on various non-fictional characters or for more about the history or pictures of various structures. The author did a great job of telling the story through the lives of generations of several families and the end ties neatly with the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for history fans","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Maybe it's less readable than Sarum but it's also less chaotic than Russka. Try to read it while you're in London and visit the places described in the novel.I did it! It's a wonderful way to merge yourself deep into British history and to learn how political and economical struggles of the last 17 centuries have been deeply influenced by religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"London; A great idea, a poor presentation","review":"Rutherfurd's attempt to chronicle the history of London over two millenia has fallen short of greatness. Through the ins and outs of his use of family lineage and sometimes playful stories, Rutherfurd's inability to construct a flowing prose which is continually(or at least a majority) captivating is his downfall. I found each chapter to begin with a \\"kick\\" then monotonously try to relate each family within a coherent story only to wrap up each chapter with haste. Rutherfurd includes a lot \\"Jeopardy-esque\\" trivia pertaining to each period but these interesting anecdotes cannot save the boredom which is the bulk of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"EASY TO UNDERSTAND INFORMAL HISTORY - LOUSY STORY LINES.","review":"After having made several trips to London, and always at a loss concerning the time-line of the history of the city, I really enjoyed the informal history lesson.....but the story line and characters were a bit boring and sophomoric. At times, I wondered if parts of the book were really fiction or actual history. Too bad some more definite differentiation could not have been made between the two. I was specifically interested in knowing the dates that different neighborhoods were established, and when landmark buildings etc were built. I still don't know if the dates given were fact or fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Historical Fiction","review":"Edward Rutherford is the British James Michener! Now he just has to do \\"Paris\\" and \\"Rome\\"! If you have been to London you will love it more after reading this book, and if you haven't been, you will want to go. Facinating history, story, and characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial piffle","review":"I wonder if people rate this book so well because it is so big and they suspect that \\"big\\" and the effort required to create it means \\"good\\". Two stars then, for effort. London fails to provide any intrigue and thus, any interest. London has been likened to a collectioni of smaller novels, taken apart like this, these sub-novels are lightweight and fail to answer the Hows, Whos and Whys of the story. Sadly, there is no synergy. I agree with former reviewers observing that women are overlooked but then so are many males. It is a pity that Mitchener has died!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Capital","review":"A 2000 year history of London using a group of family-trees as the device by which the story is told. The quibble: As the cast-list and the geography of London is paramount to the enjoyment and understanding of this book I reckon a better series of maps and a clearer (fold-out?) family tree would have been a good idea. The praise: A thoroughly entertaining ride through Roman London, a succession of Royals, Chaucer and Dick Whittington, Fire, Plague, Reformation and we have not reached Victorian England yet! Each portion of history is relayed in the context of the characters that form a lineage throughout the 1000+ pages. For someone without too good a grasp of historical dates this really aids understanding of the events. A criticism levelled at the book is that the vignettes are (by definition) too brief. However, what else could Rutherford do? Write a 3000-page house brick?! In summary this book is easily digestible, educational and - thankfully- a superb read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How About A Proofreader?","review":"My two stars are based not on the narrative itself, but on the fact that this book (at least in the Kindle edition) is shamefully poor in terms of editing and proofreading. There are commas where there should be none, no commas or periods when needed, quotation marks opened and closed inappropriately, and so on. It's incredibly annoying and distracting. This may seem like a minor quibble, but if I'm going to spend my time reading a 1200 page book, it should at least be grammatically correct. Is that too much to ask for, Ballantine Books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to recapture that exciting feeling of your first time..","review":"...in London? Even if you are just planning your first journey to London, this book will bring home the magnitude of history which is buried under the cobbles.A must read for students travelling abroad - a good carry-on/time waster on the Eurorail - very hard to put down.I highly recommend this book to lovers of historical-fiction and travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marathon reading","review":"I've just read London and Russka back to back and BOY are my eyes tired. Rutherfurd writes very well, I have the highest respect for his books. I don't think \\"London\\" is as good as \\"Sarum\\" or \\"Russka\\" were but it is still worthwhile reading, I just wish he'd write a shorter novel once in awhile, closer to the length of excellent recent novels like \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" or \\"How Few Remain\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecstatic over finding this in CD at Amazon!!!!!!","review":"I have literally \\"worn out\\" the album I bought many years ago when this was first released.

That's Gil Goldstein and Bob Berg on the boards and sax, by the way!","review":"I love this album. I used to own the Atlantic cd and recently purchased the Wounded Bird Records reissue. The production of the music is fine. Every moment of music has been retained, and all of the original tracks are present (despite the information provided by Mike Stern's website, which states that track 11 - Nardis - is not included). My one complaint, and the reason for the 4 star rating, is that tenor saxophonist Bob Berg and pianist Gil Goldstein are not credited on the album!?! This is an alteration from the original liner info, which credited everyone involved. Why Wounded Bird decided to delete this information is beyond me. Just keep it in mind as their contributions are essential to the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"This is a lovely, extensive collection of Russ Morgan's beautiful music.

The line is a reference to a Boston club called \\"The Paradise\\" where they played one of their first shows in the US sometime in late December, 1980.There is much discussion among casual U2 fans I know as to where they played their very first gig in the US. (Some say New York, some say Boston.) I decided to get this book and settle the argument.Both sides are somewhat right. Although U2 played their first concert in New York, WBCN in Boston was the first radio station in the US to play their music. Carter Allen details how he picked up a import single of their first record and was able to get the station music director to ok him putting it on.And such did greatness get its' start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but Stuck With the Printer","review":"This is the real deal, a Samsung toner.

This dvd, however, wasn't much of a workout at all and it was terribly boring. The warm-up and cool down are literally the instructor, Nick Stone, marching in place for 2 full minutes and that's it. The pace is very slow and Nick is very low energy. It sounds like he is reading his \\"motivation prompts\\" off of a cue card.I typically do not write reviews because I usually agree with the overall user ratings, but I felt the reviews on this one were off.

I use the conditioner, but FYI just on the ends of my hair. It is so shiney and I feel like a little girl again. I totally recommend this.

I'm very impressed with this album. Although I miss the exuberance of Twang-Twang, I have moved on with my life and I'm glad to see that David has moved on with his songwriting. It has matured significantly. He let's his music breathe more, lets more of the melody take over.

What makes him special is his ability to artfully employ his talents and personality without overextending the boundries of good taste. Knowing when and what not to play is one of his strongest points. I'm convinced that David is a gift presented to us as a reminder of how things could be...as long as we remain true to who we are. Of course, it is just one person's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet As It Comes","review":"There is no loss of face in fossicking in Pop's rag and bone shop when you can produce a minor classic like Gaza's, 'This Euphoria'. His voice is somewhat dry, but utterly apt for the lightness of his material; tear-jerkers, and, yes, euphoria. Sure, it's teen fodder, but it owns a real heart, and dare I say it in such context, sincerity. Without the irony of Godley & Cream, or say, the sensuousness of McCartney, Garza still manages to scale the foothills of those big talents with worthy intent and graceful effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good pop music","review":"If you are into this sort of thing, you will like it.

The drums are very tight and flawless, the guitar is crisp and on-point and there is nothing sloppy in this albums execution. The music is presented in a way that's almost too perfect and they're quite obviously the work of trusty studio men. Roger's vocals, however, are spot-on fantastic. The man has got a tenacity in his throat that shines whenever his rock & roll roar comes out. The combination between the early 90s rock sheen and Daltrey's timeless voice comes out quite well, though. It's certainly better than I expected. A few less-amphetamined numbers can slow down the momentum, but great material abounds on the CD.Hightlighs include: \\"Times Changed,\\" \\"Who's Gonna Walk on Water,\\" \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Before My Time is Up.\\"I'd suggest that if you like The Who and don't mind slick-overproduction, you should grab this great album immediately; you won't regret it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Needs the Who!!","review":"\\"Mirror Mirror\\" is a classic. An extremely romantic song. One of the most romantic song ever in fact.

His genre is minimalism, considered by some to be \\"America's classical music.\\" If you have never heard this kind of music before, it could really bother you. This music has a whole different philosophy underlying it. What is music supposed to do for you? Popular classical music typically has strong form, and seeks to provide the listener with many types of variety in melody and chord-progression. Minimalism intentionally does away with a lot of that. In Steve Reich's music, rhythm is very important, and in 18, continuous pulses, melodic patterns, crescendos and decrescendos all swirl and dovetail. Repetition is used to create a tonal \\"picture\\" for you to soak in as subtle variations are introduced and eventually fade out. The result is colorfully impressionistic, and at times jazzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterwork","review":"Whether you prefer the original ECM recording or you own the Nonesuch version, this work will blow your mind if you possess the patience.

Bollywood has much better ware to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing memorable about this!","review":"Pankaj Mishra belongs to that breed of Anglophiles who do not know their own world, excepting through the glasses of a Westerner. This handicaps his powers of observation and description a great deal. He uses a stale plot as a crutch to give substance to his vision, and this makes for a failed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeless romantic","review":"At the outset, it seemed to be an (another) East meets West story, but it truly felt to be a book about love. The character Samar has always been in love with books, and is content to live a bookish life - four walls, a window and shelves of knowledge. He is a faithful lover and truly believes everything he reads. At Benares, his love is tested as he rediscovers life in the flesh - his growing love for Catherine and shocking realization of the European world-age traveler. The story is spiritual and romantic. In the end he hopes to live a meditative life with his one true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I can't believe what these other reviewers have been saying about the book. I couldn't put it down, and the amazing thing is that the book has no conventional plot or anything, but it just takes you in with its deceptively calm prose and subtle perceptions, keeps you engaged. A triumph in all senses of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful book","review":"Reading this book was pure pleasure. I wasn't aware that I was reading a novel. I am not a reader of novels but something about this book moved me from the very first page and kept me gripped until the end. A powerful emotional experience is how I would describe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"relief at last","review":"I am a cancer survivor who endured radiation to his head and neck. This treatment saved my life but permanently destroyed my saliva glands. for this reason I suffer from dry mouth, especially at night. This product eliminates entirely the nightly problem of dry mouth and allows me to rest comfortably. It is 100% effective and I cannot give orajel enough thanks for helping me to lead a normal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dry Mouth Solution","review":"Dry Mouth strikes me mostly at night and this product by Oragel (Dry Mouth Moisturizing Gel) is, for me, a successful answer.There is a competing product by Biotene called Oralbalance which is, in my opinion, much more expensive and is sticky and less effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good inspirational video","review":"This video is very useful to me. When I'm starring at a blank sheet of paper or when I feel like my style is getting too tight, I watch this. It really helps with both. Tony Couch is a pretty good instructor and one of the things I appreciate about him is that when he does something, he tells you why he's doing it. This helps with the mental game of watercolor. Right after I bought it, I painted the painting in the video and then the very next painting I did turned out to be the best I've ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG! how terrible can you get?","review":"Please be advised this is just my personal opinion. I dowloaded this album a few days ago because it kept comming up as an artist like Evanescence and Within Temptation. THEY WISH! this has to be some of the worst musc i have ever heard; it litraly makes me sick at my stomach when i listen to it. there is nothing really wrong the vocals, the music i guess is related to Indirock, i just Don't likr it, and i am not terribly picky about music; i like many diffrent kinds. just not this. once again bare in mind that this is my opinion only. i am SURE there are many who LOVE this music. but take it from me if you like gothic metal (nightwish, WT and Evanescence) don't try this one. save your money for somthing better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not metal and not very good","review":"I heard all about Lacuna Coil and decided to get this album and check them out. Well, I was incredibly let down. This album (and only this album since I'm not a long time fan) was nothing like what I hoped it would be. All of the songs seem to sound the same and it is not \\"Metal\\" like many people have said it was. If this is your first time listening to this band, I would say that you should listen to their old stuff first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hookless","review":"Okay, so, yeah, the last album was pretty darn good for what is essentially light-weight goth metal. They looked really silly but, hey, some good hooky music. This album, after two complete plays, fails to move me. I really wanted to like this album. But, man, bad production and hook-less songwriting dooms it. Just nothing grabs me, sorry. Best thing on the album is probably the toothless DM cover. This is a good example of a band writing with too much pressure from the label and themselves. They played it safe and they got safe. Congratulations. The production: too much high-end. Geez, I'm getting tired of this brassy metal production of late (see In Flames' last few for the same basic problem). Metal drummers: stop riding the cymbals and play percussively. Check out Tool if you want to hear how percussion is done right for metal. Thumbs down on this one, sorry. Buy Killswitch's last disc instead if you want cutting-edge \\"new\\" metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karmacode","review":"Comalies was such an outstanding album, so the next album should be even better. Its not. They start out with the male singer and he is not really the best singer in the world. He sounds like he should be in a cover band instead. Cristina Scabbia's voice is the reason to buy this cd. What a great voice she has. I think if they replaced the male singer with a better singer, then this band would sky rocket to fame. A decent cd but I think its more of a step back then foward. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"Lacuna Coil has lost it. The magic, the mesmerizing ambience due to Lillo's vocals is gone. This is a messy album highly dominated by mallcore sound and too distant from \\"In A Reverie\\" or \\"Unleashed Memories\\" to be taken as coming from the same band. Even the song in Italian ('Without Fear') has nothing of the magic of 'Senzafine'. The only song truly LC in my opinion is 'Within Me', and yet has not the fire of 'To Myself I Turn' or 'Falling Again'.Unless you are a hardened fan or very open to a band falling into the mainstream I recommend to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I bought this album, expecting to hear more of the great music I liked so much in Lacuna Coil's previous albums, especially Comalies. Instead, what I heard was a bunch of dumbed down Korn-style rap metal with Eastern influences and female vocals. If it wasn't for Cristina's voice, the album would have sounded like a completely different band. The music no longer has that melodic composition and complex sonic texture that made me like Comalies from the moment I heard it. Instead, I hear repeated monotonous guitar and rhythm styles, combined with Christina and Andrea singing often in unison, which only results in them drowning out each other's voice. There's absolutely nothing in this album that would make me want to keep listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their talent has grown in this one","review":"I have been a Lacuna Coil fan since their EP came out with \\"Veins of Glass\\". I love nearly every song they have made, but there is a particular sound and feeling this album has that has me in awe. The band is more connected and appears more aware of their talent and skill. This album is 100% flawless. If you are not a Lacuna Coil fan or have not heard of them, after hearing this album you will be hooked. I have every CD and have seen them in concert twice- they rock it out everytime. You will not be disappointed in this one and you might want to check out \\"Comalies\\" and \\"Unleashed Memories\\". Lacuna Coil has what alot of present day bands lack- talent, a unique sound, and the ability to grow with every album. This is a must-have album, don't pass up true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"F*CK AMI LEE LACUNA COIL ROCKS","review":"I'm tired of people raving about Evanescence...now, I'll admit I own both FALLEN and THE OPEN DOOR and love them both dearly...but they are NO MATCH for Lacuna Coil.Lacuna Coil is everything Evanescence wishes they were, METAL. Lacuna Coil mixs the beautiful voacl talents of the singer with metal riffs and a male secondary vocalist. It's everything you want from a femal metalcore/metal band. Pick it up now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better with each release...","review":"In my humble opinion, this is the best album LC has released, and I own them all. Heavier and faster than Comalies, which was brilliant in its own right. Think Korn meets System of a Down, with a whole lot of the classic Lacuna sound we're used to. Not a bad track on the disc, and well worth the purchase price.For solid female-led metal, also check out: Nightwish (awesome Finnish prog-metal); Drain STH (now defunct after only two great albums, unfortunately); Snake River Conspiracy (middle-eastern grunge). Happy headbanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Empty Spiral","review":"I've been a fan of Lacuna Coil for several years now and have seen them live. They're a great band. I was really drawn to the unique sound of their early work (pre-Comalies). I thought Comalies was OK, but kind of a step in the wrong direction as it sounded a lot more commercial than previous works. Unfortunately, Karmacode takes this once unique and great band deeper into the commercial, overproduced, GENERIC metal sound. Nothing on this new CD sets Lacuna Coil apart from the masses of similar-sounding bands out there. I don't find even one song on this new CD appealing or interesting in any way. Lots of overdone synth, rumbling bass and for heaven's sake, a Depeche Mode cover?! I won't bother to see them on the Karmacode tour. This band peaked with \\"Unleashed Memories\\"...that is their masterpiece. I love that CD. \\"In A Reverie\\" is also very good. Save your money (and spare yourself a heartbreak) Karmacode is a disappointment that is destined for the \\"used CD\\" bargain bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not sound like the great band that they are.","review":"The thing I loved the most about lacuna coil was that there music had feeling, like the song entwined off of comilies. This album however lacks any feeling it just seems that they tryed to be heavier. I Have all four of the lacuna coil albums and this is by far my least favorite, If they keep going in this direction I will probably not buy another album of thiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"What ever kind of change that is occuring with thiz band, keep changing.","review":"This album is long awaited and it has come....dam good album....i think as Lacuna Coil goes on and keep making albums they get beter and beter. now that the audience is getting more and more of them from reviews and proformances, the audiences will really get to know how good and talented this band is. this band can only get better and better. This album has many different directions and comes in very sophisticated and aggressive. Only Lacuna Coil can do. The others need to bow down and respect them.....(that goes for evenescence(the american version of Lacuna Coil))."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaning towards selling out.","review":"Comalies is one of my favorite albums and this follow up album just doesn't cut it. It is more \\"poppish\\" and has lost some of the dark, mysterious, gothic edge that Comalies has. If your a big Comalies fan then Karmacode will not satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tepid Disappointment","review":"As a long-time fan of the band, I cannot begin to convey how disappointing this CD is. Nothing more than a lame attempt at cannibalizing themselves and ripping-off American Nu-Metal. This does not even come close to the genius that is In a Reverie and Unleashed Memories. People singing the praises of this release need to have their heads examined. This CD has already been placed into File 13 among my collection. Long-time fans interested in checking out something refreshing should give the new Angtoria or Novembre a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of their best albums","review":"THisis their best album till this album. (I havent heard their last albums so far. This album with their first e.p. are their best work. I like very much the xound of this album - its a little bit industrial with very clear and agrressive bass and amazing vocals. The compositions are perfect and its an album that you will like (if you are into atmospheric meta , Guys this is the gnetre and not gothic - rock) from the start till the end. Very very good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, yet feels short","review":"This was my first Lacuna Coil CD that I had heard... Each of the tracks is rather well produced and the sounds are quite beautiful with very fitting vocals. I find that I like both the male and female vocals of this group, partially due to the effective contrast created with them!The only real downside that I've found to this album is that every time I listen to it I'm disappointed when it ends! Each of the tracks is short and sweet... Now I just need more of their CDs. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"","review":"Are people deaf? This album has a \`muddy production'? If that's the case then Darkthrone should re-record Transilvanian Hunger and make it even rawer. All kidding aside, Lacuna Coil's latest is solid from beginning to end. It is an album whose production lets every instrument and vocal phrasing shine. It is full of very catchy songs, infectious melodies and lovely chants by the enchantress herself Cristina Sabbia. Singing partner Andrea Ferro plays his role well and creates the balance in the vocal department when needed. The album is on the same level as their Comalies opus, maybe sounding a bit more mature while retaining the hard rocki/Metal/gothic sound. Ending the album with a good cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy the silence\\", the band reaches its creative peak and gets ready for the next level. Karmacode is a triumph, a true statement from a band that, despite its popularity, still hasn't wimped and just continues to mesmerize the ear. 4.5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Comalies","review":"If you loved Comalies, forget it. This won't work for you. It happens, artists here and there, now and then let out some stuff you really do not deserve to listen to.

And Duncan Sheik (whom I normally like very much) absolutely MASSACRES \\"Songbird\\" -- I can't even stand to listen to it.

Ringo the 4th was the 2nd album in his triple threat of bombs before he released the excellent Stop and Smell the Roses in 1981.I bought this album bundled with Ringo's Rotogravure and I can say about the only song on the 4th that I actually liked was \\"Drowning in the Sea of Love\\". Other than that, every other song is worse than the last one.It almost hurts to give a Ringo album one star because he is a truly talented musician...but like I said, this album does Ringo no justice and should be avoided like the plague.Pick up \\"Ringo\\", \\"Goodnight Vienna\\" or \\"Stop and Smell the Roses\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're British Don'tcha Know","review":"Well Welsh actually, hailing from some small town near to where the Lost Prophets formed. Anyway, they are quite simply the best British band at the moment, and probably will be for quite sometime. All 4 tracks are catchy, memorable and leagues ahead of the bog standard emo/ screamo/ post hardcore/ whatever, that i tend to hear everyday. The best is probably 'Escape Artists Never Die' just because of the relentless pace but not one of the tracks will disappoint. If you like this kind of music then i strongly recommend the album 'Casually Dressed And Deep In Conversation' by FFAF, cos its stunning and worth your hard earned cash just for the track, 'Bend Your Arms To Look Like Wings'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin Sister Doll","review":"This doll was given to my granddaughter's cousin who is two months younger.

We can take a lesson from the Mediterraneans, who know how to relax, put aside the ordinary cares of the day, and savor life's simple pleasures.

Almost everything gives way to +30 second load times with menus sandwiched inbetween, and progressing through season mode will see those familiar load screens after every single step. It really is ridiculous to the point of being unplayable -- unless you're the most patient gamer in the world, save your money and show THQ that we won't put up with this unoptimized tripe. (For a fun time, try making a 4-man tag team match with all create-a-wrestler characters; you'll be waiting over three minutes for the match to start.

None of these songs, even \\"Yancey's Bugle Call\\", is played all that fast. He doesn't hurry, but does he swing.I'm not that crazy about his wife's singing -- it's just not in the same class as his playing -- but enjoy the five cuts where they work together, too.This was recorded in 1951, when Yancey was fairly old.

When I heard about \\"William & Marlys\\", I might have been the first customer to buy a copy. It's one of the most lovely records I've heard in years. The songs are so beautifully written and performed. There are lush strings on each trackthat pull you in and don't let go. \\"Good to Be Free\\", \\"Leftover\\"... the strings and background vocals will just slay you.

The disc has a solid song selection and shows us that, had McTell have lived just a few more years, he could have been a huge star in the Country Blues revival. His twelve string guitar playing is exquisite. In my opinion, McTell and Gary Davis are the greatest twelve string guitarists in history; better than Leadbelly and Jesse Fuller.

This album, like their other album Isolate, is not one that blew me away the first spin or two, but over time I've really come to appreciate the musicianship, quality of song writing/lyrics and even though they don't really take the genre anywhere new, it's a great album.I would say that this album isn't quite on par with Isolate, but has a few real gems on the album like \\"Why am I here\\", \\"1st chapter\\", and \\"Glory of the Empire\\". While it's true they aren't pushing boundaries like Suspyre on \\"When Time Fades\\" or Frost on \\"Experiments\\", they have no weaknesses either.Basically any fan of Dream Theater, Kamelot, Redepemtion or similar bands will find a lot to like here and this disc should end up earning a spot in your rotation after a few spins."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY","review":"GREAT POWER PROG ACY FROM NORWAY.SUPER KILLER VOCALIST AND A BAND THAT'S FABULOUS WITH THE GUITARIST AND DRUMMER BEING BROTHERS AND A KEYBOARD PLAYER CALLED LASSE.THE LONGEST CUT ON IT AND THE BEST IS CIRCUS MAXIMUS I THINK 18.00 MIN AND HAS TONS OF CHANGES FROM GOOD SLOW TO SUPER HEAVY ALA DREAM THEATER PETRUCCI GUITAR SOUND.I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO COMPARES BANDS TO OTHER BANDS BUT THERE IN THE PROG GENRE SO IF YOU LIKE GREAT PROG MUSIC WITH 1 OF THE BEST VOCALISTS ALIVE GET THIS CD TODAY ALSO GET THE NEW CD IT'S COMPARED TO DT'S .SCENES FROM A MEMORY CD BUT THAT'S JUST A QUOTE FROM SOMBODY ELSE.GET IT IT'S GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prog album I've heard in awhile","review":"I really like this CD.

I had never heard anything from Circus Maximus before, nothing. Decided to pick up this album after hearing there names come up a lot on the PAGAN'S MIND forums. I popped this disc in, and immediatly the galloping, deep, death metalish sound of Sin kicked me in the chest. I was thinking... \\"This isn't prog this is Death Metal!\\" then, the keyboards and odd time signatures kicked in. I knew the music was awesome, but I was just waiting for the vocals. Prog vocals ethier make or break a band, and then a new age Geddy Lee style sound came thrashing in. I knew from this moment this band was AWESOME! A great mix of Dream Theater, Symphony X, Pagan's Mind, and Queensryche this band is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly beautiful!","review":"All I wanted was a DVD of the ocean, with natural movement and accompanying ocean sounds.

Period.","review":"Sadly, Greene was shut out of winning the Nobel after P&G because a single judge on the selection committee bore him an old political grudge and swore that the novelist would \\"never win while I'm alive.\\" Greene's ability to explore the largest of human themes through the medium of his unforgettably fallible characters is never better than here. And the crystalline prose ain't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption","review":"This is one of Greene's \\"Catholic\\" books, and regarded by some as his best novel. The plot focuses on a Mexican priest, hunted by the law for practicing Catholicism in a state where Catholicism is now prohibited.The priest is a \\"whiskey priest\\", searching as much for brandy as for God. He's caught in reflection on his own shortcomings as a priest, unworthy even of being hunted down for practicing his religion since he has, in his own evaluation, failed miserably.He has fathered a child and left the child and mother. When he visits the village where they live, the law closes in on him, but the mother of his child protects him and hides his identity, adding to his unworthiness scorecard.(SPOILER ALERT)His \\"redemption\\" is martyrdom, which of course he doesn't believe he deserves. On the brink of freedom, he returns, knowing that he will be captured, and finally accepts the fate of martyrdom, providing the only tie from his inner unworthiness to the outer martyrdom he will achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid plot, Shallow Characters","review":"I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course. I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later. The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive. Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.I was extremely disappointed.Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly. It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid. The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing. The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico. It sadly shows. He has little understanding of Mexico. I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work. If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear unless you're religious","review":"Not really worth the read. The text is about a priest on the run in a state trying to stamp out Catholicism. The typical plot about persecution and perseverance then ensues.Throughout it all, the priest charges for confessions and mass, bargaining for his trade. I know this is basically how he makes his living, but it irks me to see him charging for it, even if he lowers the price from 5 pesos to 1 peso because they are poor.In the end, the only redeeming quality of this book is that the priest is a deeply flawed character addicted to alcohol and has a child. The self-moral reality check and eventual progression are good but better told in other stories without being weighted down by religious confliction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was unfocused and basically boring.","review":"This book is terrible for many reasons. One being that it is set in a depressing time and place, and the way Greene depicts his characters, at times, made me sick and I had to put the book down just imagining what they looked like. I really felt depressed while reading this book. It was not uplifting at all. And as Faulkner said in his Nobel Prize Speech 'it is the duty of the writer to uplift the audience and help their spirits soar high.' This book didn't even increase my pulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAACCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHH","review":"I had to read this for school and I hated it!

One thing i should tell you if you consider to read \\"The Power And The Glory\\" by Graham Greene: This book is marvelous and if you start reading it in the evening, you will not cut until you have finished the book. The story is thrilling and exciting. It's amazing how you can tremble, run, fear with the priest. You can feel this urgency of not getting identified or caught by anyone. It is a bit difficult to read though, due to the marginal stories like the one of Mr. Tench. But still the main story is really challenging, it makes you humble before God, to whom still belongs all the power and the glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Novel","review":"This was a book I had to read for an English 104 assignment.

A very good book, highly recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power & the Glory","review":"A magnificient story about a priest outlawed during a insurrection in Mexico during the 1930's. The \\"whisky priest\\", according to other reviews travelled his area in Mexico performing his duties as a Priest. I disagree. He was represented as truly \\"human\\" man, who happened to be a priest, who could NOT do his duties particularly during trying and difficult times. When it came to escaping the territory and possibly living in a comparativly free (religiously speaking) area he did feel enough responsibilty toward his religion, not to leave. This cost him his life. To me he was a real person, weak and again, very human, ending up with more integrity than he began. Many other interesting characters in this book well worth reading about. Lots of religious discussion here. Graham Greene is a wonderful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"confused","review":"I was intrigued by this book. Someone please explain the ending.

You won't. This is basically a pop album that's very Beatle-esque (on one of the songs Adrian imitates John Lennon's vocal intonations almost perfectly) and has some of the best work Belew has layed his name to. Buy it if you want good Beatle-esque pop, but you are warned if you are expecting King Crimson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatlesque pop.","review":"When you ask many Adrian Belew fans what their favorite album by him is, quite a few of them will answer \\"Inner Revolution\\".I have to confess, I'm hard pressed to understand why. The album is full of catchy pop songs, but they're all largely similar, and its this similarity that I find largely unrewarding on the album. Admittedly, there's at least two classics in goofy \\"Big Blue Sun\\" and the Beatlesque \\"Everything\\", but with so many songs covering no different ground (\\"Inner Revolution\\", \\"The War in the Gulf Between Us\\"), I can't bring myself to listen to this one much.On the other hand, it is in print, which is more than can be said for most of Belew's catalog, but I'd recommend \\"Young Lions\\" or \\"Here\\" before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adrians Musical Therapy","review":"There seem to be two camps with regard to this album. Those who think this moody introspective album, which is largely the self-theraputic result of Adrian dealing with a rough divorce, is his best work.Then there are those of us that found it to be gloomy and self indulgent. Don't get me wrong! I am a huge fan of Adrian Belew, I have followed his career, seen him on stage and own most if not all his albums, even this one. But I must say, had I access to iTunes or Amazon, back then, and sampled the songs... I would not have purchased this album.My wife used to kid me that I had no \\"Happy\\" music in my collection, in my effort to show her that was not the case, I pointed to my Adrian Belew collection, from which I could play many a \\"Happy\\" song.

The music is an excellent mix of traditional Afro-Cuban and Cuban style jazz. The vocals are top-notch with traditional Latin harmonies. It is interesting to note that the members of Sierra Meastra searched for and found many of the old Cuban musicians from years ago and invited them to sit in on some of their sessions. They were found across Havana engaged in such things as operating shoeshine stands. Many had not played in years, but once in the studio, they quickly found their old magic and this is obvious to anyone who listens to the recordings of Sierra Maestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"signature Upshaw","review":"This is a great album.

But, now she is one of my very least favorite singers. Why? The excessive nasality, the ridiculous swooping, and the overdone ...mannerisms. On top of that, she has lost the roundness in her upper register (as evidenced by places in Ain't it a Pretty Night). This music doesn't need someone to treat it like a cabaret showtune to be effective, it just needs to be beautifully sung. Once upon a time, I thought Ms. Upshaw was just the person to do this kind of performance...I realize that there are diehard Upshaw fans out there that will completely disagree with me.

I bought it when I received my citizenship interview in order to better prepare me, and was disappointed with the book, which instead of preparing me for the test spent a great portion of its content on things that I had already done -- such as how to fill out form N-400. The book assumes that you have a very limited understanding of the English language, which is not necessarily true of many applicants for this test. Also it needlessly reprints many US Citizenship forms which are easily available on the INS web site.

Sappy, ridiculous lyrics with a bland and over-produced sound. This album is no different than anything Good Charlotte has put out. There is no edge or grit present at any level.It is mind boggling to me that this could be the same band that put out Set Your Goals. It's more than apparent that CIV was shooting for mainstream acceptance, but why fall so far from the tree? Couldn't there have been some sort of middle ground? Songs like \\"Big Girl\\" and \\"Secondhand Superstar\\" are gag worthy! But really, those two songs alone can't sum up the overall wretched vibe Thirteen Day Vacation gives.It's really sad that a band with so much potential had to go out with a sissy-rock album like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"another good punk band sells their music to MTV","review":"I first listened to Civ when he was the lead singer of the hardcore band Gorilla Biscuts. They were arguably one of the best hardcore bands ever. Then CIV formed. The first album \\"Set your goals,\\" though toned down, was a great album. With inspirational lyrics reminiscent of his hardcore days. I started to become concerned when they put a video on MTV. My fears were heightened when I heard they became a house band for some stupid MTV spring break show. This is not to say that a band playing on MTV is a sellout. But in most cases the you'll find their music changes to accomodate the pop MTV crowd. This the path that CIV took. The music can best be described as pop punk. With easy listening guitar riffs and a new melodic, light hearted singing voice (and lyrics) to go with it. Try their debut album if you like good punk music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"If you, like me, stumbled upon this album because you enjoyed \\"Set Your Goals\\" and were looking for more CIV, don't bother with this one. Although CIV really is the definition of a one-hit wonder (\\"Can't Wait One Minute More\\"), the whole \\"Set Your Goals\\" album was surprisingly good, it was a great mix of Punk, Ska, and Hardcore rolled into one. They really laid an egg with \\"Thirteen Day Getaway\\" though. The first few tracks are pretty good, but the album goes down hill quick. It is not bad enough for 1 star, because it is at least listenable, and I reserve that rating only for that which is unlistenable...2 stars is an adequate rating. FYI, my copy is now sitting at the local CD exchage store because it just wasn't good enough for me to bother pulling out and listening to for only two or three songs once in a great while. It is probably in their \\"3 for $5\\" bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Follow-up record to SET YOUR GOALS (which was incredible) which falls completely flat. This is straight pop music and after the Set Your Goals album, this was highly disappointing. Sure, there are some catchy jams and I bet they figured they would hit it big and could make a little cash but that didn't quite work out... but they still managed to make some bucks by re-uniting to do a Gorilla Biscuits reunion in which they were driven around in a fancy tour bus fit for Van Halen sipping on fine wine... actually, I think I may respect them more for doing something \\"different\\" with this crappy album than I do for that silly tour Gorilla Biscuits embarked upon last year. Too bad this crappy music didn't take them to that kind of level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Album","review":"I will admit to having never heard a song off of this album. Set Your Goals was just plain awesome. I saw the band on the warped tour the summer of 98 when this album came out, and they didn't play a single song off of 13 days.

It's an excellent punk album, so buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"More good stuff from the YYYs","review":"This album is great punk in an age where we don't get simple, straightforward rock.

This time, though, i would recommend dropping the NME or Spin and actually listen to this record, as it totally scorches. Yeah, it's not perfect: the track order is a little odd, with the first song being the craziest blast of garagey noise ever that the album never totally matches again, thus potentially letting some listeners down. But beyond that, this is an amazing record that positively roars and growls. The production is tight, and DAMN, Karen O manages to sound seductive and intimidating at the same time. This record has already secured a spot on my top ten of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hyped","review":"Two words - downright tedious. Don't waste your time unless you're into being tortured for 37 minutes. The album lacks direction and coherence.

Karen O' just doesn't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I have been anticipating this CD since the release of their self-titled EP released a year ago. Karen O's vocals are fresh and amazing. You can't pin one style down on them since the tracks are so different from each other. The standouts are: Pin, Maps, Rich and the bonus cut. Very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! This Is Great!!!!","review":"YYY's first album is everything rock n roll seems to be:angry,furious and very,very guitar loud.Karen O's performance is also a highlight:she screams like a hungry wolf in some tracks which reminds female rock queens like Kathleen Hanna and PJ Harvey.Don't listen to people who hates her voice.Probably these guys love untalented mainstream crap like Celine Dion,Toni Braxton,etc,etc... Anyway,don't let this modern rock gem out of your personal discotheque."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No Yeah Yeah Yeahs","review":"It's not my intention to write a review here and have it be completely ripped to smithereens. I just think that with a single out as creative and flowy (and as \\"Pretenders-esque\\") as Maps, the whole CD should've reflected that. The rest of the CD is just screaming and unsettling. And I am a fan of punk rock. I was surprised that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are categorized with The Strokes and The White Stripes. Maybe they just need some more practice? This CD is a perfect example of a one-hit-wonder.If you're considering buying the CD after hearing Maps, listen to a some of their other stuff before you buy it. If I could take it back to the store, I would. I'd have been just as happy buying Maps for 99 cents off of the Apple mp3 store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"I purchased this cd because of its cheap price and because of the onslaught of press about how \\"great\\" the band was. Spin Magazine hailed them as \\"magnificent\\". The fact is that this cd just isn't that good. I don't mind raw sounding garage rock (the new Libertines album is fantastic) but this band is just an embarassment to all the great unsigned bands out there. The songs just aren't there at all. The vocalist is very annoying (I'd much prefer Dani Filth from COF before this banshee) and the music is boring and uninteresting. This is the worst cd purchase I have ever made. For a good, fresh new garage band, check out the Libertines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 standout tracks","review":"Only 2 standout tracks - the 2 awesome ones that got radio airplay.

I bought it after reading a couple of reviews, and hey, the price is attractive. The CD is a disappointment. The band sounds kind of like an unmusical Iggy & the Stooges. There's a lot of sonic sludge over the course of the disc. I didn't find anything I even halfway liked until track # 9, which is a little Pretenders-ish. I spent less than half of the cost of a regular CD, but even then I felt like I wasted my money. Two other comments: (1) It IS amusing that a band called the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have a song called \\"No No No.\\" (Even if the song is less than great.) (2) I'm willing to forgive a bad CD cover if the music is good (like with The Coral), but this CD is bad, and geez, that's one awful CD cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MAN, this is horrible","review":"WOW! I just realized something, the whole 'insane depressed bipolar drug addict rockstar girl' schtick has been done all the way to the floor. the music on this record is nothing great, trite guitar work, TERRIBLE AND MONOTONOUS drumming (does this guy even know how to play).

In the song Date with the Night, they say the word \\"chow\\" literally 10 times in a row and the song Pin is even worse because they say \\"bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom/ de dun de dun de dun de dun\\" 4 times in a row as the chorus. it was sooo annoying! even though they're punk, hiring a songwriter could really do them some good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Album for the Deaf in Years!","review":"Pack upI've strayedEnoughOh, say say sayWait, they don't love you like i love youWait, they don't love you like i love youMa-a-a-a-ps, wait!They don't love you like i love youPack upDon't strayOh, say say sayOh, say say say...When this is our idea of a \\"well-developed song,\\" Armageddon cannot be far behind.

Well the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the latest and not-so-greatest band in a long line of trendy bandwagon jumpers to attempt to revive the already healthy and vibrant rock'n'roll scene. You see, had the Yeah Yeah Yeahs EVEN PAID ONE BIT OF ATTENTION OR EVEN REALLY LISTENED TO ROCK'N'ROLL they would have realized that rock'n'roll HAS been kept alive and strong. The Devil Dogs, Raunch Hands, Dictators, Ramones and many TRULY GREAT bands kept rock'n'roll alive while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were busy combing their hair and trying to figure out if Duran Duran were cooler than Ah-Ha!

Expectation always sets you up for a fall and this isn't an exception. If it weren't for the hype maybe I would feel more kindly towards this CD, but I wouldn't have aquired it. Many of the songs seem kind of repetitive. KAren O has a good and distinct voice, but all the Coo'ing and moaning seemed to be a substitute for good lyrics.There are good songs on the album but getting to them is a challenge. I found myself tunning out the music while I was listening. (something that usually only happens with CD's I've heard to many times). It makes it hard to appreciate the songs on the album that are good.I won't discaurage people from purchasing this album. THey may find merit in it that I didn't. And when I am in a specific mood the atmosphere that the songs create can be appropriate.

These guys were \\"the next big thing\\" before they had even recorded more than 15 minutes of music. And those two previous releases weren't full lengths, unless you consider a 7-minute EP worth paying 15 bucks for. I mean this band doesn't suck, but they're not that great either. The only song that really stands out is \\"Maps\\". Anyway, don't buy this, buy something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energizing","review":"There's not much you can say about this album at first. It's like a sudden blast of surging, powerful instrumentals backing sexy female vocals. At some points in this album the instrumentals are chaotic, almost to a point where it confuses you, until you hear the voice of Karen O. Just by listening to this album, you can conclude that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs must put off some nice club shows.The album itself is full of energy, only pausing shortly on songs such as \\"Modern Romance\\" and \\"Maps\\", giving you a chance to catch your breath. Brian Chase throws off some incredible drumming, offering a raw backbone to this New York three-piece. Nick Zinner complements Karen's incredible voice with his powerful guitar, completing an engaging, invigorating experience.There are but a few tracks on this album that don't shine as greatly as the rest, which is to be expected, but all in all, this album will make a great addition to any CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awsome Type Of Music","review":"I usually do not like this type of music, because to be honest, never heard this style.

The best song, however, has to be \\"Y Control,\\" which feels the most similar to \\"Our Time,\\" the best track from their last album. (They have a thing for anthems, apparently.) All is not perfect, however, some of the other songs aren't as strong, and after only owning the album for a few weeks I find myself skipping some of them, particularly \\"Man.\\"Overall, however, I would recommend this album to anyone. If you like the White Stripes, Strokes, or Hives--and you should like at least one of those bands--you'll like this, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"How can anyone NOT like this. Perfect, no. Interesting, definitely yes, and considering that rock has been around for 60 years, interesting is the best compliment you can give to a band. In a continuing age of endless recycled Eddie Vedder growls and pathetic made for MTV pandering, music like this is a refuge. This is a record for listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Heard It Before","review":"I too was suckered into FEVER TO TELL by some oh-so-hip pre-release reviews, and I am dissapointed with the record.The band plays everything through a muddy echo chamber and sounds like nothing so much as Romeo Void without the saxophone, the sense of humor, or any semblance of a melody.I've heard this record--or at least a lot of records that it imitates--a million times before, and it was dull then too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced","review":"This sounds like Kelly Osborne rented fugazi for a studio album, but didn't tune to any of their power. Moments like Mars gave it a couple of stars but the angst is all a put on. Switch on to the whole Concrete Blonde collection if you want to hear a lady rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Yeah Yeah... please turn this crap off!","review":"Okay, first off, let me say that I don't like to say that bands are awful, because everyone has their own tastes and opinions, but sometimes, someone so bad comes along that to have to speak up. I don't normally write online reviews, but I felt I had an obligation for this one. Before I say anything negative, let me also start off by saying, I really like the actual music itself. It sounds good and I enjoy it. But one thing kills it: Karen O. Her voice is just so absolutely bad. She shouts and makes the most ridiculous noises ever. I can't remember the name, but in one song she sounds like the little engine that couldn't, trying to chug her way over a hill, and failing miserably. It's just bad. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, considering it's sorely lacking in good vocals... I take that back... Her voice RUINS the CD. She's just SO AWFUL! *Ahem* Anyway, don't but this album, don't even burn it. Just break it into pieces, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rating: -1,000 stars","review":"i wouldnt waste a BLANK cd copying this garbage...the lead singer sounds like shes all doped up on drugs and being tortured at the same time..how the hell people enjoy this garbage i dont know"},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"Bland, predictable, unexciting, feeble, totally non-creative, lackluster, uninventive - these are all adjetives I would use for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs sound like the Pretenders minus any sort of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This CD is in one word: Vapid. Songs don't go anywhere, no big surprise seeing there's no bass player, and the guitar is too repetitive to support such an approach. Drummer simply can't play. Bands like the Gories and the White Stripes can get by on this formula, but not this band. Can't even tell where this band is coming from. Are they this bad on purpose? No discernible talent except the singer's voice is cool. I turned this off after the 3rd song and never looked back. Worst CD I have ever bought. Was tempted to just throw it away. The next day I e-mailed everyone I knew and told them not to buy this. Paid off too because my one friend said he was going out that day to get it. At least I was able to save someone ELSE some cash. I am Pi**ed and want my money back! Definitely a product of the hype machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another White Stripes Wannabe","review":"This band is just another White Stripes wannabe that has sprung up in the recent years. Karen O or whatever her name is can't sing for toffee, and the musicians can't play that well, either. A Date With The Night is a cool song, but that's about it. Get something original, go buy Elephant by the WS instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A more blatent ripoff I've never heard...","review":"Sorry all.. but can you say SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES !?I'm all for something new, but something new this is not. First time I heard the YYY's I thought I was listening to Siouxsie! The YYY's albums reek of rip-off, and there's not only nothing new with their music, but their songs are all the same. Another horrible band for the major radio stations to promote. joy. rapture. vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sha Na Na","review":"The fact that the Yeah Yeah Yeah's are the Sha Na Na version of better bands (from better times?) is obvious. When you look at the numbers above, you find proof in the pudding. There are currently 33 copies of this CD used and for sale. I have never gotten rid of Raw Power. Because it was true.

I'm glad I bought the CD though. That way I get to hear it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah its good.","review":"Took a while to come to me but its here and its excellent. I wouldnt say its a classic but for what it is, I would say its well worth buying. Im not a long time fan. This is my first look at this band so wether I will love or hate the older stuff i dont know but taking it for what it is (like it should be, unlike some people who judge people based on past work for instance), its a keeper.Standout tracks are Date With the Night, No No No, Maps and Rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah yeah yeah","review":"Everything you would want to hear in a full length cd by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.Sexual tension, screaming, precision drumming, and dancable guitars. This is finally what yeah yeah yeahs fans have been waiting for after the mediocre \\"machine\\" ep. It builds on the same formula of the self titled ep but ups the ante with more spazz out parts where Nick plays a wall of noise on the guitar and Karen O screams over it. Thats not all some of the songs are even more melodic and catchy than \\"mystery girl\\" and \\"miles away\\".this is really good if you haven't heard the YYYs yet but if you have it's great. Its like a hot steamy makeout session in the summer night with the windows up and fog forming on them. for real it's worth you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was looking for some CDs. And I came upon this one. I heard their song maps, and I liked it. When I finnaly bought it and startes listening to it, I was dissapointed. All of the songs seemed to be exactly the same, and from song number 1 to song number 7.I thought it was stilll the same song! They are so incredible alike.. all of the songs have screaming, yelling, chriping, smashing and even orgasm that It's just annoying mess. I still like yeah yeah yeahs a lot, i was just diaapoindent by this particular album of theirs. Hope they do better next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!!!","review":"I love bands that sound different from everything else on mainstream radio... All the songs on this album are awesome - especualy \\"Y Controle\\", \\"Man\\", \\"Tick\\", and \\"Modern Romance\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!!","review":"Yeah Yeah Yeahs have long been victims of the music press' evil hype machine, leaving a gaping hole called 'content' in their super-stylish shell. Luckily, this album of raw garage rock fills up that hole, and more besides. The opener 'Rich' sets a menacing tone with drum loops and electric organ, giving a brittle atmosphere which is then smashed to bits by 'Date With The Night' - a pure garage stomper. But Fever To Tell also has impressive softer moments, such as the love song 'Maps' and the New Wave-ish 'No No No'. Even though a couple of these tracks actually sound better on the live recordings that have been available on the internet for ages, the YYYs have done an impressive job - which shatters the myth that they're just hype and cements the excellent reputation of their live shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is sweet","review":"The Yeah Yeah Yeah's suceeded in creating a furious rock album. I find some of the songs to be a bit \\"loud.\\" But for the most part the album rocks. Karen O has a throaty mid-west sound that's unlike other leads in her genre. What I really like about the cd most is the quick laced guitar chords that fill each song with a blast of Americana rock... the kind of jousty rhythm often found in the old school board music used in movies like Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. This album happily fills a gap in my music collection. Try Black Tongue (Track #5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive.","review":"The Yeah Yeah Yeahs don't impress me. I bought this cd because it was cheap, and I thought it would sound like the D4 but with a female lead singer. Well, the lyrics arent nearly as good as the D4s, and I wouldent really say the D4s had the best lyrics in the world. It seemes like anyone could've wrote this album, and some of it is irritating, especially when the lead singer says noises like 'tick' and 'chop' a bunch of times in a row. Musically, the band doesent show that great of musicmanship. The bass and guitars, as well as the drumming, arent anything special. I have heard it plenty of times, but much better. This band has alot of energy though, but I dont really like listening to this cd that much. I dont really like a whole lot about it. If you consider this punk, theres much better punk avaible, like the Distillers, Rancid, among many others. Take caution buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"Well, the BEST thing I can say is that it's not your generic garage rock of late, but it DOES have the annoying and pretentious parts of the genre and Nina Hagen. Since when did Lo-Fi become \\"sloppy\\" and not very well thought out or written? I saw them live and they were terrible. A friend convinced me that the singer siad it was one of their worst shows ever, so I decided to give them another chance. Call me crazy, but I kinda like singers that can sing, adn songs that I can remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"Chuck D. was right: Don't believe the hype.Great playing but, Karen O's singing is annoying; she sounds like PJ Harvey's young, dumb sister for most of the CD... BUT, on the last 3 songs and the hidden track she finds her own voice. And it's great to hear. I wish she had sustained that quality for the first 8 songs. This could've been a classic album, maybe next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, If I wanted to listen to crap I would put in Nirvana","review":"Horrible Band, no talent at all.

Really confused. People call this type of music rock. The new type of rock. All these bands that sound like this are becoming popular. Why? This Isn't Rock! I have no idea what kind of music this is but it doesn't need to be with the rock outfit. I hate, I mean hate and can't stand any band like this. I'd rather watch 50 cent jump around on stage thinking he's a good rapper than listen to bands like The White Stripes, The Strokes, Jet,.... What are you people doing to the rock industry? I know alot of y'all are looking for something new but don't turn to this. Milli Vanilli had more talent than those idiots. And I did take the time to listen to the cd. I wish I didn't. That's about 15 minutes of my life I could've done something else with like clip my toenails. There's no direction in any song. Just a bunch of mindless yelling and terrible music. For god sakes people do me and alot of other people a favor and stay away from this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I listen to a wide variety of music, and so do many of my friends and associates. They were telling me about this band called the Yeah Yeah Yeah's and how awesome their music was. The very next day I saw their video for the song 'Maps', and I kind of dug it. So what did I do? I went out and bought their album, hoping for an album that would be similar to what I had heard already. Boy was I disappointed. I bought the album for almost 14 dollars and only got 5 when I sold it back the next day. What a piece of rubbish. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Okay, I'll be honest- I've only heard \\"Maps\\" but if that represents the rest of the album- then this is horrible. First of all, the guitar riff in \\"Maps\\" just doesn't sound musically pleasing... it sounds like a bunch of chickens being stabbed with pitchforks very quickly. Second, the drummer showcases no talent. Third, the lead singer chick lacks personality... she's just boring. I think this band is trying to be \\"artistic\\" or something but their really just corny and uninspired..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...Don't buy it.","review":"It...just...burns. Karen O screaming so much?! SCREAMING ISN'T MUSIC! I can scream. But I don't sell music. She like when you're choking and you're screaming at the same time. She sounds like she's hoarse. My mouth just popped open after listening to one song of the album at my friend's house. The singing girl sounds like SHE'S DYING. This is not good music...

One of the stories that I particularly liked was \\"The Barrel of Rumors.\\" Curious about the life of the Poor Clare nuns her mother helps with donations of food, Maeve can never bring herself to ask them about what she wants to know. And, of course, no one she does ask can really answer her questions. Her Uncle Matt, though, can throw in just a very light touch of humor about what she wants to know. Charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maeve Brennan is superb","review":"From the first page to the last, Maeve Brennan takes you on a vivid trip to Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s. She explores the feelings of children and adults in this wonderfully written book of short stories. Must be kept as a favorite for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wynonna does it again","review":"Wynonna has once more delivered the goods with this Classic Christmas album.

Thank you Miss Judd for a superb album. Aiden Creavin, Dublin Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Dissapointing","review":"What happened? I have been SO looking forward to this recording, but it is depressing, lifeless, no spark, and worst of all no fun. It does not sound like Wynona enjoyed most of these classics. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Christmas Treasure","review":"The year this album came out I gave scads of them as gifts. I was thrilled to share this treasure with family and friends. I absolutely love everything about this album. As new friends come into my life, I continue to buy and share my Christmas favorite. It is clear, beautifully done, and timeless. I have yet to give it to anyone who doesn't end up loving it as much as I do. I would love to see Wyonna do A Classic Christmas II."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMOOTH CHRISTMAS OFFERING","review":"Wynnona's first solo Christmas collection is a pleasant addition to your holiday collection.

I did think it would be more lively, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I'm a big fan of Wynonna's and was totally disappointed with her Christmas album. On many of the songs, it was hard to recognize who was singing. I missed her distinctive stylings and voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"One of the other reviewers asked if there is anything Wynonna can't sing. I recommend listening to albums before reviewing them; this album answers that question. It is obvious that her talent does not extend beyond country.I was listening to station that played her version of Ave Maria. It was atrocious. I listened to the rest of the album to see if maybe she had just tried to over reach on that piece. Unfortunately, it was not just that song. The entire album is a Christmas spirit killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Classics with Wynonna's Style!","review":"Wynonna adds her personal touch to the Classic Christmas Songs we all love,while maintaining the original essence of each song.You can feel her love of the Christmas season.Her rendition of Ave Maria is amazing.This is not only her first solo Christmas album,but the first time her children have joined her in the studio,singing background vocals on Santa Clause is coming to town.This is the one Christmas CD you can buy this year that will take you back to your childhood memories of Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's Wynonna?","review":"I totally agree with the person who said this cd lacks \\"spark\\"...it sounds as if Wynonna did this to fulfill some sort of job contract, she lacked any of the heart and soul we've come to love.

Zhou, that guy obviously didn't like this album, and you can't understand why, and he creatively made fun of it and it went way over your head obviously. Enough of this king of the South (...), because the nominees are all pop clones that everyone is mentioning! But if you need a real candidate, other than Scarface, try Devin the Dude because he's not afraid to be himself. I think T.I.(whatever that means) could make better music, but he's more content with fitting in and selling more records! So be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DA SOUTH AIN't THE ONLY ONES WHO LIKE DIS","review":"What that cat from Brooklyn wrote, was a lie. T.I., who declares himself King Of Da South really backs up that title with tight lyrics. Just listen to him shawty. Igave him 4 stars because the only ones who deserve 5 are Outkast, Tupac, and Biggie, etc. So that 2 star thing, is a joke. 24's is tight, the album is tight. But I'm Serious may be a little better, but Trap Muzik is really worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KING OF THE SOUTH","review":"this album is the album of the year hands down. TI rocked the album from the first to the last song. \\"I'm Serious\\" was a classic album and I gotta put this one on top of \\"I'm Serious\\" because the beats and flows are even tighter. Right now he is the king of the south, no doubt. With all that wit and cockiness,mixed in with realness, he reminds me of a dirty south Jay-Z and . If you ain't got this album go to the CD store and get it today. One of the best southern albums of ALL TIME, no lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Up Please","review":"Rubberband Man? This CD is for kids. Grown men can listen to some real kings of the south with CELO or 8 ball, but this is really just a lil' 'un from around the way who happened to get a record deal. Nothing remarkable, you probably have friends who can rap like him, except maybe not as annoying. If you're a fan of him already then you will probably like anything he does, so happy listening. If you are looking for some good new music and are over the age of 13, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"When I buy a CD, I expected to like more then 3 or 4 songs out of 18.

Don't Hate Me Shawty is one of my favorites. His approach is innovative and fresh. He breaths life into a lackluster industry that's focus has been how much bling and things can make you broke before you even have a real hit. Real South folk are going to love this one. He made a name for himself in the region with I'm Serious... I just didn't know how serious (and talented) he was before I heard this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Masterpiece","review":"I bought this album thinking 24's and rubber band man, would be the main songs that i listen to but i was extremely suprised that i love pretty much the whole album, almost every song is great, it gets heavy rotation in my c.d. player, One stand out song is T.I. VRS. T.I.P where T.I. actually raps back and forth to himself with 2 different personalities, one telling to take the right path, the other telling him go crazy and not care, i think this song is great cuz a lot of people go through that when they get big, and he put it to words, this is a MASTERPIECE........you definitley need to check this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is THOROUGH","review":"TI is da truth. im seriously feelin this. this is the BEST south coast hip hop album since Stankonia (i dont consider Love Beloww b/c that wasnt hip hop, and Wooden Leather was good but not this serious). not only is the flow & the beats representing the hotness, BUT the lyrics are sick. we have been starving for some soulful south coast hip hop that has something to say ... not all the stupidity that has been coming out about rims, guns & shorties gettin low to sweep the floor ... dont get me wrong, TI does have his gun poppin & rim spinnin moments, but also brings far more ...i would highly recommend this joint ... \\"RubberBand Man\\" had me open, then he took it to the next level with \\"TI vs TIP\\" and \\"King of da south\\" among others. this joint gets 5 mics."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.I. King of the South","review":"I'm sad to hear that duke just got knocked. Bottom line, he is one of the best M.C.'s in the game right now. This album is solid from front to end. T.I. is what I call a \\"professional rapper\\" in the spirit of a gun slinger. Each track on this album feels as though he placed a whole lot of thought into what he was seeking to project to his audience. Simple and plain, dude can plain rap. His vocal injections and timing are immaculate. The beats are off the hook. It's a shame that he will be out of the box for a minute. Hopefully, when he returns to the game, hip-hop's fickle fans will not forget how good he really is. T.I., hold your head and learn from your life's personal mistakes. You're an incredible talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great cd","review":"i picked up this cd the first day it came out. it is great. listen to 24's that is a dope song. pick up this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight Lyrics & Stories","review":"The CD is tight as expected. I have T.I. first LP entitled \\"I'm Serious.\\" This was just like a continuation for me of some good lyrics. I think this album should go platinum. It has the making of tracks such as \\"24's\\", \\"Rubber Band Man\\", \\"Trap Muzik\\", and \\"T.I. vs. T.I.P.\\" are all chart toppers. Even \\"Be Easy\\" which is playing on the airwaves at the time of the album release, I think that will end up being a #1 hit in the south fa sho'. Well If you loking for a true artist to sit back and listen to or bump in your trunk T.I. \\"Trap Muzik\\" is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"average - but i dont like ALL the songs","review":"to be completely honest, some of the songs get kind of boring after a while, which is not the case with much of my material. i mean boring in the sense that when i go through my cd collection while playing it in the car, i dont really include this cd in the cycle. I enjoyed it when i first got it but i find myself now not really using the cd that often. however, rubberband man and 24's are both very very good songs. the first song is kind of repetitive as well. overall - average skill and production involved here."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Like 4.5 out of 5 Stars, But Better Than The 1st Album","review":"IMO, this album is better than the first album and that is saying a lot because I have had that in heavy rotation for over a year. Not only did the production improve on this album, but most importantly, T.I. has grown lyrically. This is evident on the tracks No Mo Talk, Long Live The Game, Kingofdasouth and I Still Luv U. In terms of production, Bezzle, Doin' My Job, Let's Get Away and Rubber Band Man are standouts. As with his other album, T.I. has something for a variety of audiences on here. He has some heartfelt and introspective joints(i.e. I Still Luv U, Be Better Than Me, Doin' My Job), uptempo joints(i.e. Bezzle, 24s, Rubber Band Man) and cuts for the ladies (i.e Let's Get Away and Let Me Tell You Something). This album is one of my favorites of the year, so far. This album further proves that T.I. can spit with the best of them and is continuing to improve with each album. I highly recommend this album as well as I'm Serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore jinx here!","review":"Standout Tracks: I CANT QUIT, BE EASY, NO MORE TALK, DOIN MY JOB, LETS GET AWAY, 24s, RUBBERBAND MAN, LOOK WHAT I GOT, I STILL LOVE YOU and KING OF DA SOUTH. Filler: Let me tell you something(too sugary for anybody), T.I vs T.I.P.(boring filler), Bezzle(tight beat wack collabo), Be better than me(tries to be positive but fall flat on his face) and Trap Musik. Bottom Line: T.I second album is no sophomore jinx by a long shot. T.I flows get better with each song like No More Talk, Doin My Job, Look What I Got, 24s etc. Even though he has songs on here he should have 86'd with the quickness like Bezzle, Let me tell you some thing, T.I vs T.I.P. and Trap muzik this album still has enough hits to keep it within your arm's reach. Not bad for a southern rapper you werent thinking too much about when he first came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!!! (I have 3 copies)","review":"This is my favorite cd right now. I love T.I. because his lyrics aren't the same as everyone else's in the game; T.I. has something to say. He doesn't talk about the bling bling & the glamour of the hood, rather he speaks on how he became a product of his environment & still made it out. Better yet, how he continues to go back to the ATL to right his wrongs and try to help out those in need because of the things he did as a young man. The lyrical content of Trap Muzik is better than most cds out right now, and it doesn't hurt that he's the SEXIEST MAN on earth. His flow is on point, the beats are tight, and if you don't have Trap Muzik yet, you need to go out & pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a 0 or negative star rating","review":"Because this is crap. Actually to tell you the honest truth, crap is better. At least crap can be used a fertilizer or something. Crap is a compliment. How does that one guy know the word Monotonous?

It provides a historical perspective that is well worth reading for several reasons. First, RCA, having won the battle to commercialize television also claimed credit for its invention. With the demise of RCA, we are rediscovering the accomplishments of Philo Farrnsworth. Second, the author, George Everson, was one of Farnsworth's financial backers and close associates who witnessed first hand the birth of television. Third, the current books about the life of Farnsworth depict him as the struggling inventor battling the giants of industry only to be crushed by them. Everson portrays him as a well know and respected scientist who despite enormous technical odds was eventually able to triumph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Casual Reader","review":"This is a poorly thought out piece of time travel fiction.

Now that I have heard the rest of Alleged Dances, it reaffirms my belief that here at last we have a composer of our time who is in tune with the times, who can be as classical or as pop as anyone and most importantly write good music that entertains as it does provoke.It is strange that people will call Brahms' Hungarian Dances\\"classical\\" but not John's fabulous Alleged Dances. Adams here is far more sophisticated than Brahms, and he deserves to be up there with the greats.If anything, I was overjoyed to hear how Adams made the connection between what we call \\"classical\\" music and pop, reminding us that even back in Handel's time dance was the basis of music that we now call high art.Moo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The second disc with works by John Adams I've been listening to, and already I can't help but wonder what has become of him. My first experience with Adams has been Harmonium, a work of breathtaking intensity and uplifting beauty - ten years later, he produces entertaining sections of noise which transport the impressiveness of old in nothing but being impressive examples of the fact that not everything coming out of instruments (or of a cow, for that matter) can actually be considered music.Gnarly Buttons seems to be a little less bad at first, but later on turns out to be just as stereotypical as most of the Dances.If you enjoy pop music performed on classical instruments, mainstream film music or light music in general, you might still enjoy this disc; perhaps your children will like it as well. Yet, bearing the name of John Adams, this is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quartet is a dud!","review":"One had great expectations for this Adams string quartet.

So I checked out DAWN, California Diary #1. It was terrible, absolutely terrible, and it made me very upset. Everything is Dawn, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn this, Dawn that. It is filled with some very inappropriate things. The Baby-sitters Club Series is NEVER like that. In this book, I also found words I'm not allowed to say. I was so ashamed of this book that I just stopped reading it. If you could rate books, this would be PG-13, so don't even THINK about buying this novel for a ten-year-old. I am very frustrated with this volume. How can you do this to my favorite baby-sitter, Ann M. Martin?! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Well................","review":"The character Dawn was pathetic and the fact she was suprised that there was drinking and smoking at party is plain out stupid.

Martin was a little bit more realisitic about suburban teenage life, but Dawn shows herself to be a selfish, uncaring person that makes you wonder what happened to traces of the old Dawn. In Stoneybrook she seemed to be picky and arrogant and always picking a fight with Mary Anne because she's being so stupid and unappreciative of her wonderful stepsister with a sensitive heart, and yet sometimes she had a social conscious and did a fund raiser for kids in new mexico or trying to start an environmental club at school and becoming great friends with a girl with Down's Syndrome, but in this book she exposes her true colours. We've seen traces of Dawn snobby attitude through the little Mary Anne fights and jealousy towards Richard, and how rebellious she was when she flew to Connecticut from California stealing her dad's credit card.

I was completely charmed. Cozies are usually light on characterization or real mystery, but Monica Ferris wonderfully combines the American small town cozy with diverse, interesting, fully-formed characters. She also crafted an actual mystery that was hard to put down.The needlecraft angle was also surprisingly enjoyable. I knew nothing about needlecrafts and was curious about how an author could anchor a story around something like that, but it was so interesting, and I learned so much that I'd never even thought about before, that I'm tempted to pick up a pair of knitting needles myself.With well-developed characters and a strong story, Ferris proves that cozies can be more than fluff. \\"Crewel World\\" was absolutely delightful and I can hardly wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crewel world","review":"I loved this book and found it very interesting.

I find his work, especially 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Extended Phenotype' to be extremely enlightening and a joy to read.Sadly, in this book Dawkins largely repeats himself and at the same type manages to down-scale his arguments for less capable readers.In short, if you've read other works by Dawkins and have a healthy dose of scientific education this book will often be boring.I highly reccomend 'The Selfish Gene'"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTG for the layman","review":"A book essentially dealing with genes (a favourite subject of the author) and how scientists can use DNA 'fingerprinting' to delve deeper and deeper into the past to discover life's origins and branching points.It dispels some myths & misconceptions about how evolution works and also raises some rather novel issues (I thought) about heredity - took me a bit of time to get my head round the argument here!Although I found this book enlightening (as all Mr Dawkins' books are), I found myself a tad overwhelmed by the economics brought in to play to explain the apparent inconsistencies in populations of male & female in certain species, and also I found the discourse on bees a little more laboured than usual.Nonetheless, a very thought-provoking and interesting read for those who wish to know more about life, the universe & everything (42)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawkins succeeded in maximizing interest in this work","review":"I liked the book for it's lucidity and many insights it provides into evolution in a lay man's language. If you happen to be interested in Evolution and haven't read anything about it, this is a good book to start. I particularly liked the first chapter and also the chapter on God's utility function.

While a bit shorter than most, it is a wonderful piece. It is a somewhat broad overview, and if you've read much of his other work, a good portion will be familiar, but just as much will be new. Even the parts you know are enjoyable. He introduces some wonderful and fascinating examples of animal behavior, and explains how each could have arose through simple darwinian evolution. This book also covers how we can now use various proteins to determine how closely related various species are, as well as using mitochondria to determine how closely individual humars are related. While not as valuable as The Blind Watchmaker, this is a book that I would recommend to anyone wanting a bit more information on evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't really grasp natural selection until...","review":"This was the first of Dawkins' books that I encountered. He develops a picture, step by step, of what evolution actually means AND does not mean. I felt, after reading this book, that for the first time I had obtained a worthwhile understanding of the topic. He expresses it in terms that I could understand, yet the concepts were much more sophisticated than what I learned in Secondary school and Undergrad Bio courses (as an engineering student).This book was so fascinating that I have subsequently gone on to read all his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Life.","review":"Dawkins leads us through evolutionary theory with a wittyvoice and an eye for wonder.

It is also the type of song that screams for a remix. It is layered, has several different sections where the song varies, and has a great beat that could be manipulated for a remix. It's a re-mixer's dream and I was very exicted to see the results. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed in the re-mixes. They basically stuck in some rapper who repeats a stupid line over and over and basically ruins everything about the song. Yuck. What a shame. Get a new remix outfit Roland!! The single version is just the album version minus a few bars to cut the time down as expected.By the way, the album is great. It combines Roland's classic melodies and hooks with a nice new, trip-hop feel. Highly recommended--just don't get the remix single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roland's back with a new/old sound","review":"This is the new & now withdrawn first single from Roland's \\"Tomcats Screaming Outside\\" CD. The track reminds me a bit of The Pet Shop Boys in one of their more experimental moods. Not sure about its commercial appeal, although I certainly like it enough to recommend it. It should be picked up by the dance clubs. But the fact that it has been reconsidered as the lead single means that other tracks must have more commercial potential. (As I write this, the album is due for release this week.) In any case, anyone who owns this already has a collector's item!

GREAT ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"Thank you Ry Cooder for saving these wonderful people from extinction and giving them life again. The first tract on the CD is one of my all time favorites, but when I saw the movie BuenaVista Social Club inflight the tract \\"Cinfuego Tiene Su Guaguanco\\" had me literally dancing in the aisle! I am not Cuban but I ought to be! This Cd will live forever as a testament to the beauty of an ethnicity and culture that we may never see again. This CD is a history of a noble and dignified people and their life in Cuba presented in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty needs no understanding","review":"With only limited Spanish-speaking skills, I cannot begin to fully understand what Ibrahim Ferrer and Co. are singing about. It really doesn't matter, though -- the music's beauty shines brightly through the darkness of my ignorance.The Cuban folk music is truly a beautiful blend of plucked guitars, a light sprinkling of brass, and some soft piano and clean drumming for accompanyment. Although you may not speak Spanish, it is a beautiful language nonetheless -- another sweet instrument, if you will, that lilts and floats over the rest of the music.This album really brings back great memories of traveling in Mexico: the images of the desert; the poor, dusty villages; the enchantment of the Sierra Madres; the amiable, heartwarming nature of the natives -- it's all here. Every listen is a trip to a place far away but not forgotten. If you have ever taken a trip to not just Cuba, but any Latin American country, I think this music should be a part of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music is amazing","review":"This album and the dvd/documentary are amazing musicianship. I thank ry cooder and the cubans for providing such a great source of music its beautiful. Also ry cooder has proved to me he can do anything when it comes to music. By buying cooders albums i have learned so much about different genres of music. Ry cooders music makes me think outside the box and not to stick with one genre of music. I think i would be bored of music quick if i just liked one genre thank you cooder for all the great albums you have made. All of your music is good. What ever you touch musically turns to gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varied and Seductive","review":"A lovingly created compilation (by Ry Cooder) of soulful, seductive, tropical, jazzy, Afro-Cuban, ballads and more. Though varied, the record works together as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Buena Vista Social Club","review":"This is a must have album for any Latin American, music lover. Ry Cooder brings out some of the best of Cuba's talented artists in this single album. Many songs are classics from the 50's and 60's Cuban sons y boleros. There is not one bad song on the whole album and each has a distinct and different flavor que agrada la gente!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album i have heard in some time","review":"This is one of the greatest tributes I have ever seen or heard to a group of musicians who actually did what they did out of sheer love for the art. These songs remind me of what my family use to listen to around the house, and the stories I heard about my parents and grandparents growing up and living in Cuba. I honestly can say without worrying about being cliche, that I can feel some of the songs on this album, a rare occurence. Any body of Caribbean, particularly Latin American descent should own this album and definitely see the film. For those of us who only know Cuban culture as it has been filtered through American culture this is definitely a learning experience. Very Profound in its simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting","review":"Ry Cooder is a great roots guitarist, and this is very pleasant record that should wet your appetite for a deeper exploration of Cuban music. Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned About Album From Documentary About Making It","review":"My husband and I had heard that the documentary \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" was a must-see. We did watch it twice and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, the version I felt I must own was the CD of the music, which I did buy. I know very little about Latin or Cuban music. My one prior exposure was to the soundtrack of \\"Mambo Kings\\", which I also enjoy. This is an absolutely beautiful album. It is very lush and romantic and very easy to listen to, again and again. There is a beautiful thick booklet included with the CD which was a very nice bonus. There is nothing strident or loud about this Cuban album either, if anyone assumes (incorrectly) that is what Cuban music must be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It's probably the most interesting Album I've ever heard in the last 10 years.These aged guys played with heart! You can feel the difference between the contemporary Salsa and this wonderful, acoustic music...few notes...played with feeling. Ry Cooder had a good idea but he and his son were unneeded in the recording. Sorry for my bad English"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cuban","review":"Here's the deal.. in a country full of musical talent (to say the least) largely unknown to the general American population, lives a Gold mine of aging musical genius. However, unlike most musical wizards, these musicians play out of love, for their nation, their music, their life. All it took was a \\"Gold prospector\\" and his Hawaiian slide guitar to find, publicize, and exploit these musicians for a cool buck.. or two. However, none of this leaves this cd any worse. No guitar could ever destroy the brilliance of the rest of the musicians in this album, or take away from the fact that they are all still playing for all they've ever known.. What is left is worth far more than money; authentic Cuban brilliance in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ry Cooder should NOT play in the disk!","review":"As much as we are thankfull for assembling this group of fantastic people, we are really frustreted by his guitar and his pinkfloidish Taaaaeeeeeeeeeeeen that have NOTHING to do with the atmosphere of the disk. He looks like he said: \\"I paid for this, I gotta be in it too!\\" He makes me skip two songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is simply a CD-- Not the movie","review":"Before you purchase this \\"DVD\\", you should understand that what you will receive is not the movie, but simply a CD of the music from the film \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\". While I love the music, what I wanted was the film--- and I was disappointed to discover that this version is nothing but an expensive CD that can be played on a DVD player. If you want the music, buy a CD. I'm returning this for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Sorry, but based on all the reviews I was expecting some fantastic cuban flavoured salsa. Instead this sounds like some pathetic combination of bad lounge Hawaiian and b class Mexican influenced band. If this is the best of Cuba, then maybe the US trade embargo was a good thing after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"It saddens me to think that 7 million Cubans suffer everyday from political oppression and the lack of everyday necessities and we think these productions are just dandy. Of course the music is great, but having US dollars flow into the communist government's laps in not the situation we want to have. How much of the cash do you think Ruben Blades sees off of his work...very little.Enjoy the music but don't forget the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it's really not very good","review":"I'm sorry but this is not a listenable CD. This is the standard repetitious Latin music we pass over on the radio every day. Although the performers are legends within the Cuban music community, to a listener whose ears have been conditioned to the jazz, pop, country and classical of regular old USA offerings, it's not interesting. It is better when someone like Carlos Santana or Al DiMeola interprets it and filters it. It is not very good otherwise. I would prefer listening to a faucet drip, rats in the attic or fingernails on a chaulkboard. If I could, I would give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Ever","review":"You know what,get over it,if a dedicated cubafile like me is sick of seeing this album since it's concept still here,you need a life,Cuban music has nothing to do with these,be it as it may good preforms,live life Go on ex4plore,grow,if you realy try life outside,even if Castro falls down in national papers ,a list is much more refreashing!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its officially a staple for me!","review":"I have had this cd since its release- and I still play it- which is a real surprise to me. Most of our music these days is so disposable- one hit wonders- sixteen bands that sound & look identical- but this cd lives on. It's a beautiful & astonishing cd. I sincerely believe its just one of those things that gets better each time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"Michael Fletcher reviewed this CD spot-on. And I concur with the review that it is magical--it is indeed that. I can listen to it over and over at work or at home! It seems to suit almost any mood and simply nourishes the soul. I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys good music--you don't even need to be a fan of Cuban music. I certainly am not well versed in Latin music, but am a definite fan of this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Cuban Music Fans","review":"Born and raised in Cuba I grew up and somehow this copilation of music makes me feel like I never left.

I knew about it and the movie, but figured it was Ry Cooder infatuated with a mariachi band. Wrong. This is absolutely gorgeous music, a true fusion of jazz, blues and latin styles played by unknown masters. It cooks, it grooves, it will make you fall in love with good music and the wonder of virtuousity all over again. I purchased a new copy out of respect for the artists and for the 48-page booklet that doesn't come with bootlegs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ry\`s intrusion","review":"This CD is obviously a classic. Belive me, This is the real latin american music, very far and more soulfull than Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and their code-bar oriented, musically deaf crowd. This is one of the most touching testimonies of the latin american musical spirit. It is a blessing to hear the raw, almost live sound of this recording, so you can apreciatte what is this all about. Still, Ry Cooder and his son\`s intrusions in the sons put on evidence that they (The Cooders) have no clue about latin or cuban music. But I am thankful to them for showing the world these exquisite talents and their music.

I also found it annoying that Mr. Lipper was so heavily biased toward independent juvenile products stores (e.g. the store he manages in New York). He made himself out to be an expert, given his vast experience in selling baby products to expectant parents. However he doesn't have children of his own, so he has never really tested any of these products in real life experience. Don't bother with this book if you are a first time parent and need the nitty gritty details about baby products. Instead, I'd suggest you buy the Baby Bargains book by Denise and Alan Fields. They have two very young children and have actual experience with the products that they list in their book. Also, they are not biased toward any one type of store. They advise parents to shop around. I would rate the Fields book 5 stars and can't give more than 2 stars to Lipper's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too general for my purposes","review":"I found this book to be far too general for my purposes.

Oh, and the author has no kids!! Lol, 'nuff said. Don't waste your money. I own a used bookstore, that's how I stumbled across this gem. I just hope no inquiring customers ask me what I thought of it or it will be on my shelves forever. p.s. Did I mention this book is written for rich and/or stupid folks only? My favorite part is on page 85, where the author recommends combs (and I quote) \\"Tiffany's sells sterling silver sets for boys at $265 and for girls at $415.\\" Is this guy for real?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and helpful.","review":"This book was wonderful. We stumbled upon it while looking for consumer reports on baby strollers. As first time parents, we had really no idea what to look for in baby products.

I am a graphic designer and I needed to hone my Flash skills. This book and CD were perfect in explaining things that seemed a bit obscure. I also purchased the MX Bible, which is okay for reference, but not for learning the application. I highly recommend this book/CD.

Nobody can be good at everything, Doug. Also, I guess I must have put on own spin on the term 'virtual classroom', because I was expecting there to be 'lessons' that would lead me through a series of 'assignments' that would lead to the accomplishment of a certain task, the goal of the chapter. This is how teaching in a real classroom might happen, but not here - there are step-by-step instructions for performing tasks, but they do not lead to any final goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh-hummm","review":"Doug Sahlin's voice may put you to sleep on the CD-ROM.

There are many Flash MX books out there - skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you quickly.","review":"I'll admit, my first listen disappointed me. Every NUFAN fan knows that they've been progressing away from the aggressive vocal style that made most of us fall in love with them, and the latest album continues in that direction. It's hard to get past that on first or second listen, especially with some of the slightly stranger songs such as Divine Let Down, but with repeated plays you'll find that the melodies here have never been stronger, the songwriting is still top notch, and there's actually more fast stuff on here I believe than their last album or two. I'm confident that any No Use fan will grow to love this album; it may not be your favorite but it's still classic No Use For A Name."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars","review":"what happened to NUFAN? they got old, thats what. In my opinion this CD sucks. its boring, slow, and boring. There is no energy but into it. These guys used to be a good punk band, faster stuff and much better stuff has been made. Do not buy this album, unless you are a hardcore fan, and if you are a hardcore fan, chances are you wont buy it either cause it SUCKS! there is one good song on this CD, \\"there will be revenge\\" other than that this CD is bad. slow. boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this band but...","review":"This album [...]. Not sure what happened to NUFAN, but it's time to get back to your roots. This album starts off well but it's all down hill from there. I listened to it once, and it's never been back in the CD player. Remember Making Friends? Leche Con Carne? Daily Grind? This album is more like New Found Glory or Simple Plan. Just because they're \\"maturing\\", doesn't mean they have to write radio friendly pop [...]. I'm sure the lyrics are inspiring, thought provoking, embolden, etc., but if you can't get passed the music, you can't get into it.

No Use have done absolutely nothing new since \\"More Betterness\\" came out almost 8 years ago. This sounds exactly like \\"Hard Rock Bottom\\" with the same formulaic hooks, riffs, and vocals. They've totally lost the edginess they used to have, and have settled into a rut of boring recycled music. NUFAN used to be one of the few \\"punk\\" bands that I liked, because they were different than most of the carbon-copy punk bands that had flooded the scene, but now it seems they've run out of ideas. There's no emotion or feeling anymore, it's as if they're writing these songs to appease the general public and gain radio airplay. I just can't get into this album like I got into their older stuff, who knows, maybe it's just me.

The directing and lighting is abysmal.I have no idea why a credible studio would spend a nickle getting this film made.Thank goodness when I got this movie at Gamestop in 2007, I only spent $2-bucks and it skipped in between a few scenes (which I didn't care because I couldn't wait til it was over).Buy this movie at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.....","review":"This was awful!

Not a clue as to what the problem might be or how to reset or disable it. You have to unplug the device and remove the batteries to reset it and it comes back again within hours. The customer service was no help. All they said was that I would have to send the radio in to them to have it repaired. A brand new radio just out of the box? I don't think so.

It occurs frequently -- day or night -- with no apparent trigger or cause. The standard alarm feature is difficult to set.I made the mistake of throwing out all of the original packaging and paperwork or I would have returned this product for a refund. This radio is NOT user friendly. Very disappointing performance from First Alert, a company that usually offers a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This product is almost everything that I have wanted in a weather radio. It allows to granularly select what type of alarms that you do not want to receive or not. For example, I live on a hill, so I do not care to be woke up in the middle of the night for a flood warning (recently happened and I slept right through it). This unit uses S.A.M.E. technology so I set it for my quadrant of the county and the corresponding quadrant of the surrounding county, which is where I live. Seems to work great.Only issue that I have found with this unit is that it does not seem to set the time with the atomic clock (saw this issue in another review). It sits right next to a clock radio that receives a signal every night and yet this unit does not get the update.

This book is simply a rehash of a theory based on wolf packs. The problem with this is that dogs are not wolves, although they share some of the same characteristics, and we, humans, are not dogs. Dogs recognize this difference between us and them, although the author does not seem to. She seems to apply the same solution to every single problem, barring physical illness or injury, that a dog could have. Her writing is not the best, and her editor wasn't as helpful as she could have been. Save your money and invest in one of Karen Pryor's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogs are not horses","review":"I ordered this book as I've always had horses and was impressed that the author fashioned her training model after Monty Roberts the Horse Whisperer. The first thing she tells you to do is totally ignore your dog. Sorry, that wasn't going to happen. I'd rather teach my dog how to interact with me appropriately and highly reinforce them for wanting to interact with me.As a motivational trainer who is always trying to build and maintain a positive relationship with my dogs I quickly realized how damaging her methods can be. They will certainly work with horses and maybe dogs if you keep a large pack of them like she and Cesar do, but if you are an average dog owner who wants a close relationship with your dog/dogs, especially if you compete in any dog sports, I would recommend anything by Dr. Ian Dunbar, Suzanne Clothier, Pam Dennison, Leslie McDevitt, Jean Donaldson, Karen Pryor, Pat Miller, and Dr. Sophia Yin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Best Book about Understanding Your Dog!!!","review":"I have read this book in a couple of days and was just blown away by our ingorance of the fact that dogs evolved from wolves. Mrs Fennell starts each chapter with a short story of a behaviour between wolves in the wild and how the alpha wolf will correct unwanted behaviour.

The actual informational content can be boiled down to 2 tips: eat a bite from your dog's bowl before you feed it, and don't pay attention to your dog right after you come home. The rest of the 300+ pages describes in nebulous descriptions how great the author is and how she solved dog problems by her mere presence and greatness. The author plows through multiple examples of dog problems and that they were solved, but without providing any details that are usable to the reader. The author boasts about getting her inspiration from a well known horse trainer. The author is a self-proclaimed equivalent in the dog training world.

The puppy chewed alot while I was gone and they both would always be waiting for me at the door when I got home. Which made it hard to get in the house. I noticed a difference after one day of the methods in this book. And after a week, the dogs no longer are at the door when I get home! My small son and I can walk in no problem. The dogs are also relaxed the majority of the day. I never thought a training method without some kind of force worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Worthwhile","review":"There are so many dog training books out there -- it is refreshing to find one with a really positive approach. It reminds me of another favorite, \\"Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name,\\" by Vicki Hearne. Combining animal training with philosophy and literary criticism, it offers excellent insight into how animals communicate and respond to humans. The Atlantic Monthly called it \\"A fascinating and often surprising discussion of animal-human encounters.\\" If you are an animal trainer-- or even just an animal lover-- it's definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science","review":"Although her training techniques are loosely based on operant conditioning and positive training, Jan Fennell has little true knowledge of why and how this kind of training works. She also operates from the presumption that all bad behavior stems from dominance issues. This leads her to state some rather outrageous opinions as fact and to devise some very silly training exercise for things that can be accomplished much more easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dog Listener","review":"Of all the dog books I have read, and I have read a lot, this one gave me a new understanding on dogs and how to be a confident and loving owner. Jan Fennell shares her experiences from beginning to end. Jan's training techniques are great in the sense a dog wants to do what you want and not what it is made to do. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary methods have changed my house!","review":"I came home from work one day and my wife was excited to see me as she said, \\"come look at this.\\" She called our dog, a seven year old Westie, into his area where he is always reluctant to go. But this day he walked right in without making a scene. She told me she had seen Jan Fennell on television that day and had simply tried one of the concepts she talked about. We got the book, and immediately our Westie has settled right in to our new pecking order, and has significantly settled down.We are more than impressed with the insight that this book gives. It has greatly improved our relationship with our dogs, and I would recommend this book to any dog owners. Understanding the canine culture is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dog Listener","review":"This book is well written and easy to understand. The frequent referance to wolf pack mentality is right on. I have watched PBS documentaries on wolf packs and observed my own two dogs and the behavioral similarity is astounding. I think Jan has nailed it with this book. I'm presently applying the techniques Jan has developed to my dogs and the results are as predicted. I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to gain control of their dog and to those who want to start out right with their new puppy.

Ms. Fennell presents both scientific and practical information/advice in an easy to read/understand style. Applying her guidelines in training not only works, the resulting relationship between dog and companion is comfortable and stable for both. She is, however, very stern in admonishing the reader to realize her training method requires serious commitment and constancy from the human in the equation.

Now we can enjoy our visit rather than just struggling through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"height of stupidity","review":"This is really an idiot's delight when it comes to dog training. The author proposes such amusing training techniques as climbing in and out of your window and chewing your dog's food before feeding it to the dog and it's all based on the author's absurd notion of instinctual canine behavoir - as if she has a clue. There are much, much better and far more rational books for dog owners beset by difficult dogs than this including another book with the same title.When you get right down to it, the best way to cope with sharing your life with a dog is to be very careful in selecting the breed, gender and temperment that's appropriate for your life style. All of these factors can and should be considered before adopting a dog but mimicking alpha wolf behavoir as the author feels she alone understands it, will only leave the dog owner feeling like an idiot while your dog is either bemused or freaked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in the condition of the book.

This book changed my relationship with my dogs in less than a week.I have had dogs all my life and surely thought I understood them well enough.

With this I disagree, but if you can look beyond that impossible to live up to tagline(Bryan Adams, anyone!) then you will certainly enjoy this disc. Velvet Underground meets the Stooges in an analog space-rock kinda thing. The songs start off with great, quirky pop then stretch out into creative jams that aren't HIPPYISH in the least(maybe a little acid, but who's counting).

The opening track can give you chills; one of my favourites from the album. \\"Take Me Home\\" starts out with some brilliant instrumentals - soooo 70s disco! There is a bit too much of Cher talking in between tracks, some of which exposes her somewhat arrogant attitude a bit much, but I still love her. With less talk, they could have thrown in a couple more songs. The attitude is what makes some love her more, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great Live album should be","review":"Cher's Live: Farewell Tour album is an excellent rendering of her tour. It gives you all the meat, without the extraneous - you get the songs, and her on-stage banter without extended pauses or applauses. It also doesn't feature all of the extended dance portions that were used to give her time to change costumes - but then again it would make it a 2 CD set if you did. Cher on tour is amazing, and being able to relive the concert is fantastic. The big songs are here, from her latest album on back to the 60's and 70's. It's a must have album for any Cher fan. The sound quality is excellent. It would have been nice for the liner notes to give us more of those Cher costumes - she uses enough in her concert that it's a shame we didn't get more of them in the album. But that's a small quibble in this tribute to one of the great divas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD I ever bought of the greatest Diva on the world","review":"Hi, I am Ralf from Germany.

My sister has the very same Dell that I have except I have more ram on mine. Hers works fine, but my adapter forces me to the BSD's.

I'm going to uninstall it tonight and try that way.So if you buy this with a dell product use the xp version, the cd seems to be screwing things up.

I use the laptop for making simple spreadsheets and e-mail, so cutting edge tech was not needed.Did not want a PC Card because I travel a lot and having something stick out the side when inside a bag is an annoyance.Plugged it in and used it all night the first time to do research on the Web -- no complaints!

The box comes with v. 1.1, which I never bothered with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pain to Configure","review":"The adapter itself works reasonably well on XP, but I found it nearly impossible to configure the software that came with it. I even tried it on different varieties of Windowws. Only XP was able to handle it. Netgear could have done a better job with the accompanying software. But once you get over the initial configuration in XP, the adapter works fine. I don't recommend it for any other operating system though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent USB Adapter for Money","review":"The MA111 works pretty well most of the time. As long as you get version 2.0 of the drivers from Netgear's website, it works well in Win XP Pro. Also - I got it working with my Mac PowerBook G4. I found some instructions on how to modify D-Link's OS X drivers to work with the MA111, and it works great!My only complaints - gets very warm. When I plugged it into my HP running Win 2000 Pro, it shut down my PC. Literally. Just all shut off as if the power had been pulled. It might be my PC though, I don't want to be quick to blame Netgear. Last complaint, is that the speed is usually at 2 Mbps, not 11. However, it goes to 11 when I am using it to transmit data, so I am not sure 2 Mbps is just a mode it goes to when doing nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not work with Windows 98","review":"Despite what is said above and in the manufacturer's literature, this device does not always work with Windows 98, as one of the Netgear techs admitted to me after hours of effort (not to mention the time waiting to get to a tech). Nor does downloading the most recent version of the software--which is what the level 2 tech advises--help. Caveat emptor: Windows 98 users should think twice before buying this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for TiVo, but has relatively short range","review":"I've used my MA111 (v.1) with a Tivo for over a year now with absolutely no glitches. The TiVo instantly detected iand configured it without a problem. Given that it has been turned on and connected 24/7 for over a year, I'd say this is quite a sturdy adapter. My only gripe is that, like most 802.11b devices, it has a relatively short range. Mine is about 30 feet and two walls from the wireless router, and gets only 30-50 percent signal strength. Other than that, this adapter is perfect for TiVo (just make sure you get the right version, since v.2 is not TiVo compatible)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Linux.","review":"The product information makes no distinction between the old \\"v1\\" of the product and the new \\"v2\\" which is shipped by Amazon.The new version uses an entirely different set of drivers, and will not yet work with Linux.I was extremely disappointed to receive this as a gift, only to find that the new version will not work with my laptop system, while the older version could have done the job quite easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as promised","review":"I installed the CD, and I couldn't get the wireless connection to happen at all, much less have problems after it.

It ONLY works under Windows.

My MA111 is a pain in the back. Bought it after better experience with a MA101 but could not buy another MA101 - so I bought the first available one from my local store without looking at reviews. What a mistake!First my Win XP machine started rebooting time after time. After I upgraded the driver of the MA111 from 1.1 to 2.0 the machine is no longer crashing uncontrolled but I get breakdowns of the wireless conection by the dozen a working day. Intollerable!

Having been a victim of exactly the time period which the \\"writer\\" expounds on, I have long ago stuck my nose in just about every publicaton I could read that was pertinent to the subject of Hitler .

I'm really not a history buff but I have to say I was surprised at how much I loved Last Stop Vienna - and I learned an incredible amount. I couldn't stop reading it and, instead of skipping over the historical descriptions as I usually do, I was truly fascinated by Nagorski's ability to write so clearly and incisively, that I had a blast reading all of it! Of course, I relished the love affairs and love triangles and all the intrigue...especially when it came to Hitler's own perversions that I didn't know much about before!

It does not quite measure up to my favorite Phillip Glass compositions, but nevertheless I listen to Symphony No 2 often.There are three works on this recording; Symphony No. 2, Interlude from Orphee, and Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra. It is the namesake Symphony which is the jewel of this collection. It is typical of Glass' best work. A simple theme is repeated, varied, and experimented with. The result is hauntingly powerful. The theme's beauty holds the piece together.The other pieces are not as good, but still enjoyable listening. If like I, you are a Glass fan, you will like this CD.

This is a cheap plastic product, that while the noise and arc will definitely scare a potential attacker, it is not up to standard. The belt clip is plastic that is secured by one screw. It won't fit over my belt and if you were to simply use the belt clip to slide over your pants or bluejeans, that would work, but if you did anything but pull the unit straight up, e.g. pulled it at an angle from your body, the plastic clip would snap. The wrist strap is not a detachable safety item as other units I have seen are not able to be used if they are detached from the wrist strap thus preventing an attacker from taking the unit away from you and then using it against you.

I have bought many pads over the years. Sore lower back or twisted knee, heat after ice is a blessing. But most heating pads are actually a plastic 'shell' with a cloth cover. The cover snaps off and can be washed. And it usually gets lose and annoying overtime. Not so with this unit. This heating pad is one piece and a plug. It is made like a heating blanket. You unplug it and can wash the whole thing on the gentle cycle. To top it off I have been using this heating pad for 1 to 2 hours a day for the last three months solid. (I hurt my shoulder.) I burned out two other heating pads (my old one and a new one) in the month before I purchased this one. Pretty awesome! I will be buying another- if this one gives up the ghost.

The \\"high heat\\" light flashed on and off (as it does when it auto-shut off after two hours), and unplugging/plugging it back in did not fix the issue. Removing the cord, and re-inserting it did not fix the issue. My guess is there is something wrong in the wiring that is sending a signal that the unit is overheated and has forced an automatic shutoff. While it was a good heating pad, it only worked for 3-4 months before breaking.

I found myself referring back to the maps in the previous sections to get an appreciation for what was happening in the other sectors.

Vogee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries are frequently dead from the start","review":"We have five dogs and three bark collars which use these batteries. I have never purchased from Amazon but from several different local stores and more than half the time the batteries are dead when I open the package or very soon after the are installed. The fault is with the manufacturer or their supply chain, not with Amazon. We also have a Trainwell collar which uses different batteries and have never had any trouble with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all control collars","review":"Amazon has this in a discount combination with the PetSafe Large Dog Control Collar. But it used different batteries. And because they are flagged as containing a flammable material, they can't be returned. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"First, let me state that I love the Safepet wireless fence. We have been using them on our three dogs for the last fifteen years. Ours are big dogs and we live in the country where we dont want them chasing deer. The collars work great. I highly recommend them to everyone, whether they live in the city or country.But the new batteries are a different story. Like I said, we have been using the collars for the last fifteen years. They dont wear out. They have been handed down for pet to pet. But our collars are of the old type and these batteries are not made for the old style collar.So before you order, check your collar to see if they are the right type. I did not check, now I have to go through the motions of returning the items. Luckily, I did not open the package.I guess I will have to continue to buy the medical batteries that fit the collar and remember to replace them each month. BUT STILL LOVE THE COLLARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't order with other items","review":"don't waste your money ordering this with other items.

We're a family with 3 small children and what could round us out more? What we didn't realize was that the sneaky neighbor cat liked to use the \\"doggie door\\" on cold January nights. So, we purchase an electronic doggie door to keep said \\"sneaky neighbor cat\\" OUT! We install it and realize that the door wasn't working properly. We called customer service and they sent us a replacement door with very few questions asked. Installed the new door and for some reason the door doesn't like to unlock until the \\"key\\" is RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR and even then, it has to be positioned a certain way to work.

By \\"nearly dead\\", I mean that they worked for 3-5 days before dying completely.I have also purchased them in the store (Home Depot and Petsmart) with varied results. Sometimes they are fully charged and work for 3-6 months; other times, I get only a few days or weeks. This is a huge problem since stores are reluctant to allow you to return batteries.In addition to failing to address the quality control issue, PetSafe does nothing to help you avoid buying expired batteries. There is no date on the package and no stated shelf life. This means that the stores have no way of knowing when the product has gone bad, and the consumer has no way of knowing if they're buying a defective/expired product that they won't be able to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This batteries are easy to used, not tu expensive and in my case it works like a 6 to 7 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"short of battery life","review":"Their genius wireless fencing system allows for a new battery type that I cannot purchase in bulk on the internet. I am writing about the battery itself; not the elaborate plastic screw-in system. The main complaint is that the batteries never last the six months as advertised. This alone accounts for fraud in that the battteries last on average 2 to 3 months, if ever that long. PetSafe sees themselves as an HP printer company, making their profits on ink in HP's case, and non-enduring batteries in the PetSafe case. It is sad to see such great inventions dirtied by off-setting devious and untrue testimonials. Amazon should be more careful of product claims.If you tell me my Standard Schnauzer continually test the boundary line, I will tell you this is nonsense. He is smarter than his Master and PetSafe in this matter, and continually shows how he remembers his first sting many years ago when he was young, I was younger, batteries were inexpensive, and PetSafe was most honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item","review":"This was recommended by amazon as the battery for a collar i bought and it was the wrong item, also expired 2 weeks after i got it... not worth the shipping to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor battery life","review":"Batteries lasted 2 days.

I've come to understand that it's not a problem with the batteries (in most cases) but the shock collar box.

This is basically the REM we have heard now on the last 3 albums (Reveal had a few moments but not many).Has Michael Stipe gone solo and not told us? This album starts off pretty nicely with the first 3 songs. Then, your grandfather's REM kicks in with eight Up-ish lullabies. While Stipe's voice is still strong and beautiful after all these years, it simply can't carry 3 albums in a row like REM would like us to believe.

I don't own this CD, but I have heard that it's a miserable flop. I am really not suprised, because none of their albums since 1992's AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE have really sold. Avoid this at all costs. If you want an insight of REM's entire career with Warner Bros from 1988-2003, buy IN TIME. It contains some post-AUTOMATIC songs, but they are not bad.

There is a beauty to many of the songs on AOS, but I cannot help myself from pointing my mouse to something more interesting in my iTunes library.This record is much better than Up and more consistent than Reveal, but I find Reveal's gems to be more interesting that the songs on this album. Aside from Ascent of Man, I don't think there's anything too memorable on this cd.My friend Seaweed made the comment that REM has produced a number of great songs since Automatic for the People; the problem is that they've produced five albums since then, so the great ones have been drowned out by all the mediocre stuff. I tend to agree. There is some good stuff on AOS, just as Reveal, Up, New Adventures, and Monster had some good songs, but there has been more misses that hits.All in all, these guys are slowly putting me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"My New Coaster","review":"As a long time fan of REM(last album is an exception) I went out the day it came in stores to get my grubby little hands on their new album I unwrapped the plastic and carefully slid it in the cd player.My initial reaction from the title track was ok this song is not great but its ok lets listen to the other songs........by the time I was done I knew I had bought pure and beautiful CRAP!!!!!!How could I waste my time on such a wretched and horrid cd.micheal stipe wines throughout the songs with mediocre intrumentation and off beat drums sometimes when u skip to the next song its like a b movie where u thought u killed the evil creature yet its been resurrected from the abyss.Being as I am very tight with money i couldnt throw it away so I have made myself a new coaster thanks to REM for making coasters that were supposed to sound like music....I wouldnt even rate it but alas it goes no lower then one I hope U2's new album isnt this trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful spaced-aged adult contemporary uber-hipness gone wrong","review":"Never have Stipey's lyrics been so obvious and/or clumsy, the instrumentation...errr, music could've been lifted from Amy Grant's next next album. \\"around the sun\\" is frightening in its ability to remind folks like me who, at age 16 bought Chronic Town, that age so often equals loss: too bad R.E.M. has lost it and forgot to record it as it left."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Gives?","review":"I don't know what it is that people like about REM that they feel is lacking in this album. I've seen it described in print as \\"boring,\\" and \\"largely hook-less,\\" and other generally uncomplimentary terms in a similar vein. I strongly disagree. I think this is REM doing what they have always done, which is to marry probing, insightful lyrics with brilliant melodies and heart-ache-inducing, otherworldly harmonies. Pop music excellence. For the record, I also loved \\"Monster\\" and basically everything else they have ever written, and I would probably love \\"Michael Stipe Reads the Phone Book\\" if they ever released it, so you can take that for what it's worth.

The opening track and big hit \\"Leaving New York\\" is the perfect opener and obviously one of the stand-outs, but the high standards continues throughout the album - at least until track 9 \\"Aftermath\\", which was also a minor single-hit.There is a nice mixture of fine ballads like \\"Make it Easy on Me\\", \\"I Wanted to be Wrong\\" and \\"Boy in the Well\\", and more upbeat and catchy songs like \\"Aftermath\\" and \\"The Outsiders\\" - both songs all-time R.E.M. favourites of mine.The two other singles \\"Electron Blue\\" and \\"Wanderlust\\" are also great tracks - and generally it's a nice album in the easily recognizable R.E.M. style."},{"rating":"2","title":"First impressions","review":"This album starts off with each track being really good, then goes downhill, then gets a little better towards the end.

Reveal had more life to it than either Up or Around the Sun and seemed to have more inspired arrangements. REM is at its best with louder, richer layers of music than the introspective piano tinkling meanderings that dominate this one.A lamb without a rack?(Stipe needs to do an album with Adam Duritz from Counting Crows, and title it: BLAH...(Bad Lyricists Anonymous Here))"},{"rating":"1","title":"R.E.M.

It's really not as average as I originally thought. \\"Leaving New York\\" is a really good song, and \\"Electron Blue\\" and \\"I Wanted To Be Wrong\\" really caught my ear this time.

This is actually an album of 13 beautiful, strong, delicate and mature songs that will take you from the beautiful Leaving New York to the electrizing Electron Blue, the psychodelic The Outsiders and so on. It is definitly a different album from the rest of R.E.M. discography, with its own spirit. For those who have compare Around The Sun with Reveal and Up, you have to listen it again and feel the real essence of the album. Personally, Electron Blue, Leaving New York, Final Straw, The Outsiders and Wanderlust top the album, but in each track you will find beautiful sounds, strongs and maybe strange lyrics, you know what I mean if you have listened Automatic For The People, Monster, Reveal, Up, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"they are lost...and irrelevant","review":"REM, lets face it have not put out a good album since they became a threesome.

When I first listen to the CD I thought I had the wrog one because there is no way this CD is in the Rock Genre. Unless I have been listening to the wrong things then I find this band to be sadly mistaken for something its not. The songs all sound exactly the same, you can't understand the lyrics, the singing isn't very good, and it reminds me of the days I had to go to church and sit their listening to spiritual but sucky music (sorry whoever I offended).

Early albums such as \\"Murmur\\" are also considered a classic. Since \\"Automatic\\" this band (for reasons I don't know) has hit the skids with very average music from \\"Monster\\" in 1994 to \\"Reveal\\" in 2001. The albums are OK but lack the clever, hook-oriented 1960's rock or groove that made R.E.M. famous and in my view the greatest American band of the modern (music) era. \\"Around The Sun\\" has one brilliant moment...the single \\"Leaving New York\\" one of R.E.M.'s greatest singles. But the rest of the album is flat. I can't even listen to these songs they're so dull.

I've adored them since Murmur (I know that might sort of disqualify me since it's not since Chronic Town) and have loved at least several songs from every album (I date myself!) and CD, even Monster, even Reveal, which several critics on this site have compared to Around the Sun. I even gave one reviewer the benefit of the doubt and listened to it several times before reaching the agonizing conclusion that it really just completely blows. Never have I heard an REM recording that was so completely forgettable from start to finish. With the exception of Leaving New York, whose hooks I can call to mind if I want, I still, after five or six listenings, can't recall a single note from a single other song on this CD. And that's really sad, and something I NEVER thought I would be able to bring myself to say about anything REM ever did. Nor did I think I'd ever say this: REM, you're finally All Washed Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mature Album","review":"This is one of the best cds I heard all year. R.E.M. is a great band, just because they change their style doesn't mean its bad. The songs are very well written and have some deep messages in them. I just saw them live at the fleet center and they put on a hell of a show so go see them live also. Favorite songs are Leaving New York, The Outsiders, Boy in the Well, High Speed Train, and Around the Sun. I was doubtfull at first but I really enjoyed it. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"First of all I love REM. Second I dont hate REM b/c they dont have a drummer anymore. And no, they dont need to be rocking like they did in the 80's or need to make another poppy Automatic for the People. However...they still needed to make a better album. If you want to hear a GREAT non-rocking REM album - get \\"UP\\" instead of this one. The album starts off well for the first 3 songs...and goes downhill fast.

That is how good the most recent album by one of the world's best bands feels. As good as their classic (and my personal favorite) 'Automatic for the People'. From the early chords in \\"Leaving New York\\", 'Around the Sun' is one great track after another, where the band delivers a sound as clear and appealing as it ever has.Not targetting the young adult or the new generation in any particular way, the trio from Athens, GA set out to just write some fine music blending in a good deal of folk, a tad of pop, and a dose of electronica here and there. Wilco fans may enjoy the sound at times, but make no mistake: this is R.E.M. every step of the way. As for the lyrics, nothing to miss from the band's classic works.My favorites: the opening track, \\"The Boy In The Well\\", \\"The Worst Joke Ever\\" and the title track. Overall, a solid production and a very much awaited comeback. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work!","review":"First of all, I disagree with Amazon's reviewer in that \\"Monster\\" was \\"pointlessly noisy\\" and \\"Up\\" was \\"dull.\\" Actually, both are very different and very good albums.Now on to \\"Around the Sun:\\"It's an excellent work, and again quite different from its predecessors.The only caveat or slight complaint is that it doesn't include any \\"rocking\\" numbers -- while I don't think it would put people to sleep, as somebody else suggested, I will agree that the whole album is on the very mellow side.So that's it for me -- go get the CD without any hesitation!This album proves that REM is one of the most talented bands around. I hope they continue producing this level of quality many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but could use a little spice","review":"Some of the songs are wonderful, but the overall assessment that the album is too consistently mid-tempo is valid. However, if you mix in a couple of the tracks from last year's \\"In Time\\" (the new songs, \\"Animal,\\" \\"Bad Day,\\" maybe even \\"All the Right Friends\\"), it adds just the right amount of hooky zip that we all used to love about R.E.M. Maybe not the album they envisioned, but then the last few records haven't really been the albums we've envisioned, either.\\"Leaving New York,\\" \\"Aftermath,\\" and \\"I Wanted to be Wrong\\" are all worth the price of the album, though.

Up was OK but had too much filler. Reveal, however was much better than Up and I consider that the best of their trio era. So when I bought Around the Sun, I was a bit skeptical because I thought I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did Reveal. And while not their best album, it's certainly not their worst either (Monster gets that title in my opinion). The album opens up with \\"Leaving New York\\", which is a beautiful opener to say the least. Other decent to solid tracks include \\"Final Straw\\", \\"I Wanted to Be Wrong\\", \\"Aftermath\\" the title track and my personal favorite track off the album \\"Boy in the Well\\". Though it does lose some steam towards the end (I couldn't really get into \\"Wanderlust\\" or \\"The Ascent of Man\\"), Around the Sun is still a solid album that most R.E.M. fans can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan for Life","review":"I'm a cactus trying to be a canoe (me too). What a great line! I am the same age as Michael Stipe and have been familiar with the band since they started recording but didn't buy one of their albums until Up. I really wanted to see how they would cope with carrying on as a trio. I liked Up but didn't like Reveal as much. However, I am really enjoying Around the Sun, and consequently am ready to add the band to my list of \\"must buy\\" artists. I am also ready to explore their back catalog. Around the Sun is full of simple and subtle musical charms, and Michael Stipe's voice and lyrics are well suited to them.

I was once a purist, but I have come to really enjoy the group's transformations over the last 10 years (I disagree with evaluations that mark their highpoint at *Automatic* and downplay later innovations). But my god, this new album is something I could not have imagined from the group: a bland, uninteresting, soul-lessly overproduced snooze-fest. Pay careful attention to those reviews that note the album's \\"polish\\" and prepare yourself to hear the sounds of Buck and Mills (and perhaps Stipe himself) mixed out of existence. This could be Stipe with any old band-for-hire, and its total lack of edge or texture makes it perfect waiting-room music. Now, REM gets to make a mistake now and then, so no problem; but let's not say this is a good album. It's the sound of something good going very -- and let's hope temporarily -- wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"still good in Rockville","review":"an impressive collection of slowrockin' songs that hark back to the more acoustic days. I still miss Bill Berry and his influence on this band, but I suppose they are doing what they can as a trio.I believe that playing smaller venues and competing against so many great bands is helping them strive harder with each new release. This effectively combats the \\"multi-millionaire syndrome\\" of complacency that hits so many (like The Stones).While I love this direction of ballads and softer songs, I find it curious that their association with the likes of Radiohead has not pushed them into an even more experimental direction.Either way, as long as they continue to produce good music, I'll continue to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice release but NOT vintage R.E.M.","review":"Those of you expecting a return to roots, a la U2's 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', will be disappointed.

You can make a decent slow and quiet album, in fact R.E.M. already did with \\"Up.\\" No, the problem with \\"Around the Sun\\" is that the material is weak.Michael Stipe has a harder time than ever coming up with vocal melodies and Peter Buck just doesn't sound very interested. If a song isn't necessarily awkward, as is the case with the first single \\"Leaving New York,\\" then it's the musical equivalent of blank, white paper, barely registering as anything resembling stirring music.It's no wonder this is the last R.E.M. album produced by Pat McCarthy. He steered the band right into a brick wall with this one. Weak songs coupled with a yawner of a production job just doesn't yield many dividends over repeated listens. At least it didn't with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the entire new direction","review":"This is not R.E.M. of 1985 nor should we expect them to be.

If they have it lit on the dinner table, I have to blow it out and take it out of the room. I have no words to describe this scent other than NASTY!

Then Higgins sat down to force the thing into shape. Every page has the feeling of being forced. There is nothing here that is smooth, natural or even very insightful. Higgins is constantly saying 'I think that is funny' as though her opinion could be worth anything at all. She has to think that in order to fulfill her contract. And who cares about her mental state anyway? The only proof that something is funny is that people find it funny, perhaps. But Higgins is an interested party, so her opinion is irrelevant.

Those seeking in-depth study should be forewarned, the texts are not annotated at all...even difficult words have to be looked up in the glossary in the back. The typical scholarly introductory materials found in the preface and apendices is largely absent. And to top it off, the type is printed in a dark gray ink, instead of black: not that easy to read.

However, I found this book lacking in a couple of areas. For one, there is not a comprehensive troubleshooting section. Troubleshooting steps are given for a few systems, but this book is written only for service, so you have to know what is wrong and what part of the motor to work on before this book is useful. Also, much of the engine terminology is not defined, so again you need some experience with this before you start. Once you get past these hurdles, this manual is very detailed, with plenty of good pictures showing key steps in the repair proceedures.

The story is beautiful and as a christian I have no problems reading it to my children as a fantasy rendition. The illustration of evil regimes and quest for freedom is very moving and uncanny in many ways. Worth reading for this alone, but the ending speaks a message that should never have been spoken.

In ways resembling recent wars and tyrants.It is a book ful of morals and lessons. They are not slapped into the readers face or overexplained but they are there and an innocent child can relate to them.The lesson of the book is to do the right thing always, no matter the risk and several more lessons besides.

It is not wonder that the average handicap hasn't gone down in 30 years even with manicured greens, state of the art instruction and better equipment. This book takes the swing apart and separates it into a two plane swing and a one plane swing. It us up to the reader to figure out which one to use. I can bet that many readers will vacilate in indecision. There are just too many things that Hardy has the reader think about even in the so called \\"easier\\" one plane swing.It is human nature to take a watch apart to see what makes it tick, but taking a swing apart is foolish.

Sometimes a quick look at them before going to the course gives me a mental model to carry with me.Two other annoyances. First, there is a copyright notice at the beginning of every chapter.

I read Jim Hardy's article in Golf Digest about the one plane/two plane theory and thought I was more of a two planer. I decided to buy the book and after studying my swing with a video camera, I realized I was more of a one plane swinger. I won't tell you that it instantly transformed my game, but within roughly six weeks after reading the book and hours on the driving range, I had the best round of my life two weeks ago!The book is a fast read and I go back and reread it all of the time. It helped me reduce the swing thoughts to a bare minimum and simplify my swing. Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Golf Professional by trade.","review":"This very well could be the holy grail. A golf swing fundamental breakthough in thinking. Jim Hardy's extensive passion and reasearch shows. This will simplify the game for golfers of any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compliment to Hogans 5 fundamentals","review":"I must admit that as I read this book I began to realize that Ben Hogan was only 90 percent correct. As a 50 year old golfer with a life time of bad techniques there was no way I could swing the club like a person in great shape who is flexible and doesn't have so many bad habits. I have always used a 2 plane swing and didn't realize it until now. I'm glad I bought this book together with Ben Hogan's book because it allows me to make the slight adjustments to my grip and stance that will provide me with the final answer to a consistent golf swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is the first book detailing Jim Hardy's one plane swing. It can easily be read in an afternoon, and discusses the fundamental differences between the one plane and two plane swings. This book is rather basic and covers the fundamentals including grip, stance, and posture . . . I would strongly recommend looking into the second book in this series (Master Class) as it goes into more detail and has a whole chapter on drills."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the Plane Truth","review":"I believe that Jim Hardy is deinately on to something here. I always struggled with golf instruction - some tips worked like a charm while others didn't seem like they belonged at all. Now I know why - I am a one planer and alot of insruction is based around the two plane swing. I now recognize the differences and can concentrate only on things that will \\"fit\\" my swing type. My improvement is progressing very nicely now. With all the conflicting instruction out there - you owe it to yourself to read this book or get the DVD's and get working on the right swing for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best golf book EVER!!!!","review":"If you are already a golfer, this is the best golf book ever written! It cuts through all the information out there, and lets you focus on what is right for you. I am a \\"two plane\\" swinger, I gave the book to my playing partner, who is a \\"one plane\\" swinger. He says its the best golf book he has ever seen. I look at all the information in the golf magazines, and I can immediately tell what is right for me, and what to ignore, and I am ten times more confident every time I tee it up. I have bought four copies for friends, and am loaning my copy to another friend tomorrow. If I ever meet Mr. Hardy, no I won't kiss him, but I will buy him the best bottle of wine I can find, and shake his hand about one thousand times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my gosh, it works","review":"Halfway throught the third chapter I went to the driving range to try out some his recommendations. My drives were perfectly straight and 25 yards further than I have ever hit. While reading the book it took me a while to realize that I had a one plane swing. It wasn't until I saw in my mind's eye what he as describing that I understood. I made the adjustments to my stance and the results were impressive. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I shouldn't have to write more than the title to do this rating ... and won't rate things in the future because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"I found this little gem in a big box of obscure cds that the local community radio station was selling at an Earth Day celebration. Intrigued by the funny liner notes and the price (it was a dollar), I bought it knowing nothing about the band and was pleasantly surprised. Strong melodies, inspired guitar work, and an energetic vibe makes this album fun to listen to and instantly likable.

The chapter on forms does not explain how to integrate the form with a database, giving the excuse to see a later chapter. The later chapter on databases then states that most database features are out of scope of the book. How about starting with some basic coverage of how to setup Frontpage 2003 to work with sharepoint team services? If you don't do it right, you simply get an error message from Frontpage stating that these features don't work because one has to have a server. I got the distinct impression that the authors have never really used Frontpage 2003, wrote most of the content based on earlier versions of Frontpage, and relied too much on Microsoft's skimpy Frontpage 2003 documentation for the new features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"This book is too complicated for someone that just wants to get started with Frontpage."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative, interesting quick review","review":"I enjoyed reading and looking at this very concise and easy to follow atlas.

This film is a cash in of the worst kind. The wit, humor, and subtle references of the original series was completely missing. All you get is a series of clichéd appearances by all the old characters loosely connected with a re-hashed plot.Save your money. Enjoy the original, forget about this cash in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring FUTURAMA back!","review":"A better plot than most movies with all the sick humor made me a fan at 1st. It only lacks a full nude shot of Leila."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I am a big Futurama fan...of the TV show.This \\"movie\\" looks like Futurama and sounds like Futurama. The formula is right, but it is just not funny. Not at all. It's tedious and self-indulgent. It even includes a special feature by the poster child of tedious and self-indulgent: the global warming huckster Al Gore (who wasn't elected President because he couldn't carry his home state: Tennessee).The show is great (even when Bender's robot friend Algore is on it) but this movie is just terrible. I spent $1 renting it and consider it a wasted dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama is back, baby!","review":"The series finally returns with a 90 minute movie/episode thingy of goodness. With classic moments from all the PlanEx crew (Zoidberg is still the best), lots of throwbacks to old episodes with plenty of inside jokes, some musical numbers and a clever time travel plot, this one has it all.Don't listen to people who claim to be fans of the series yet dislike this movie, they've obviously gone stupid with old age (no offense fogeys).If you loved Futurama, just buy this already, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOUR A FAN OF THE SHOW DON'T BUY THIS!!","review":"This can't be the same writters from the TV show. It's not witty or even funny. The writing is very lazy. I loved the TV show and I didn't laugh once at this movie. The voices are the same and the animation is really good but the writters didn't get what was funny about the characters. I heard The Beast with a Billion Backs is worse but I can't imagine thats possible. I hope they make a good one but it doesn't look like these writters understand the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be renamed \\"Bender's Big Bore\\"","review":"Being a big Futurama fan, especially of the first 2 seasons, I was looking forward to some classic Futurama. I could not have been more wrong. This should be used as a textbook example of things you should not do when writing comedy for a series. Almost every line is a forced joke, and most of them are reused jokes from past episodes. Just about every character is brought back, unnaturally forced into the plot for reasons I can't understand. The plot is all over the place and has no flow. They dropped the ball, bigtime. I hate to say it, but this was actually worse than a Simpson's clipshow episode. Probably not even worth renting. There is a lot of extra content on the DVD, but I'm not even motivated to watch it, given how bad the movie was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great full length film","review":"Its unfortunately been far to long since there has been anything new for Futurama. This brings us the same wonderful humor that made the show great, and I fully recommend this. If only there were new shows now too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Point me to the nearest suicide booth...","review":"After about 10 minutes of uncomfortable silence, my friend and I simultaneously looked at each other and said \\"I can't watch this...\\" As HUGE Futurama fans, it was astonishing to watch our favorite show gasp and wheeze like a fish long out of water. The jokes fall flat, seemingly aimed at 9 year olds. The voice acting seems stilted and the timing is completely off. The orchestral score, which appears intended to give the DVD more of a cinematic feel, was completely out of place and overblown in proportion to the action on the screen. I hardly laughed once during the entire viewing. It was like some cheap knock-off of a show I once loved, with a complete lack of irreverence, visual humor and comedic timing that made the show so wonderful. It left me feeling angry, confused and in search of a suicide booth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite my shiny metal a**!","review":"Is this the best Futurama offering ever? No! However, as a fan who was left wanting more when the plug was unceremoniously pulled some 2 years ago, I'm ecstatic.

Remember when Family Guy was cancelled?"},{"rating":"2","title":"futurama review","review":"bender's big score was a long time coming, and it delivered. i thought the naked aliens scene with the \\"sprungers\\" was pretty classic. i think it was as good, or better than previous seasons...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bender's Big Score A Big Score For Futurama Fans","review":"Being a diehard Futurama fan, even a subpar movie would win me over. Luckily I got to experience what is 'Bender's Big Score'. It takes about twenty minutes for the movie to kick into hard drive, but once it does, it's like enjoying the original tv show episodes of this series, or 'Star Trek' for the first time (or the second, third or so-on if your a dialogue and freeze frame geek like myself). It has a lot of characters from old episodes giving brief appearences such as the computeresque god from 'godfellas' down to (in height anyways) Philip J Fry (Fry's nephew) from 'the luck of the fryrish'. If you like intelligent comedy you will like this. If you like sci-fi and you are into intelligent comedy you will simply love this. So sit down, get a 40 of some 'Olde Fortran Malt Liquor' and watch this movie, you will most definitely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hermies big scam","review":"We are such big futurama fans that we have all the seasons and watch them regularly (they are one of the few things we can agree on watching.)Surprisingly this was something we can agree on watching too, we both vowed NEVER AGAIN.This was bizzare and dreadful, the story is dry and confusing, the characters never do anything funny, exactly unlike the TV show. It has a couple of laugh out loud moments with Zoidberg, but you will really wish you didn't watch this. It's too bad the producers decided to sell out their great legacy for a cheap buck. Unless you are an 8 year old kid who signs onto Amazon to post 5 star reviews and has no powers of discrimination stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!?!?!","review":"This used to be such a great series! Like a zombie, what they reserrected was NOT what was laid to rest. If you're a fan of the show (or not) STAY AWAY from this abomination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Beast","review":"The Beast with a Billion Backs pales in comparison to Bender's Score. After having seen the Beast, I have a much deeper and pleased appreciation of Bender's Big Score. And if you just let yourself go into the story, DON'T analyze it, it's a very pleasant story line that will aim to please and even surprise a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama Good","review":"This is a good movie.

Again, it is good, but doesn't compete with some of the great episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was hoping for more...","review":"I was SO excited when I first heard about this new Futurama movie, but I have to say I was kinda disappointed.

Instead, we get a glorified clip show. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Laughs ?","review":"It just wasn't funny and having Bender brainwashed throughout most of the movie took away the words and antics of the best character. Also the plot of the movie was all over the place. They should have stuck to what has worked in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"It feels like the last episode of Seinfeld combined with the new Star Wars Midichlorians.Which is to say, self-referential humor to jokes that were funny years ago but fall completely flat if you don't remember them... combined with new characters you hate, a plot that's thin, and very little left remaining from the original formula that made you so happy in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bender's Big Letdown","review":"I expected much more from the restart of one of my all time favorite series; however, Bender's Big Score turned out to be a complete letdown. The story is slow and rather boring, the jokes don't hit, and the characters are strained, artificial versions of themselves. I'd like to chalk this up to rust, but given that this is supposed to be Futurama's big comeback, I just can't. It has none of the classic Futurama brand humor of \\"A Big Piece of Garbage\\", none of the well crafted feeling of \\"Jurassic Bark\\", and none of the originality of \\"The Sting\\".Not funny, not touching, not Futurama. Here's hoping the next few direct to dvds get the formula right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below junk","review":"After the start i truly thought this was going to be brilliant.However, just like the Simpsons movie, it quickly loses steam. The first song featured, \\"I might as well jump\\", was so childish and poorly written, I couldn't bear to see it! There were too many characters crammed into an overly complex plot, and the new villains were so dull and boring , it was a wonder anyone had thought them up.Don't get me wrong, I ADORE the series, and I loved the \\"in jokes\\", but I really think they were a mistake. Instead of appealing to those who used to watch the show, they should be appealing to those who have never watched it. They were cancelled once; now a second one doesn't seem so far off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be weary","review":"This is not the same quality as the Futurama of old. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they are just warming up for the other DVDs, but this one was disappointing.The movie seems to suffer from the same problem as The Simpsons. There were still some funny jokes, but they weren't topical. Too many of the jokes were just paying lip-service to funny episodes from earlier in the series and didn't add anything to the story. Also, far too many plot twists. I understand that the movie was intended to be split into episodes, but it felt like different people worked on different parts and just tried to stitch them together.I had to turn the movie off a little over an hour through, but I did watch it a second time and I started to feel a little better about it. I still don't think that I'll be watching this movie with anywhere near the frequency I watched the original episodes.Here's hoping the next movies are back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"nastalgia doesn't hold the show together!","review":"First and foremost, I want to explain why I gave this two stars. Because I would have given it one, but heck, it IS Futurama. And that's about it. Whatever you remember about Futurama, keep it gold by avoiding this mess. The writing is poor. The one-liners are only kinda funny. Everything seems rushed to make sure everyone gets an appearance while you sit bored for most of the movie. My wife actually turned to me during a painfully unnecessary song and dance (the first of TWO) and whispered \\"this really sucks.\\" The worst part of her statement.. I was about to say it to her!Sorry Futurama lovers across the globe.. It's the cold, hard truth. How many years did they have to perfect this gem? Doesn't matter, because what they gave us was rough and boring. I'm almost NOT looking forward to the next movies.. but I am because they can't get much worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail Hypnotoad!","review":"I was sooo glad to see that they were making a Futurama movie. Let's face it, as much as I loved watching reruns on Adult Swim (and now Comedy Central), it was getting to be depressing watching Fry lose Leela every night. The Fox execs that canceled this (It was probably the same idiots that canceled \\"Firefly.\\") in favor of some of the other \\"stuff\\" they put on should be drawn, quartered, forced to listen to the \\"Velour Voice,\\" and made slaves to mind slugs.If you loved the series, you will love this movie. Every major and minor character from the series is in it. The original actors are doing their characters and the writers skewer everything from Spammers to dim-witted TV execs with the wit and wisdom that we came to love from the original series. You get a \\"bonus\\" episode of \\"Everyone Loves Hypnotoad,\\" a lecture from a Math professor that the Futurama staff liked, and more extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bender's Big Score","review":"This was a very good return for Futurama, I thought. Granted, it wasn't excellent, there are some lame jokes and the plot is slightly overdone, but, overall the movie is very good. It was very nice to see Fry, Leela, Bender and the rest of the crew back, and this was a very good return for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as the rest of the series, but YES! New MATERIAL!!!","review":"As my title states, this particular episode just doesn't grab me like the majority of series does, but you know, it was still pretty good, and there was new Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Bender material, so thats always worth applauding for! I'm just super glad that Matt and the crew created this show, and even though it wasn't as big of a hit as the Simpsons, they still kept it going. This show was cancelled way before its time. I'll be looking forward to the Next Futurama addition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"It is typical Futurama, laugh out loud funny. It stays true to the original series.

DVD of most terrible quality","review":"Having purchased all the other Futurama DVDs R2 from the UK, I couldn't wait for this one so bought this R1 from the US. The DVD packaging is cheaply done and film of terrible quality. Very pixillated. Not my TV or system as other region 1s work perfectly.And the film was totally awful. Very safe, very tame, very unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Futurama but this was terrible....","review":"I'm surprised how good these other reviews are. I thought this was a very weak effort. The first half of the movie was wasted dwelling on the two years they were off the air. There was very little story that was engaging and there were odd characters that look like they were drawn by a different set of animators.I'd love for them to bring the series back but the wit seems to have fizzled out in this venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming Pile","review":"After almost 10 years of time off you would think the writers could have come up with some better material then this.

How I have missed you.You have come back to me after years apart. Unfortunately, I can tell that your writers have not remained faithful. There are brief hints, albeit many of them, that show that your writers have pursued other projects, and did not spend our long nights together practicing dialog for Bender, Fry and all the rest.But not to worry. You have still warmed the cockles of my heart and tickled my funny bone. Like always, you manage to convince me to suspend my disbelief and follow along with your parables on the dangers of modern society.You tried to keep it subtle, but I saw that moral you introduced.

Fans and non-fans will be slightly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I expect too much?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Futurama and I am very glad it is back, but this movie left a lot to be desired. The writing on the original series was tight, full of one liners and wonderfully dry humor, while this one felt like the writers were tied to a chair and forced to make one 22 minute episode into four. There were some very funny parts, but they were few and far between. I really don't think I was expecting much in the way of comedy either, as my favorite episodes are the character driven, newer ones (\\"Jurassic Bark\\", \\"The Sting\\", \\"Roswell That Ends Well\\", and \\"The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings\\").

The production quality on the visual side is better than ever. But the script or direction or combination of the two, is really lacking. It feels like it was rushed, like they were trying to make a deadline or something. There is a moment or two where it feels like the old Futurama, but the story, the writing and even some of the perfomances feel forced.One of the few good things I can say about this, is that it illustrates the quality of the original shows. And how much effort really goes into something that comes off so effortlessly.I will still buy the upcoming features, as I very much want Futurama to survive. But I hope they can regain their old rythm, or I fear this will be the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited five years for this?!?","review":"Alas, perhaps my expectations were too high? I slogged through this, saying \\"just wait - it has to get good soon.\\" The plot would easily fit a twenty-five minute episode, but is stretched so far that it snaps in this feature-length production. The writing lacks the sparkling brilliance I have come to expect and the visual gags lacked power. (Who can forget Bender dropping that brick in the series?) When it was over, I was left with the impression that the whole thing had been slapped together like some last-minute term paper.

Futurama simply failed to translate to an epic movie.It isn't horrible, just too damned long and tedious.Would have been superior if they had spent the money on creating three or four separate 30 minute episodes built around a central plot.If you felt that the Simpson's failed to translate to a full length movie successfully (I did -- but it was still entertaining), this movie will be a disaster of an experience for you.The 20 minute hypnotoad is a definite win, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama - Bender's Big Score","review":"Awesome movie, as funny as the series, so great to see this long lost show resurrected - not as much Zap Brannigan as I would have liked, but I am willing to look past it.

It's been awhile since I laughed as hard as I did while watching this. The best parts are that all the voice actors are the same and it FEELS like Futurama; as if this was just the next episode in this cancelled series. The DVD includes several bonus features-some great, some blah. Overall if you love Futurama or even just watch it when nothing else is on the tube, you should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama - MORE PLEASE!","review":"You don't know how much you missed something until you get it back. I've been watching Futurama re-runs for the last couple of years, bought the box sets and loved every minute of them. When I heard about Bender's Big Score, I was straight onto the pre-order page. This is almost everything any fan would have wanted in the return of Futurama - not up to the standard of some of the best episodes, but then again that's a very high bar to get over. If you love Futurama, you'll love this DVD. Very funny, but a bit convoluted at times. One thing is for sure - I'll be buying all the other new DVD's as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Did This Ever Get Canceled?","review":"What a wonderful return for Bender and the gang! I loved how they started the movie with slams at the Fox executives who canceled the series in the first place! Let 'em have it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the Pilot?","review":"Futurama - Bender's Big ScoreBy far the most horrible episode of Futurama ever. I am such a fan of Futurama and when I found out this was going to be released I could not wait to get a copy. Sitting through this was an unbelievable boring, unfunny, and slow ordeal. I recommend that this is a rent grade DVD. Something is really off with this DVD, so off in fact that I thought I was watching a pre-pilot episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bender's Big Score","review":"since the moment they annoucned it, i waited this movie, even morethan the simpsons movie b-cuz they still show simpsons in new episodes.well, it was worth the wait in my opinion.this movie has alot more to offer than the series. sure, the series can never really die, and this movie keep it living. i enjoyed it alot, and beacuse i am a futurama fan i saw all of the little jokes from the series too.i recommend it to every one who liked futurama, even of you who didnt watch it much. as a movie, its simpley good.Buuy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bender's Big Waste of Money","review":"I really have no idea what movie most of the other reviewers were watching, it certainly wasn't the complete waste of time I just finished watching. The original was funny and innovative, this movie just seemed like lots of rehashed jokes from the original series which, when all smashed together, are not funny or interesting.I can not recommend that anyone purchase this mess. I had to give it one star, because no stars is not a permitted option."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the voices are similar...","review":"Definitely not as good as the original seasons. Not really worth buying on DVD, but worth watching when the episodes come to TV.While I absolutely loved the original seasons, this is an obvious attempt to cash in without actually devoting any resources to making it worth my time to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"*silent sobbing*","review":"i'm a massive futurama fan and this movie was just a big letdown. its just a collection of references to jokes made in past episodes. its good that people rally behind futurama and supported this release, but the content of the movie itself is so poor compared to the quality of the actual seasons. there needs to be more of a movement for the show to get picked up again by a network and screened again in episodic format instead of saying the movie is good (when in actual fact its horrible - which is the general consensus outside of amazon) in order to keep the futurama people sustaining their input.i give it no stars. so very very bad. - annoyed fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing executing of the exciting return","review":"I'm a huge Futurama fan, so I gathered several friends to watch this DVD the day it came out and was very disappointed. The movie doesn't have the same creative spark that most episodes of the TV series did. The plot is great and leads to some funny situations, but the little inserts of humor were often unimaginative and dropped too often into stale toilet humor. Even the songs were mediocre. Between the 5 of us watching, there were very few laugh-out-loud moments, and the chuckles were not nearly as frequent as in the TV series. I think we got more laughs out of the Everybody Loves Hypnotoad special feature than the movie itself. I'm definitely glad that Futurama is back, but I hope they have much better stuff in store for us than this lame attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futurama is back","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this DVD and like so many others, I was expecting a miracle. All those years of waiting a re-watching every old episode lead to high expectations.After seeing for the first time, I was slightly let down - the long format does not work for Futurama (just like it did not work for the Simpsons Movie). However, after watching it again - and again - I must say that it still has everything that made me a Futurama fan. Great story with clever references and hidden humour. I usually hate timetravel in films, but the writers managed to make it as much fun and as little annoying as possible (paradox correcting time travel). Great music. Touching story about Fry & Leela. Bender. The professor saying \\"I am the professor!\\"Futurama is back in style, I can't wait for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bender's Big Flop","review":"I like the Futurama series, but the movie release just didn't come up to the quality of the TV shows. It was crass without being funny.

This film is what they broke down and made 4 new 1/2 hr shows on comedy central."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my then 15-month-old daughter. She gets no thrill out of it whatsoever and it is one of those toys that has been tossed to the side. The blocks don't really 'lock' in place so that you can see what animal noise, etc. is being said, so it can be confusing for a child who is learning the new sounds and letters. The only good thing is that it sings the ABCs... but I could do that myself and could have saved myself $12.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I'm a tough critic when it comes to these classical crossover artists who are appearing all over the place these days. As a big fan of Sarah Brightman (who in many ways pioneered the classical crossover style before it was in vogue) I'll admit I'm hard-pressed to find artists who can come close to Sarah in voice, ingenuity, and flat-out fabulous recordings. However, I think this CD is downright beautiful. The arrangements (by Summer herself!) are lush but also understated, and the whole CD keeps this rich texture throughout, while also remaining interesting and fresh. I was totally won over by Summer's version of \\"Sposa Son Disprezzata\\", which I think is one of the most beautful classical pieces I've ever heard. And the violin in the beginning of \\"Morgen\\" is also quite gorgeous. Many of today's classical crossover artists cross the line into some rather pretentious stuff, but this one has heart and soul, and is quite impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross over music that works brilliantly","review":"I heard Summer on a sampler cd I got for free from one of the local bookstores. I kept coming back to her song and liked it enough to order her entire cd from amazon. Great purchase to say the least. She moves effortlessly between classical and pop selections. She has a way of working within the song and not overextending - meaning she doesn't showboat. Don't expect any american idol grandstanding at any time. What you get is straight up professional singing from a classicaly trained vocalist. It doesn't get boring thanks to a great mix of songs. The treatment of Sting's 'fragile' is especially nice. Not an essential cd but I still give it 5 stars because it's practically flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"Bought this at a local Tower Records because it was on sale and want something relaxing. Turns out it is one of the best albums I will ever own. Great voice, relaxing music. Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerging voice of classical crossover","review":"The artist usually associated with crossover is Sarah Brightman. But Summer's voice is very unique. By this she seperates herself. The songs are cool and mellow, with wonderful arrangements. She is what classical crossover needed. A blend of operetics and vocality to create a new sound. Summer is the first of her kind, a kind that will define classical crossover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen","review":"Listen and I'm sure you will buy a copy even if you already have the songs she sings. I did. The next vocal queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"This is a beautiful CD! I have always appreciated this type of music, however, Summer exceeds my expectations. So many sopranos have a breathy \\"childish\\" quality to their voices when they reach for high notes. Summer has a controlled manner that is smooth and effortless. I have thoroughly enjoyed my new CD and look forward to future recordings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a lovely voice, but...","review":"it definitely lacks expressive quality, particularly on the classical pieces. Her dynamics are appropriate and fine, but it's a very one dimensional sound. Her long notes have a beautiful tone, but they don't move anywhere. They just hang in the air waiting to meet their ends. Listen to Cecilia Bartoli's rendition of Sposa son disprezzata to hear what this piece sounds like when it really is brought to life. I'd love to hear Summer's tone with Cecilia's passion...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she falling asleep ?","review":"Bought the album because it had all of my favorite selections, nice orchestration but her vocalization is totally without feeling...and beautiful music without feeling is a waste..nice voice but boring ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to put no stars on these reviews?","review":"The author is an infamous neoconservative. The best way to describe the book is that it's racist, oversimplified, biased, and ignorant. I hope the people who read this book ralize that it will only breed more ignorance and arrogance. Shame on you, Mr. Lewis!As someone who has and worked in the Middle East, as well as studied it, let me recommend The Looming Tower, No God but God, The Shia Revival, and The Great War for Civilisation. Thease are accurate, eye-opening, insights into such a complex topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"As a once an admirer of Bernard Lewis, I find this book oversimplistic in it's nature.

I could not believe that the author would actually refer to the reader as \\"us\\" when he made his profoundly biased claims against Islam. What kind of \\"academic historian\\" would use the words \\"us\\" when speaking to the public at large on such a divided issue? I also can't believe how many five-star reviews were listed for this book. I'm highly suspicious because the overall distribution of the reviews of this book are unbelievably bimodal. What are the chances? Look for yourselves. Something fishy is going on here. I'm not an academic and I'm not a muslim, but I was deeply annoyed by this author and the disservice he has done to humanity. He's not even a good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Islam will fight its last war against Hindus","review":"Dear brothers and sisters of Western Civilization,One of the reviewers suggested that Islam hates one who stand up against Islam. You are right. Islam hates Hindus and Buddhists. Islam was able to wipe out peaceful Buddhist from India. But Hindus gave a good fight to those Arabic Islamic for nearly one thousand years. Unfortunately, British came to India and protected Islam from Hindus (British thought that Islam was more closure to them then Hindus. So, we are now happy that British is fighting against Islam. Let two evils fight to the end!). But Hindus are the warrior people, and we are determined to destroy the evil intention of Islam. So, Islam's last fight will be with Hindus. West is losing this battle against Osma, and we Hindus are happy about that. We want to fight against Islam, the powerful Islam...and destroy its cancerous wings for once and all.Bikram, Bharat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly inaccurate, one sided and misleading","review":"I will not go into the details of the book otherwise the allowed 1000 words would not be enough.Do not be impressed by the prestigious academic position of the author, or by his vast historicalknowledge, which he employs to convince the readers with his superficial analysis. It doesn'ttake much effort to find out how emphasis is placed on certain issues inappropriately. By doing so,apples are mixed with eggs all the time. The book is full of contradictions, half of the truth -most ridiculously in Chapter 5.If you are seeking a compact, and thus not comprehensive, lesson of Islamic history, this book mightbe useful, and therefore, two stars. But if your aim to learn something about the political evolutionof the Islamic world, do not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't tell whole story","review":"i'm not an expert on middle-east history, but common sense tells me something is missing here. if, as prof lewis says, the soviets were agressively pursuing policies to extend their influence over the oil-rich arab states, i think it's a safe bet the americans weren't standing idly by. what exactly they did, though, is glossed over. is there something here that doesn't agree with the professor's arguments? lewis does the same with with the colonial period. it's well known that the british adopted a policy of 'divide and conquer' towards their colonies. the aim was to bequeath debilitated states that could be manipulated for britain's continued economic advantage. oil had already been discovered in the middle-east by the time most arab states achieved independence. it's hard to believe the west encouraged genuine independence when so much was at stake. there's obviously much more here than prof lewis is willing to tell us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fair appreciation of islam","review":"Overall is a rather cold and cruel vision of islam. The author is not simpathetic or understanding of it. He describes its problems in the same way a psychiatrist tries to understand the mind of an \\"insane\\" person without ever forgeting that the person \\"is crazy\\". At the end he does not proposes any substantial solution to the conflict. The question is, how can the arab countries and people can be helped from their pain? Have the western countries really offered their sincere and fraternal friendship, trying to trully help improve those countries? The arab people feel that over the history their culture and dignity have been offended through colonialism and then by globalization that threatens their identity and moral values. What can the western countries do to stop this apparent aggraviation, and offer help, cooperation and legitimate friendship?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"Lewis has prostituted his vast knowledge of history in the service of the terribly misguided U.S. foreign-policy stance on the Middle East, which policy is a stupid blunder that will lead to WWIII."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Went Wrong?---With Lewis??","review":"Expanding on his provocative autobiography, \\"what went wrong\\", mr. lewis continues on the curious course of being the best self-marketing scholar in the bookstore. you see, mr lewis' background shows us that he's a turkish historian by profession who has intermediate knowledge of arabic (which would be the equivalant of studying the french revolution speaking only chinese) but has turned himself into the most understanding man in the market. wouldn't it be refreshing to actually hear what muslims have to say about their own history? maybe for once we should stop admiring our own rhetoric"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write a book based on UnTruths?","review":"This book is a sad depiction of one who has no knowledge of religion and is just trying to make a book about a popular subject, distort the facts, and make lots of money....Don't buy this book...

Instead, buy something like \\"The Islamic View of Women and Family\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be read by everyone","review":"I do not have more info to add over the many good previous reviews except that this book should be read by every one who wants to figure out what is happening in the world.This is a small book that provides a brief view of Islamic history and ideas. For peple who are interested in a good understanding Islamic history and ideas you will have to look elsewhere. But if you want to find out why America is being attacked, you will find some answers here.The message I got from this book was Americans are hated by many Muslim because of what it is and what it represents. I am not sure it would apeace the American haters even if every Americans convert to Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good basic overview","review":"This is a great primer for learning about the Middle East and Islam as a whole The book is only 170 pages long which is nice in that it gives you a quick and easy, general understanding of the topic. The reader should be aware however that no book can claim in 500 pages to explain an entire religion and an area of the world much less in 170. This book is simply a good jumping off point to getting a better understanding of the historical context of Islam and the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good popular information about Islamic nations","review":"Lewis is one of the leading scholars on Islamic history and politics in the US. In this book he brings scholarship down to earth and presents Islamic history and politics in an accessible and understandable manner. We learn that, for example, no Islamic nation even shows up on a ranking of countries buying the most books. We learn a little of what went wrong and why it hasn't gotten any better. There is a great need for good knowledge about Islam and Arab nations by all who are concerned by terrorists, war, and politics. Lewis does a commendable job of writing an easy to understand and comfortable length book for the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but still worth the read","review":"Disappointing simplification of Arab American relationship or lack thereof, its link to the decline of Islamic political power and the frustration of Muslims. Mr Lewis is successful in drawing up a picture of failures of Islam through the American prisms. Unfortunately, the arguments must be viewed in a broader context to be credible for those of us who have also lived outside the US. His linking of Islam hostilities to the Nazis and the Soviet Union is a bit weak, although some truth could be found in it. Overall, an interesting book for those who want to understand Americans' misconception of Islam written by a scholar within the middle of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and easily accesible","review":"Lewis scores again with this brief but compelling tome. It has angered many in the Islamic world (5the truth can be painful) for merely reciting facts. Recommended for anyone seeking to understand the hatred that is facing the U.S. and its religous roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very simplistic, naive view of the middle east","review":"Lewis attributes all of the animosity that the Islamic world has toward the US to this: jealousy and envy.

His pasting-over the West's roles in history events distorts the depth of emotions of the subject of his book. I recommend that all readers read him with a critical eye (especially considering the fact that the acclaimed religious expert could make the rather obvious blunder of calling Confucious teachings a religion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a Muslim but I can recognize bias.","review":"I lived for years in the Middle East and after reading this book I can tell you that this \\"historian\\" comes with an agenda. It may be his jewish cultural background or whatever, but he only seems to have a cursory and simplistic understanding of Islam and Muslim thought. Of course saying that some Muslims could care less about \\"The West\\" or Israel and just want to be left in peace would not sell many books.Take it from someone that has been there. Most people in the Middle East are no different from you given similar circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unfair and biased","review":"Although Lewis does make several legitimate points, the overwhelming majority of this book is right-wing, anti-Islamic, pro-American rhetoric.

Yeah, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!!!!","review":"The contents of this book are extremely offensive. I'm a muslim and from my point of view this book is biased. Lewis generalizes way too much. Sure there are some muslim extremist but what religion doesn't come with it's share of bad apples? If Islam is so \\"evil\\" and whatnot then how come even today you find old churches from way back in muslim countries yet in christian or jewish countries you only find ruins of what was once mosques? It's because Islam is a tolerant religion, and always has been, that's why.

Being an infidel is one of the worst things in Islam.This is a horrifying book since it is so close to home.The facts are real.The Arabs don't deny it.15 of the 19 hijackers of 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia, and they don't even apologize.Every American should read this book, and then write their congressman to take action against the dangers of Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read and useful summary","review":"I read this book in two days.

I really liked Keys to the Kingdom in the book version, however, friends and family that listened to the book on CD hated it. Not sure why exactly, but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead. Also, you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist. Hang in there though, because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships. I can't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men. Did I also mention that apparently Alanis Morissette is also an Armstrong fan? In a nutshell, get her book, and her other CDs like \\"In Sync with the Opposite Sex\\". Also, her CD \\"The Amazing Development of Men\\" is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\", which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm and wonderful!","review":"A warm, wonderful story -- very engaging.

I read it in one sitting one afternoon. The battle of the sexes unveiled. There is NO need to be adversarial (I love the book's explanation of this). Written in novel (story) form, this is an easy read. It enlightens probably what you kinda know deep inside; it explains it, readily and easily. Men do go through phases of growth.

It had lots of information that has helped me gain new perspective on my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years. It is very short, only about 75 pages long, with large print and wide spacing, and i finished reading it an a little over an hour. My main complaint is the way that she (the author) would make references to her lectures and other books in a way that withheld information that seems as though it is necessary in order to complete the ideas that you are reading about. It had lots of ads for her other books and lectures right there in the pages, and kind of forces you to buy her other books in order to complete the half-knowledge given to you through this book.

However, if God created the world and God is love, why is there so much pain? Also, if a good power (God) exists, it is almost a given that there is a opposing force (satan) that is not as strong as God. They also don't believe all of the Bible because of some outdated civil laws for the Jews of the O.T. times.

Unfortunately, their studio Albums, while quite good, never seemed to reproduce their live sound very well. In The Poppy Fields is the first official release by the band (Mike Peters + 3 very talented veteran punk musicians) since 1991's Raw. With this release, they have finally put to plastic what they never quite achieved in the 80's - 90's - namely a truly great album with a full, live sound, and flawless production.The 12 songs included show off the variety of song styles that the band excels at - 45 RPM is an all out punk rock stormer, while New Home New Life gives Travis a run for their money in the melodic, alternative category.If you like good rock / alternative music, you can't go wrong with this collection. All songs are slickly produced by Steve Brown and show off the song writing and musicmanship of the band very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound the Alarm","review":"In a word Brilliant. The Alarm prove that 13 years after their last studio LP they are still a serious contender in this business of Rock n' Roll for a new \\"Second Generation\\" of audience to experience.\\"In the Poppyfields\\" is a true masterpiece from First track to last & will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from which you won't want to come down. From the anthemic ferocity of \\"45 RPM\\" to the haunting echoes on \\"the Unexplained\\", the sheer beauty of the lyrics & the craftsmanship of composition in the music will leave you floored.

There are only a few exercises & the drawings were created in an earlier version and saved as 2000 format. Some don't act as expected. There are also some errors that were not caught (the book appears to have been updated from an earlier release). While a beginner could re-create the drawings shown in the command examples, it would take an unacceptable amount of time. Each explanation should come with a drawing that has been pre set up for the user to practice the commands & see how they work. Only the command line version of each command is given (right click menus are also somewhat explained), with no mention of how to use a toolbar or menu bar to activate the commands! The only reason to buy this book is because it's the only one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks a crucial element","review":"What a disappointment - this is a fairly decent book for Mechanical Desktop 5, but ALL instructions pertain to the command line prompt codes (not the toolbar).For those of you who don't know what I'm referring to: Autocad gives you two main ways to execute commands - by typing in 8 to 10 letter codes (the old way), or by clicking on the toolbar buttons (the more user-friendly way). In some cases, you have no choice and must use the code commands, however this book makes no mention of the toolbar buttons that relate to what they're doing.

It is stark, realistic, and yet has a fantastic quality all its own. The story follows three small time crooks: Donny, the calm vet, Teach, daring and aching for adventure, and Bobby, the slow, amiable kid. Their plot to steal a valuable coin collection is the center of the play, but so much more goes into it. Honor amoung thieves, the busted American dream, and masculinity are at the core of this piece, and Mamet, with his honest style, pulls off what could very easily be a dumb crook spoof. It's a little hard to read at first, as all Mamet is, but if you envision the story, you'll get through it. I recently saw the play in New York at mamet's Atlantic company with Philip Baker Hall, William H. Macy, and Mark Webber, and it was truly great. I suggest owning the play and getting to a local performance asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too obscure.","review":"\\"American Buffalo\\" was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic.

I ordered this and started using it. I do it in conjunction with a Fly-Off ear and nose ointment, and disposable attractant traps, and this 3-pronged approach works well. I love that it's all natural, because the dogs do lick it off each other, the kids hugs them, I spray it on their doghouses and around our patio door, etc. The scent isn't terrible at all, and I swear I can smell it sometimes the next day when I step out to feed them, so I know it's hanging around. It's definitely a great investment for the dogs' health and comfort. I looked around for a while and read many dog-lover forums and sites before deciding on this for price and health reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product that smells nice too!","review":"I've bought a few different types of fly spray for my horses, but I really hate the smell of most of them. I tried this out and I really like it. It's just as effective for fly repellant as other chemical brands, but the smell for this one is pleasant and minty, and if you apply it evenly, it makes the horse's coat and skin look moisturized and shiny. I now put this on my horses not just as a fly repellant but as part of their grooming and after baths because I really think it has been good for their skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!

However (!), when I checked on my horse the day after the first (and last) application, each and every sensitive area (flanks, girth area near legs, etc.) was very scurfy and flaking.

Yes, I did dilute it according to the directions.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I don't think the authors have any idea who their audience is. Their goal with this book is a mystery to me. This book misses hundreds of educational opportunities in several areas. Mainly, a description of the abnormalities, using anatomical terms, is to me a blatant omission. In head and neck radiology, anatomy is crucial and complex, and the vast majority of cases in this book DO NOT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS. Moreover, the follow-up questions don't seem relevant to anyone, including radiology residents, neuroradiology fellows, or neuroradiology staff. This book seems like it was written by an academic ENT physician, who lost his research funding, hated patients, and decided to dabble in head and neck imaging. The authors of this edition are capable of better work, and I look forward to the next edition.

Really feels like IW rushed this out with out much market testing. Easy to find glitches and the release of this game WITHOUT A ANTICHEAT are things that any testing would have brought to the forefront immediately. Would figure they would have learned from the first version. Recently there was a worldwide strike against the game due to the lack of response from the gamemakers.

The traction provided by the little tiny numbs is all but nonexistant. These tires may, and probably do, perform well on hard pack, but in the NE we almost never get that. The type of riding we typiv=cally do is technical with lost of roots, rocks and mud; these tires just can't cut it. As far as puncture protection - forget it.

The non-existent development of character, the introduction of meaningless distractions designed to manipulate the reader's emotions for no apparent reason, and the over-dramatic (yet empty) writing style, all combined to make me more and more frustrated/angry, as I made my way through the book.

It taste as close to store bought milk as anything I've ever tasted. I travel a lot in my RV and trying to keep milk in the fridge can be difficult, so I usually buy powdered, canned, or shelf ready milk. The can milk takes up too much room as is also the case with shelf ready type. The \\"regular\\" powder milk I've purchased before either didn't taste that fabulous or lumped up severely. I have to say this NIDO milk mixes very well, and the good thing is the fact if you don't want to use at full strength (whole milk), you can dilute it to your liking. This stuff taste great and this will be on hand from now on out. I agree with the one reviewer who related that non-powder milk drinkers may just change their mind when they try this out. I agree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful.","review":"We bought this specifically to add body to homemade yogurt. We'd seen only good comments about it. Using less than half a cup of Nido to 42 oz of fresh whole milk resulted in the worst tasting yogurt we'd ever made. We couldn't believe it was the Nido, so tried again, this time with a scant 1/3 cup. Still horrid. Went back to the store brand, not great but certainly edible, until we were able to pick up some Saco, which worked well. I'm not sure whether the Nido was rancid or just didn't fit our taste.

It also froths better too, with just a hand held frother to rinse. I just use the Nespresso to pour some hot water into a cup with the milk powder and a packet of sweetener, and hit it with the frother. The Black & Decker one works great. Then I do a shot or two of espresso, and an instant capp or latte with no fuss! Tastes as good to me as frothed milk from a fancy machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes bad quickly","review":"What is wrong with this stuff?

According to the label, this 3.52 lb can makes about 13 quarts. Rather expensive per quart, compared to fresh milk from the grocery store, but cheaper than a trip to the store when I run out of milk and need some quickly. Ingredients: Whole Milk, Soy Lecithin, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 (per label). Imported from Chile.

I looked at the reviews for this product and they were generally positive. I saw one dissenting review from a person who said they switched the manufacturing plant from Chile to Mexico and it was horrible now. I thought he was wrong and was just some bitter man with time on his hands.Boy I was wrong.I never tried this product when it was made in Chile, but I can tell you that it now tastes horrible and nothing like regular milk. It tastes like cheese, really old rotting cheese. It smells terrible, and all my buddies who I had try it agree with me. I have a friend who picked up powdered milk from Albertsons and his is substantially better. It's a store brand I believe, but I can't order that on Amazon.I want to request my money back from Nestle. This is probably the worst product I ever ordered during my time here at Amazon and on prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste and easy to store","review":"I purchased this product as I don't care for the taste of most powdered milks. They are ok for an emergency, or for cooking, but really aren't the best for flavor as a drink. I have to say the taste is absolutely fantastic! I could not tell the difference between this and store bout whole milk. Yes, it is that good!I will no longer buy regular milk from the dairy aisle at the grocery store, this is what I will use, exclusively for all my milk needs.I mix it as directed with warm water and blend with a stick blender to be sure it's thoroughly mixed.

It is still an easy drink to make and it is tasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of Chile or Mexico?","review":"Be aware that Nestle USA recently switched supply of NIDO from their Chile plant to Mexico and the quality is like night and day.

For my food storage pantry, I choose Nido whole milk powder. The large containers keep a very long time in storage, and they are light enough to travel well. May I suggest you combine this milk powder with a meal replacement, like Carnation Instant Breakfast, for a more nutritionally complete source of calories.

One of those amazingly annoying Sario-Rip thingamabobbies happen, and they go back to Mr. Rex's era. That's the setting, and I'll say just a few more things. 1) Rachel and Tobias spend some real quality time together (heh heh heh). 2) They meet the race that invented broccoli. 3) There are ants involved (doesn't that just stink)!

It's the best of the Megamorphs (which isn't saying much at the moment).BTW, I just finished reading Back to Before. What was the point, apart from showing us that the Animorphs need to continue fighting? I mean, Rachel with Marco?

I use it accompanying with DG's Brahms complete edition, and the result is very informative and I totally enjoy it. The greatest merit,and at the same time the crucial flaw, of this book is that this is a collaboration. Yes, good enough, we can find different perspectives and different writing styles and different standard among these articles. But even in the same category pages seem not being equally distributed. For example, there are 4.5 enthusiastic pages dedicated to op.43,four lieder, with every lied in detail. But there are only 3 paragraphs for op.46, four lieder.

The author obviously made little, if any, attempt to interview German survivors of the Market-Garden fiasco. Doubts are cast on the remembrances of those he does quote with such statements as He \\"claimed\\", etc. German soldiers who, early in the book, are described as old men and adolescent boys suddenly become \\"fanatical\\" Nazis who \\"infest\\" woods and fight in a \\"frenzied\\" manner. General Roy Urquhart -- one of the bravest of the brave -- is never referred to in second reference as he, or the general, or Urquhart, but as the \\"incredibly brave Scot\\" or some such sobriquet. In the author's view the British lost this battle. The Germans had absolutely nothing to do with winning it. See the movie and watch your favorites strutting through the film. It is a lot more entertaining -- and about as evenhanded -- as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"Absolutely one of the best books that I have ever read. It is not so much a book about the tactics and strategy, although that is in it, but a story about ordinary men doing extraordinary things.

For you war buffs, it will give you even more reason to wonder why Montgomery is held in such high esteem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is a superb piece of work. The amount of time the author must have put into the research is nothing short of amazing. I think the best way to describe the operation was stated by Ryan himself.

You have to watch some of them with a remote in your hand to constantly raise and lower the sound. The narration is too low and the music is too loud. A review on another website defending the DVD set said that there is a warning on the box that says \\"audio levels may vary\\". Yeah, right, but the sites that sell the DVDs don't point that out.

The narration by Leonard Graves and the music by Richard Rodgers are at the absolutey correct levels that they should be, just as in the original VHS series. The sound quality is excellent as is the video imagery. You get the lead-in theme song and the big \\"V\\" at the end of each episode, no overlapping segue as in the VHS tapes which eliminated the leadin/endings for all episodes on a given tape in the series.

I could understand variations from episode to episode in the decibels of sound (though that is not even necessary with today's technology), but the range of volume fluctuations within one episode is inexcusable.

I have to agree with everybody else, the sound was processed for the music, not the narration. Peter Graves opens each chapter with a short discussion. Set your audio system for the introduction, and then you must reset it for the Richard Rogers music, and then turn up the volume for narration. As everybody else writes, you can not hear the narration. N.B.C. should go into the vaults and pull the sound reels out to remaster the audio. I don't care about the idea that Roger's music could be processed in stereo. The masters most likely were recorded in mono. All they have to do is pull the music down and bring up the narration.It is ashame that many of the WWII veterans may have hearing problems to begin with. Wouldn't it benefit them to rework the audio so they can hear the program, before it's too late............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is a disaster","review":"The music is too loud while the narrative is barely audible. Between three-quarters of maximum volume and full max, the volume of the narrative doesn't change, and even seems to fall.

I can barely stand to watch more than an episode or two before I become so irritated I have to turn it off. I could have been good, but it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Having but Sound Issues are VERY Annoying","review":"Yes this is a Classic Documentary series and has footage seen no where else. However this is the most aggravating Soundtrack of any DVD I own. SURELY they could have mixed it better! The narration is very muddy and hard to hear while the music is blasting. I read another review that said the sound was fine.That user must have a high end system with an equalizer or something. It is terrible. Also I was astounded at how many scenes are obviously staged re-creations of events. One thing I liked about the World At War is they would tell you if footage was staged. So yes go ahead and get this because the historical importance makes it worthwhile. But be prepared to aggravate others in your home if you're the only one watching this while the family is doing other things. Because to effectively hear the narration the volume will have to be set high. The music will then be VERY loud. PLEASE RE-MIX this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overstate audio concern","review":"The so-called audio problem is NOT a big deal. The sound on the set can be adjusted upward a bit without changing any Digital TV settings. I took a chance and purchased this series, and I am not disappointed. I first saw it as a boy and the impact of seeing it today is the same as then. I suppose that if you are an audiophile purist you can jump up and down. But while you are jumping, I enjoy the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible audio plus NO CAPTIONS or SUBTITLES!","review":"Like other reviewers who complained about the audio level, I had to watch the entire series with remote in hand, since the volume changes are constant: barely audible narration by Leonard Graves, then BOOMING sound for the music and battle scenes. Raise the volume high enough to understand the narration, then immediately lower the volume when the music or battle scenes start. To make matters worse, there is no closed captioning, no subtitles, no SDH (subtitled for the deaf and hard of hearing). One would expect that one of the great all-time WWII documentaries would have some type of captioning for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, which many WWII vets may, in fact, be, God bless em! Are ya listening, History Channel? Good! Cause we sure can't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And they wonder why ....","review":"I have several options in copying many of the DVDs I rent.

That's a big market that you are excluding yourself from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound makes for bad DVDs","review":"My disappointment with this DVD set stems from my expectations. I thought that time and effort would have been taken to enhance the video in the this digital format since Victory at Sea seriesis a classic. In comparison with my VHS version of the series the video is no better or worse. Where the DVD is truly lacking is the audio which of its self is a great part of the cache ofthe series. The audio was so poorly done as to be upsetting. I had to turn up the volume control of my system by three time the setting I used with the VHS tapes which I used for a comparsion. The voice of the announcer was not melded in with the sound level of the music as was the case with the VHS tapes. Consequently,I was fidgeting with the volume control frequently. Cannonade from artillery or of the large gunsof ships would boom the volume of the audio off scale requiring another audio adjustment.My advice to anyone interested in this series-truly a classic-would be to buy the VHS tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"But for the sound, this series would have garnered a 5.","review":"Series exemplary in every way, except sound. To balance the music with the narration, I purchased a \\"TV Volume Regulator\\". This has returned the sound to approximately what it would been in 1952, when the series was made. This an added expense, but at least can watch segments now without constantly using volume control. I pipe the DVD player through the \\"volume regulator\\" before attaching through the amplifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality issues with the DVD copy","review":"While most of the segments are ok, there are a few sections that have not transcribed into the DVD without some severe distortion. It appears that the master tape used to make the DVD (not the original films) loses sync and skips in places. This is very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"BuyVictoryatSea.com","review":"[...]Don't buy the set from the TV commercial either. The sound is consistent (always bad, garbled and distorted). Level changes occur as the narration sometimes drops to a low level. The picture is out of focus on all 26 chapters. During the last 13 chapters ,the picture jumps back and forth a frame or two several times in succession whenever there is fast movement on the screen. The sound does not break up during these frame jumps. Like the DVD under review, this inexpensive version also seems to be made from very bad VHS tapes. I own 9 episodes on Laser Disk and the video is sharp and the sound is fine. I only wish I had the whole set on Laser disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate DVD of \\"VAS\\" by Emson","review":"Forget the Victory at Sea DVD sponsored by the History Channel. I agree with all the other reviewers. The sound mix IS awful. I returned my copy to Amazon for a full refund. Instead I ordered a 2-disc version of all 26 episodes from Emson, Inc. The sound mix is MUCH better than the HC version, and it's NOT sponsored by the History Channel. Emson's phone number for ordering, if anyone's interested, is 1-800-592-6800. Used my credit card to order. It took 2 weeks for delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first class series with third rate sound","review":"The sound on this DVD is terrible. It is not possible to hear the narration when the level is set for the music score. With the level set for the narration, the music track is too loud for the music-only passages.The narration on these DVDs, when you can hear it, sounds thin and reedy, as if it was fed through a telephone line.This problem has nothing to do with the age of the original material. I have Victory at Sea on laser disc. The audio on them is fine when played through my TV or through the same sound system that I use for DVD. The sound was fine on the VHS release. The sound has been consistently fine when the series was shown on TV over the years. And the sound, with Richard Rogers acclaimed score, was fine when the series first ran on NBC when I was a boy.This versionis much better. And, although I haven't seen (or heard) it, I imagine that theBlu Ray release] is pretty good, too. Anything but this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American Should See This","review":"I had not seen this in many years, but this is something that all Americans should see to remind them of what can happen if or when we cease to understand the dangers to our country that exist today. While watching these 26 episodes, I was reminded of how we, the American people, co-operated with one another to ultimately defeat the enemy during World War II. In those days, it mattered little whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, we ALL pulled together to achieve a common goal--VICTORY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"important part of television history","review":"really awful sound (as previous reviwers have aptly noted), but still well worth every dollar. this has to rate as one of the top 10 most important series in the history of television. great content, terrific focus on key events, and a true work of genius for this early era of tv. your remote is required for viewing. but i found this 26 epidode series to be dramatically insightful throughout and after a while the sound situation becomes secondary...recommended !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"Vistory at Sea is a classic T.V. show that I loved when it originally aired.

I am hooked on colorku."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I like this even better than traditional Sudoku - my husband and I have been playing together instead of watching TV.

Great challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family activity","review":"We sit around the table together and play this game. We work together to set up the board at the beginning, and we place pieces when we see things that work. Each person placing a piece explains how he/she knows that piece goes there. My 5 year old enjoys it, and my mom does too! My mom normally dislikes number games, so the color option is good for her. In certain lighting, it can be tough to tell some of the colors apart, but it's not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sudoku alternative","review":"This is a nice alternative for Sudoku fanatics. It is challenging in that there is no way to \\"record\\" or \\"pencil in\\" the answers you have narrowed down a spot to be, but fun.We found it easier to work in pairs on this game which is too difficult on a tiny written sudoku puzzle. This is a fantastic logic game for children.ONE PROBLEM: Ours came fully sealed, but was missing the first (the easiest, of course!) 15 Colorku puzzle starter cards. BUT, there is a chart with easy directions (very easy!) on how to convert your favorite sudoku puzzle into a Colorku puzzle.Not good with small children around who will bump into it...really messes up your logical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color Sudoku Puzzle","review":"We purchased Color Sudoku Puzzle as a Christmas gift for our 10-year old grand daughter.

I would suggest that you purchase a bag to hold the sudoku balls so they don't get lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for me, my 7 year old and my 9 year old","review":"I've always casually enjoyed sudoku but never *really* gotten into it. I got this for my kids (7 and 9) and discovered that I prefer this to normal sudoku, something about using colors instead of numbers makes the logic easier to process for me.My friend and I love to work on the harder levels together, and my kids and I can do the easier ones together... and sometimes I just like to sit and work on one myself just for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment for all ages","review":"I bought this game for my 9 year old nephew for Christmas and he really enjoyed it. It's less intimidating than the numerical version of Sudoku and he caught on fairly fast. His 4 year old brother even helped put in the marbles in the right places and while he didn't quite understand the rules he seemed to enjoy trying to catch on. The wooden board it comes with is very sturdy and well crafted. My only complaint would be that the maker of the toy doesn't supply any holding container for all of the colored marbles, so it's a bit cumbersome to put away when you're done. However, I would recommend this game to any parent who enjoys Sudoku and wants to teach their children the game! The best part about it is that any Sudoku puzzle you can find online is easily translatable to this version. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"7-year-old loves it...and now \\"gets\\" Sudoku","review":"This is a very high-quality game. I bought this for my 7-year-old, who was trying to understand how I did Sudoku puzzles. Very soon in our first Colorku game, it \\"clicked\\" for her. She loves to play this game. Right now she's doing really well with the Easy puzzles, but she needs some guidance on the Moderate ones. This will definitely be a game she can play for a while.My take on a few criticisms that other reviewers had:- We don't really have a problem with the fact that there's not a carrying case for the balls. We just leave them in place after a game and cover them with the plastic lid.- We've had no problem differentiating between colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for ALL Ages","review":"This game was given to my oldest son, Age 7, for Christmas. He loves it. He does the puzzle cards and will then transpose the Sunday Sudoku into the color version and do the complex puzzles as well. My younger son, age 5, also loves this game and can play it just as easily as my older son. The adults in our family love it just as much. Good quality wooden game board. Nicely made wooden marbles with pleasing colors. An excellent overall game which will span many generations and bring them together. We find that once somebody has started a game everybody wants to come and help solve the problem. Ours is a family with very little TV, no Gameboys, many books and good quality toys and puzzles. This one fits the bill. I highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but I wish the colors could be stacked","review":"I bought this for my kids thinking it'd be more fun than using a pencil and paper, and I think that's mainly worked out well - the board is big, it's easy to move the pieces, the kids can easily work together, and it doesn't feel like doing a school worksheet. But the downside is that the colors are spheres, and can't be stacked, or placed to the side - they roll. So you can't easily mark that a particular spot could take one of two colors - once you've put a color there it looks just like the colors you placed initially to set up the puzzle (unlike, say, a printed puzzle where you can distinguish between your own writing and the pre-printed part of the puzzle). So while I like this product, and we're having fun with it, I think it could have been even better by making the colored pieces more like stackable poker chips so that you could temporarily stack several someplace, or put some next to a spot or some such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numbers guy loves colors","review":"This was a gift for a Sudoku aficionado but I wasn't sure if the numbers logic guy would like working with colors. Not to worry, the game is a hit! It comes with game cards, but any Sudoko puzzle can be adapted to play on the board. The color game is even being used to help solve some of the 5-star difficulty level games that hadn't yet been completed! We think this is a nice addition to our board games. The 4-star rating for durability is because of the plastic cover used to keep the balls in place. I foresee storing the balls in a separate bag at some point in the future. Otherwise, the board and colored balls are of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!","review":"I play this game with my niece's and nephew's on vacation (ages 7-14) and it's great. They are learning so much and are patience at the same time while playing this game. I love that it has colored balls instead of the usual numbers. I would highly recommend this product.

There's real Stones rock in Wired All Night, Out Of Focus and Put Me In The Trash; falsetto funk in Sweet Thing; blues rock in Don't Tear Me Up and Use Me; country balladeering in Evening Gown and Hang On To Me Tonight; hints of gospel in Angel In My Heart and even Celtic folk in Handsome Molly. Emotionally compelling music - great lyrics wrapped around killer hooks. It's like those late 60s and early 70s Stones albums where every song is a classic. Mick sings his heart out and puts most of modern rock music in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I bought this album when it first came out basically because I was curious to see if Mick Jagger could make a good solo album. I found out that not only could he, but this album is bette than good. There are some rocking songs here such as \\"Wired All Night\\", \\"Out Of Focus\\", 'Put Me In The Trash\\". We have a funky sounding song \\"Sweet Thing\\" that you can dance to. \\"Dont Tear Me Up\\", and 'Hang On To Me Tonight\\" are some powerful ballads that trap the listener in. One other highlight of this album is the duet with Lenny Kravitz on \\"Use Me\\". Lenny Kravitz was just a few months away from releasing his awesome album \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" and I think that Mick recognized his talent and included him on this album. After listening to the song, we know that it was a wise choice. I think that any music fan will truly enjoy this and should add it to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Album","review":"This is a really good album. An unexpected treat. I bought the album without having heard any of it because the reviews were strong, the Stones rule, and Mick is just the man in general.I was pleased with the whole album on playing it - which is rare these days. There are some real gems here.And the cut \\"Sweet Thing\\", has a hip-hoppy funky beat that was one of the most dancable traks released that year.

I believe that Melissa could be a viable source in the biz if she could put an up to date edge on her music. This album's failure is strictly the fault of the label. They'll never get it.

When I first heard that this special would be on TV, I was very excited. I was not disapointed.One of the best things about this video is that it has two levels. Kids will like it because it has plenty of funny voices and, of course, Bill the Cat. But there is also a higher level that adults will enjoy with allusions to old black and white movies and references only they would get.The story is about Opus, a penguin, who asks Santa for a pair of wings that work. He tries everything from therapy to balloons in order to fly. The ending really shows the meaning of Christmas and is, in my opinion, the best Christmas story (and should be shown on TV again). This is a great video that any kid would really enjoy and one that their parents will look forward to as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD please","review":"This is a light hearted, wonderful story of confused priorities and multiple epiphanies. The cinematic allusions are a delight, and the music is a Joy. It may prove a bit quirky for the strict traditionalist, but once you get over that, it wears extremely well. I am saddened to read that it is out of print; in these times of self-absorbed acquisitiveness, a DVD release might set in motion at least a tiny counterbalance of decency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the memories!","review":"My brother and I have been trying to get this movie for years since we are the only people we know who saw it on tv for the brief time it aired.

The movie is good, but the disc was awful.It refused to play on two of our Blu-Ray players (different makes and models), so we ended up having to watch it on an old Sony portable DVD player where it worked fine. When inserted into one PC it just seeks forever (blinking light, motor whirring up and down) and hangs the PC (everything is stuck waiting on reading the media). When inserted into another PC with Slysoft AnyDVD, it said there was no media in the drive. When inserted into a third PC it worked fine.It was clean with no scratches or other marks, just couldn't be read by most players in our house. Since this is a newer release, I'm guessing the studio tried to add some sort of new copy protection scheme, but that's just a guess. Could just be bad quality control or cheap blanks.In any case, I would suggest getting the other version, the older release without the bonus music CD, unless you have multiple DVD players to try this in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jenny - bookaholic- dream job: book reviewer full time","review":"This is one of my favorite cartoons of all time.

Right after I finished reading My Only Love, I was left with a longing for the book to go on and on and on and on!I loved the way the author wrote about Adam and Maggie, the way she described their feelings, it felt so real. The secondary characters Paul and Anne were great as well. It was actually 2 romances in one book.When I was reading My Only Love, especially the part when Adam found out about Charles and Maggie.... oh gosh, my heart was beating so loud I thought my next door neighbours could hear it! It was so heart wrenching!I laughed and suffered with the characters and felt the passion Adam and Maggie had for each other.When I read a book and the book makes me experience the feelings of the characters, then I know I have a keeper!For those who want good old fashion romance THIS BOOK IS A MUST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Cold Heroes This is for You","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. I felt so bad for the heroine throughout the book even when she is with her man who supposedly loves her. I think the girl had it bad enough that she had no money and was forced to sell herself, but no our hero did not show any remorse, understanding or love towards her. He was mean to her. In fact once when they were talking she told him \\"you have hurt me before, I don't mind if you do now\\" (when talking about sex). This book is awful awful!! But of course if you like men who are cold and unloving and heroines who have no backbone and suffer because of the hero and then give in easily, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know about the other reviews but...","review":"I thought this book was awful. The only thing about this book that was good was the secondary characters, James and Annie. Adam the \\"hero\\" constantly let Maggie know her position in his life as his mistress,not anyone who he would consider marrying. He constantly called her derogatory terms which I will not repeat. The first chapter of the book Adam was great and it goes downhill from there. Maggie rarely showed any backbone towards Adam, but it is hard to blame her because she is an innocent. After reading this book I felt disappointed in love. James the secondary character should have been the main character. He treated women the way they should be treated.

First, the author desperately needed some practice of the writer's rule: Show don't tell. She had the characters' telling boring long paragraph after paragraph of their lives when a sentence would have sufficed. And that Ariel goes to her writing student's house for the first time for lunch and by meal's end is moving in there to live; it just didn't ring true. The characters were not very likeable and the twins really seemed immature.

Unfortunately, none of the others was available in the e-book format.In this age of TV chefs and their cooking shows, It's great to find a book that explores the restaurant world, and what can happen when tempers flare in the kitchen.

I've only read Didion's \\"A Year of Magical Thinking\\" and a few essays prior to this \\"novel\\". Joan should stick to essays and first person accounts. Democracy, as another reviewer stated, is a compliation of glimpses. Everything is glimpses and in order to fill it out to novel length, Didion puffs it up by adding herself as the novelist to the mix.The novel is utterly pointless, the characters are thinly developed, even the heroine, the plot is aimless, and the timeline is staggeringly difficult to keep up with.

Another rock opera/concept album from Towser, but unlike \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia,\\" one that is filled with between-songs dialogue that is, quite frankly, annoying. Townshend, like Ray Davies, is still a genius in my book, but this drivel only goes to underline the fact that John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey are the real rock and roll heart of The Who (at least since the death of Keith Moon).

For me the dialogue became a major distraction. It comes right in the middle of songs and is sometimes so straight-forward and literal that it makes the wonderful abstractness of music completely absent.I normally love Townshend's style of aschewing normal rock structures and really producing what I consider high art, but Pscychodelerict can derelict my balls.

Maybe the music- only version is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete Townshend bring's his Lifehouse project back to life.","review":"Psychoderelict is about a washed up pop star who tries to reinvent himself though the media and a life long project.This can be looked at as not only a self parody (and indulgent) but as a way to bring back LifeHouse into the public eye. Many of the unreleased material from the project appear in the album. Psychoderlict was a sucess and Pete brought his work on the road and performed the concept album live. After going back to the drawing board, Pete would sucessfully bring back Lifehouse (before tarnishing his legacy by playing with the Who again).Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the intellectual","review":"I don't know how that person from Silver Spring, MD got so little from this album. I bought it when it came out and immediately became hooked into the storyline.

The other problem is the mechanism that connects the two sides together fails and the thing keeps popping apart.I haven't had this Bamboo one very long, but it was obvious on the first use that the blade is much sturdier and does not bend nearly as much.

On traditional and traditional sounding material, he's marvellous, a lulling, authoritative presence, and even the milkier contemporary stuff sounds okay under his command. This is a first-rate collection that gathers fourteen of the best performances Tyrrell's made since he began recording solo work in 1996. Some of the songs are familiar from other singers, other tracks are new; they all sound nice. If you enjoy Celtic music's vocal tradition, this is a fine album -- very listenable and with a strong song selection. Celtic music veteran Davy Spillane plays tin whistle and uilleann pipes on a couples of tunes; otherwise Tyrrell brings his own crew with him, talented newcomers who match his rich, resonant style.

In it I encountered a \\"woman's blend\\" of romance, mystery, and suspense that seemed initially engaging. There was also a big element of \\"action/violence\\" that seemed to have strayed from another genre.McKinney's Louisiana \\"downhome\\" sayings are fresh and unjaded, and her language escapes cliches. The love/sex scenes are well portrayed with the right touches of physical allure and emotional involvement.In spite of her deft phrases and skillful dialogue, I found \\"Still of the Night\\" too formulaic, as if conforming to a careful outline with a strange spin intended to appeal to women and men alike. From its promising opening pages, I expected another kind of book. I missed the integrity of a full-hearted, cleaner romantic novel it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read all of her books and found this one disappointing. The two main characters were interesting and well drawn but the villains were extreme and not believable. The ending was rushed and not really satisfying after all the build up. There were several areas given a lot of attention but then did not get wrapped up (e.g., her interest in period photography, the sheriff's twisted homelife). I have generally enjoyed her previous books and hope her future offerings will be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This book was boring. What is meagan Mckinney doing, her older books, My Wicked Enchantress were good but these new ones are tiresome.

The minutiae of contracts and deals are offered up but rarely is Watkins's involvement mentioned.This failure to address her part in the company, for good or ill, leaves me wondering if she simply didn't see the handwriting on the wall and write her infamous memo just to do a little CYA. There's also an unpleasant whiff of sour grapes - she never got the money she thought she deserved. If she had, would she have stayed silent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"A very compelling read. One of those books that you wish had waited a couple of years so the authors could comment on whatever will happen to Andy Fastow, Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, et al.

Adelphia... of the recent major corporate failures, Enron's was the most egregious of all. An insider's account, this book serves as a case study in aggressive corporate accounting as well as pursuit of profit and an ever-rising stock price in 1990's corporate America. This was capitalism gone horribly wrong.In places it gets a bit too technical for non-accountants, but overall this was a highly engaging treatment of the factors leading to Enron's late-2001 demise. The character sketches (Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Rebecca Mark, and the infamous Andy Fastow, among others), in particular, help to put more of a human face on the greatest corporate failure of our time.

The insight into the personalities of Jeffrey Skilling and Andy Fastow. Where she loses it is when she tries to make us believe that Sherron Watkins is heroic. Baloney! Ms. Watkins was just as greedy, just as nasty, just as self-serving as the rest of them. She only wrote the memo to Ken Lay to protect her job, not from viewpoint of a corporate savior. She was just worried as to where she is going to get her obscene bonus. Her salary was excessive to the point of disgust. She still has the arrogance of an Arthur Andersen accountant. I would love to have been her boss as well as Andy Fastow's boss. They both would have been on the street before sundown. Thank you, Mimi, for a well written book. Shame on you Sherron for your greed and lack of ethics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Many good insigts into the background in the fall of Enron.This book does not get too technical and is an easy read.I found interesting the exploration of the characters of Enron into their personalities and behaviors.

Sherron Watkins saved buckets for the book. More than once I would have to stop reading and just stare at the page in sheer disbelief.

The band perform in broad daylight to a bored crowd that is far more interested in their picnic spreads. Killing Joke is NOT a daylight band.

The movie's action sequences are borrowed from countless other films, and only the film's sincere attempt to take itself serious keeps it from being a true bomb.

The first pair- I've been using for over 20+ years (still have them- just lost the nitrogen purge). That first set was also a pentax. This is why I went with Pentax again.

Finally the guy behind the counter hands these over to me, and said they were the ones he owned, and were better than anything the big three had to offer in that price range. He didn't need to convince me; I could see the difference immediately - the images were brighter and clearer; everything seemed better illuminated through the Pentax. It took me less than a minute to decide. My wife walks with these binoculars nearly every day, and absolutely loves them. Every once in a while I'll use them and always give myself a little pat on the back for having chosen them.I'm buying my wife a camera next, and it's probably going to be a Pentax.

I was first introduced to The Blind Boys of Alabama a few years ago when I went to see them with my grandmother in Charleston, NC (soulful live performers) they were GREAT! My favorite song on the album is \\"I Know I've Been Converted\\" lead by founding member Jimmy Carter who belts and testifies about turning his life and spirit over to God (Hallelujah).

But out of the ten songs that comprised the CD, I only really found myself connecting to track 2 \\"Demons\\" and track 9 \\"Presence of the Lord\\". The rest of the tracks were nice, which is to say mediocre.

It is completely unoriginal and features little involvement from Crosby on the songs. He wrote about 2 of them. It features Crosby singing with synthesizers and a backing band backing him up. He doesn't even play any guitar. Also, Crosby has lost all his vocal originality as heard on his CSNY songs (Long Time Gone, Almost Cut My Hair etc).We know what side of the hill Crosby's on now (over it). Neil Young is still cranking out good stuff. Not so for Crosby. Don't buy this album unless you own every recording David Crosby has ever made. Look to his heyday in the 70s when he did his best work with CSNY or Younger than Yesterday, his last album with the Byrds (he wrote almost half of the songs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"history, please","review":"For those who know little of Rock history, rather than \\"ripping off Joni Mitchell\\", David Crosby was around for years before she became popular, with the Byrds.

I loved it. It made me think...got me more involved then death of a salesman did. It took serveral readings to get the full jist of it.

In the process, they confront old grudges, relieve guilt over past wrongs, and learn the difference between material success and spiritual fulfillment - all major themes in Miller's output as a whole. Symbolism, a technique seen in such previous Miller plays as ALL MY SONS and DEATH OF A SALESMAN, is very important in THE PRICE, as well: different objects in the Franz home represent different ideas. What is unusual for Miller is the inclusion of a comic relief character: the ancient dealer Gregory Solomon, who comes to set a price on the furniture. Wise Solomon's appearances provide highly amusing commentary on the essential conflict between the brothers. THE PRICE is a fascinating gem of a play that only seems more so with repeated readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"bought it for a 06 mazda 3,it said it fit, i emailed the seller to make sure, he said \\"its a perfect fit for your car\\" it came said for a mustang on the package, i returned it, about 27 days ago still no refund, never buying from this seller again, not happy and weres my money? don't buy from them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on...","review":"I am an advanced user and found this product to be incredibly frustrating.

I still consider Boz to be very underrated and 'Middle Man' really brings out the great vocals, songwriting and sophisticated production job. This is a very tight, listenable CD. JoJo, Breakdown Dead Ahead, and Isn't It Time are wonderful songs, that when you think about it, were really kind of ahead of their time, since I believe this was from 1979. Boz ranks among of the best, and became one of the real slick performers of the era along with Steely Dan, The Doobie Brothers and Little Feat. This is definitely worth the price and you'll want to keep listening to it as time goes by."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great Boz album...","review":"David Foster really rescued this artist from oblivion when he produced MIDDLE MAN, a stylish, groovy and hook-laden rock n' roll-infused album that became the last great Boz Scaggs release. From the opening jazzy riff of \\"Jo-Jo\\" to the road-house blues of \\"Breakdown\\" to the inspirational balladry of \\"Isn't It Time\\", this album is ecclectic enough to appeal to many tastes while at the same time remaining true to well-crafted songwriting arrangements.

So often authors don't deliver on their promises and claims. Despite its self-helpish title, I think this book provides a fresh look at personal renewal and practical solutions that are carefully described in the lives of the people they talk about. It's written to address overworked executives, but it applies to anyone whose life is OUT OF BALANCE. You may not relate to the stories of the executive life, but the tools are thoughtful and invaluable. Using rituals is an old idea, but in the context of managing energy, it takes on greater significance. I finished the book with a sense of joy that I could accomplish so much more than I thought just by managing my energy better. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFE IS A MARATHON","review":"One major disagreement I have with the author is that LIFE IS A MARATHON and not a series of sprints as he suggests. His assumption is wrong and that's where his model crumbles like a cookie. In real life, we experience constant stress; it's the same experience we have running a marathon. We have a goal, we pace ourselves, we hydrate and nourish, we dig deep, and finally go for the finishing kick! That's how we want to live our lives. We want to win and everybody loves a winner!There's no real sense of victory in sprints, only a fleeting rush of adrenaline. A lot of factors can influence how and when we finish a sprint. These factors can spell the difference of a few milliseconds. But a marathon is brutally frank. You either finish it or you don't; it's up to how much you've trained for it and how much you really want it. Pure guts and glory, and no excuses. That's what life is, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nothing new here. Eat right, get plenty of sleep and drink your water and you too can have more energy.

All positive reviews influenced my decision to give it a go. I completely agree with another reviewer who said this book is all about common sense. Basically, you have to use your energy and make sure you recover it, i.e. work and make sure you leave yourself some time to play. Add exercise and healthy eating to it and bingo, you've got the power of full engagement. In this book, you will find pages and pages of examples from research and psychology of sports performance backing the idea of work and play.Save yourself some time and money and just make sure you actually do it instead of reading this book.

Unfortunately, the subject was considered to be too \\"vague\\" and I changed the topic.Building new rituals of behavior is easier said than done, though.

It is the big picture 'cure'. I've read some of 'the best' ratings self-help books and i must say this is definitely the most useful/helpful to the general public in today's modern world. Most 'self-help' books fail in that they are often centered/focus around a theme that is a ''small picture'' of a problem, maybe they do often some short-term solution, but they do not provide a solution of the root at the problem. This book is the overall, fundamental, big picture solution.My honest opinion is that this book is helpful to almost everyone(who knows how to read obviously) ranging from a CEO of a MNC to a college student or housewife."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get through this, you don't have a problem!","review":"Maybe I just didn't give it enough of a chance or maybe my energy and attention level is so far out of whack that even this book couldn't help.

I almost thought it was going to have a big fold-out page at the end that said \\"CONGRATS, YOU MADE IT THROUGH THE MOST BORING BOOK EVER. YOU ARE CURED!\\"Another major problem of this book is that it sites very specific examples which did not help me at all. I'm not a 9-5 Lawyer, I don't get lunch breaks and if you can explain to my 5 yr old that \\"Daddy just needs more sleep in the morning!\\" I'll buy YOUR book!Hey, if you are down in the dumps and need something to help you, then any port in a storm I say and good luck to you.

Every person has different biorhythms, and the concept is that to accomplish what you want, you need to train your body to maximize your energy when you need it, just as an athlete trains everyday to get the job done when it counts. The Power of Full Engagement was full of common sense and anecdotal stories of how other people 'trained' to manage their energy (fluff).There was nothing new in the book, if you have read other self-help or motivation books. I also felt like this book was written to promote the author's institute that trained several high-profile athletes too many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ENGAGING NEW PARADIGM","review":"Full engagment is achieved when four sources of energy (primary capacities)-physical, emotional, mental and spiritual-supported by a variety of habits, are all positive in quality and strong, yielding vigor, confidence, a sense of challenge, joyfulness and connectedness. The book shows how people can reach this zone of full engagement (physically energized, mentally focused, emotionally connected, and spiritually aligned).The book can be used as a basic guide to self development and the coaching others. This work presents an engaging new paradigm, useful in understanding organization as a reservoir of energy, and how to tap into its potential. Part II of the book presents a training system for realizing this potential on an organization-wide basis. An excellent book in content and scope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time","review":"I work as a stress management trainer for humanitarian relief and development workers around the world, so I've read a lot of self-help books in my time.

Every track just flows into the next and the vibe and feel throughout makes me get chills all over. This is the perfect musical companion for doing yoga, chill out while driving and just sexy and sensual for anything fun in the bedroom!! WOW...Great packaging and great artwork as well.

It crosses electronica, world music and new age and fuses them into an experienes of pure blissful grooves.Time to play loud and get my groove on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Midler was born to play Rose","review":"The music is amazing and Bette Midler could not be more perfect for the role of Rose. Just discovered Lacey Chabert (Mean Girls, Party of Five) did the acting/singing for the role of Baby June! She is also an insane talent. Cynthia Gibb is perfect as Louise, transforming from mild mannered mama's girl to slinky sexpot flawlessly. GREAT version- I just can't imagine Patti LuPone or Angela Lansbury or ANYONE else playing Rose quite like Bette Midler."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good remake","review":"This \\"Gypsy\\" recording is a very well made recording. The orchestra sounds fabulous, if not a bit mechanical at times. Bette sounds a little weak as Mama Rose. Having seen the video many times, I feel one really needs to see the film to get the true power behind her interpretation. Cynthia Gibbs as Louise has a very pleasant voice. In fact, everyone on this recording has a nice voice, but nothing special. I was very pleased that all of the dance music for \\"Baby June and Her Farm Boys\\" was included. However, I would opt for the Lansbury \\"Gypsy\\" instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadway's brightest returns in the perfect role","review":"Bette Midler in Gypsy was perfect casting, Bette IS momma Rose. Her Voice is perfect for the role. It is good to hear her belting for more than just a few notes. And with Music by Jules Styne and Lyrics By Stephin Sondhiem you know you are in for a treat when listening to this album. I have owned this recording for about five years and it remains one of my favorites. I also recommend the Tyne Daly cast recording it is great. Whatever you do do not get Ethel Merman! Bette And Tyne are the only ones worth your money. Bette's rendision of rose's turn is the best out there. Supporting actress Christine Ebersol (now Starring in 42nd Street) is wonderful as Tessy Turra. Gypsy is a classic and this album will soon be a classic recording. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"I just saw GYPSY and the well-known actress, Patti LuPone, playing and singing Mama Rose was superb. Her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is Rose. She soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever.I came home and put on Midler's Gypsy, and it sounded flat, stale, weary, unprofitable. I have always liked Bette Midler, but this CD seems to have no dynamic, no sparkle. I think that you need a true Broadway diva to sing Rose, and perhaps even one with some operatic experience.I can only fervantly pray that the Ravinia Festival will release a DVD or a CD of the LuPone production.It may be unfair to compare Roses. Midler does excel in different material but I don't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is Madame Rose and to sing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Midler and Cynthia Gibb make a team","review":"Bette Midler's brilliant big beautiful voice matched Mamma Rose perfectly. She fills the room with energy and exitment. But you would expect that from a Golden Globe, Emmy, and Grammy award winner wouldn't you. Cynthia Gibb's delicate honest voice was perfectly fitted for Louise and her transition to a Big and confident voice was excellent for the role of Gypsy Rose Lee. The songs are clear and the music is great. This CD is definetly a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of Laughter","review":"If you haven't listened to this recording by now, you should just move to BFE, Montana and raise goats or something. Mr. Leary had me rolling on the floor in fits of laughter with this jem of a stand-up routine. The only thing I don't like about it is they didn't have enough room to fit all of the material contained in the Showtime performance on the CD. However, I have probably listened to the CD more times than I have seen the video. A must-see if you have any sense of humor whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLY HILLARIOUS!","review":"This is the funniest CD I have ever bought! It is a must buy CD.

As far as all the allegations of plagiarism i could really car less. No cure for cancer was crazy funny. This follow up was just plain lazy. sadly it seems with most comics there is a big slump after there early material. George Carlin is the only guy i can think of that was consistently brilliant right up until his death. Anyway avoid this, even if you are a big Leary fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Comedy Nerds","review":"Attention Comedy Nerds: The comparisons to Bill Hicks are ignorant of the facts. The bits and jokes collected on this disc are, as any comic would admit, of the kind that anybody would come up with. But to say it's a Bill Hicks ripoff? Where's that coming from? Bill Hicks started in the 70s and 80s in Texas. Denis Leary started in the 70s and 80s in Boston. To say this sounds like Bill Hicks is quite a compliment as Bill Hicks has become a forgotten icon of the late 1980s of standup comedy. But sure, most of these tracks are not unique jokes. Everybody had stuff about the war and drugs and women. Everybody still has stuff about the war and drugs and women. But unlike Bill Hicks's even paced delivery, you get classic Denis Leary: fast talking rants that can go on and on, never slowing down, makes you feel like you've just chain smoked your own pack and downed a few fifths when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, yet forged","review":"When this CD first surfaced in the mid 90's people were falling over themselves with laughter, I remember hearing \\"That Leary guy is HYSTERICAL!\\" I too agree, he did a good set on this cd, and it's a great first appearance on disc. Shortly after, I found out where that talent was coming from...Bill Hicks. Do yourself a big favor: get a Hicks CD. Leary is a puppet, mimicking only the finer parts of Bill Hicks career by cutting-and-pasting good material into his average shtick. If you don't know who Bill Hicks is, I don't blame you for being uninformed, I only ask that you go find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denis Leary rips off Bill Hicks","review":"Anyone who has listened to the great comedian Bill Hicks will recognize where Denis Leary gets all his best stuff. Leary was a ho-hum Boston journeyman until Hicks died & Leary appropriated all his stuff. Considering the title of this CD, it's ironic that Hicks died of Cancer. If there was a cure for cancer, Leary wouldn't have a career. A pox on this plagiarist. Point your Browser to the Bill Hicks section and get the real thing. I recommend \\"Rant in E-Minor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stole his best ideas from Bill Hicks-- And it shows--","review":"Is Denis Leary listenable?

That's all I can say after listening to this CD. This CD has so much stolen material on it, that I doubt that Leary even bought the clothes that he was wearing on the cover photo. Almost everything that you hear on this was done by Bill Hicks -a much smarter, more inventive, way funnier comedian. It isn't just that Leary stole the bits - he virtually lifts them word for word. He also stole from several comedians in the Boston area that were of that time (mid 1980s). Even his ending bit - about how we only kill the cute animals was stolen... I know - I was around then. In buying this CD, I just had to hear for myself. Sure enough, it was a tremendous disapointment to hear several comedian's routines being paraded before me. Honestly, save your money and buy any of Bill Hick's CD's. They are MUCH MUCH FUNNIER, and worth far more."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hail Hicks","review":"I used to think this CD was funny until I heard the original material done by the guy Dennis stole it from, Bill Hicks. Some of the material on this is taken nearly word-for-word from Hicks' performances.

The Flying Saucers are coming for you Dennis, and they ain't happy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cure for plagarism.","review":"This album has a lot of funny material. Unfortunately, it was originally written & performed by the late, great Bill Hicks. For proof, pick up Hicks' CDs - you'll find some jokes lifted word for word. And, Bill died (far too young) from cancer. Is Denis trying to confess his sins through the title of his show/CD? So, even though there are laughs to be had, I cannot support a comic who stole everything lock, stock, and barrel from a superior, deceased comedian."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cure for Cancer","review":"It is true that quite a bit of the material from this album resembles Bill Hicks's material from \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"Relentless\\". Leary even does a routine on Jim Fixx, a fixture of early Bill Hicks's routines. Most of his rants on music artists also sound very similar or almost exactly the same as Bill Hicks's routines.However, Denis Leary does have original material. Some of it is quite funny. And his song \\"A-hole\\" is pretty good too. Unfortunately, too much of this CD sounds like Bill Hicks to ignore. This would be a pretty good comedy CD if there was more original material. I would recommend to get any Bill Hick's CD instead of \\"No Cure for Cancer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved him until I listen to Bill Hicks","review":"Ok, first off, I'm not writing a bad review about Leary because he isn't funny, it's because he uses stolen material. I was a Leary fan since I heard No Cure for Cancer 3 years ago, and this summer I was buying Lock n Load, and this guy working there told me if I wanted real comedy, get a Bill Hicks CD. The only one they had was Rant in E Minor. The guy told me Denis had stolen Bill's material, some word for word, and some disguised. Since then I feel sick listening to Leary do Bill's material. I have to admit Leary is funny, but if you want the real deal, start listening to Hicks. If you are smart and take my advice DO NOT get the Best of Bill Hicks, because there is no best of Bill Hicks. Everything he says is genius.\\"You have to admit beliefs are odd.

About a week back, after an interval of 14 years and having heard and LOVED Bill Hicks's routines since, I saw it again and barely raised a titter.Do read 'American Scream' (biography of Bill Hicks)to learn about a comic with REAL integrity who truly 'played from the heart', as he was so found of urging us all to do. Then see if Leary's erzatz imitation does much for you.And yes, it doesn't look too good that the end of Leary's stand-up career coincided with Hicks's death.I say this reluctantly because I have only looked into the matter recently, and have actually been a fan of Leary for 14 years, both as stand-up and actor - but once you check out Hicks's work and look into the facts, it's hard to have respect for Leary any more.The amazing thing is that he got away with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny back then... and still funny now!","review":"I thought this was hilarious when I first heard the CD back in the early 90's.

Very little original material now. The late 90's and early 2000's used up all the \\"shock material\\".Same reason there are so many movie remakes. There's very little original material anymore. And for crying out loud, has anyone turned on the radio lately... there's nothing original there either.

Likewise, I became an instant Bill Hicks fan upon being exposed to his work. Both Leary and Hicks have the same raw, hard style and both focus much on the condemnation of modern society (not condemning modern society - that is one of their messages: modern society has condemned itself). Yet they are very different comedians nonetheless. For my money, any work by either artist is worth the investment. Even when they are not at their funniest, they are still levels above the norm and well worth overlooking their, ahem, language choices if such things as 'cursewords' offend your senses.*marks a bush and scratches dirt*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand-up does not get much better than this","review":"For Denis, nothing is immune to ridicule - drugs, terminal illness and even meat-eating.

Please do yourself a favor and listen to someone else with something original to say.I think the fact that Leary has stooped to doing Quaker State commercials tells the whole story. This guy doesn't even believe his own schtick and is willing to do anything if you dangle a check in front of his face.Yeah, there's no cure for cancer. That's why Bill Hicks died.

A total of 30 seconds after I opened the shipping envelope. It looked like the top two mounting posts were never glued, and the bottom two posts just snapped off. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. The Krussell All Metal Clips are much better. (Though out of stock by all vendors on Amazon.)

I ordered this for a lightsaber holder. After I put my saber in a few times, it fell apart. It should not have done that. Also it came in a little plastic bag, and not a plastic bubble case. Also it was all black, with no white. I am forced to keep this because I have no money to send it back and no way to currently do so. I am very sad and dissapointed and say you should not buy this. If there quality control is that bad, then why bother buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for real Jomada fans!","review":"I'm guessing the record company forced them to make this set. It's a true disservice when artists step away from the genre that people love them for just for the sake of \\"crossing over\\". This album is full of uninspired generic R&B tunes. The only real standout is \\"I Cried The Tears\\". I wasted my money this and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Yes this item is big and bulky, but it works, and it's inexpensive. I have bought this item 3 times, cause the first two broke, but this third one has lasted over 3 years now. just gotta find a spot for it and leave it there. I think I fiddled with the other ones too much.What i dont like is while on a long car trip and you have to switching channels, cause you have to switch the dial on your radio station as well as the unit. The switch is on the side of the unit out of view, so it's a little difficult to change while driving. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun! - Go Hildegarde","review":"Our son is 16 month old and we weren't sure whether the book would be too old for him.

It's a great instrumental funk group with horns, guitar, percussion, etc. Shields and guitarist Andy Scott really stand out.

The group also put out a second album called \\"Life Out There,\\" which is also highly recommended if you can find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every cut is good!!","review":"These guys can play.

The vocals, I am sorry to say, are the least complimentary. Knight's voice is flat and at times harsh. I have listened to the CD several times in order to try to change my mind but have not. In my opinion, it would definitely be better as an instrumental CD. There is a lot of other goddess/pagan music I would recommend before this CD. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, addictive program","review":"I am English, living the US with a 3 year old son. We go back to the UK every 6 months and the first thing my son asks for is Pocoyo.The animation is great - plain backgrounds (at least in the first 2 series) which allows you to concentrate on the characters. Wonderful expressions and music and simple ideas about sharing, caring, being careful and being friends.I am ECSTATIC that this is finally available in the US.The thing that most appealed to me as a parent was 1) the shows are short, about 10-12 minutes 2) right now, the product is not commercialized (although that will probably change soon enough) 3) the ideas are simple yet convey quite a range of emotion - for example my son can understand that Pocoyo is sorry when he breaks his sister's toy.If your child is watching TV, I would say this is a great addition. And you'll enjoy it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong aspect ratio","review":"I like Pocoyo a lot. It's a great show. The reason I'm giving this dvd only 2 stars is because it's squashed. The show is broadcast at 4:3 but for some reason the people who put this dvd out squished it down to make it widescreen. The characters aren't as appealing when they are squashed.

The stories entertaining and very imaginative. What I love is how amazing the animation is and how non-verbally expressive each character is.

I think they'd truly get a kick out this set of ignorant Tyrones.Their type is a testament to what festers and grows in the backwoods of the southern black american rap scene. This non-creative pair of twins, between them, share the vocabulary of a retarded chipmunk. If you're desperately looking for something, anything, to waste your money on, find a pantomime at your local neighborhood park. Watch the pantomime for five minutes and then pay him for his perfomance. The pantomime's performance couldn't possibly be any worse than what you will hear on the blah blah twins album.So, if you're into listening to two supposed \\"men\\" who stand at a mic and rattle off every curse word they know at the top of their lungs, you'll love these clowns.

It is NOT meant to be taken seriously, but is a great way to chill out or get your krunk on. It's great for bouncing in your car or whatever, it just has to be fun.

With an irrepressible bark, these two southern lightweight try to weigh in against the likes of Outkast. Ludacris, and David Banner and surprisingly to the fact they are far inferior, they squeeze in there. First off this album, was \\"Naggin'\\" which was a nag to hear, then was \\"Salt Shaker\\" which squishes and farts along.If their lyrics were good, I'd be willing to overlook the fact of their lackluster beats. \\"Five dollars get your ass a table dance, If you got ten then bring a friend\\" and \\"Drankin everyday like gasoline in the car, you can find me at the bar\\" they bark, Ludacris would laugh in their faces at lines like this.The twins need to learn to pro-nun-ci-ate things and quit with the throwback (or should I say throwaway) beats."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is terrible","review":"what is wrong with you people?! it sounds like some idiot trying to sing deathmetal vocals with rap. i dont like rap to begin with but now i hate the crap.all of you other idiots could you a spell check with your damn ebonics.

It is very light weight so it quickly tips over. My granddaughter enjoyed dragging it around on it's side and it made the adults laugh. But it definitely does not make any barking sounds just an annoying cranking noise. The tail is loose but doesn't wag.

I got it when my 14-month-old because he was just starting to walk and he loves puppies. However, he's not too interested in this toy.

My son is now 16-months-old and he walks really well, but he's still not interested in this toy. A few times I've seen him try to play with it, but he just lifts the \\"leash\\" up and ends up carrying the dog around... instead of \\"walking\\" the dog.

If you are an adult and can pull and walk smoothly, then it's great, but no toddler can pull it smoothly while walking at the same time. The toy immediately tips over and my nieces are instead dragging it across my hardwood floors, which a) upsets my nieces because they want to walk a dog the way grown ups do and are smart enough to know you don't just drag your dog along the sidewalk and b)it scratches my nice hardwood floors. We instead gave it to our 6 month old son, because at his age all he wants to do is bang things with his hands repeatedly.

It's also kind of hard to follow and understand, picking 4 different types of travelers that you have to relate to, and not one of us on our trip did...

Sprague de Camp shares the benefits of his vast knowledge with a general audience. Dividing his subject---the early days of engineering and technology---by period and place, he shows how often-humble beginnings led to spectacular structures.

Or the Colossus of Rhodes? Or those huge walls, aqueducts or temples? Sprague de Camp shows in a very entertaining and engaging manner how the ancients were as intelligent as we are today and many a lot more so. They didn't have modern technology but they did have ample curiosity, ingenuity and derring-do. A must read for anyone interested in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Magic","review":"The Ancient Engineers is a very informative book. It discusses \\"Technology and invention from the earliest times to the Renaissance,\\" and is packed with useful information for historians and those who enjoy history. De Camp begins his nonfiction book interestingly, discussing Ancient life and the probability of something being invented. He talks about how when there are more people and more people with more leisure time, the chances of someone inventing something or there being a break-through in science increases dramatically. This book is highly recommended to all, although since it can be boring to those uninterested in history or reading, don't read it unless you're a reading or history maven. If you do like medieval warfare and technology though, this book will be of the greatest use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set","review":"Good quality set of blocks.

The book deals specifically with the airborne drops and landings around the Hague with numerous individual and small unit accounts. I was surprised at the large number of incidents where the Germans used prisoners and civilians as human shields and I am still wondering if it is a bias by the author. Also, the vast number of elite fallschirmjagers surrendering in penny-packets, while factual to a degree, seems excessive. Perhaps it is only the author dwelling on these aspect too much. The author also goes out of his way to point out the lack of British support and cowardly actions of these troops that did land to provide support.The book is organized by day and sums up the overall events before moving on to the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuando naciò nnuestro primer hijo,","review":"fue como si mi esposa hubiera muerto para mi...Yo no le habìa causado ninguna pena, pero me lanzò al abandono y a la soledad.Me hizo sentirme como un extraño que solo tenìa la obligaciòn de llevar a casa el dinero para los pañales y el pediatra...Estuvimos al borde de la separaciòn,hasta que ESTE LIBRO LA HIZO VER LA REALIDAD...Hemos vuelto a ser felices y ya no tengo celos del bebè..¡Lo adoro !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I pray for the PREY TO END!","review":"Dull Friday/Burning clone featuring a huge forest-fire-disfiguredkiller gypsy(played by Struycken from ADDAMS FAMILY and WITCHES ofEASTWICK)murdering the usual bunch of overaged teens.

Torch Editor Wade Keller did a phenomenal job hosting the DVD. When talking to Ed Ferrara about the DVD project, he explained to me that he didn't think he would ever do this type of interview unless Wade was hosting.

What originally drew me to Kenny's music was the combination of Rock and Country. This CD lacks the spark. The songs are average at best. I'm a huge Kenny Chesney fan... and for the most part, I think his music is top-notch. I hope his next CD to this one will return to his what he truly excels at - a country/rock artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny is the $hit","review":"Great CD.

What kind of message are we trying to impart on young people with the kind of lyrics on this trashy song? The rest aren't much better. And Chesney, well, its obvious that what the ladies are going for are the looks because the talent is not there. Also included here are two more \\"beach themed\\" songs....\\"Outta Here Chesney\\" and \\"Old Blue Chair\\" which is featured on the \\"ISLAND\\" CD. What a waste of money. One more question. Where have all the good producers of country music gone?

(I'm on Fire, Come Monday, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Chesney ROCKS!!!!","review":"I just saw Kenny Chesney last night. He totally ROCKS. He is just fantastic and so is this CD. This is one of those CDs that takes awhile to grow on you - but when you really LISTEN to the words... and then when you know what heartfelt emotion went in to writing these songs you really get a whole new perspective. Kenny Chesney has come a LONG way in all of the years that I have listened to him (about 4 now) and he ranks right up there with the best of them. His concert was sold out last night - and I could have sat there another 2 hours! I think that one of my favorite songs on this cd has to be Please Come to Boston (bonus track) and The Woman with you. I love Kenny and his Jimmy Buffetishness - he's GREAT with his toes in the sand and a drink in his hand. He makes you WANT to slow down and enjoy life.Get this CD - you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THESE SONGS LIVE","review":"This is by far one of Kenny's best cd's ever. I think it is ridiculous how anybody who has ever bought a kenny chesney cd can give this release any bad reviews. You obviously do not know country music, and you dont know Kenny Chesney. Anyway, this cd is a perfect blend of country songs. It ranges from reflecting on meaningful moments from his past to having a few drinks and soaking up some rays. How can any country fan not get goosebumps when listening to songs such as: \\"There Goes My Life\\", \\"When I Think About Leaving\\", and \\"Please Come to Boston\\". This is the format every artist should follow and I can't wait until my friends and I get to see him in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE For your cd collection","review":"I bought this cd when it first came out, and I can't get enough of it. I love Kenny and love his music, this cd will not disappoint you! Every song is great, and even the bonus tracks are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could Anyone Like This?","review":"I just don't understand how anybody can enjoy this childish predictable music. I mean all of his last \\"hit\\" songs are all about the same things. And that is about growing up. I mean come on now think of a new subject already. It almost seems like he just keeps changing the lyrics ever so slightly in all of the songs. They almost always have lines about being young, your first kiss, or something generic. The words are just so plain and nondescript, just like the music. I just feel like this guy is one of the most boring looking unoriginal performers of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"H O R R I B L E","review":"I love Kenny's music but this cd really does nothing for me. His new music is all starting to sound very similar to the songs he's recorded in the past.

Baldy has never sounded so bored and disinterested throughout. And what's with collaborating with that no talent Uncle Kracker? Uncle Kracker may find Baldy's tractor sexy, but they need to keep their musical careers separate."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT cd!","review":"Not country? Hello guys Kenny is amazing! I love this cd so much, Kenny has an amazing voice. He is singing about what he loves, just having fun and making music about it. I really do not see what all these people have against the songs on this cd. 'There Goes My Life' is a beautiful song, and 'When The Sun Goes Down' is just WAY too much fun to sing and listen to. I have every cd kenny has made and this has got to be one of my favorites. Kenny isnt trying to go all rock on us, he just wants to sing fun songs and have a good time; which he does. Everybody should at least give this cd a chance, because you will be blown away by Kennys amazing talent and voice. Oh yea and another thing, I have made HUGE country fans out of the most devout rock, pop, and rap fans using Kennys work. He is so much fun, sings great songs, and puts on a GREAT show. I just love this cd so much and everything that he has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect soundtrack for when the sun goes down!","review":"I absolutely love this cd! It took me a couple times listening to it to really into it, but once I did I was completely hooked. I think its one of Kenny's best. Sometimes, there are those certain cds that just put you in a great mood when you listen to them. For me, this is it. It reminds me of great times that I had when I was younger and brings back forgotten memories. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title track alone was worth it!","review":"I bought this album after I heard (and heard over and over again) the title track WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. I could not get the melody out of my head! When I heard the album, I was just blown away! Being Drunk's A Lot Like Loving You is, to me, the most memorable song in the album besides the title track itself. I love the emotion in the song, and I love the words used. For all the UPS this album has, there is one DOWNER: There Goes My Life is a track I skip when I play the CD. I'd have rated it 4.5 for that reason but what the heck, a 5 will do :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Almost every song can be described as either: 1) Jimmy Buffet wanna-be, or 2) Kenny singing about losing his virginity in high school.Tired and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what's wrong with country music today","review":"You have a talented guy like this, he comes out with a new cd that's basically a rehash of his last cd and it sells like hot cakes. What has happened to the country music industry? Everything sounds the same as if it was made from a cookie cutter and there's not a real stand out in the bunch. I bought this cd for the stellar track \\"There Goes My Life\\" but goes down hill from there. The duet with Uncle Kracker is catchy, but at best, it sounds more like a knock off of the Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett duet of \\"It's Five O'clock Somewhere\\". Hopefully Kenny will have a better album next time. I really do like his music and I own all of his releases, but I think he should have spent more time finding material for this outing. Instead of spending your hard earned money on this disc go get the new release by Clint Black or Gary Allen instead, much better material and you'll have a disc that will get repeat listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny's #1 Fan!!","review":"I enjoy this cd soo much, if you like Kenny Chesney you will love this cd it is just as good as any of his other cds. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Chesney Doesn't Disappoint","review":"I have been adding to my Kenny Chesney library of CD's. When the Sun Goes Down is typical of the wonderful music, lyrics and general every day warmth that permeates all of Chesney's music. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite country album","review":"As a rock fan, country music is not much more than an occasional diversion for me. \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" is the first country album that I actually purchased and it became a stable in my CD rotation. I have since bought a few more CD's, generally disappointed with the others except for Toby Keiths Greatest hits 2 and Brad Paisley's 'Mus On the Tires'. So needless to say, Kenny Chesney has increased my interest in Country music. Very nice, non-country sounding country music, and that is how I and an increasingly large group like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Songs?????","review":"I found this CD to be basically the same as No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problems. The songs sound the same, and feel the same. At first I thought I had accidently put in No shirt, No Shoes, but it was just that the two CDs are that much alike. I like kenny chesney and his philosophy and reasoning behind what the songs mean, but he needs to mix it up a little (or a lot). Honestly because his last two CDs are so simular this one bored me. Coming from an artist of his caliber it was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upper and a downer, but all good","review":"Kenny Chesney knows how to keep it real. Almost every song on this album is good, especially \\"When the sun goes down\\". The song \\"There goes my life\\" reminds you that your listining to country music. Don't worry the album is more uplifting than depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different","review":"I like this cd, a lot. It is a lot different from 'traditional' country, which is a movement I never really understood. I have listened to country all my life, and can definitely say that Chesney, who I have listened to since his first CD waaayy back when, is as country as the last cd I bought before this one, a Hank Williams Greatest Hits album.In conclusion: Everything a country album should be. I laughed, I sang along at the top of my voice, I lived a lot of those songs myself, and I definitely cried. Who says this ain't country? No rock or pop album's ever made me do all of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the Sun Goes Down","review":"I will have to be honest- it was a true disappointment. None of the songs seem to really stand out on their own.I just felt Kenny threw together a CD for the College crowd and young girls that seems to be his following to just to market another CD.It really had no substance as far as I am concerned. This CD does not compare to his others.The only song I thought was somewhat decent was:There goes my Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks have to sell because its not talent","review":"Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"Didn't this CD come out a couple of years ago and was called No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem?

The stuffed toys were all slightly \\"off\\" looking and were not of a very good quality, and if I had screwed the attachment on firm enough to actually keep it upright it would have chewed the finish right off the crib (as it is it left a mark I had to paint over).

This cell phone holder, though inexpensive, is an example of a case where one gets less than one pays for. It comes with a throw-away flashlight and a carabiner cheaper than those sold as key rings. It comes without instructions, so if there really is a way to mount it horizontally on one's belt as stated in the description and on the packaging, I didn't see it. With the flashlight in place, the holder is huge and bulky--certainly not something that one would wear on a day-to-day basis. The pictures don't show it with the flashlight--a marketing person wisely decided it would sell better if prospective customers didn't know what it really looks like.In short, if you were to look at this in a brick and mortar store, you'd buy something else. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning (at least for me)","review":"This was by no means the first recording I heard of Edgar's. It's just that, chronologically speaking, this is the first album of Edgar and friends that I think is amazing. How much more monumental can a recording be than the first time that Meyer, Douglas, Fleck, Bush, and O'Connor all recorded together? Unfolding, the title track, remains a mainstay in the Meyer & company live repertoire, and for good reason. Jerry Douglas just put it on his solo album \\"Glide\\" and although that version is great, the original still shines the brightest to me. Other highlights are Cottonwood and Early Morning. The whole album is a glimpse into Edgar's genius. It's a shame that you have to shell out so much to get a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manky Fingers!!!","review":"This game is a pretty cool actioner with a nice variation of weapons and gadgets to use in your missions. The music is good and doesn't end up annoying you as you play through the game.The sound effects are really good also and the graphics are quite stunning.I found the dialogue pretty funny in places and when you get any swearing it's not just for the sake of it, it's always justified. Overall the game is a lot of fun to play, my only gripes would be that it's a little on the short side, and sometimes you tend to get a little bit of slowdown on screen, especially when a lot is going on, but it really doesn't detract too much from the gameplay.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes first person shooters as this is a bundle of fun, and if you can get hold of it cheaply, then you've got a great bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Game","review":"I have played the first few levels of Cold Winter.

Luckily, I have a monthly rental pass at Blockbuster, so it really didn't cost me anything to try this game out. And that's good, because I wouldn't pay $1 for this game. It is that bad!

This stuff is so bad (tough and hard to chew!); nobody in my family will eat it. I tried eating some, and with every mouthful I was spitting hulls in the trash. I discarded more than I swallowed. I would recommend that this popcorn be taken off the market, as it is not fit for human consumption. It seems more like the type that should be fed to farm animals or maybe used for Christmas tree decorations.

I read this in a magazine review. It's hilarious how much this album wants to be \\"Master of Puppets\\". I wont say its a complete failure, i liked the songs \\"enlightened by the cold\\" and \\"what drives the weak\\", but COME ON! This fits in nice and snug into an already overstuffed genre lacking creative thought and originalty. How bout some breakdowns other than chugga-chuggas,and god if I hear another single note run harmonized in thirds i will shoot myself. This is another band that you can have thier entire song catalog figured out by the first two tracks. I love metal/metalcore, and it pains me to see buzz around something, then to be terribly disappointed when i hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Well, I had heard all kinds of good reviews of this band and this album. Even MetalJudgment.com gave it an average of 4.67 out of five, and those guys are usually right on the money. I have to say I just don't get it. They sound a lot like Killswitch Engage, but just not as good, and I'm not the biggest KE fan, so that is not saying a lot. The songs are all just OK, not one song really got my attention and I felt no urge to bang my head along to a single song. The songs are just not that heavy or catchy or anything. Just boring and uninspired. Save your money and go buy some Opeth, or Lamb of God or Pig Destroyer or Arch Enemy or Nevermore, or 50 other good bands. I just don't get the hype. Mediocre at best people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick @$$ CD!!!","review":"The War Within is the first album I had purchased by SF and I was completely amazed at how talented this band is. From the opening of \\"The Light That Blinds\\" to the last track on the album SF goes hard. The opening of the cd starts out with an old school Jimmy Page type guitar melody then comes the hard riffs and Machine Gun double bass then a few good verses and a very unique over the top guitar solo. TWW is probably one of the top few really good CD's to come out this year in this genre, I suggest buying this one, and would like suggestions on their other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows Fall: The War Within","review":"I enjoyed \\"The War Within\\". You can tell the CD was leading up to Threads of Life. Jon Donias was really working overtime in the studio perfecting his techniques and lead riffs.

What can I say, this album really bores the hell out of me. The songs are so drawn out, it's like listening to the same song twice for most tracks, some being uninteresting the first time around. The guitars are pretty good, but I think the vocals are really poor. He tries to sing on a few tracks but it comes off weak, and his regular aggressive vocals are nothing special anyway.I'm sorry guys, I do not see what is so special about this band. If you are looking for new metal bands I would personally check out All That Remains, Trivium, and Unearth. Those bands all really impressed me with their last releases, which Shadows Fall failed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadows Suck","review":"This album is pretty weak to sum it all up...yes, the guitarists are incredibly talented, which is why it got two stars.

It was a great album, no doubt. I picked up The War Within, well these guys can play there positions very well, everyone is talented in the band. It's just this album sounds to similiar song after song. Telling songs apart becomes harder after each song. But that is really to say about all the new wave of american metal bands, (Lamb Of God, Unearth, Killswitch Engage..etc.) Shadows Fall sticks to the same format every song pretty much, with an occasionally melody. I would probably enjoyed this album more if I heard it before The Art Of Balance, probably. It had a bit more diversity.

These guys have totally brought that back without that gay metal hair sound that alot of bands are still trying to do today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The evolution of Shadows Fall is very interesting. They started out as a very intricate, innovative metal band and have now become basically a new metal band with solos. Of One Blood features extremely creative melodic metal guitar. This new cd showcases they complete lack of fresh ideas. The dvd gutar lessons show some of the most typical,generic, boring riffs I've ever seen. Both of they guys are incredible guitarists but it seems like this cd was rushed and is subsequently a complete failure. Check out Of One Blood, and Somber Eyes To The Sky, for true Shadows Fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Metalcore Band, yet average and unoriginal.","review":"\\"Of One Blood\\" was a good album, all the elements were crafted with the purpose of making a good metal record. \\"The Art of Balance\\" had a much more comercial orientated sound, it sold well and suddendly Shadows Fall were the kings of Metal, so on a lazy attempt they release this album, recycling everything they did on the past and showing an unconsistent emotional feeling with a hardcore attitude, well that is what makes Metalcore what it is, but at least was better composed on past records, which by the way don't get more than a grade 3 on Amazon's evaluation system."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys prove metal is not dead yet.......","review":"As im sure most of you know, metal has seemed to take a down turn the past 5 to six years. It seems everybody is going the Nu Metal route as of late, and leaving metals original \\"glory\\" behind. Well, its good to see that there are still some real, flag bearing metal bands out there, and Darkness Falls may be the best of all the new breeds.True, i think God Forbid is one to watch as well, but if you listen to this new cd by shadows fall, you will see why i say they may be the best. I heard the song the power of i and i on music choice, and was blown away. These guys just keep improving from album to album, and when you listen to this one closely, you feel a little bit of Master of Puppets, mixed with a little South of Heaven. If you are an old school metal fan like myself, then you know what im talking about. Go buy this cd, only if you love real metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SF Album","review":"Shadows Fall's new album The War Within just shows how talented a metal group can be. More melody than before, and I actually enjoy it (I'm more of a fan of the hard stuff though). I heard that this was supposibly gonna be the Album of the Year. That is not the case, however. If you want Album of the Year, go buy Lamb of God's Ashes of the Wake or Slipknot's Vol.3. Both are better, barely, but this album is nonetheless awesome. The thing that made me a little upset was that the guitarists BARELY do any of the death growls found throughout The Art of Balance and Of One Blood, but Brian Fair is awesome nonetheless. Best songs are Enlightened by the Cold, Act of Contrition, What Drives the Weak, Inspiration on Deamnd, The Power of I and I, and Those Who Cannot Speak. So if you haven't heard Shadows Fall, you should definitely check them out. If you are going to buy an album, though, start with The Art of Balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"REHASHED 80s METAL","review":"Did I just step into a time warp? It's fine and all to be into the old school metal. Hey I loved bands like Testiment and Anthrax back in the days, and dont forget the kings of metal...Iron Maiden!

Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs. 2 stars because it reminds me of Testiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool Metal album","review":"Before I start out I should say that I'm more into the classic metal, and I don't pay attention to tne nu-metal scene much because I am frankly annoyed by most of the bands in it (Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Ect.) Shadow Fall surprised me, though. My friend burned this album, and I kind of like to think of it as Slayer meets Iron Maiden with a little bit of Metallica mixed in. This is probably the best nu-metal band out there except System of a Down. Cool lyrics, excellent guitar. This is the kind of stuff I can headbang to without getting a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the previous stuff but still no cigar.","review":"This is not the groundbreaking, shredding, and improved SF album that I was waiting for. True, SF does not seem to wallow in endless nu-metal chops for a change,(the nu-metal is still there mind you, just not as obvious) but the vocals are still just as bad, or worse than ever. Great leadwork, decent overall musicianship and crappy vocals all average out to make this a better-than-normal-but-still-mediocre album. SF should definately consider getting a new vocalist, and trying to stay away from that damned boring, simple song structure.

I dont get it..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"another band gone mainstream","review":"these guys are such sellouts... they are horrible now... the only reason i gave it two stars was because of the guitarists... he's the only good part about the band... everything else is terrible and mainstream"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but there is better","review":"the album was okay but lacks originality. they sound too much like many others i've heard.these guys are definitely not \\"the future of metal\\" or \\"the next metallica\\" as some people would call them.you are much better off getting the new Lamb of God"},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"...I always hear so much hype about shadows fall. about how they are a great metal band.....this is true. The BAND is good. The vocalist however, he comes off very cheezy to me. I don't see how he has any talent. Now dont get me wrong I really dig alot of metal bands with little singing such as Lamb of God, In Flames, Opeth....etc. But this guy he trys to sing more on this Cd than the previous (fromw what I am familiar with) and he just can't. He honestly needs to stick to the screaming kind of vocal, but I really dont dig that either. I honestly get the impression that he is ripping off the old school metallica James Hetfield and it doesn't work. My opinion is fire the singer, and hire someone who is meant to be a front man. Just cause he has dreds doesn't mean he can sing for a band. Pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good instruments, weak vocalist.","review":"When you hear a shadows fall song, you are instantly drawn in by fast and heavy instuments, but then driven back by a voice struggling to keep up.Seriously now, their vocalist is very weak for this kind of music, if they could get a better one then they would be much better. I saw them live at ozzfest last year and they were horrible.But, if its loud, then all the little metal heads will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth price","review":"It's ok for what it is, if you care what the American Poultry Association thinks, or if you are a collector of these books.

I grew up on a midwestern farm myself, so I very much related to Ray, so much so it was freaky. Because I could trust this author to really get that experience, I found myself letting go and really loving the letters between the women-- both of them far from typical in their desires, individuality and strength. I highly recommend this book to guys who don't ordinarily read women writers, because they'll be surprised at the relief they will feel at how someone really gets the misdirected anger, the violence, the hot sex, the wanting, and the need to just lose yourself in someone else, just because."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really \\"fine line\\" marking tips","review":"I bought these because they identified themselves as \\"fine line\\" washable markers.

Sadly, Fate's Right Hand doesn't have the clever, complex, folky feel of The Houston Kid.Navel-gazing is the theme of the album, and it's all the worse for it. Crowell takes self-deprecation to a new and disturbing level; I cringed at some of the lyrics in these songs. The lyrics and the themes behind them seemed to me to be weakly conceived, half-hearted even. I didn't buy the cloying sincerity.Musically it is straightforward and I thought, rather monotonous: repetive choruses, endless lists of things half-cleverly put together, and the kind of noisy country rhythm that drives you mad after half a CD. It was quite shocking to find not one song that I liked - in total contrast to Crowell's previous effort. I'm puzzled by the change. And disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rodney, Snap Out of It!","review":"I guess this is one you either really love or really hate.

It now makes a horrible knocking sound every time the rollers are moving.I would switch back to a Samsung cartridge, but at this point, I don't know if the printer would work, so I am going to buy a new printer.

Toner output is consistent and very reliable especially in crucial moments when you absolutely need every bit of toner out of that drum.

Caine and Smith are simply wonderful together and Spader gives a brilliant performance as a comedian - one has to think of his later work in \\"Boston Legal\\". The supporting cast is also very good. Polly Walker seems a little pale and uninteresting, but that can be easily overlooked.And this film is more than just a love-story (or even a ghost-story): it's a film about books. The sub-plot features the hero's struggle to run a publishing house that refuses to publish low-quality books.

But beware, you may be taken in by its arguments if you haven't read the opposing view.A great example is its appeal to authority.

To their credit, they sensed this and called it a day. Unfortunately, their last album was not up to their ususal high standards for pop songwriting. \\"One of Us\\" is the only song on the album that measures up to their classics (and, I might add, the only song that appears on the career retrospective \\"Abba Gold\\"). The title track is just plain bizarre and few of the other songs leave much of an impression. Despite what their detractors might say about their disco connection, Abba was a great pop band. This is just not one of their better albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abba - last album \\"Visitors\\"","review":"If those guys were trying to get rid of & bury Abba they succeeded with this album.

This album ranks as one of their silliest and finest collections! Who can resist the unnervingly catchy \\"Two For the Price of One\\" or \\"One of Us\\"? A person with no pulse, that's who. Benny and Bjorn's songwriting reaches surreal new heights as Agnetha and Frida sing their Swedish hearts out and abuse the listener's threshold of pleasure. I highly recommend this record to all lovers of pop music! Three cheers for ABBA! Gimme an A!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre but worthwhile","review":"Here's Abba at their melancholy best, with the somberness of \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" and \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" taking center stage. Still, the serious-sounding \\"Soldiers\\" and \\"One of Us\\" are rife with Abba's candy-laced harmonies, and I've found them to be highly addictive. The album hangs together well and is at turns brilliantly executed--but \\"The Visitors\\" is worthwhile if for no other reason than to hear \\"Two For the Price of One.\\" What were Benny & Bjorn smoking when they decided to combine a menage a trois theme with a marching band fanfare?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturity never sounded so good","review":"How can the impending break-up of 4 members who are no longer happy together sound so terrific? \\"Visitors\\" is mature, thoughtful and ... dark (Yes, Abba and Dark together).

Soulful and sad, this album is the perfect swansong for the greatest pop band in popdom's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their greatest achievement","review":"This is ABBA's finest album. It's certainly the most diverse and the most mature - it's not surprising it was a relative flop. When it was first released I couldn't believe they had created such 'dark' music. The title track is about Soviet refugees and paranoia - from ABBA??!! And there's even an anti-war song here! (Soldiers) With time, it's become easier to understand what they were trying to do. To the end they remained defiantly commercial, and yet you listen to this record and it sounds like the end of the world is nigh. Coupled with that, their lyrics and arrangements had reached a new level of maturity and they were recording 32-track digital, so this is the best-sounding ABBA ever got. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic ABBA!","review":"Its immediate predecessor, this album definitely hints at the absolute genius which will create \\"The Album.\\" This, too, is a sonic journey that the listener will want to take again and again. While the concept of \\"filler music\\" is not uncommon in the industry, appearing on the works of many artists, it seems all but unknown to Andersson and Ulvaeus, especially when considering this outing and the one to follow. From the title track to the closer, \\"Like an Angel Passing Through my Room,\\" one is compelled to set all other matters aside and give full attention to the aural experience. This album is a must-have for any lover of great contemporary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Good Songs Worth Buying","review":"I think Abba is so underrated, because their harmonies are so absolutely beautiful. This CD has several songs on it that are worth buying to keep...\\"The Visitors\\" is a song that is just fun to hear. But others, like \\"One of Us\\" and \\"Like an Angel Passing thru my Room\\" are those stop still songs that make you pause and remember. A song that can be sad \\"Slipping through My Fingers\\" is so gorgeous and so relatable to anyone seeing their child growing up, and it was just featured in the \\"Mamma Mia\\" film. Note the beauty of the front cover of the CD...the rich golden color and the way the members are standing apart, with the ceilings high around them. It is worth a buy because it's not all about one good song. Let's get back to worthwhile, classy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Abba's Best","review":"Abba was, from the very beginning, a great singles group. They matured into great album makers, and their last three full-length studio recordings are all great from beginning to end. This, their last, proved that they still had a lot to offer, and they went out on a high note. Especially notable here is the inclusion of \\"The Day Before You Came\\" as a bonus track. It showed that, had they wanted to, Abba could have become a major force in techno-pop, believe it or not. It is a beautiful song based on a simple keyboard and drum-machine backing, with fantastic vocals by Agneta.But the whole album is strong, The Visitors, When All Is Said and Done, Head Over Heels, One of Us--all worthy of inclusion among their greatest. But also tender ballads, \\"I let the Music Speak,\\" \\"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\\"--gorgeous.

I cannot say I disliked it completely, but I think it is indeed odd book. A few episodes from life of 4 main chars of the book. All of them unfaithful and the writer sort of supports men's desire to sleep with as many women as he can, while he also shows how tolerant a wife can be if she loves her husband, even if his head has a smell of another's woman vagina.

If you're one of those people who can't appreciate Picasso's Cubist paintings, you'll be just as frustrated with this book.

They are just recreations of thought from other texts written long long ago and written much better.

These characters do not resemble any real person, but they resemble real weaknesses, and that is why is people like this book: they want to feel comradeship in weakness. There is no triumph here, the characters do not learn or grow, and really, it's a very boring read. I am not convinced of Kundera's interpretation of Nietzsche, either, except that by ascribing extremes to Nietzsche it makes an easy foil upon which to base one half of a concept in novel form. Perhaps this book means something to the academics, but I always thought the ultimate goal of all theory was to lead to better lives. This book does not, and I would not recommend it to any literature readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a glimpse","review":"A book about feelings on the either side of betrayal; the infidelities of a man, the jealousy of his wife.The angusih she feels and the affliction he suffers from his compassion towards her.Explores the innate desire of a man.A woman trying to recede the pain of her mental rack, caused by her husbands \\"indecent nature,\\" by her love for him.

However, Kundera's method of introducing these ideas -- usually by interupting his characters -- made the novel really choppy. A lot of times, it seemed like the characters had impossible foresight -- that no one living would ever think such a thing at such a time. The character's were far too analyzed, leaving the reader with basically nothing to do but sit back and attempt to enjoy the rather dry writing. Overall, ideas great, but style terrible. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"From the get go I knew I would love this book. There's nothing better than when an author catches you off guard. Some people may be turned off by Kundera's approach to this story, but I thought it was what made it better. It's one of those things you love or hate. If you haven't read the book, what I am referring to is how Kundera throws himself into the story, not as a character per say, but into the process of how and why he made these characters as the story unfolds. I found this fascinating to be able to be apart of the process instead of just a reader of a story I was also let inside of author's mind while writing it. Now, is it one of my favorite books of all time, no, but it is a very good read. Worth the time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Czech Out With This Novel","review":"There is a certain magic about Kundera's prose that seems to lift it off the page and into the imagination of the reader. His words are like music, or the ocean, ebbing and flowing, building to a magnificent crescendo. It is time that Nobel finally recognizes the profound contributions of this literary master. This book may be his finest effort. After reading it, after soaking in all the colors it has to offer, your opinion of what a novel can achieve may be changed forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"inside the woman and the man.","review":"The thing that stirkes me more than anything in this book is the sad realization of the fact that very light things(like crossing a certain border) could bring down heavy consequences. Consequences that would shape ourlives and hence ourselves in a drastically different way. All over the story the inside of the man and the woman performed the same torturing dance. But only inside the heavy she became certain that he loved her. She was happy to know that he really did(happinees is light) and she was sad(heavy) to see him the victim of the proof. Milan Kundera flips the coin of heavy and light showing us different faces (of many different dark colors) for the same two sides of his coin until all the faces blend. He is a true magician."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth of lightness","review":"The core theme of Kundera's book--that it is the lightness of life, not the heaviness, which is tragic and thus unbearable--is concise, simple, and true. We are not burdened with duty and meaning. People often refer to this book as \\"stylized\\" or \\"contrived\\" but I don't think that's accurate. It's literature and philosphy simultaneously, and it's self-conscious of that. It is a product of a twentieth century sensibility even as it overcomes the trappings of one age and strives for timelessness. A masterpiece. Please read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning with a brilliant concept, but not maintaining it..","review":"I bought this book after looking at all the wonderful reviews that this book has received. The first few chapters illustrate a beautiful concept, however, Kundera does little to maintain our interest. After the first few chapters, my interest started fading. The characters are uninteresting and as a reader, I felt I couldn't give any sympathy to them, regardless of what the situation was. There's not enough character development such that the characters have grown on to me. This is unfortunate because Kundera outlined a wonderful concept, only to fill it with mundane words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable is right!","review":"Am I the only reader who found this book contrived, soulless, meandering, egotistical and overrated?"},{"rating":"1","title":"right brain or left brain","review":"to tell the truth, i didn't finish this book, so my review is limited to the hundred or so pages i did get through. i first heard of kundera's book from an instructor of mine in college. he, as well as others in the class, raved about the book, so i decided to check it out. but i just couldn't get through it. the characters did not capture me or make me feel any affinity towards them so that i would continue reading. and kundera's continuous interjections to contemplate philosophical issues disturbed the story's momentum. i suppose for those who enjoy philosophical inquiries and who have high levels of concentration and patience (i.e., lovers of zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance) this book is heavenly, but for those who can't endure 'authorial disturbances' (and characters as simply symbols) this book is a long and tedious experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"enh","review":"This one was not as good as they say. It is a good literature book for people who love stephen king and michael crighton. But if you are looking for something more than an airplane read, look elsewhere.

However, there were no noble characters in this book. The confused, selfish adulterous lifestyles of Franz, Sabina, Tereza, and especially Tomas, exemplify humanities hopelessness of which Kundera seems to celebrate through this novel. Despite humanities struggle to find or balance lightness and weight, hopelessness is inevitable without the external, absolute, and objective truth to anchor upon. The only character I was moved by was Karenin, the dog, who lived a much more purposeful life than his owners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kundera's genius","review":"This book will forever be one of my favorites. Kundera has an uncanny ability to put into words questions that any thinking human being has to come across. I first read it in another language, and am not sure that the english translation does not obscure the overall tone of the book. However, it is still worth anyone's time who has a desire to look deeply into the human soul. Kundera's writing genius is backed by an immense knowledge of philosophy and the arts, and he ties ideas together from across the centuries to show the basic questions that humans have faced throughout history."},{"rating":"1","title":"an apathetic frenzy of existential angst","review":"We are all born, we live and we die.

Hence, two stars rather than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I thought this book sounded intriguing, but I found it pretentious and boring.

Most of the reviews focus on the concept of \\"unbearibale lightness of being\\" and they do a good job in describing the author's point of view. I don't think this the main point of the book. This idea is really \\"unbearable\\" - depressing - and for this reason I never focused on it.There are four different characters in the book. Together, weighted in different ways, they can almost describe every person. They feel and interpret emotions and situations in different ways; everyone offers his/her relative point of view. The rationale is that everything must be seen from a relative point of view. We always need to keep in mind that something can appear very differently when seen from a different perspective. This is what I really liked.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, recent history, philosophy","review":"This book is an unexpected love story, a philosophical essay and an account of dark and turbulent historical times. The events and consequences of the Prague's Spring gentle revolution are seen through a very personal drama. This masterful and poignant account gives out the author to be a real-life victim of communism and occupation.Written as a two-sided love story narrative, the book really conveys successfully only the male point of view and the male (mis-)understanding of the female sensitivities and insecurities. Tomas is the true and only protagonist; the attempt to describe what drives Tereza to Tomas and the imperfection of their union is somewhat tainted by a macho viewpoint. Same of the authors points are expremely overworked and appear again and again throughout the book.Enjoy this masterful depiction of heaviness (difficult love, communism, occupation, exile) through light (will and hopefullness of main characters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitch","review":"Hoping for the author to redeem his irony, I suffered this book all the way to the end, but found it nothing but a potboiler."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lived in this book those days","review":"Can't forget the days when I was reading this novel. It felt I was living inside the book with those engrossing characters all the time. And when I was not reading it, I'd feel as if I had stepped out for a while and ould eagerly wait to re-enter that amazing world of romance and complications once again.

I enjoy this book every time I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"at the very least, get it from the library.","review":"I borrowed this novel from a friend who sang its praise to no end. I have since come to the conclusion that said friend and I do not have the same taste in fiction. She seemed to glean some deep philosophical meaning from the novel, as many people do, or apparently so from all the babble going on about it. The babble is sometimes very difficult to follow, and I was in no way enightened by the novel. The sex was gratuitous and the protagonist was unsympathetic. Although I have to give Kundera some credit, for writing a mildly misogynistic and wholy uninteresting novel almost entirely about sex and very faintly about oppresion, and then somehow convincing a slew of young western women (surely you've encountered a few) to tirelessly laud and contribute great genius to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unbearable Weight of Kundera's Ego","review":"I never thought I'd say this: this novel made a much better movie. Why? Because Kundera didn't write it. Although considered a virtuoso by many, Kundera can't tell a story without reminding you he's telling a story. Tereza, Tomas, and Sabina never come to life because the author of their story refuses to share the limelight with anyone. Over and over, Kundera adds his observations and such just when the story is beginning to roll. Furthermore, he's a condescending ass: how many scenes do you have to explain to us, Milan? Also, this Czech is definitely male: his women fall into the boring, old saint and sinner categories. Finally, if you've read Sartre, Nietzsche, or any philosopher claiming to be an existentialist, Kundera's philosophy is tedious rehash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable.","review":"Read this book as an undergrad English major, didn't care for it.

It's a great book. Tomas and Tezra cope with existential angst, have sex, cope with existential angst, cheat on each other, and cope with existential angst. This is really a departure for Robert Jordan, whose perennial Wheel of Time series has carried him into fantasy legend; more importantly, however, it is a vehicle for actor Kevin Bacon, who (it is almost certain) will star in the screen adaptation. Without giving too much away, I will point out that there is a great deal of confusion near the end, involving a family of angry bears, an anthropomorphic bee hive and Tezra, wandering through the streets of post-war Czechoslovakia; I think there's some kind of message in there, but I'm not sure what. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful crap","review":"It seems that Kundera got confused between writing a philosophical treatise and a novel--a nasty experience to say the least. Instead of creating characters and action, Kundera get's bogged down in his own philosophical wanderings on life, and just him mentioning such greats as Nietzche and Tolstoy in this book makes me want to vomit. Thank God both those writers are dead, but I on the other hand was not spared from the stench of this literary poop. It truly contains some of the most frightful prose ever written. Yes.....it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"I had no idea what type of book this was, nor anything about the writing of Kundera when I purchased this book. I wish I had.The book chronicles different people's lives and journey's, but their lives are just a subtext to the writer's general philosophy on life, which is infused throughout. His philosphy is a little odd, and very VERY European. There is a tinge of melancholy that runs throughout his philosphy, and the very Un-American idea that things don't always work towards a greater good, or that things that happen don't necessarily have a point. (Did this book have a point?)Reading this book was like being flipped upside down a few times and not knowing where you will land. If you would like to read a good fiction novel, this is not it. I think this should be put under philosphy, rather than fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This book is different from what most have read and that alone makes it worth reading. It's heartfelt, sad and happy and it's hard to put down. Kundera thinks in such different ways that it makes the reader ponder on his ideas.

I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant","review":"Love, philosophy, intrigue - this book has it all.

For those who have never read anything by Kundera, it will come as a shock; he writes in a metafictional way - always reminding the reader that these characters are made up. Kundera's style seems to be \\"tell, don't show,\\" but he somehow makes it work. Above all, he is a philosophical novelist - his stories exist to illuminate his ideas. Which is not to say that he provides any answers: he always maintains that stupidity arises from thinking that one has the answer for everything - his books are about posing questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life...","review":"...or perhaps more appropriately, this book speaks to my life - describes my life - reflects my life. I believe, once in a lifetime, you come across something that so clearly mirrors your view of the world, but in a strange, beautiful, and unimaginable way.Taken as a story, it is a compelling tale of love, life and the struggles faced in Prague during the Russian uprising. But when taken on a deeper level, an \\"ur-level,\\" this book speaks to one's view on oneself and their relationship to the eternal struggle of life.This is a book I have been reading every year for the last 15 years, and every reading brings about new thoughts, new ideas and new perspectives.

I noticed that the stem/valve of the tire was shifted and no longer coming out of the wheel at a perpendicular angle. I suspected that the liner was too slippery and was causing the tube to shift and ripping away at the stem.When I took the tire out, I confirmed this on both of my tires.I wouldn't recommend this product.

I had read the reviews here and thought the tire slicing reviews wouldn't apply to me because my V2100 had 2.125\\" tires. I went out on a 15 mile ride in ~35 degree weather on Sunday night, and the next morning noticed my rear was flat. The end of the liner in contact with the inner tube had cut a crescent shaped groove and had caused a pinhole at one of the corners. I didn't have a spare tube with me at the time since I had a (non-liner related) flat on the front tire the previous day, I can't believe how close I came to being stranded, at night, in cold weather, 7 miles away from home. Needless to say neither tire has this liner anymore.Since I ride streets frequently I need protection from unseen broken glass. These are not the solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good liner for the price","review":"These liners work really well if you know how to instal them.

I had no punctures during that time, which I believe I would have had without the liner, but then the liner cut a hole in my tube. It was at the end of the liner, where the tube under high pressure has to stretch itself over the sharp ledge. it was a small enough cut to patch, but I'm not letting that liner back in my tire.I used glue to help position the liner in the tire as I assembled it; experience with tire liners in general tells me if I hadn't done that, it would likely not have been centered and a puncture in the tread area could get past it.Another liner, maybe not this brand, once sliced my tube lengthwise in S-curves, as it was not centered in the tire. Had to throw that tube out when one slice finally got all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually caused me to flat...","review":"Length:: 0:31 MinsThese liners lacerate the tube itself.

Since I had a major flat on the rear tire before I installed the liner, I also replaced the inner tube with one prefilled with slime. 30 min into the initial brisk ride on city streets, the new inner tube burst. I replaced it with a 2nd slime inner tube - 10 days later, burst again. Kind of wondering if the liner is rubbing against the inner tube. I noticed a 1-2\\" laceration along the tube slightly off center. I am now trying something else - buying a kevlar tire with a generic inner tube and did not install the liner on the rear tire - will see how this lives up. Bottom line, I suspect the liner causes the inner tube to slide around and eventually rub against the inner tube and cause it to tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item DOES slice your inner tubes","review":"Bought these at the recommendation of my LBS.

This is true - Slime liners have sharp edges on both the end and sides - these cut tubes.Also instead of being molded ( rounded to the two curves of a tire ) Slime liners are flat. The result is the Slime liner snakes around on the inside of the tire, sometimes going all the way down the sidewall.With a little finishing by the manufacturer ( smoothing the edges, molding the shape ) they would be useful.

After getting a flat in the rear tire I thought I see what I could do to prevent it. I picked up both a Slime tube and Slime Tire Liner. One thing about the Slime Tire Liner is that it is difficult to run down the center of the tire. The liner does not have an adhesive. You are relying on the tube you are installing to hold it in place. After two repeated flats with the slime liner, each with in a couple of days, I took out the Slime tire liner and noticed at one of its ends it got folded double creating a some what sharp edge. The hole was a pin hole size, much less than an eighth inch which is published by Slime to instantly patch. It did not seal the hole even with the tube outside of the tire. Exasperating! Maybe Slime can work, but I am not a believer.

It is clear that this he thinks combining a mish-mash of disorganized facts and questionable opinions in an endless series of lists and bullet-points makes for writing a book. An example is his useless list of potential crime victims, including laughable characterizations like \\"Business people -- vulnerable anytime, anywhere,\\" and \\"Police officers -- easily isolated and overwhelmed.\\" Another bizarre, casually-made and unexplained statement: \\"The availability of weapons has nothing to do with the incidence of domestic homicides.\\" Or \\"Drive-by shooting victims are generally children.\\" Huh? And the worst of it is these are not rare hiccups -- these disparate and doubtful claims are all from the same randomly-selected page. This book is a compendium of nonsense like this.One could learn more about how criminals think by watching an old episode of \\"Knight Rider.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too historical in nature, no real life and up to date info","review":"This book reads like the author copied his facts from an encyclopaedia. There is no real, up to date info on the topic. This is what I, as a buyer, was looking for. I returned this book very disappointed. Writer's Digest should insist on having authors who really work in the field they are writing in, so as to lend authenticity. Some books in the Howdunit series that are far superior are Modus Operandi & Murder One, which were written by real-life detectives Paglino & Corvasce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written with Childish Execution","review":"The author reaches several conclusions without ever explaining how he got there. He also contradicts himself on a fairly regular basis as if he cannot remember what he wrote 10 pages earlier. And while we all agree that murder is a horrible, hateful crime the author constantly interjects his own poorly chosen adjectives to highlight his personal take on the crimes: \\"this evil deed\\". The perfect example of poorly written this book would be is when he offers a modern \\"profile\\" of Jack the Ripper at the end of Chapter 2. This \\"profile\\" ends up being nothing more than a rehash of facts and theories. Not only does it offer nothing new on Jack, but it isn't even a profile of the killer it is more of a description of the crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful introduction and reference for writers.","review":"\\"Malicious Intent\\" is one of the best writers guides to how murderers and other violent criminals think. The author approaches his material with a mind/personality/psychology/human behavior perspective. The book's coverage is broad, including history, profiling, serial murder, cult murder, and sexual predators; it looks at the role played by victims and drug abuse. Sean Mactire's background in the prevention of child abuse shows up in his detailed treatment of child molesters and murders.Mactire's chapters on serial murder and on terrorists are especially usable.While all books I have read in the \\"Howdunit Series\\" have been helpful, \\"Malicious Intent\\" has been the most useful. My copy has so many Post-It Flags marking material and references it looks like a porcupine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malicious intent","review":"The book was excellent and gave me an insight into the criminal mind. The statistics within showed how many people have preconceived ideas. It covered a large variety of topics and would be beneficial for writers trying to get the characterization of the villains in their stories correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real meat in this.","review":"I was a bit irritated at spending good money for this book. I wanted very much to understand the psychology of why criminals act the way they do, but I finished this book knowing no more than what I did going in. The author makes too many pronouncements, many of which I doubted. His reasoning seemed vague, and I was left wondering if he made his statements based on sound research or just his own opinion. If anyone knows of a better reference on the psychology of criminal and psychotic behavior--one geared to writers--I'd like to hear what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for new crime writers.","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in learning how to properly write a 'profile' of a serial killer for a story I am working on. Of all the writer's guides I have used, 'Malicious Intent' was the only one that gave me detailed background on serial killers, and how 'Profiling' came to be used by law enforcement."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not ment to be a bible","review":"I found this book useful as an entry level resource into understanding criminal behavior much in the same way law enforcement does. It's not ment to be the concrete last word in criminal thinking. As no one can possibly cover all aspects of criminal psychology, I find it a tad insulting that this whole review section is filled with people angry about the offense supposedly directed toward their religious beliefes. But the book for what it says it offers. Try the bible for religious needs. Nowhere in the title does it say, \\"the writer's guide to how murderers, robbers, rapists, and other criminals think; and making you feel good about your religion.\\" The book offers insight, and that's what you gain, if your not bias enough to stop after the chapter that might have pointed out that some of the sickest and most dangerous criminals were bible thumping church goers on a mission to clense the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Opinions?","review":"Prior to this book, I felt \\"The Howdunit Series\\" was 5-star. Malicious Intent was a disappointment! While offering good background information for developing a character's history, it seemed to me that the author had/has either ill feelings, or a lack of knowledge, about Christianity. Clear distinctions, in great amounts of detail, were made in attempts to get the reader to understand the intricate differences in so-called Pagan Religions. However, none was offered for any person whom the author felt was a \\"Christian.\\" Simply referred to as \\"Christian\\" cults. In my opinion, it would be wise for anyone not familiar with Christianity (or other mentioned beliefs), to take the author's \\"groupings\\" with a grain of salt. I felt that several other belief systems were misrepresented, as well as my own. This biased my opinion of the book before I could get into the \\"meat\\" .. the profiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Headed Robot Animal","review":"An accurate and colorful toy!

Rockabilly was named after the kind of music that the Dorsette brothers started. They would have a performance and most nights there was a fight because the crowd got so worked up by the hard driving edge of the Dorsette brothers music. Rocky and Billy Burnette started it all and this record will give you a great taste of the artist, Rocky Burnette who had a whole genre named after him! Before Elvis, before anyone else you care to name there was Rocky Burnette. Here is his music that will show you what rock really is and where it came from. Rocky wrote the music too which is important. That just wasn't done then but it shows how brilliant Rocky and his brother Billy were. Their songs were covered by Ricky Nelson, and even the Beatles as seen on the BBC recording.

Members of Mayhem had said that only a select few were even worthy of listening to the album; however, that has changed since. This is the album where it all began. The music on this album is so raw as Black Metal is intended to be; however, if you are looking for a Black Metal sound, you will not get it here. The sound is not the usual high-pitched screaming with organs and whatnot, but it still remains unique.

From opening track to the last they flow and just sound well written and better hooks. Also the phil collins cover \\"IN the Air tonight\\" is amazing, not as good as a local band from texas had done, but still good. Elias Soriano's vocals have definatelly matured. his raspy screams to melodic high sounds make this cd great. SOngs such as IMpossible needs, Wait, Move Now, PAst it all, and Done it anyway.

It will be a fine supplement to Roosevelt biographies because it is well written and gives a fair, balanced view of his career. Just as a side note, this book was the first one I found to equate T.R. with evolution. He liked Father Zahm's book Evolution and Dogma; which sees no problem combining Creationism and evolution.

Nelly Sachs, \\"his Li\\", loved him, no doubt. Her \\"dearest Paul\\" was married with a child. It is fascinating to read how two poets process the most common story among people. With tenderness and sadness and so much dignity. And as Nelly Sachs says: \\"Love is inhuman\\". This book reveals the sensitivity it takes to write poetry and how this sensitivity marks your every single gesture, making sometimes life to be simply unbearable. \\"If only I had you here\\" Nelly Sachs says, and that is what the reader wishes with her. An unfulfilled wish. They met only once and never again. Hard for simple people, even harder for poets. \\"You are my light\\" they say to each other and from the third letter she feels he is her home. Did they decrease each others loneliness, or did they make it bigger? It's up to the reader to decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collectible item, of one of the greatest stoner bands of all times.","review":"Clutch firmly implanted themselves as one of the most talented hard rock bands making music today.

Lt Bidermann gives an account of his part on the eastern front. Bidermann is a common grunt who begins his service as a private eventually earning a commission from a Junkers school. He leads his men in an unwinable stuggle where the goal is survival. Bidermann's tale is so well written that I must rate it as the best account of combat on the eastern front that I have ever read.

Gottlob Herbert Bidermann's expieriences while manning his AT gun on the Eastern Front are heart-pounding, and in most cases, amazing.As I said I have nothing to compare it too, but this book definetly gives a face to the German soldier. All too often Hollywood depicts them as cowards, ruthless murderers, and clumsy fools, and Im glad to have finally read a book that truely puts things into prespective.I could not put this book down from the moment it arrived at my house. Lets just say my social took a leave of absence in the weeks after getting this book.If your even remotely interested in the German side of WWII, then get this book. A little knowledge of basic German may help too, otherwise you may be flipping to the glossary everytime you catch a word thats foreign to you.

The best being Jean Genet's fabulous one act play called the 'Maids'.Whereas Genet's play focuses on the social role-playing that leads to the crime (in the play the murder is never actually shown) - this film adaptation gives us detailed background information about the sisters and focuses more on the possible sexual relationship between them (and their strong inseperability). It also gives a quite graphic picture of the actual murder. I found this film to be quite engaging on many levels - I am still more intellectually drawn to Genet's play, however, it leaves out more - but is effective in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehhh it works","review":"I bought it to use in my sony dsc-p72 and well it worked fine but I could not get past picture #51 it gave me a file error so I had to turn it off and then look at the pictures from the last one back to picture 51.

What a stupid piece of junk this thing is.I recommend you spend $13 more for the sony pro 256MB, which is really a 256MB module, or just buy a 128MB module since most of the time you'd never go through all this.

They perfected both the story and their gift with a hook with later albums Deceptive Bends and Last Motion Picture (that's where the radio hits are) but judging from these early records they began with the belief that every song should be a story, and a twisted/tormented/goofy one at that. That the beginnings of their creativity seem rough around the edges doesn't make these gems any less interesting.

By gen-9 they have totally trashed the shoe. The ride for slight over-pronators has definitely degraded, but the maddening and absolutely inexcusable design flaw is the d*mned squeak that sets in anywhere between 50 & 125 miles of use. There's a tubular insert in the heal (just look at the bottom)that obviously loosens fairly quickly and then--squeak-squeak-squeak...every plant! (even when you're walking.)I've moved on to Mizuno Nirvana's--heavier, but what a great ride. Farewell, Adidas, I guess you didn't love me as much as I did you.

Clinton-bashers are likely to consider it liberal pap, but there are some serious points presented in the book. It is unfortunate that the information found in the book had to be presented in this format and not in the public media. If the media had fulfilled its obligation to provide balanced news instead of only news that sells, today's current events might look very different. The book presents, in my opinion, a good starting point for those wishing to pursue the possibility that there might actually be something resembling a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" that Hillary Clinton alluded to on the Today Show, January 27, 1998. The book is well written, well documented, and very readable. I would recommend it to those who wish to explore the possibilities of how we have arrived at the pinnacle of Clinton's demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much spin wrapped in a cloak of good research.","review":"Retter's book was dated before the ink dried. But that is the problem with authors who want to get a book out quickly. This rush to judgment, however, does not deminish his work. While he tries to be objective, and he succeeds in most cases, one can still see his susceptibility to the Clinton spin. I would love for him to put out another copy now that the report has been completed.

The Soviet correspondents lay it on with steam shovels, since they weren't doing very well at this point in the war. There is about 1% truth in these accounts.I purchased this volume for research purposes but found it virtually useless, since wartime censorship minimizes the amount of names and dates in here. Most accounts are about low-level figures who are being lionized as heroes in some action or other (which is rarely described in detail). All defeats and setbacks are glossed over or ignored. German losses are multiplied times five. This gives a feel for Soviet communist thinking at this point, but is not intended as real history."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Passages' Helps Girls Face New Challenges of Teen Years","review":"Dr.Pam Chubbuck's empathetic but professional book guides young girls to look forward to the events of pre-puburty, puberty and beyond.

In September the left underwire broke, while I was at work, making for an extremely uncomfortable day. And a very sore spot that evening.This bra didn't even last me 5 months.

Charles Durden was a freelance correspondent in Vietnam, and he has an ear for the language and an understanding of the attitudes of the combat soldiers. He pinpoints the horror of killing, which is for many worse than the fear of death, and he sketches the frustrations of a pointless war in which the unwilling were often led by the incompetent -- or worse. The grunts of Kilo Company arrive in Vietnam and are soon faced with the absurdity of the war; they respond in an interesting variety of ways from that of the skilled and capable lieutenant, \\"The Boy Ranger,\\" to the deserter and traitor, \\"Jinx.\\" Do not read this book as a true story of what happened in Vietnam but rather as a realistic picture of what war was like there."},{"rating":"1","title":"for jazz fans","review":"Well,i'm not a jazz fan and i don't think it's the music style that suitsChaplin's music.Anyway if you like jazz this could be your disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystalline voice... but so-so production","review":"Lea is one of those incredibly gifted singer who can deliver the goods.

Like other Amazon reviewers, I agree that the background accompaniment completely overpowers Ms. Salonga's lovely voice on most - if not all - of the tracks. Those wishing to hear Lea's vocals in the same calibre as \\"Miss Saigon\\", \\"Les Mis\\" or \\"Mulan\\" will be disappointed - this CD does not approach those efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Les Miserables, is it?","review":"Lea Salonga is truly fantastic. Her voice is amazing. If you really want to see/hear her at her best, get the DVD of Les Miserables. She out-classes and out-performs her peers to no end. However, this album does her little justice in terms of her ability. The soundtrack to Mulan is better...cheesy at times, yet better. (I know, I can't even believe I'M saying that).

Really and truly, check out her DVD in Les Miz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't waste your money...Lea S. has a wonderful voice but she is trying to achieve something that she doesn't.

I wouldn't buy this CD unless you are a VERY dedicated fan to Ms. Salonga."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice voice, but weak choice of songs","review":"Indeed, lea salonga has a nice voice. Proof would be her clear crystal voice in various recordings. Her weakness: her acting. Being objective, listen to her on other CDs like this one, Flower Drum, her manila concert, it all sounds the same. and it gets to be boring as you listen to her over and over again. she cannot seem to offer something new. It is like miss saigon over and over again.in this cd, she pulls the same tricks. no variety. all songs sound the same, there is no progression. and, the choice of songs are bad as well, she cannot do anything interesting with the material.

Yes, she has a lovely voice, and have heard of this album. The album speaks of love, love, love, and well, love. Creative isn't it? She used to be a good student until she denied and lied about the fact that she is from our school and had graduate from College, but she never did! And as for the album, it never gave me the impression of it being good, It has dull lyrics and CD cover for a dull artist and most of all lacks creativity! Besides she never broke any international market aside from that stint in Miss Saigon, good thing Tina Arena got both lead roles over her in the smash musical \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\", and Sam Mendes' \\"Cabaret\\".

I liked the album the first time I heard it, but hearing it again today almost reminds of going back to time when my world was - still simple. Guess I could say I know better now.As for the album. She should stick to her stage musicals and voiceovers. That's where the talent in her vocals truly belong. Unless these songs from this album were blended in the form of animations or musicals then I'd say these songs might've been taken a little seriously, but I've always noticed her voice could and would never fall into a Pop genre category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing voice!","review":"I bought this after watching Flower Drum Song on Broadway.

Not the best, but clearly a great example of what Lea is capable of doing. For those true Lea fans... i wold reccomend buying her Filipino album, which is an even better display of her vocal talents. However, i would like to comment mainly on the dats of some reviews? How long has lea's album been up for sale on the internet? I bought her album in 1995, but most reviews of it are posted in 1999 or 1998. we used her song \\"It's Just Goodbye\\" as a graduation song! In a way, this might greatly affect how people listen to the music. In 1995, her songs would have sounded so much better ebcause that was the type of music which was popular at the time. Music has evolved so much since that time, and that completely changes how the album is looked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written classic introduction to stochastic theory","review":"The math which goes into stochastic theory is key and fundamental; this book is a very readable introduction to the material.

I bought this collection mostly out of nostalgia, and it is of very high quality in terms of sound and packaging. However it contains a significant number of songs that I don't recognize at all, particularly on disc 1, and mostly from the 1970s. Still, it's hard to criticize a music collection for having more than you really wanted, and I can always skip the songs I don't like. I burned myself a highlights disc and I've been playing that instead. I will also say that the collection contained a bunch of hits from the 1980s that I knew but had forgotten which was a very pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's fan","review":"I got this as a Christmas gift and I love it.

I loved One on One but was not impressed with their tribute to the Righteous Bros, You've lost that Loving Feeling. Like other blue eyed soul styles, It's hit and miss for me.

I liked the concept and the idea. I think that the writing in this particular is more for younger childre, more of an elementary level. The story moved to fast. There were not enough details given to support what was going on. In my opinion, you didn't get to know the characters well enough. They didn't really develope. There was just a brief description at the begining. Also, it was to choppy. The story didn't flow very smoothly. Next, some parts were unclear. Such as when a person was speaking. A few people were talking and there was no name in front of the speech so you didn't always know who was talking. Finally, at parts of importance, there was no stress to make them seem more important. The writing could have been more descriptive so you get a good picture of what's goiong on. Some other books about the holocaust that are a little more descriptive are \\"The Devil's Arithmatic\\" and \\"Number the Stars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first book on holocaust","review":"I highly recommend this as a good first book on the holocaust for younger children. It is less personal and upsetting than the Diary of Anne Frank but is honest in its depiction of Jews that have to go into hiding at the beginning of the war. It reminds children of the unfairness of the world, the innate goodness of many and the necessity of equality. A parent or teacher should read along for discussion.

It is a historical-fiction story that won a Newbery Honor award because it teaches you a lesson. I think the lesson is to treat people the way you want to be treated. This book takes place in Holland during WWII. It is about a girl named Annie and her family who has to hide from the Germans. Annie is a ten-year-old girl who doesn't like the idea that the Nazis came to her town because now her friends won't talk to her. She is not aloud to go to school any more and she is not happy, all she wants to do is go for a long bike ride. The climax of the story was when the family had to go into hidding. When they were hidding they had to move from house to house, that made the story very suspenseful. YOu would never know if the Nazis would catch Annie's family. I also liked this book because it related to my own life (since the holocaust is part of my history)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really a good book","review":"I am twelve years old and I just finished the book.

This book takes place in Holland during the Holocaust. The main character is a worried nine year old Jewish girl named Annie that had to hide in a backroom for years and couldn't go outside, she also hid underground. She has two sisters (Sini and Rachel). It reminds me of a wonderful Holocaust book called \\" Parallel Journeys\\".The theme of the book was to treat all men equal. It wasn't fair that Hitler made the Jews hide and kill them. It's like the pharse \\" Treat others as you want to be be treated yourself\\". I didn't like the book because nothing exciting happend, I didn't like all the cuss words, I also didn't like all the crying and hugging, and I'm more interested in boys being the main character because I am one.I recommend this book to a girl in sixth grade or above because the main character is a girl, it has a lot of dramatic parts, and the cuss words are inapropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we were expecting","review":"Maybe even a little nicer.We needed to replace some inexpensive bamboo window shades that had really started to look awful but we didn't want to invest in custom blinds.These look better than what we had and do the job we needed which is to provide privacy from the house next door but also let in some light since we placed these blinds on windows that provide light to our main hallway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, powerful read, Testimony is a superior work!","review":"Although it is a fast, exciting read, Montejo's Testimony is an extremely powerful, raw book.

He's not there long when an emergency situation makes him reassess the desirability of engineering the human genome, but by then things seem to have gotten rather out of hand. As usual, this adventure is filled with research, lots of tense situations and interesting characters.

It is obvious by the anger in Gary's voice, the hard hitting riffs from Nuno, and Paul's departure. No more happy-go-lucky fun music; this is serious. This is the hardest sounding CD from Extreme. Enough of the Glam-rock, let get heavy. This may be Extreme's most under-rated CD, and maybe the best.The punchline: 90's Grunge. Sorry, but thats the joke! The music industry turned their backs on real rock and Gary and Nuno knows it and realizes the truth.This is a must-have CD. I promise, it will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme? Yes A Bit!","review":"I remember when one of my workmates brought this CD into the work back in 1995. Everyone instantly hated it including me! He was told not to put it back on again, but he did when some of the whingers weren't around moan about it. I must say it grew on me. I was never an Extreme fan but I did go out and buy this album a few years later and to date is the only Extreme album I own.I can understand why some fans wont like it, but I would say give it a chance, you may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"big Extreme fan, but this album is AWFUL","review":"I am a big fan of Extreme (esp. of Nuno's guitar playing and Gary's singing) and I thouroughly enjoyed all their albums prior to this one, there are truly wonderful pieces on every one of them. However, \\"Waiting for the Punchline\\" is very boring and rough-sounding, seems to be played by a bunch of kids in a not-so-well-equipped garage. I bought the album right after it came out (a long time ago), and sold it at a loss soon afterwards: the last drop was the last song, Unconditionally, which is probably the best song on the album, but so corny, protracted, and unpolished that I couldn't take it anymore. I do not recommend this album, thank goodness it is an old one (I have yet to listen to their latest album, Saudades de Rock, but I am not very motivated anymore, the samples I heard on Amazon remind me - quite unfortunately - of Waiting for the Punchline)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Extreme","review":"You'd think that after releasing 3 albums, these guys would have honed their craft. Sadly, this album is their worst release. Seems they tried to strip the sound back a bit on this album, fewer guitar overdubs being the obvious change. This album sounds a bit empty to me, I preferred the fuller sound of their earlier releases. The first 3 albums are great. Being a fan of Nuno Bettencourt, I'd also recommend the first Mourning Widows album (the second one is not quite as good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight up hard rock","review":"This is the Zeppelin album that Zep never made. If you're a big fan of Extreme's other work, this may be too \\"straight ahead\\" for you, but I think it's their best work BY FAR. The musicianship is incredible (Nuno's work is his best), the rythym section sets up some wicked grooves... it really reminds me a lot of Zep's Physical Graffiti (which is my fav hard rock album).I see there's some used copies available for a couple of bucks... that is an absolute steal. This one, IMHO, is a classic that slipped under the radar.BTW, the best track on the disc is the hidden title track. Wait 'til you hear the bass work on that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Don't even spend the $... to buy a used copy. This is very unlike their other records. Guess they were listening to too much grunge, because it's very dark, depressing, and quite a downer.

Stay away if you like Pornografitti, you'll find nothing like that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of Extreme","review":"Upon one listening of this disc, I knew the end of Extreme was near. The soaring art-rock masterpieces of previous albums are nowhere to be found on this joyless effort. Also gone is the hint of spirituality found toward the end of \\"III Sides to Every Story. Song quality suffers throughout the album. None of the expertly crafted types of songs found on the previous two albums can be located on this disappointing album. Instead of \\"Waiting for the Punchline,\\" this album should have been entitled \\"Going Through the Motions.\\" A sad end for this underrated and talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme saved its best for last","review":"I used to think that Extreme was a miserable excuse for a band ... until a friend loaned me WFTP. One listen, and I had to have a copy. Guitarist Nuno Bettencourt was brilliant, Gary Cherone sang with emotion, the songwriting was strong, and varied. Simply, the best music the band released, and a shame that Cherone took 5 steps backward to work with Sir Van Halen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - DON'T BUY IT - IT'S BASICALLY DISCONTINUED!!!","review":"I was so pumped to get this, but when I got it home, it turns out that they have had some sort of a corporate breakup with the ONLY company that makes the software that runs it.So you receive the scratch amp and \\"Traktor 2\\" in the box, but you will soon find that it is NOT compatible with Intel Macs.

I managed to nab one of the first few copies and as such got a free signed card from Wayne Houchin, and I think that's an amazing touch by a company that obviously cares deeply for its costumers. Once I got the DVD I figured that there was no way that this trick could live up to the hype, but I was wrong. The effect is amazing, the handling is deviously simple, and Wayne Houchins teaching is simply brilliant. He is one of the true bright stars of the magic community and it gladdens me to see that he can share his gift with so many. He has a very clear presentation and the way he teaches the effect is flawless. This effect gets great reactions and it's easy to learn.

Which brings us to Ludacris who presents the audience with The Red Light District. First of all let me say that the production on the album credits are far much better than that of his previous releases. The songs that really stand-out are: Number-one Spot; Get Back; Put your money; Blueberry and needless to say (all of the songs have that profounding production advantage). Now let's not get carried away here, Ludacris is not a 2pac, Nas or a Scarface, but he therefore brings lyrical improvisation and energy. If you look up the word ludicrous (you will find that the meaning for the word is ridiculous or outrageous) which is to say in this matter loud and boisterous. So overall, I believe this album deserves 4 stars (like this being his fourth album)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm","review":"dnt get me wrong, luda can rip the mic with the best of them. dude has talent. but he cant make a good cd for the life of him. i dont know what it is, he can make a sick song and tear it up (the potion) and then put together a mix of some of the worst songs ever. i give him 2 stars only b.c the potion is out of control."},{"rating":"1","title":"No play in GA","review":"We in da red light district!!! apparently Luda likes to pay for hoez, thats not so hot and neither is this album.

Well, Ludacris is the opposite, but not in terms of music. Luda's attributes are primarily length, while thickness isn't something he's known for. But who cares? Most rappers are neither long, nor thick. The fact that Ludacris is so long (we're talking a foot, buddy) more than makes up for his Sharpie marker thinness. Yeah, we cut (and I do mean cut, at least from my end), but I'm not about to put my man down because I never got paid; I never expected money. In fact, aside from some internal bleeding and an upset stomach a la George Michael, I'm quite satisfied with the experience I had. Luda is truly a man of the 21st century: he doesn't discriminate. That you can get with girls and guys alike just shows that you are open-minded, so I'll never put Luda down."},{"rating":"2","title":"coulda been better","review":"this isnt the best luda but its still good. the best from him is Word of Mouf and Chicken N Beer.Top Songs\\"Intro\\"\\"Number One Spot\\"\\"Get Back\\"\\"Hopeless\\" (F/Trick Daddy)\\"Virgo\\" (F/Nas & Doug E.

Luda isn't GOING to be like Nas, UGK, or anyone else, while I admire their skill as well, I don't expect everyone to BE like them. The Remix of \\"Number One Spot\\"? Luda has a sense of humor. This is him using it. So don't make it out to be anymore than it is, a joke. And you're probably giving him the response he expected. Overall, it has some good tracks, his best since Word of Mouf.

I'm not one of those people that hear their favorite artist put out a record and expect them to keep doing the same formula over & over again. I admire artist that have the cajones\` to expand themselves musically. This CD though, it seems as if these were left over from the less impressive Chicken & Beer album. I can't front, their are a couple of songs that are worth (i.e. 1 Spot, 2 Miles an Hour) listening too. For your fans sake though Luda, take it back to Word of Mouf days cause you have just lost a fan AND a consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Feel-Good CD!!!!","review":"It's a great CD to listen to while rolling in the car. My personal favorite song on this album is \\"Child of the Night\\" which is a collaboration of Luda and Nate Dogg. For the first time, Ludacris takes you further into his personal battle with money and fame, but also reminding you that he is also human. The CD isn't cocky or routine and it is definatley the best CD yet by Luda. Although, they are all great...this one promises to teach you some of the lessons that he has learned in his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pimpin' All Over The World\\"...HELL YEAH!!!","review":"LUDA DOES IT AGAIN!!!Being one of my favourite rappers i do have all his cds...and this is easily the best!!!Let me \\"Intro\\" you to the \\"Number One Spot\\" rapper.

He unzipped his pants and I saw that monster - 12 inches and don't play! I don't care about it being thin, I'm only seeing that length. Ohhh...to hell with you haters hating on Luda's latest album! This man turned me out, and the stitches ain't nuthin! Look, take three chop sticks from your local chinese restaurant, tape them all together lengthwise, and you have a perfect replica of Luda. But y'all will never know the softness of that skin, the bumpiness of those veins, or the stickiness of that fluid in your throat. Luda, I love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is Bangin!!","review":"I have been a huge fan of ludacris for awhile now, but this cd is by far the best one ever. His fast paced beats and tight flows combine to make this the best cd ever.The best songs are; Number one spot, Get Back, Put Your Money, Blueberry Yum Yum (THE BEST), Large Amounts, Two Miles and Hour, Hopeless, and Virgo. If you do not own this yet, Get out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LYRICAL GENIUS","review":"For all you people out there hatin on luda sit back and actually listen to the lyrics and then right your reviews. Ludacris has come along way from his first album andonly continues to improve.

He has had a fair amount of bump-able radio tracks that still hold up as the years go by. Unfortunately, the Red Light district didn't meet my expectations, and seemed well.....corny. Track 2's homage to Austin Powers is way lame. Maybe 3 years ago, when an Austin Powers movie was in the theatre's, it would have been cool on a soundtrack. It's the end of 2004, and makes no sense. The rest of the album is Luda singing about \\"being #1.\\" Get in line man, all MC's think they are #1. Find something else to spit. Having to remind us that you are #1 in every track makes Luda has a lack of confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass Up This District","review":"Why is this junk selling I dunno but his sales are based on hype alone because this album is garbage. Ludacris has some the most dumbest songs and dumbest lyrics I've ever heard and he wonders why people dont take him seriously. He doesnt promote himself properly. He chooses songs to make money instead of choosing songs that showcase his ability. Until he matures and realize that money isnt everything then his dumbas is going to have people who dunno anything about rap thinking he's hot and they dont even know what they talking about which is my point here. He hasnt shown any growth since the 1st album. Ludacris is still talking about nothing as usually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Me Some Luda","review":"I love this whole album, some nice slow songs as well as some get angry tunes, the whole album is good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but you already know that.","review":"This album is great. Luda is one of the few rappers that can rap a word with the same word and come off as credible. His inflection is what makes the difference. Instead of rapping in a flat or angry tone he adds an almost comical affect that makes each track a parody of itself. He is serious while not being serious. It is unique and wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart raps, sick beats","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of Ludacris' best albums (if not the best). Packing flavor, heat, flawless rapping and pounding beats, The Red Light District is addictive. No two songs sound the same; each expresses a unique and hip side of Ludacris. If this album isn't already one of your favorites, it will be. The Red Light District is soon bound to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Get Back!!!\\"","review":"The only reason I bought this CD was because of the song 'Get Back' because they play it at the end of Tropic Thunder! The other songs are okay. I'm glad I stopped at THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT!!!p.s. I'm glad Ludacris played Jim Bravura in Max Payne!p.s.s. Tomorrow is my 19th birthday!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"man this album is really not good. i like ludacris, his a good rapper but i'm not really felling this one, there's only four good songs in here, and that's not good enough for a good rap album. i don't even know why everone likes \\"get back\\" that song is rubbish. but the song hopeless is great, classic song with great lyrics and a great beat, trick is really good here and Luda's lyrics are on fire. I Also like \\"Put your money\\" with X, it would have been even better if X did a verse here but it's still a great song. Child of the Night is good too, again Luda again drops nice, deep lyrics and nate comes good on the chorus. The other good song is \\"who not me\\", this song has a nice beat and crazy lyrics. but the rest of the tracks are bull****, and why is \\"Virgo\\" in this album, it's already in Nas's \\"Street's desciple\\". Anyway, i'd recomend you to buy this only if u r a die hard Luda fan, if u'r not then i'd suggest u listen to it first.OUTLAW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not Word Of Mouf Pt. 2","review":"This CD was a very disappointment to me.

Luda has declared that he has no hesitation about bending over for the right man, a man who could persuade Luda to take it from behind. Alas, Luda knows that his intense desires are desires that society looks down upon, and so he must hide his true identity so that the masses will not shun him. At midnight, Luda's true identity reveals itself and he goes on the prowl for those that would give him pleasure on a whim."},{"rating":"1","title":"its all true","review":"I thought y'all wuz flodgin but he really do say he cumin in number 2 spots.(a man ass that is) I got tha mp3 last night of tha remix and its nasty.

I hesitated to try Richard Carpenter's remixed tracks for years. But, boy, was I wrong! He has done his task professionally, and has done it with subtlety.I love this album. It includes so many terrific songs that bring back memories. [We started listening to The Carpenters on our honeymoon ...]Some interesting tracks:From This Moment On features an interpolation of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier Book 1, Prelude no 2 into Cole Porter!Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft is an excellent version of the Klaatu original.

I do not like the little rope tassel with bulky metal clip that is used to hold the \\"tail\\" part in place. That is a minor complaint though. Other than that, for the price, this is a decent hat. The other ones in comparison might be a little better quality, so there is a trade-off for the price difference.Good hat to block sun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheep","review":"You get what you pay for. If quality doesn't matter to you, or you don't care if this hat blows away, then it's serviceable and probably right up your alley. If you don't want to pay any more for a sun hat for one season, then this will do. If you haven't seen some of the ones costing about $10 more, you'll probably find this acceptable. It's considerably heavier than the Sunday Afternoon hat which is polyester, nor can you reshape the visor which is where most of the weight is. One size fits most which is usually men's hat sizing. My opinion? It's just ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great hat","review":"Even on a hot day, the hat feels cool on your head and the long flap in back is not hot on your neck and keeps the sun off.

I can never put down California Diary books because they are so interesting, its like I'm in that persons life. Especially in Amalia's books she draws doodles on some of the pages on what is going on in her life, so your anxious to see what the next drawing looks like. Ann M.

Everything seems perfect- she's got the perfect friends, perfect family and.... perfect boyfriend. Then her boyfriend turns really awful when he gets mad at her over the simplist things, doesn't really listen to her when she tries to explain her side, and basiclly is a real CREEP!!

This series is alot, if not completely, different from the Baby-Sitters Club series. Im not saying this is a bad thing, but im not saying it's a good thing. Ann M.'s writing style is way diffrent, and so are the charectors. They have bigger and a little more important problems from those of Kristy, Claudia, Mallory, Stacey, Jessise, etc. Finishing this book only minutes ago, I have to say it was quite chessy at times. I felt a little embaressed for the author who was obviously trying to make the charector sound \\"cool\\". I thought Amalia's drawings were a little, well, stupid, and the dialouge kind of corny. I thought it was rather boring sometimes, and struggled to finish it.

Amalia didnt deserve James. One thing i didn't get about this book was that James wanted to KEEP amalia as his girlfreind. Why would he, he can DO BETTER.

His stories are valuable as a first person account of a scout during numerous campaigns. He does not shy from sharing his opinions and some of these may be offensive to modern readers. These must however, in my view, be taken as a product of the times in which he lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better from Donegan","review":"This seemed like an afterthought without putting much thought into the product. Not built very well .. The light flickers, very limited spread of light, the battery pack flops around and seems like it should be brighter. I looked for an alternative and found the Quasar Lighting System which fits over the lens and contains 6 very bright LED's. Honestly, this is the product that Donegan should have come up with. Same price as the OptiLIGHT, but unfortunately Amazon does not carry it. Very Very pleased with the Quasar. DO NOT waste your money on the OptiLIGHT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok in a pinch","review":"Good for temporary light in dark work areas, not a permanentsolution. A bit overpriced for what you get, runs extremelyhot. Batteries die off quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not outstanding","review":"We like the features on this swing. The multiple speed settings, two seat postions, music, timer, etc. It definately swaddles the baby. Our son (7 weeks old) likes it ok. He prefers to be held, but he will sleep and sometimes be content in the swing. We will see how he does as he gets a little older and more confident on his own. For now, we feel 4 stars is fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Failed","review":"I purchased this for my daughter who has an 18 month old and a new baby, so the baby could be in the swing out of big brother's reach. The motor failed after less than two weeks. We exchanged it for another one and the motor failed on the second one as well. We won't try for three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing!","review":"When we had our daghter we didn't realize how essential a swing is for a new baby. Fortunately, that meant we got to try many different swings before we made a decision. We opted for the Boppy rock in comfort swing. It cradles the baby very comfortably, is super portable, has 6 swinging speeds, has two-positon recline, plays 5 different tunes (if it only plays one you get really sick of it, and looks better than most swings. The only thing I wish this swing would have is an A/C adapter, so that it doesn't have to run on battery. However, I used rechargables, so I didn't have to pay to replace them. I would recomend these batteries:Sanyo 277265 Eneloop Power Pack with Battery Charger, 8 AA & 2 AAA Batteries Plus 4 C & 4 D Size Adapter ([...] Kit #2)THEY ARE AWESOME! I would encourage you to get this rather than a bouncer, or any other swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing","review":"This swing is great especially if you do not have the space for a larger swing. My son enjoys it very much. The timer on the side is also wonderful and has increments of 5, 15 or 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"here are the good things about this swing - the batteries last really long, the range of motion is nice and my daughter loves it - it took her some time to enjoy the motion, about 2 months, now at 4 months she is starting to get over it..the bad stuff - the music didn't work from day one, it was too late for us to return it so we just kept it. Also, the corners of the legs have a padding - I guess anti-slip, that broke off after 2 weeks of having the swing on the carpet.. it does fold up quite nicely but whenever we fold it the seat gets out of the aligment and we have to redo it. Every time. Otherwise she is practically falling out of it. I would probably not choose it again and would not recommend it to my friends. We also own a bouncy seat from Boppy and absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if your baby likes freedom - this is not the swing for you.","review":"Our 2 month old, 12 pound son hates to be confined. He hated this swing. The main problem was that he sunk into the seat - it looked so uncomfortable!!! He couldn't move his arms or legs and he cried when we put him in it. But if you have a baby that likes to be swaddled and kept confined - this may be the swing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son didnt like it","review":"We had to send it back cause my 2mo son didnt like beeing in this swing.it looks great but just my son looked uncomfortable and began to cry every time i put him in this swing.the only thing i dont like about it is an adjustment of seat. it can be either fully reclined or fully straight which is not suitable for a such a little kid.My son likes to be in partly seat position. may thats why he doesnt like this swing. Otherwise its very cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend more on the Papasan swing","review":"We got this swing because the reviews seemed decent and we don't have a lot of space in our apartment so this swing looked like a good solution.

It's terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"ideal4mybusyroutine","review":"my baby enjoys being rocked in this swing. i put her in it when i need to get other things done and before i knew it she was asleep. she loves the music and the bees too. i like the fact that the swing is not too high because when my little one is getting overly active, there's a reduced risk of a banging fall. overall, this is a good product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swing for the money!","review":"This swing is working really well for us. WHen we first received it, the seat cover was really difficult to assemble.We thought it was defective. I called the manufacturer and they sent a new cover right away. Great service."},{"rating":"1","title":"motor failed for me too","review":"As I sit here manually rocking her in this swing, I'm very disappointed. It was great at first, and the only place my newborn would take naps, but after only 4 weeks it has stopped working (even with brand new batteries)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for larger babies","review":"My son was 8.6 lbs at birth and loved the swing, he fit really comfortable in it since we used a body pillow insert. The swing takes up little room and has really soft material. The six speed option is great. And that it turns off on it's own.However, that didn't last long. The price is way too much for the month of use we got out of the swing. He grew out of it so fast. He couldn't have been more than ten pounds when this happened. The seat is very uncomfortable for him already. I wouldn't recommend this to someone with a larger baby because they won't be able to use it for a long period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things I Never Knew...","review":"This was an incredible piece of fiction from an author who had to have been diagnosed with an EXTREMELY overactive imagination as a child-there's no other way to explain a book where people bounce off the ceiling as a matter of course! Did you know there were floaters out there, carefully concealed so the rest of us don't know about them? I sure didn't!I have to say, \\"Moe Howard Died for Our Sins\\" (the not-so-tiny short that shares its name with the novel) was far and away my favorites. The t'ings I never knew about the Stooges!I laughed and yelped in outrage alternately from the first page to the last while I was reading this, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a pleasant change from the ordinary drivel that's currently cluttering up bookstore shelves.Does anybody have a pie....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Stooges fans don't bother!!","review":"Looking back over the reviews and the Product Description I feel I was misled that these were short stories about Moe Howard and / or the Three Stooges and some behind the scenes memoirs.

I also recommend this book to all of those who are started their journey of self-discovery, and free-thinking. We all have psychic abilities. Good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining","review":"This book cannot be seriously evaluated as one is given almost no information about its source or background. One suspects that it is either a work of fiction (by whoever), or that the editor has an agenda. It can be read at one sitting. The first half is somewhat entertaining, but the second half is downright boring. To describe this book as important, I'm afraid one would require checkable source material. And I'm making this point as a person who is very open to the possibilities raised in the book. As it stands, one would need to be a very unquestioning person to take it seriously. Therefore it cannot be recommended as anything other than light entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe True, but I Don't Think So","review":"The story just does not ring true.

The added benefit is that you get to see what it was like growing up during the Victorian era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several friends who will appreciate it. It is written by a child, as his diary in England, in the Victorian era. In it he describes his gradual understanding that not everybody \\"sees\\" what he is able to see. There is something refreshing in the feeling of authenticity he brings in his writing. He is not trying to \\"sell\\" a point of view or convince anyone of anything. He knows what he sees and can say it in this, his private diary. Towards the end, it gets a bit bogged down. And the last section contains some letters he wrote as an adult and these are less engaging to read. The end had no \\"ultimate conclusion\\" that rounded it out as a satisfying read usually does. It is the crisp, childlike honesty of the first half or three-quarters of the book that really makes it something so alive and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job!","review":"It is sturdy.

It is a complete history and each decade is shown in its origianl bright colours or dark hues or some gorgeous combination of both. Batman is served very well as the author lovingly (yet often critically) looks at the many changes this character has gone through and survived. A particular joy is the first chapter and its look at pulps, the real roots of Batman. The book is also useful in its examination of other media, such as TV, movies and the weird and witty range of merchandise produced to cash in on various Batman crazes. This book is pure pleasure and will result in a joyous nostalgic sugar rush for the lucky reader. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life & Times of the Dark Knight","review":"This book serves as a comprehensive \\"biography\\" of Batman's long and wonderful existence looking out for the good folks of Gotham City. From creator Bob Kane's conception of the hero in 1939 to the campy TV series starring the venerable Adam West, up through the more recent movies (good and bad), and the very dark Dark Knight of Frank Miller, no stone is left unturned.The book covers all phases of the character and his various transformations and includes some excellent comic book art (the book's strength), movie stills and photos of rare and unusual collectibles.If you're a fan of comic book art or simply love the character as I do, this is an enjoyable and entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"How anyone can keep a straight face while watching SpongeBob is beyond me!

It's a little more Canadian/Western than \\"June\\", but it still has the same trademark Jann Arden soulful, beautiful, meaningful lyrics that are just as good for a sunny day as a rainy one. \\"Time for Mercy,\\" the title track, is so incredibly moving. \\"Waiting For Someone\\" is also quite soulful, and, as most of Arden's songs, sucks the listener into a web of emotions and into the same plight as this Calgary songstress. \\"Over You\\" is a great last track, and (the bonus track from \\"June\\") \\"I Would Die For You\\" are both great great great songs. A must have for any Jann Arden fan, a must have for any good music fan, and a nice alternative to those typically crunchy, annoying, feel-they're-too-damn-special female singers of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is my third CD by Jann.

The type of music you listen to when your in a mello mood. I also feel they are very orginal. Tracks 2 8 9 & 11 are my favorites. Out of all 4 of Ms. Ardens Cd's \\"Happy\\" is by far my favorite... but time for Mercy makes you think about the more simple things in life...the type of things we take for granted.

Don't keep your fans waiting to long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching Music, but Bad Singing","review":"I bought this cd because I wanted some more music akin to Sarah McLachlan--mellow, touching, beautiful. I think that this cd succeeds on the first two counts, but not the last. I really want to like this cd, I like the music, but her voice is absolutely annoying. She is *constantly* singing under pitch. On every song.
