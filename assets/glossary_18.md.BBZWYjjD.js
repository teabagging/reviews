I thought they had a really good singer back then but the band didn't feel right and they decided to sack him. This is their second album without a vocalist and they still do not sound like a headless band. It's really amazing how they can hold my attention with nothing more than a guitar, bass and drums. Their influences seem to range from Black Sabbath to Lynyrd Skynyrd and from Hendrix to Kyuss. Well I have to say that they melted all those influences into something they can call their own. Thumbs up for this band that deserves better than they have had until now. It's just too bad that there aren't more instrumental bands of this calibre around.

If the music on this CD resembles anything, it would be Clutch and not Slayer ... come on man. All instrumentals that do not get boring.

Just about any death metal band for another). Point is . . . KTB is good background music for whatever you might want to do. Its lively. Its crunchy. Its fun. Sounds like Kyuss, but not as good. Sounds vaguely like Clutch, as others have said, but nowhere near as good (speaking of singers you want in the equation).

These guys are so STRIPPED BACK, they almost make AC / DC sound like PROG ROCK. Had there been some cool solos as well as a bit more variety, this cd could have been a winner. ALAS there are no guitar solos and every track follows the same insipid formula.

This play is based around the murder of sargent Waters who was a black man. Throughout the play clues are thrown at you that just make you want to turn the page.During the time period of the play there was still descrimition aganist blacks so that also adds to the action and the main conflicts in the book.Otherwise reading this play it is great to act out it gives you a viratery of characters to choose from and diffrent emotions to put across. I say that solider's play is a great book if you like shows like law and order and mystery soliving movies. I grantee if you purchase this book you will not be disapointed.

Horray!If you're wanting to purchase this set and aren't seriously considering it because it's Region 2, think again! Most (if not all) new DVD players can be \\"hacked\\" in order to change it to be multi-regional. It's incredibly easy! Try googling \\"dvd region hack\\" and look around for your DVD player. It's well worth the little effort for me because I love so many British shows that aren't available in the US or they have Special Edition DVDs that have extras that we don't have.

Admittedly Alan Moore doesn't want his name associated in any way with the movie but these two statements create the impression that \\"V For Vendetta\\" is entirely the creation of the Wachowski brothers.Once you get into the book...well let's just say its done nothing to change my opinion of novelizations of movies based on novels.

It works for all size wires and makes it easy to adjust the amount of wire you want to strip and thus can strip each wire at a consistent length (very useful for applications where the device to be wired \\"expects\\" a certain length of bare wire - typical with many wall switches).

Two at a time is definatly not a problem if you get them even. The crimpers on them are worthless as you already have to pull against springs to close the crimping section, they are about 2-3 inches below the hinge; being between the handles it is very difficult to get the wire to stay inside the connector while positioning it on the crimper.The construction appears solid, and the wire cutter works alright. The real beauty is not having to position the wire in a certain slot and with one quick pull, the wire is striped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strips smaller wires better than larger ones","review":"I have a pair of wire strippers that I have used for a while now. But when it came to the 24 AWG CAT5 ethernet, my old ones didn't have a cutout small enough. I bought these to replace my old strippers and then some. However, the thicker the wire, the worse these things do. When stripping ethernet, I have had a 100% success rate. However, getting up to 14-12 AWG, the success rate dwindles to 25% or lower.

It is a miserable thing to use - it always burns what you are toasting (or it won't toast it at all), the shelf is nearly impossible to get out, the handle keeps coming off, and pulling the inside out takes an act of God!I wish I had back my cheapy $20 toaster oven instead of this one I bought for $50!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toast-Disaster","review":"Bar none, this is the worst toaster ever built and I have no idea how it ever made it out of the test kitchen.

The love scenes were gruesome in particular- the dialogue that is used to express a young man's sexual desire, one of the most natural scenes to encounter in art and life, is here made irrevocably awkward and discomforting. My sense of the author was of a man who thought that writing simple thoughts down simply, and in relatively short sentences, was enough to make him the new Hemingway (he miscalculated). I also puzzled at the author's photo that accompanied his bio on the back cover- is the anxious look upon this man's face spotted with snowflakes supposed to remind me of the politically conscientious Redford?

Depressing viewing indeed. Wow, how has his hair stayed so brown when all his contemporaries are gray? Incredible!More importantly, his post-Band music is not much chop (it's embarrassing, actually) and he comes across as incredibly vain, single-handedly taking credit for all The Band's music. Still, he has some interesting turns of phrase and the interviews aren't bad.Far better is Levon Helm's autobiography \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" (1556524056)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife is Very happy","review":"This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do. I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is. A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile. The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands.

Do not buy this \\"Penguin Classics\\" edition!!!!!!!!!It is horrible! All the good parts have been \\"abridged\\" out of it.This is one of the silliest ideas I ever heard-but Penguin apparently tried to \\"clean up\\" Casanova. They have removed most of his stories about seduction from his auto-biography! Since Casanova was the world's greatest lover, I don't know why they think anyone would want the book except to read about seductions but those are exactly the parts they took out!Only Penguin could make Casanova boring.Buy a different edition of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy History of My Life Vol. 1-2 if you want the real Casanova","review":"Just like most people looking at this book, I grabbed it because I didn't think there would be any difference between this version and the unabridged version. I was dead wrong. This version is abridged, and is almost completely censored. So if you're looking for racy tales about Casanova's exploits with the fairer sex, you will be very, very disapointed. In fact, if you're looking for any evidence of Casanova's cleverness, his wit, his great writing style, or awesome storytelling ability, you will not find it here at all! However, the book \\"History of My Life\\", which is the completely uncensored translation of the book by William Trask is a gem. Not only does it have all of the exploits that make Casanova,well, Casanova, but it also lets us see him for who he truly was: a Renaissance man (arguably a genius) who had one hell of a libido."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD EDITION","review":"Reading this book was a real chore.

Some books I love and would read everyday, this one bugs me for some reason.But having said that, the book is well done. It's all about waking up and finding weird things going on in your house and on the way to school. The story line tells you how many oddities you need to find in the illustrations on each page and the text is pretty easy for a beginning reader to get through.Even though we have read through it tons of times, my daughter still loves to find all the things wrong (knowing that she's found them many times before)."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Illustrations Needed","review":"They need to get a new version done with a better illustrator.

Very disappointing to me. A word to the editor: spelling and grammar matter. There were consistent misspellings, such as \\"seperate,\\" and \\"it's\\" for the possessive \\"its.\\" That's just shoddy and there's no reason for it--this is a formal publication, not an exercise for English Comp I. As to the content of the book, I was less than thrilled to see that the author had merely painted over the existing facial screening of the doll rather than removing the original paint and starting from scratch.

It did show a few photos of other dolls, but it seemed to more showcase the artist, but did not say what or how she did things to them. It's ok for a beginner book, but I have seen better.

Part of the book's appeal is that it has a 90's feel to it, younger fans will find that they can relate to the novel very well indeed while hard-core fans will appreciate it's regenerated form.

This effort resulted in no appreciable impact.I specifically and repeatedly targeted a particularly irksome offender, using every conceivable angle of attack, throughout which it stubbornly and valiantly resisted the so-called blade.I should add that while it fails to trim anything, the device does in fact result in sensations that cannot be called pleasurable as it pulls on your nose hairs in futility.In case this is not enough to dissuade you from making this purchase, the device also produces an unpleasant and potentially harmful ozone smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reviews are correct","review":"I got one of these and the blades would spin for just a bit before the unit stopped even with a fresh battery. Starting and stopping all the time was a pain. It also got hot if I tried to run it long enough to boldly probe where no nostril has been probed before.

It's underpowered, so it starts up kind of slow, and you wonder if it is up to the task. One AA battery isn't enough. 3. The cutters seem cheap and don't trim very closely. 4.

I decided to go with this little \\"bad boy.\\" Let me just start by saying that if you are looking to buy this product, you better have three inch nose hairs because this little device is unable to trim my nose hairs. Basically you have two small blades attached to two plastic hooks. The plastic hooks are spun by a plastic notch (hint: all plastic usually means garbage.) Since it is only powered by one battery it lacks power. Just to see if this thing really could cut hair I tried to trim a piece of hair on my head and just as I expected it whipped the piece of hair around in a circular motion failing to cut it. Bottom line, this is a very poorly made product (Made in China) with a Panasonic logo that should NOT be on this product. I have never purchased anything by Panasonic that was made this poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, works, but needs lube","review":"I've had mine for several years now and I find it very dependable and useful. I initially had some startup problems that I, too, thought might be battery or switch related. However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable. As with all hair-cutting clippers and shavers, blade lubrication is needed. The other thing people should know is that while the blades cut in a rotary direction, the only way the hairs get into the cutter is through the slots. So this tool cuts on the way IN only, so just putting it in the area and leaving it there will be ineffective...you have to insert and reinsert to get uncut hairs into the slots. Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool. The \\"pulling\\" and \\"tickling\\" that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"You should think about using eye-watering tweezers rather than buy this product. I gave up using it after the first few attempts because, amazingly, it doesn't cut hair! You spend 5 minutes trying to align each hair so that it will enter the nozzle at the right angle to cut. Even then, the blades tend to push the hairs out of the way rather than cut them. It even managed to scratch the inside of my nose because I was pushing too hard to make it work.

Or, perhaps, sounding like your downstairs neighbor had his stereo cranked but had the treble turned to 11 and you were hearing it through the heating ducts.

This occurs when the grind is too fine. I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine. To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap. I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.

Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema.

Maybe both acting and directing were too much for him on film rather than on stage. Or maybe Miss Monroe, the consummate movie actress, was too instinctive and spontaneous for his formal, studied, exercise in self control. Ironically this was the conflict between the two main characters in the story, but on screen it only comes off as a confusion of acting styles as if they were in two different movies entirely, sinking the whole mess of a project once you begin to wonder just what does that showgirl see in this self absorbed mannequin after all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for marilyn fans","review":"entertaining, at times a bit slow, movie with Laurence Olivier (who also directed) and Marilyn, of course.

Prince and Showgirl is a great Monroe movie that, like several of her other movies, showcases her talents as a comedic genius. And there are slight glimpses of her skill at drama as well. It's just a shame that she had to use Lawrence Oliver as her co-star. He didn't seem to have a comedic bone in his body!

I have 17 films in which Marilyn Monroe appears or stars, and I can say with certainty that in this one, she is her most radiant, most charming, and most beautiful. And because this is her \\"happiest\\" film, she giggles, and she laughs, and it's marvelous! My favorite film will always be \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" and I think Marilyn's best acting is in \\"The Misfits.\\" But in \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" I see Marilyn Monroe as the gorgeous American Icon we all love and cherish.

I didn't care about any of the characters and, in fact, found the leads quite unlikable. Elsie is the stereotypical dumb blonde who is (of course) the smartest one in the story. Her giggly, breathy bimbo act gets very old fast. Olivier's Prince is a pompous, lascivious bully who hates his own and the son is unpleasant, as well.

I would rather have been at the dentist","review":"I love Marilyn and she was beautiful and charming as ever in this, but that could not save it. This never should have been made. I was asleep within the first fifteen minutes. I painfully forced myself to watch it out of respect for Marilyn. It was a very very painful and probably one of the longest two hours of my life.Showgirl meets rude Prince. They fall in love? When did this happen? I never saw any indication of this in the film. I also could not for the life of me see why she would want such a rude person!The movie takes place mainly in one room of the Prince's manor. I will probably have nightmares of that room for the next year!You have been warned!

The DVD is in the old \\"standard\\" 1:33 format, meaning they chopped off the sides to fit the older, smaller box TV format. This was filmed in 1957, so I believe it was filmed in widescreen, wasn't it? I give the movie five stars; it's one of MM's best. Just rating the DVD release two stars for this reason. I want to see the movie like it was shown in the theaters, so I will return my copy to Amazon, and wait for a decent release of this classic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Descriptoin","review":"Although this machine does indeed make hard ice cream soft, you need to use a pint of ice cream to get two cones. The rest of the ice cream remains on the blade and you practically have to eat if off there.The ice cream also has to be extremely hard or it will be liquified.The on/off switch has to be depressed constantly, because as soon as you release the switch the machine goes off. The machine also has to be operated by two persons, because of the hardness of the on/off switch.For me this was a very bad buy. I used it just once and never will again. For me it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought one locally for my Mom as she likes soft serve, well, I HAD to buy one for myself, and that's when I saw Amazon has it and I'm buying it. It makes ice cream like you get from soft serve machines at DQ and places like that. You do need to make sure the ice cream you put in the machine is VERY hard, other wise it wont make a good soft serve cone, it'll be way to soft. This machine is great if you are making more than one cone, and you will need atleast two people if you are making cones. It's a nice little kitchen tool, and I highly recommend this. Play around and come up with neat mixes, add candy and nut pieces, have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy.","review":"This is a quick way to get soft serve ice cream with store bought ice cream. I did find it rather easy but the ice cream must be very hard. Ice hard to be exact otherwise it comes out to soft for cones. Make sure you fill it up to get best results. This machine is not good for making just one. Also for cones you need two people, one to work the machine since you got to hold the button down to keep it going at the same time pumping down on the handle. That's two hands right there. The person needs to hold and turn the cone. Blending in topping is the best. It really crunches it up. I used chocolate balls and they got grounded into powder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I am really disappointed with the performance of this product. It is poorly designed for operation. It requires that you keep your finger on a pulse-type on/off switch while you are also pumping a handle or pushing down on a plunger in the feed tube of the machine. The blade that blends the ice cream with the additives does not turn fast enough. The directions say you need to have very frozen ice cream. Well, they mean frozen like an ice core sample dug from the Arctic! I started with what I thought was rock hard ice cream and that was too soft. This product is a waste of money. You could achieve the same end result by blending additives into ice cream by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real review...what you need to know","review":"Here is the real review. The one I got did NOT have this button problem I have been reading about. That tells me that all of you who had to hold the button down had defective buttons. The main thing, it takes way too much ice cream to make way too few cones. The chute does not hold enough ice cream before needing more packed in. I packed the chute full, and got one cone out. I packed it again and got two cones. The blade stores about a cones worth on it, so when you are done, put it in the freezer for next time.I returned it. I would rather use all that great ice cream packed hard on a cone. It takes alot longer to eat a hard ice cream cone that a soft one, that's for sure. Stick to the hard stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I asked everyone to get me one for a Christmas gift so my daughter did, because she knows I like soft serve ice cream. First it was very hard to figure out how to even use it and second you need two people to run the darn machine and you have to use so much ice cream for one serving. Third, you lose a lot of ice cream in the twister and it is hard to clean inside the base. I would never recommend it to anyone, in fact if someone asked me about it I would tell them it is not a good product and I would advise them to save their money. Black & Decker this is one for the Hall Of Shame... Better go back to the drawing board and try to invent a new machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer confirmed information","review":"After reading previous reviews on how the Arctic Twister is difficult to say the least to operate, I contacted the manufacturer directly.

This is a poor investment dont not buy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad ...","review":"It's too bad ... I really wanted this to work, since I love soft serve. But after using it twice I donated to Goodwill.It would be great if somebody brought out a home version of the \\"drill\\" thing they use in some frozen yogurt places. Until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours, then stir it up with a spoon until it's the preferred level of softness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many unhappy returns.","review":"Pros:1) If you are willing to spend over half an hour trying to make it, you can have soft serve anytime.Cons:1) You have to hold the on switch while pumping the handle of this machine.2) You have to put the components in the freezer for 10 minutes before you can use machine (or you end up with even soupier ice cream).3) It is REALLY loud.4) It takes forver to get the ice cream out.5) It takes forever to clean.6) It wastes ice cream. It takes almost a half gallon for two servings and I'd wager that's because of the amount that gets stuck inside the thing.7) By the time you get a decent sized dish of ice cream it's horribly melted.It's just awful. Mine is going back to my sister so she can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after three times","review":"I am very disappointed with this machine. I used this machine three times and the motor stopped working. I am currently in the process of receiving a new one from the company. Also, a 1/2 gallon of ice cream will only get your four servings.

The only way this product would get a star from me would be a big punch in the eye to the people at Black and Decker. I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for the family. Today is the first try for nice smooth ice cream and the machine broke before the first chocolate chip hit the ice cream. Today is Dec. the 26th. So now I have to go to the trouble of sending it back. What a piece of junk. Hope you all have better luck with it than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the picture","review":"As others noted, the machine is a disappointment. One half-gallon of ice cream made 4 servings. (Where does it all go??) The mix-ins get ground so fine there are no chunks left. The worst feature is the amount of ice cream left on the mixing blade. And it is nearly impossible to get that ice cream off to eat without just licking the blade.The ice cream must be very hard, and pre-freezing the parts also helps keep the ice cream from melting. Until B&D perfects this, I'd stick with Dairy Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and very noisy","review":"This noisy machine was extemely disappointing for my daughter's 15th birthday.

Certainly not worth the rather high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this.","review":"I bought this and found like the others before me the button is awful to press.

The film is constructed around the hum-drum life of schoolteacher, Emil Jannings; thus throwing a heavy spotlight on Marlene Dietrich, but all to what avail? As empty and soulless as the empty bottles and stuffed ashtrays at the end of the night in the Weimar beer halls it depicts. One can feel Von Sternberg holding back on his usual visual flair to give credence to the story itself. Can one imagine a modern day actress like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock as Lola Lola?

I used to think this was a superior trimmer. Now, it is on par with all the others.I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews, and I loved it. I will admit it that the only drwaback was that it would very slightly pull hairs if they were too long, but that could be avoided with routine use.My kids recently broke mine. Without hesitation, I reordered from Amazon. I was shocked to discover this newer version has a less powerful motor. I knew the second I turned it that the motor was different. It sounded like my old one with nearly dead batteries!It took longer to trim hairs and did not even do a thorough job.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Purchase This Item!","review":"I have purchased 3 of these, (1) a couple of years ago, (2) and (3) this last August, 2006.The last two were purchased because of the performance of (1).

So I went with another Panasonic.My old Panasonic didn't hurt. Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly. Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter, not on the tip.This (reviewed) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter, where they are TWISTED out of your skin. It hurts like crazy - and I'm highly pain tolerant. I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller. But it's a totally ineffective compromise. It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit. Entertaining for my wife, yes, but this thing is no good. Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouchy!","review":"Of the 3 nose hair trimmers, 'personal grooming devices', I've used this one caused the most pain.

Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair. I didn't know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try. Well, I'm sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I'm not an experienced hair trimmer user. And other models don't have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and some winch over it. In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it didn't occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned. The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars, for performance alone I would it it none as I haven't found any use for it. If I had the box it came in I'd wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"But---I read the reviews!!!!","review":"I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband, he has an old trimmer he had used for years, so I thought a new good one for x-mas, I read alll the reviews and bought this one, well he says it works ok but it pulls hairs, this is a nose,ears trimmer,but he says it feels more like a type of torture device.

I'm surprised other reviews haven't said this thing friggin hurts to use. A few point to keep in mind; I have used a nose trimmer before w/ no problems (chrome Remington model). By \\"hurt\\" I mean it doesn't feel good, not \\"I'm a puss\\". Lastly, I have nose whiskers not just nose hair, this matters. Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard. This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest. I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair... not the 20 gage wire I'm growing. Overall this product gets the job done but I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality product","review":"I just fired up my new trimmer today. It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried. The testing ground was nose and ears. My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles. But this trimmer handled the challenge well. The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because I felt like the hair was almost being pulled, so the trimming process made me a bit edgy.Please do not ask me to borrow nose hair trimmer. It is for my use only."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit working after 3 months","review":"initially It was painfull to use.

I, like most men, have hair growing in my ears and nose that tend to be a pain to groom. I have nipped my ears a number of times when trying to cut wild hairs with scissors. The same with my nose. I like to present a neat appearance and that is hard to do with stray hairs growing where they shouldn't be. Plucking is effective but can hurt quite a bit.With the Panasonic groomer, it's a breeze. No nicks and it is quick and easy to do both my ears and nose. It is easy to clean afterwards as well. Now I just spend 5 minutes with the groomer every 3 or 4 weeks and no more wild hair problems.

Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again. Exact same experience. Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this is a crappy product. It might very well be a combination of the two.Honestly, every Panasonic product I've owned has broken down on me before a resonable time.

In my experience, the blade would go bad before the first battery had to be replaced. However it would trim small hairs from the nose and ears very well.Panasonic has changed the blade design from an 'L' shaped blade, which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides, to an 'I' shaped blade, which only cuts hair entering from the sides. This has changed the trimmer into a lousy product. It now does a poor job of trimming hair from the nose, or ears, or anywhere else.Panasonic probably made the change so that the blade will last longer. Of course it will, because now it doesn't trim anything. There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product. Stay away from this product and buy from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase!!!","review":"I purchased this trimmer after owning a Wahl trimmer for 4 years, and what a mistake that was.

Problem is, as someone else reviewed, it may not work properly for very long. I only used it about ten times, and the next time I turned it on, it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center, I don't know.

I dread putting it up my nose. I found it to be painful and irritating, and I bled when I tried to get too close. Maybe all of the other nose hair trimmers are worse. A friend of mine had a manual nose hair trimmer that he wound up his nose, and it stuck, he had to pull it out. This isn't THAT bad. But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or whatever. I have not tried it on my ears, maybe it would be good for that, but I don't need that.

It makes a lot of noise like it's doing something, but spins and spins and doesn't remove any hair. If you mash it flush against the skin (which is a real blast), it might nick a hair or two.

Not for tender noses! ... the thing hurts and leave red inflamed marks on tender skin. I really just can't stand to use it at all ... I fear it's going to draw blood. It might be OK on ears, but I don't need it for that. It's also of flimsy construction and I'm afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop, that would be the end of it.

It IS the coffeemaker's fault. I've set my grinder at midrange and it still gets clogged in the the drip chute. Forget buying preground coffee-you can't buy fine ground coffee and expect your counter to stay dry. Is it overpriced-absolutely. As I like tepid coffee, I will not join others and say it is not hot enough.

The controls are easy to use, and the coffee brews fast. Most importantly, the coffee tastes great--far superior than tasted through my Cuisinart brewer. The water head seems to cook the coffee more thoroughly than my previous coffee maker. Also, the thermal design keeps it warm and not bitter for three hours. The standard gold filter provided is a nice touch. The Capresso coffeemaker is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased so far","review":"It seems to be a better-made machine than the brands we had purchased previously (Krups and Braun top-of-the-line models).

I buy coffee directly from a coffee roaster so I like a good, full-bodied coffee. I got a flavorful cup of coffee and, initially, the coffee stayed hot in the the thermal carafe for maybe two hours. Now, the carafe does not keep the coffee hot at all even when I preheat it with scalding hot water. I called the company and they will sell me a replacement cafafe for about the same cost of the newer model Capresso. I said \\"no, thanks.\\" They lost my business as I continue my quest for a coffee maker that keeps the coffee hot after it is brewed. The thermal carafe lid is also somewhat difficult to open for pouring the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso pot lid is defective","review":"I like this pot, it brews a great pot when it's all cleaned out ( I use baking soda, some Borax and a scrubby brush), but the carafe lid does not come apart for cleaning and is clearly filled with coffee gunk. I shake it and brown gunk comes out, but I'm sure there's some left in there that is then dripping into my coffee. Please fix this lid, make the whole thing easy to clean with no hidden gunk places.The price was steep for a partial stainless, partial plastic machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good coffee, fast and fresh","review":"I have owned this coffee maker for 6 weeks and I could not be happier. Having tried several others and found them wanting, this is a great relief. The coffee is brewed very fast and has a fresh clean taste.

I'm very happy with the money spent on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I was really dissapointed on this capresso coffeemaker. First of all, if you don't line up the carafe with the top perfectly, you will wake up with spilled coffee all over the kitchen counter.

We will never recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"Never know what to expect from this thing. One time it makes coffee, the next it pumps water and coffee all over my kitchen counter.

Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing!","review":"For a very expesive coffee maker this is a severly dissapointing product. About 20% of the time we use the pot (7-8 cups) it ends up backing up and overflowing, causing a huge mess of grounds and coffee. It seems the flow rate intot he pot is faster than the flow out to the carafe, or perhaps the carafe develops an air-lock. Whatever it is a disaster and a flawed device. Besides the coffee tastes better in my 10 year old $50 Krups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more for the price...","review":"I've had this coffee maker for about two years now and have had many problems with it from day one.First, the pause feature used to pour a cup while brewing does not work at all. Coffee continues to brew all over the base when I pull out the carafe.Second, by the time I'm ready for my second cup of coffee, it's not hot anymore and I have to microwave it for about 30 seconds.Third, the lid to the carafe can only be turned about a quarter turn to pour the coffee, any more than that and the lid will fall off and you'll end up pouring coffee all over the counter like my parents did when they were visiting. (Really, for this much money, should you have to explain to your house guests how to pour a cup of coffee?!) It's embarrassing.If I hadn't spent so much on it I would have already bought a different one to replace it. Save your money, believe the reviews and buy something dependable and worthwhile.

I haven't had any problem with the way the carafe fills, etc. Just add coffee, water and go. I really like the carafe because it's relatively \\"undrippable\\". After I pour a cup of coffee, there's no \\"drip\\" hanging from the spout.It's a great design, looks good on the counter, and brews a nice cup of coffee.

I would gladly pay this type of premium for better coffee but this machine is not worth it. First and most importantly, the coffee is never hot. As others have written, every cup has to go in the microwave for 35 seconds if you like your coffee hot. We often have guests and if I forget to show them the little dot on the top, they spill coffee all over...embarrassing for them and a mess for me. I was glad when it died. Back to Braun, non-programmable machine at $14.99...the coffee is hot and tastes great again. It's the beans, not the maker, that seem to matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee - High Price","review":"I am sitting here enjoying my 2nd cup of French Roast after getting the coffee maker yesterday. It tastes great and just like it does from my favorite coffee shop where I bought the coffee. I knew when I purchased the unit it was high priced and it is way over priced. Its not made in the USA but atleast its not made in China. I agree with other reviews that the caraffe is not the best. It pours coffee very slow. Unlike my last coffee maker it does brew a whole lot faster. It is twice as fast and that is good for the flavor of the coffee. The beans are not over brewed. Overall it is a great machine but could be half the price. Now I am waiting for my Baratza Maestro Plus Burr Coffee Grinder to come in the mail and I will be all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker","review":"This is a fine coffeemaker with not a whole lot of bells and whistles.

I bought it based on reviews on this website. It was a disappointment. The carafe DOES NOT keep the coffee warm very long. I make a pot around 6:00 am. By 7:00 or so, I'm having to heat my cup of coffee in the microwave to get it hot enough to drink. I would like it to keep the coffee a good hot drinking temperature for at least a couple of hours. This one does not.Also, after a years use, it has now started \\"spitting\\" steam on every brew. I've cleaned it three times now and it hasn't helped. I start out with 8 cups of water in the tank and wind up with about 7 cups of coffee, not to mention, it is very noisy when it's hissing away all the steam.I will say, it brews a good cup of coffee.

If the carafe were not put on the coffee maker, or if it were misaligned, the coffee would brew and I would wake up to a small lake of coffee on the counter, in the drawers below, on the floor, you get the picture.

Besides the price, by far the biggest problem is that the coffee is only luke-warm even if you pour it the second it is done, (don't think of using the \\"sneak a cup\\" feature to get one before it stops because that doesn't work either. The carafe is also a nightmare as it is exasperatingly slow to pour out of even if you unscrew to the point of the top coming off and there is no way to clean the dried coffee from the bottom of the carafe through its very narrow opening. Really, you don't ask so many things from a coffee machine that it should have this many problems, especially at this premium price. A classic example of decent form over very bad function."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"After years of perked coffee, we decided it was time to get with the times and get a drip maker. After a thorough search of retail stores and the internet, we decided to go the price, and get what appeared to us to be the best. We made the right choice. This coffee is super. We have been using gourmet coffee for years, and can't stop raving about much better it tastes with this coffee maker. It is hot, and stays hot. It is fantastic to take the thermal coffee pot to the table, and when the weather is right, to our patio. The programming is unbelievably simple. Our only regret is that we didn't make the move to this coffee maker sooner. We have a Capresso burr grinder that we purchased about a year ago, and that helped give us confidence in the Capresso name. This grinder is a perfect partner to this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes cold coffee","review":"We are very disappointed with the Capresso coffee maker. Unless we rinsed the carafe with hot water and used hot water to brew the coffee immediately, then we would end up with luke warm coffee. We would have to drink the coffee immediately since the carafe could not keep the coffee warm for over 30 minutes. Using the automatic timer was therefore useless.After waking up morning after morning to automatically brewed semi cold coffee, I went out and bought a Cuisinart stainless steel 12cup automatic coffee maker which brews hot excellent coffee automatically with no hassles. The Capresso is all looks and with no capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst quality ever!","review":"I bought this coffee maker a few years ago (I'm a sucker for design).

They ignore the message because they don't think the song is catchy. The West isn't dark enough to feel Nas. They wanna see someone ridin a 64 on a sunny day smoking. If it ain't about killin, smokin, or f$#%in, they don't wanna hear it. When they hear, 'New York, New York' comin out their speakers, they shut their brains off and try to find Dr. Dre.

It was enough to just see Puff Daddy with Nas to make me realize that Nas had changed from the person he used to be when he made \\"Illmatic\\". The only song from his new albumn worth listening to is \\"Nas is Like\\", the rest are a sad example of what happened to \\"Nasty Nas\\" (Nas Escobar's former real hip-hop self). Nas Escobar destroyed \\"Nasty Nas\\" in a battle of money and greed. He then proceeded to make \\"I Am\\", a direct contrast of what \\"Nasty Nas\\" used to be.

Nas combines a little bit of It Was Written however with Nas first album (the hip-hop classic)Illmatic. Nas goes all out on the album. With tracks such as N.Y. State Of Mind, Money Is My Bitch, and the tribute to the late greats The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur on We Will Survive. Nas also has excellent help from guest artist Puff Daddy, Scarface, DMX and Aaliyah. The production is also tight. With super-producers Timbaland and Poke and Tone of Trackmasters. Of course the Q.B. native also has Big L.E.S. on the album and one of hip-hop's greatest producers D.J. Premier.(On the track Nas Is Like) Nas goes all out on the album showing the world that this the best album out right now until his second part of the album drops in October."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazin","review":"I Am is the best rap album of '99. i felt that 75% of the album was tight and the rest filled in the gaps.

Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It ain't hard to tell, the CD ain't all That\\"","review":"Now I understand fully why Nas' first single \\"Nas is like\\" was released first. The DJ Premier (GANGSTARR) produced track is clearly the best beat on this otherwise mediocre album. DJ Premier makes the best tracks that suit Nas' flow. Why he didn't use him more is a mystery. Most of the production on this album was done by the Trackmasters. They should be called the wackmasters. I'm sorry but I'm 33 years old and I have been listening to Hip Hop since before they new what to call it, and this is not a great CD. I believed the hype and purchased it because I like his flow. But if the beats don't move me, I can't get into the lyrics. Out of the 3 Nas albums this is the worst. There is no enjoyment in buying a 15 track album with less than 4 decent cuts on it. Illmatic 4ever baby! Maybe the Oct 99 release of \\"Nastradomous\\" will be better.

YOu won't see me tonight is a good song about not having time for your girlfriend. Please get this if you don't like bad words get this edited version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight","review":"Each song is tight lyrically. The rap is better than anything besides 2pac and biggie.

This is the album all Nas fans have been waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of hip-hop history","review":"Nas's third LP to hit stores, \\"I Am\\", should be a definite choice when it comes to your hip-hop shopping cart. With the already blazing new singles, \\"Nas Is Like\\" (produced by DJ Premier) & \\"Hate Me Now\\" (featuring Puff Daddy), you're sure to find some of Nas's best work on this album. With cuts like \\"NY State Of Mind Part II\\" and \\"Ghetto Prisoners\\" for the hardcore fan and for the dance tracks, you'll find \\"You Won't See Me Tonight\\" (featuring Aaliyah) and \\"Dr. Knockboot\\". Nas goes from East Coast lyrical wizard to gangstafied street pharmacist. This third effort is for all kinds of hip-hop fans and is full of slamming beats and lyrics that you wanna rewind over & over. This album combines the lyrical content of \\"Illmatic\\" and the street game of \\"It Was Written\\". Peep it. Don't sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"money money money is my bitch...","review":"Yeah money money money is nas's bitch but he definitely didn't bring any in on this album judging by the reviews on here.

Yeah some albums aren't as strong as lets say Stillmatic or Lost Tapes, but there is no nas album that just completely is a failure, not when you have Nas writing the lyrics. AND STOP COMPARING EVERY ALBUM TO ILLMATIC. This is NOT illmatic and nas WILL NEVER make another album like illmatic, who wants to hear illmatic again?? I think over every CD nas switched up his style to evolve himself to who he is today, whether that be a good thing or a bad thing. If every CD sounded like the last one he wouldn't be a true artist, period.

Nas then came with It Was Written, although not as good as his debut, still an extremely tight album. With this, the 3rd release from the ghetto child Nas, I Am stands as the worst of Nas' 4 albums. The beats are weak as hell, and there are only a few tracks on the disc that are even listenable, and even they get old after a few spins. This album is just another indication of where modern rap music is going - nowhere. If you are serious about rap music, want good lyrics and phat beats, you need to look no further than Kool Keith, it seems he's the only rapper with any innovation these days. Steer far away from this release from my former favorite rapper - NAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD should be called \\"Nas I Am... Not\\"...","review":"This album is just absolutely horrible. It's a nightmare. Don't get me wrong I WAS a big Nas fan until this joke came out. The beats and rhythm do not match Nasir's original masterpiece, Illmatic (5 stars) at all. The lyrics are ok but he needs a nice rhythm and beat to back it up. There is only one alright song on the whole album and that is \\"Nas Is Like\\". You can just buy the single for \\"Nas Is Like\\" so don't by this junk. This CD should be called \\"Nas I Am... Not\\" because this just ain't Nas.

Dj Premier of Gang Starr blesses two tracks and Nas is all over it. But he does lose some of his edge on the Timberland produced \\"You won't see me tonight\\" with Aaliyah.

While I personally would prefer Nas to return to the non-commercial flavor of ILLMATIC, I can't knock him for trying to reach a larger audience through his music - afterall, the man's got to get paid. The lyrics are tight and Primo's tracks are incredible once again (by far the best on the album).

I like most of trackmasters stuff but I don't think that they can hold it down for the strong lyrical content that Nas seems to always put forth.

Actually this is a 4.5 stars, almost a classic 'cause with the exception of track 14, the album is fantastic.I haven't had the oportunity to listen \\"Ilmatic\\" yet but I do know it's a classic!! his best album so far and I think \\"I am\\" could be as good as \\" Ilmatic\\".Nas is one of the best lirycists in the game if not THE NUMBER ONE! his storytelling is great, he can make you visualize every single rhyme..he's a street poet and he's still true to this game and that's why people r still feeling and suporting him.About the album it's hard to choose the best track..the premo production in \\"Nas is like\\" and \\"NYC state of mind part II\\" r amazing..the basic premo but he's the best!! and the timbaland track really impressed me...Well I think you should buy this album..it's one of the best reeleases of 99, I've just listened to it and it's the kind of album that u will listen every damn day..trust me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I am\\" going to play this all summer!! It's hot!","review":"This new release from nas is hot. I don't understand what's the problem with people trying to compare this to illmatic his last album. People have to understand that he got a different state of mind now, and this album is about things happening now. Not back in the late 80\\"s. Even though I never heard illmatic, I say this is a classic. Especially compared to what's dropping now like (harlem world, etc...). If you want a banging album with tight beats and lyrics to make you really think pick this up. I don't know about everyone else , but compared to \\"It was written\\" his last album, this is way better overall even though his last one had some tight songs like \\"If I ruled the world(feat. Lauryn Hill). Don't listen to the hype and don't listen to people who want to hear another album of illmatic. Just go out and listen for yourself, and you'll see what \\"nas is like\\".

His lyrics and production was untouchable.Especially his lyrical skills, damn, this kid was god. the words that were coming from his mouth were straight knowledge. But now on \\"I am\\" the production was wack with the commercial trackmasterz and nas lyrical skills were good but not even close to what was on Illmatic. I was dissapointed with nas this time, despite \\" Nas is like \\" NY state of mind 2\\" and \\" Undying love\\" this album was poor. Nas, please leave esco and come back to Nasty Nas. PS DMX is the worst rappper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album - Dissapointment","review":"Nas totally sold out. He fell away from the underground scene and found an unexcusable spot in the commercial mainstream. The commercial is trash, all they talk about is money, drugs and murder. But what really bothers me is the money money money money. Who are they fooling? They're talking about they keep it real when they talk about million dollars and driving around in fancy cars. Come on, I don't see real people driving around in rich fancy cars throwing cash around like it was nothing. I say Nas should of stayed REAL like his first album \\"Illmatic\\", because that's when he showed he had talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"Nas's third album to date and a real disapointment. The only track to check for is \\"Nas is Like\\" with production by dj primo. This track gets the 1 star I gave the album. This track is sort of reminiscent of the Illmatic Lp. It seems Nas is more interested in how many G's he can bank and unfortunately has forgotten how to keep his music pure and creative. Its also funny that he was the one running around screaming keep it real. I can't believe this is the same emcee we heard on Illmatic...........its too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas Is Back","review":"On Nasir Jones' third LP \\"I Am...\\" he brings it back to where he left off on \\"Illmatic\\" the classic Nas LP. I would be giving this 4 1/2 stars but this site won't let you. Nas's official come back tune, the first real song, \\"NY State Of Mind 2\\" is a sequel to \\"NY State Of Mind\\" Off of \\"Illmatic\\". He brings it back to the roots of Hip Hop here with the track done by DJ Premier. On his lead single \\"Nas Is Like\\" he shows how he went from rugged Nasty Nas to big willie, Nas Escobar, then to just plain Nas. His other best tracks are, \\"Favor For A Favor\\" featuring Scarface, \\"Small World\\", \\"Undying Love\\", and \\"Big Things\\". The only minor slip is \\"Hate Me Now\\". OK, a little FYI for dope rappers like Nas himself, PUFF DADDY IS TERRIBLE, DO NOT USE HIM IN YOUR SONGS. The hook on this is just flat out annoying. But besides that this album is close to classic. Check out \\"I Am\\" if you wanna hear Nas the way he used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is wak!","review":"A boy comes out talking about nothing and you act like its the best.

Alot of the songs on the album i can relate to. Eventhough \\"Pappa was a Player\\" didn't make the final cut to be on the album that is one of my favorite cuts. That song made me relate so much to my most recent relationship. Nas has really made an impact on my life in the neighborhoods near me and we can relate being that we come from simular home towns that're really close. It would be a dream come true to be able to show my appreciation to Nasir but being that that is a dream I can show love online. Personally I think Nas is doing his thing and anyone that says otherwise is basically just HATIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1/2 MAN 1/2 AMAZING","review":"Nas to me is the definition of half man half amazing.

It has no flow at all and just plain sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hip hop album since Jay-Z album","review":"THis album is off the hook. It should be listened too over and over again and the lyrics should be heard word for word. This is his year he should come hout with the video for hate me now and his album sales will sky rocker. There is not a rapper like him today except for Jay-Z. His album has the most amazing lyrics. Its not better then Illmatic but better then It was written"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic resource","review":"I just read this book and highly recommend it - especially to teachers who want to give their students a comprehensive look at global issues. The best thing about the book is that it not only includes good information on global issues, it also includes many examples of people making a difference and developing solutions to problems around the world. The units are well written and accomplish the difficult task of making complex issues accessible, without watering down their significance.

A GREAT MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware: this movie will make you want to watch more crappy movies.","review":"If you enjoy b movies and monsters that look like poop, this one's for you. It has a solid cast, and a comedic subtlety that you just don't find in other movies. The monster is one of the slowest moving monsters in cinema history, but everyone insists that it's going to kill all of mankind. There are many scenes that will leave you with a smile and a deep appreciation for the effort it took to create this piece of crap. The xylophone scene is classic! If you're looking for gore look elsewhere, but if you like cheesy 80's monster movies, you won't be disappointed. If you mix a case of beer, a few friends, and Hard Rock Zombies, you have the recipe for one mighty glorious evening. 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Col. Sanders when you need him?","review":"Yet another homage to 50s sf/horror flicks. The movie predictably opens with a woman being eaten by the monster of the title (Kevin Peter Hall). No prizes for guessing where it's hiding. Being a PG movie there is no blood, just clothes being thrown out of the door. Strange considering this is a Troma production. But soon the monster, which resembles a man-sized chicken wing breaks out of the closet and as in all B movies wrecks havoc on the townspeople. Soon a biological technician and a small town obituary columnist(?!) are assigned to investigate the strange diappearance while the police, army and every man and his dog are called in to eradicate the chicken. This isn't one of Troma's best, or one of their \\"Best Worst\\" but you get to see Stella Stevens in the shower, so that's god enough for me to rate this 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie","review":"condition excellent but I overlooked the fact that its a troma film.....disappointed by this fact just looking for a more wholesome throwback scary movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is a copy of a VHS tape","review":"I enjoyed the movie, though it is cheesy. (You can read the other reviews for the movie plot details.) But I gave this a 1 star because the DVD is a copy of the VHS Tape. Even the FBI warning at the start says illegal to copy this \\"TAPE\\". The quality is not good, but still watchable. In addition, they put R rated material on a PG rated movie. And that material starts before you even get to the disc menu, plus the bonus material also has R rated material.

Small handles or a simple indentation and you are taking a risk. The silicone is grippy, things won't necessarily slip unless they are very heavy, but since it doesn't conform well around the side of the pan, you are risking a burn (like the one I just received on the back of my hand). I'm shopping for oven mitts or big potholders, and just had to warn people. I've burned myself three of the four times I've used these last.

The storyline follows separate women and their unlucky and often painful pursuits of men who are either married or emotionally stunted. The Bean-centric story, which finds a particularly repugnant woman named Rose (Theresa Russell, Wild Things) stupidly falling for him (Paul) even though she knows he has a wife. She then proceeds to get vindictive, when he opts to end their affair and stick with his spouse, who happens to be pregnant. Paul comes off looking like a flaccid doormat and Rose, who sets off on a campaign to publicly humiliate him with nude photos, turns into a detestable she-demon. Frankly, I could care less if either of these tools find happiness.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor directing makes for bad acting!","review":"Unfortunately Mr. Hayman has taken a clever script and a handful of talented actors and combined them with chopping editing, unfeeling direction and a handful of bad actors.

It's a refreshing read inspired by Turow's participation in the post-moratorium, Illinois death penalty commission. Turow lays out an analysis of some very important considerations. While he never really takes a position, he examines the issues from all angles, from a very good discussion of victim rights to a very good discussion of alternate incapacitation of criminals. He candidly admits that this is a book based on his experiences and not necessarily on scholarly study. Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the topic, with the caveat that you don't limit your reading on the topic to this book.As far as Turow goes, I'm not even a big fan of his non-fiction work.Happy Reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"History of a Birgade","review":"Excellent product.

Yet she attempts to give it an 'anyone/anytime' feeling (the ability for me a the reader to place the story chronologically was very difficult) which only distorts from both the 1985ish story she is telling and trying to \\"place\\" this novel in a contemporary time.Frustating, from start to finish. This is a woman who made her name writing about her generation, with all the gifts and burdens that come with it. Perhaps she was simply trying to do to much for too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreams of a marketing machine","review":"One thing you can say for Jayne Anne Phillips--she knows the topic that is selling at the moment. Publishers love her, and no wonder: When Raymond Carver-esque short stories were the hot ticket, we got Black Tickets. When Vietnam was the fictional selling point, we got Machine Dreams. Now that the Boomers are burying their parents and producing babies, we get Motherkind. Don't waste your time or money on this bland, but oh-so-topical, autobiography masquerading as novel. This writer hit her stride in the 1970s; thirty years later, she's plodding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"I can't believe I spent $13 on this book. It reads like the rough draft of a novel--not an actual novel. It's banal. The heroine is nursing her baby and her breasts are sore! Wow! What an insight! Phillips' brain must have been on auto-pilot when she wrote this. It got decent reviews in the media when it came out in hardcover. Why??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am furious that I wasted my time reading this book. The characters are vague, impossible to envision, and prone to terribly boring dialogue. The plot has almost no forward movement. Phillips seems to expect that the symmetry of her extended birth/death metaphor will carry the novel, but it doesn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I'm officially done with Jayne Anne Phillips. Having read Lark and Termite and now MotherKind I know for certain that she is definitely not my type. I found the novel extremely boring. You all enjoy if you want, maybe this book is for you, but you'll have to judge yourselves. It is definitely not my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Anytime a Jayne Anne Phillips book comes out, the temptation is to compare it to her great story collections Black Tickets and Fast Lanes. But Motherkind fails on its own terms, with bland characters and even blander, flabbier scene setting. It's hard to care about a narrator so self-obsessed. Just as a friend's pregnancy is more interesting to her, the narrator seems to think we'll be fascinated by her endless litany of childbearing/childrearing, most of which is old hat. An earlier Phillips would have undercut this sentimentality with vicious irony (without lessening the characters), but here she piles on even more. Her last novel Shelter was overdone too. Maybe it's time to pare down and go back to short fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"did I actually read it all?","review":"This book seemed like a glimpse of someone's hectic everyday life. I am amazed I finished it. I enjoyed the author's writing style (some great imagery and thought connections) but the story never amounted to anything. The characters seemed like aquaintences-I knew some details of their lives but I never really cared about them or about getting to know them. The relationships of the main character (her name escapes me) were of interest at first, but again never amount to much. Her relationships with women were strong, her relationship with her husband, disconcerting. The book felt like it was building to something but it never peaked. Can I assume this is the author's comment on life?If I were to turn back time, I wouldn't read this book but would pick up another by this author. I will consider reading other work of hers in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective on/off switch","review":"I did get this coffee maker to work twice, but it was difficult to get it to turn on. I read the manual and then called a Black & Decker rep to make sure I was operating it correctly. She concluded that my unit was defective.Even without this defect, it has it's shortcomings. The pieces were a bit difficult to snap together/pull apart when making coffee, therefore making it easy to spill the grounds during cleanup.The coffee was nice and hot, slightly more full-bodied than drip coffee, and not at all bitter, but not quite robust enough for me. I think this is due to the short brew time that the water stays up top with the coffee grounds. I like it to be about 4 minutes to fully extract the flavor, but this one only brews for a minute or two when making about 6 cups. I sent it back and got a Bodum Columbia french press, which I highly recommend if like robust European style coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum brew and some shortcomings","review":"Not the prettiest coffee maker in the world, but my wife seems to enjoy the coffee's flavor.My two gripes:In order to get to the desired coffee strength, I have had to increase the amount of coffee, as compared with the old coffee maker.Also want to add that this thing is a pain to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"This odd looking thing makes really good coffee","review":"Like some of others have said, I have no idea how some think this makes weak coffee. If you use one full scoop (which they provide the scooper)of coffee, it is perfect (maybe a little strong). When I first saw it, it was not impressed with its looks or the idea of having its ugly self on my kitchen counter. But after learning how to use it and clean it(which is a breeze), I got over its looks really fast. The coffee is great tasting, smooth and hot. You taste the coffee flavor and nothing else. I hope they do not stop making them. I'd buy another if this one breaks. It seems pretty well put together, unlike the Home Cafe I had prior to this machine. HOME CAFE, say away. It started falling apart the next day after I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot.","review":"I had high hopes for this coffee maker. The coffee is flavorful and smooth but way too hot. I only have one mug (about 2 cups) every morning and I thought the warmer plate was overheating the coffee. But when I doubled the amount the coffee was still WAY TOO HOT. (I think the brewer heats the coffee to almost boiling.) I have to put a spoon in my mug for five minutes before I can drink it.I am going to see if Amazon can refund my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Palstic Board","review":"A bamboo Cutting board is the best IMO. Better on your cutlery etc. But there are advantages to a plastic baord. Dishwasher friendly is the #1 reason. Also no worries on stains or permiable bacteria/odors.For an inexpensive Plastic cutting baord this gives you plenty of good work area and the molded feet are better then the stick-on type on most glass boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing.....","review":"One of the best releases of the past year. N'Dambi continues the vibe from the first disc \\"Little Girl Lost Blues\\" (if you don't have it stop here and click, click, click your way through Amazon to get it NOW) and brings it up a notch with the live instrumentation of her band and co-producers Camp Wisdom. Tight arrangements, alot of jazz this time around, and a little hip-hop vibe with the club-type banger \\"Black Star\\" Overall a great buy. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Taken Advantage Of, and Tricked!","review":"N'Dambi was wrong for several reasons, one for even putting this crap out there for the consumer to purchase. This is a retelling of her last CD and to be honest, she told it better the first time. N'Dambi tries too hard at times to be innovative and it hurts her. she over emotes and has a hard time staying in key. One reviewer referred to her imperfections as a passionate delivery. I beg to differ, as there are a lot of people who are passionate at Karaoke and still sound horrible because they can not sing. Do something I didnt do, and save your cash. I sold my copy as fast as I could and didnt even bother to burn a copy of it before getting rid of it. It is THAT BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She Has No Concept of Pitch!","review":"This is my second attempt at a review of this CD. I guess my first one was to honest to post, so I will try this again. I was a fan of N'Dambi's debut CD, and rushed out to get this one. After one listen I was extremely sorry I wasted the cash and effort. She has some SEVERE pitch problems going on, on this disc. She takes a note and starts to bend it into something that ends up being FLAT. She has a haunting voice that would be great if she could keep it in TUNE. The backing band is great and the concept was a good one, it's just that the material is not all that, and her pitch problems derail the project. If you want some quality musicianship,try to get your hands on the Sandra St Victor Disc, Gemini:Both Sides, its available through amazon.com, and will be worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DDDDAM!!!!!","review":"These two DOUBLE cd's are layback & chill. The 1st cd is laced with some newer tracks & the 2nd are cuts from her 1st Lp but with a slight twist. It's boldness of a live performance but without the crowd. I LIKE THE TWIST & the effort of coming-up with a live remix cd and hearing small clips of the band in rehearsal. N'dambi has the voice of a jazz vocalist that easily puts you in the mind of Ledisi. N'dambi has deep Texas roots and has definitly been influenced by Erykah Badu. This cd has been out for some time but its worth buying I cant wait until the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some sellers are sending a single pack, advertised as 5 pack","review":"Beware that some sellers with an unbelievably low price are sending you a single book. Learning Resources/The manufacturer markets toward educators, so the product is really a 5 pk and for Amazon's price is a good value. I recommend you contact Marketplace sellers directly to confirm how many you will receive.I recommend this book! It is durable (you need your own pen), and easy for young ones to manipulate. Buy the 5 pack because they make great, inexpensive and educational birthday gifts for your child's 4yr old classmates. Like a previous poster commented, it is great to keep child occupied when out and about. I like to play the matching game where the child finds letters in the enviroment (like modified travel bingo or a scavenger hunt) then traces the letter in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I had bad breath and I was suspecting my sinuses so I even had a sinus surgery and the bad breath did not go away.

In fact, though it kind of smells like bleach, I didn't think it really had any taste. My issue was that it simply didn't work. I got through the first two bottles (about a months worth) before I decided to give up. I didn't get any results for my breath and I also noticed that this stuff tore up the inside of my mouth. Sometimes I'd spit out what looked like pieces of flesh from inside my mouth or blood. My mouth felt clean, but no cleaner than normal mouthwash makes me feel.

In addition, Small Appliance refused to offer any help, and told me I needed to have returned it within 7 days. I never realized I had to test out my filter so quickly in case it stank! That's not something you're supposed to have to worry about with an air filter.

No receipt, no UPC code on the box and no proof of purchase. Therefore, no box. Fox refuses to send me a box, not even if I offer to pay for it as well as the shipping and handling. If I want the Box, I'll Have to purchase another set and use the information from that. Also, this offer only applies to the sixth season.

My favourite here is the first episode, \\"Bart of Darkness\\". Ned screaming like a girl is just classic! A lot of these episodes, I've already seen them on television before, so it's great to watch them whenever I want, commercial-free. Plus, the menu navigation is fast and easy. I think it's my favourite menu because it features characters on it from each episode included on the disc! And the packaging is the best ever.

The case is made of cheap, *cheap* plastic, hinged at the bottom in a clamshell design, and held together with nothing more than tape, which means that shoplifting of the DVDs is going to be a major concern with retailers. The head is covered in a plastic slipcase that mimics the previous seasons' design on the side. The slipcase doesn't fit very well, and doesn't improve the look of the case at all.There is NO second box inside. However-- here's the good news. There is a card inside the box with a phone number you can call to get a regular box for the discs-- this is probably where the \\"Green box\\" pictures have come from. The clamshell won't last very long-- the plastic isn't sturdy enough-- so I suspect many, *many* people will be taking advantage of this offer sooner or later.Worst. Packaging. Ever.

But this plastic Homer head that falls apart once you touch it was a bad idea. And calling people anal retentive just because they want something sturdy that will protect their DVDs is really out of line.Hey you Fox marketing \\"geniuses\\"... If you had limited this silly head design to a special collector's version and released the regular boxes to the masses in the first place, you could have saved yourselves (and us consumers - who pay your salaries, by the way) a lot of time, money and aggrivation.

I was planning on buying the first 8 seasons but 5 will now be sufficient. 5 stars for the show but DVDs are priced to be an exclusive item to be displayed-not something to achieve with this set. As the cover influenced me not to buy this set a 1 is deserved.

After \\"Cape Feare\\", I had high hopes for the fourth Sideshow Bob episode, but the only good bit was when Bart and Lisa tried to show that the other Mayor Elect was better and Bart got taken away by Bob's guard people.

But that was before the realease of this set. So they may make 7-10 different material, or not even use the simpsons and go back to the box sets, we wont know until that comes around. Anyways, this is probably the best Simpsons season so far, with great episodes with great laughs. If you are a hardcore simpsons fan, or not, buy this DVD. The packaging is crappy, but the DVDs are great. At least fox changed the boring ol' colored boxes.. and for all you babies who have to HAVE the old boxes, there's a number in there you can call and you will get an older box.

Inside the pack is an insulting little card with instructions to call a phone number where you are further insulted and sent to a web-site where you are again insulted as you follow instructions to order a different package, for which you pay a handling charge, the final insult.It took me two weeks to get over the negative vibe from the packaging to finally pop in the discs and start watching, and, well, the laughs are few and far between.I've made a huge mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark","review":"Be aware, if you don't like the box of \\"Homer's Head\\" You can actually order the box, just like the other five seasons prior to the sixth season.

A DVD should not have to be \\"unfurled\\" on one's coffee table or bedspread: it just ain't right. Is a repackaging double-dip in the works?

I was so excited, as I was each time a new season came out, about this one. But there is a drop-off in quality that is so sharp it really caught me off guard! These, almost every episode, are just as bad as the new ones. Just a lot of over-extended jokes (that weren't very funny to begin with) and pratfalls...Bart becomes a pure caricature instead of slightly caricature-ish but a genuine child at his essence. I can't really explain much further than that...maybe they lost a couple of key writers? Because these episodes are so different from season 5 and before that it's uncanny...and supremely disappointing.I strongly suggest trying to see some of the episodes elsewhere first, before buying.

Anyways, back to the point, I got the DVD just because of this episode. But, my wife was reviewing the other episodes, and it also has other really, really good episodes.

When they talk you still here them clearly cussing. This helps because you do not hear the \\"beep\\" on any cuss word at any time on the show [for what I've noticed]. The bad thing is, the PICTURE is not. For some reason, the DVD producers were just too lazy to fully write the cuss word on the subtitles and too lazy to uncover the blurred out nipples and thongs.

Easy cleaning - after cooking I just put water in the wok, rub it out with sink brush and towel dry and rub with cook oil. Then hang until next use.I read online that you can use coarse salt & cook oil to help rub off the manufacturer seal coating the first time you clean your wok.

The movie was obviously shot over a long period of time and on a small budget, and sort of stitched together. Characters come out of nowhere and they never really get fleshed out. The plot jumps around, and every cliché in the book was trotted out.Worst of all, the director cast himself in the lead, and he's not a very convincing actor.

He directs like a cut-rate Guy Ritchie and acts like a poor man's Ben Affleck, which pretty much makes him broke. He is mugging the whole time. The film also filled with unrealistic characters that the audience doesn't care about who spurt wooden, forced dialogue.

Of course there is always the \\"Color of Money\\" and the unbeatable \\"The Hustler\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby.","review":"While this film is a tad predictible, it's still a lot of fun. The trick shots are a blast to watch, the soundtrack is awesome and there are a few laughs and surprises.Honestly, though, how can you go wrong with a movie starring Christopher Walken, Chazz Palminteri and Michael Rosenbaum? All three give stellar performances, and are completely entertaining, especially Rosenbaum (all bad lip-syncing aside)."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"The product was advertised as new/unopened. Upon receiving and opening the packaging for the DVD, I noticed that it had been re-packaged. The DVD was not in its original wrapping with appropriate labels and had obviously been opened. I inspected the DVD and noticed marks on the delicate side of the disc, which looked like something had been spilled on it at one time. The DVD appears to work with no problem (which is the only reason I have not returned the product), however I am not happy with the deception used regarding the state of use of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to \\"The Hustler\\" or \\"Color of Money\\"","review":"Sorry but I can not comprehend people rating this on par with Color of Money or the Hustler.

It is a great movie--plot kinda lame, but full of clever one-liners and great billiard action! Christopher Walken is great in this movie. The primary star is also the writer and I believe he directed. There are a couple other big stars in this 'B' movie, such as Michael Rosenbaum-from Smallville, Chazz Palmenteri, Rick Schroeder, and Alison Eastwood- Clint Eastwood's daughter.

After watching the first two hours, we gave up simply because we couldn't undersand much of the dialog.

With a light coat of shaving cream, I get the equivalent of a shave with a blade. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin so shaving has never been one of my favorite pastimes. The Panasonic ES7017S now makes this ritual tolerable and even pleasureable. My only complaint is that the off/on switch is awkward, and, with wet hands, nearly impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great, for about 3 months","review":"When I first got this razor I thought it was the greatest thing ever. It's completly waterproof, so cleaning it is simple, you just run it under the water and add soap. It also gave me a really close shave, which was what I was looking for.Unfortunatly the razor refuses to charge, and I'm not sure why. Because the razor cannot be pluged directly into the wall, it is completly useless. Hopefully I just got a bad one, and everyone else's works fine, because this was a very nice razor, when it worked. I would however not recomend buying a razor that cannot plug into the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've gone through FOUR in only eight months!!!","review":"This is a very good shaver - except that it suddenly stops working, even when I follow the owner's manual religiously. I bought my first one last fall, and after about 3 months, it stopped taking a charge. The replacement lasted about 2 months before the same thing happened. Now my current replacement shaver (#3) just quit on me with no notice, so I'll have to call Panasonic again to get my FOURTH shaver in about 8 months. If this happened once, maybe twice, I'd chalk it up to bad luck. But FOUR defective shavers? ...so I figure this has a design flaw or poor quality control. By the way, my previous older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver worked just fine for over 2 years... DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Includes amazing warranty expiration detector","review":"I like to shave in the shower, and Panasonic's wet/dry shavers seem to be the only available choice. They do work great . . . until they fail spontaneously. They have the most amazing warranty expiration detectors. Every Panasonic shaver that I owned managed to fail within 3 months after the warranty expired.There are two varieties. The cheaper shavers have a clip-on charger. On those, the clip will break. The more expensive ones use an induction system. Those will simply fail to charge after the warranty expires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shaver especially for the price","review":"I was looking for a shaver that had as many of the features as possible for under $50 for Father's day. My wife had already purchased a Norelco for me, when this shaver popped up in my Gold Box ... You have to get used to it, especially if you shave with a razor like I did, but I'm really liking it.

I investigated the problem and tried positioning it differently, screwing the top on more or less, and it still leaked.

What a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working!","review":"This coffeemaker worked like a dream for about a month. Then suddenly it starting steaming like crazy every time water was put in, and the steam got so intense it took the words \\"Black and Decker thermal Select\\" right off the front compartment that houses the filter. It's as though the water was being boiled and turned into steam before it ever got a chance to drip down through the grounds and into the carafe. Out of 8 cups of water put into the water chamber, about a teaspoonful of water dripped down into the filter. It was all boiled away by the machine.

However, after a few weeks, I could hear swishing that meant liquid had leaked from the glass lining inside of the carafe into the space between the glass and the plastic shell. No way to get it out. Soon after that, liquid started leaking out of the bottom of the carafe. Also, I found the lid very hard to keep clean. Coffee would get inside the lid and the only way I could get it out was to shake the lid - hard - repeatedly - to get the coffee to come out from the tiny holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubber taste","review":"We have followed all the manufacturer's instructions and there is a distinct rubber flavor to the brewed coffee.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe is Faulty","review":"Water somehow accumulates between the outside metallic cover of the carafe and the inner glass liner.

I did have a couple \\"over flow\\" situations, but soon realized that I was screwing the lid on too far. I also realized that the basket & lid needed to be removed and cleaned at least once a week to avoid any potential mold situations. But this should probably be done with any coffee maker. I did end up having to replace the maker after about a year, when it completely stopped working. I soon found out that my husband was trying to be helpful & submerged the entire unit under water in an effort to clean it! I did end up purchasing the same one again, and that was about 1 1/2 years ago. I have had no problems with it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee doesn't stay hot","review":"We may have received a defective unit. But the coffee comes out barely above luke warm, then within a couple of hours becomes cold in the carafe. It is also easy to not place the carafe firmly into the station. In that case the coffee goes everywhere but the carafe. We had an old Black and Decker carafe coffee maker for around 12 years that worked like a dream, coffee came out piping hot and stayed that way. That is why we bought the same make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes nice cup of joe, but lousy carafe design","review":"Yes, this model Black & Decker makes good coffee, and it keeps it hot for a while on the table, but... We got the product cheap because it's discontinued. We found, as other reviewers have said, it's all too easy to have an overflow issue--you need to be super careful about placing the carafe precisely on its seat. Plus a little coffee leaks into the space between the glass bottle and the vinyl casing. Then eventually it leaks out the bottom of the casing. It looks like you could remove the bottom cover (big slot in the middle), but I tried and couldn't budge it (there's a warning not to do that!). We're holding on to this thing until we get our money's worth, but will think twice before buying B&D again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like cold coffee. Do you?","review":"We purchased this coffee maker, hoping that we would actually be able to have a hot cup of coffee. Unfortunately, it doesn't ever make the coffee hot. Even when we tried using hot water, we still get a lukewarm product. We never got totrying the clock or programming features because it just didn't last long enough to bother with that.

It leaks out the seam at the bottom\\". Would like to caution people in hanlding the carafe. We broke one liner stirring in cream (to take the unit with prepared cofee). We broke another putting ice into cold coffee.To buy a carafe, if you call the 800 number on the box, they refer you to another 800 number, .... They will ask for the model number, as their are several. We had to look for TCM508 in very tiny print under the \\"electrical caution\\" notice on the bottom of the coffee maker. There seems to be some room for negotiation.I don't know why they don't sell the carafes in the stores that sell the coffee makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the mop, you're going to make coffee...","review":"What ever happened to Black and Decker?

Because it only holds 6 cups instead of the 8 as advertised. Don't believe me? Simply measure it yourself. There is a slot in the back of the device that prevents no more than 6 cups. Once filled, the afixed measuring device on the left side reads 8 cups. Pretty sneaky, huh? Incidentally the carafe only hold 6 cups as well. SHAME ON YOU, Black & Decker !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee shouldn't be this much trouble","review":"I love the handy features on this coffee maker (programmable timer and thermal carafe), but this machine's been a problem ever since my thoughtful husband gave it to me as a birthday gift a year-and-a-half ago. The coffee wasn't great from the start, but I decided to keep the thing because I didn't want to hurt my hubbie's feelings. Soon after purchase, the carafe began leaking and has never stopped. I always have to pour the coffee over the sink so as not to make a mess on the counter, and there's constantly a puddle underneath the carafe in the machine. Now, I'm finally getting around to looking for a replacement carafe and can't find one. After reading all the other negative reviews here (the moldy lid problem really disgusts me), I think I'll invest in a newer, better maker altogether. I hope my husband understands! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imploding Carafes","review":"These carafes are crap!

Even with an opening as large as possible, the stuff doesn't exit the tube. After about five minutes of some really serious squeezing, I managed to get maybe a quarter teaspoon out of the tube.

Only when I stood on the bottle with my foot was I able to get anything out of the bottle. Which, of course, is not handy.Bottle or not, the filler is too translucent and gritty for my liking; I ended up going to Rockler and buying a much better filler.

You literally have to cut all of the tube off so the stuff will come out, you don't have a choice because if the hole is small which is the purpose of the cylindrical tube it comes out for a split second and stops every time. I've tried 4 tubes of this junk and when it dries and it does come out it's fine but the mess is so thick you have to cut the dispenser tube all the way off to where the hole is huge and cannot be used for small projects. it's worthless for small projects all around, only good for if you need to use the whole thing in one sitting through a giant hole.

It cannot start again after making the first batch of toast due to a poorly designed toast start button. I suspect the start button is an electronic control which you have to depress just right or it refuses to start on the first batch. After you make the first batch you have to wait until the stupid thing cools down again in order to get the start button to work. Electronic start buttons - which appear on all their new models are not designed properly - the heat temperature is set too low, so even when you cool the toaster down for five minutes the start button still thinks you're trying to restart the last batch. Also the dark toaster setting is the minimum you have to set it at to get barely brown toast. Stay away from Black & Decker since their toasters share the same start button design/temperature toast control."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of [junk]","review":"The only thing worse than a toaster oven that breaks after 3 months is a toaster oven that breaks the day after exchanging for a new one.

It is easy to keep clean and still looks great(no fading or yellowing, which is easily possible with a device that heats up regularly).The top surface didn't get hot, so it made a good temporary shelf for random kitchen things.It heats up fast, had an accurate and loud timer, and allowed for very light to very dark toasting. Worked great to reheat pizza and for making frozen foods.The crumb tray is easy to remove an clean.Only downside is that as a bread toaster it would likely lose a race against a conventional 2 slice toaster...but that is more due to volume being heated.

Thisbook is fine for the school nurse who is starting a clinic literallyfrom the ground up. It even has floor plans for school clinics. The assumption is that the schools have unlimited funds, large space and unlimited time to provide healthcare, and the focus is very administrative. Treatment of everyday shcool nursing issues is very cursory. The extensive treatment of sexual-orientation issues renders the book very suspect--there is an agenda here. There are lots of reproducible forms which can be useful. However, the fact that this book was written by an MD should have been a red flag: Not for nurses who live in the real world and need practical advice.

I have previously used Norelco and Braun electric shavers with mixed results at best. This Panasonic handles the thickest of my beards. Granted it takes a while to get through the growth, but I truly appreciate the \\"Linear Motor\\" feature, which ensures that the razor does not slow down in direct relationship to the thickness of the beard. The speed is fast and it remains constant! As long as there is power left, which is conveniently displayed with LED lights, the shaver works its way through and I get a very close shave. Guess if I shaved more often, I would appreciate this product even more!

I installed the batteries in my digital camera (my camera takes 2 of the AA). I took 4 pictures and the battery low indicator came on. I tried the batteries in my friend's digital camera (different make and model), same thing, with any/all of the batteries. I tried charging the batteries again, and again. Same thing every time --- charging light comes on for less than 20 minutes, then goes off, and the fully charged light never comes on. The batteries do not get anywhere near a full charge, and the batteries get very, very hot while in the charger. It appears to be of questionable quality.

Put them in the camera, it won't power up. Remove them and replace them and it powers on fine. Check them with a battery tester, 3 of 4 check fine, one shows no charge. Check it again a few seconds later, and it shows a full charge.

The first time I used them, it took about 30 minutes to feel any heat at all, and it was just barely noticable. The second and third times I tried them, there was no heat at all (with new batteries). The weight of the batteries and the location of the battery pouches guarantees that the socks will not stay up, but will bang against your ankles or lower legs as you walk (or ski). Part of the poor heat problem, I think, is the poorly designed battery connectors which don't make good contact with the positive end of the battery.

However, if your intentions are like mine to design some hardware and transfer data from the device to the PC, I think your pretty much out of luck.I understand this is a very hard subject but the author does not include sample drivers that allow you to communicate with a generic part, let alone, helping you develop a driver for your application.I think this book is only good to get a sense only for what USB is and how it works. Unfortunately, blocks diagrams do not solve anyones problem, and knowledge-hungry individuals such as myself find these books rather useless. Buy the book only if you have no clue what USB is, else do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly complete, but good enough","review":"When it comes to developing USB hardware, there aren't many off-the-shelf-how-to books. This is the only one I am aware of. As a result, it wins by default.Axelson starts by covering the pros and cons of USB, and would be perfect for explaining to a non-technical manager. It covers the USB protocol, and even covers the Cypress USB development kit, which can be used to develop a USB peripheral.Simply stated, this book won't make you a USB genius, but if you are charged with developing a USB device from scratch, it can compress the time required to ramp up. It can save you hours of frustration.Unfortunately, reading this book won't make host (PC) programmers into USB geniuses, but it does explain USB reasonably well."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked the book,but not for beginners","review":"needs more pictures and figures for explaining,the book needs a better design and more on software, but in general i found it useful for my work(too many books i had in USB design and i used this book as a complement)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This edition is a little outdated, but gives a good basis to understand USB","review":"This book gives a good outline of USB and how to work with it.

I couldn't put the book down or stop reading it. Bockris proves with this biography that Keith Richards truly IS the ultimate rock n' roll icon through his inimitable, rhythmically driven style, attention to what makes music \\"swing\\" (something multiple modern artists have discarded) and an incredible presence that oozes off the pages. While Bockris backs his book up with the dialogues of those who knew Keef, these accounts often seem contradictory-- perhaps shedding some light on the paradox that is legend. Either way-- a must for all Richards apprentices, Rock afficinados and anyone who wants to learn a thing or two about how to feel their pulse more effectively..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"This is a lifesaver for me when I travel!

The construction is chintzy to say the least. I admit, I also choose it for the color. There are not too many blenders out there available in black.But, now I'm going to do my homework and shop for another blender.I'm really dissappointed with the B&D unit. The blade assembly binds up that results in requiring to dump the contains and start all over. Besides being an inconvenience, I've wasted a lot of food!The only thing I've used it for is to blend healthy shakes that consist of milk and some powder.My suggestion is pass on this one and spend a little more money and purchase a higher quality blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!","review":"I'm really not sure how this blender received such a high rating. As soon as I took it out of the box, I realized that the purchase was a mistake. Very low quality! The first time, and every time after that, it smelled as though wires were burning inside. Less than five months, with little usage, and it is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep on looking","review":"I've bought a few things from amazon and try to read the reviews to see what others think. But you always have those reviews that say 5 stars, best product I've ever had, and those that say 1 star, horrible product. So you really just have to go with a gut feeling. But I'm telling you now, if you're reading this, not to buy this blender. My wife was using it to make baby food, and after about a month of using it, the motor burned out. We returned it to amazon and got a full refund, but we still are out a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend this one","review":"Blender leaked and also noted the burning smell others reported. Not heavy usage, mostly pureeing soups and drinks. Discovered base ring is cracked. Emailed for replacement, no reply.

I make a protein shake with ice every weekday morning for breakfast, and after only 6 months, the upper blade fell off and the motor seized and started to smoke. I see I am not the only one to have the motor fail this way. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender Lasted Less Than 24 Hrs","review":"I spent quite a bit of time researching blenders and the Black & Decker BL600B seemed to be one of the better ones despite the mixed reviews.I bought the blender on a Friday night used it to make a mango lassi (smoothie). It worked pretty good for that.The next day came the real test. I tried to make some beet hummus (cooked beetroot, cooked chickpeas, yogurt, tahini, lime juice, vegetable stock and olive oil). I loaded all the ingredients, with the soft beets first. After turning the machine on, the ingrediants didn't mix well, I tried the various speed and the motor started to slow, and after about 1 minute, started to smoke. So, I burned it out rather quickly.Maybe a blender cannot handle making hummus. Most recipes say use a blender or food processor.Anyway, I took the machine back and I am now looking for a better blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender Blades Bind","review":"I bought this blender in September and it worked great until December. Mixing only milk and powder the black disk on the bottom bound to the gray blade disk and the kitchen counter was covered with small plastic pieces. I called customer service and they first said that this was a wear item and not covered by warranty and to send them $17. I insisted that there should not be a failure due to wear and tear after only three months. They agreed to send out a replacement blade for free. There is something major wrong with this design that should be corrected.I would not get this again. Hope the blade comes soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a piece of Junk","review":"The first time we bought it, the motor stopped working after a week. We exchanged it. After three months, the plastic blade assembly starting falling apart.

My osterizer is not broken and I just bought this because of the good price and also I wanted something to match my other appliances in kitchen. I thought, I can forget buying a blender for atleast 5 years. Oh god, may be the quality of blenders is going down or something, this one stopped working with a burning smell in less than 6 months. I don't recommend this one to anyone who is expecting durability out of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!! Run away from this one","review":"I bought this as a result of lots of good reviews. When I got the blender, I thought it was broken because it didn't change speeds (as determined by the noise not changing pitch), regardless of which button was pushed. I called service, sent them the old power cord, and they were quick to send a replacement. When I got the replacement, IT STILL ONLY HAD ONE SPEED. OK, I put up with that. But, after only several months of light use, the motor burned out. I spliced the new cord to the original unit, and now that one is burning out too. This thing has always been NOISY to the point of being painful on the ears; All conversation stops while the blender is running. One bad unit may have been a fluke, but two in a row??? I really like to save money where I can, and hate to toss stuff in the trash, but I wasted good money on this one, and am sending it straight to the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out","review":"Got this product in September 2004 - used it occasionally about once a week - guess what, in a month, the motor burned out.This has never happened with any blender I have owned before.Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get one","review":"Hi,I recieved one of these blenders as a gift. When I got it the off button would not work, I would have to guess how well blended the contents of the blender were and unplug it manually.

So I now have no blender and have not heard anything for over 3 months.

We've returned it and will be purchasing a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"It has a lighted timer that supposedly shows when the waffle is done. Apparently at Black and Decker, \\"done\\" means blackened. It cooks the waffles way too dark.

Cooked some good waffles once, cleaned it, put it away. When I went to get it out for a second time, this evening, the hinge broke. Pieces literally fell out on the counter. We still used it as I had the batter made and, actually, the waffles turned out fine.

If you like spending your time picking waffle batter out of crevices with a toothpick then this is the waffle maker for you. You also have to remove the waffle before the light goes out or it will be overdone. I judge when I should open the lid by the amount of steam coming out but should I have to?

I will return this item and go purchase a commercial grade waffle maker. Quality costs. That is why this Black & Decker is so cheap. It has no quallity. The hinges were out of stock and on back order when I talked to Black & Decker about them. I wasted about a half hour on the phone waiting for Black & Decker to answer the phone.

We like our crispy and to the browns side and we've figured to take out our waffles after the steam is gone (after the light has gone off).We've used the Albertson brand pancake and waffle mix and it works great. Just follow the directions and measurements and you won't over fill the platter (we used 2/3 cup for each make and it comes out perfect).Clean up is a breeze as long as you've followed the instructions in the manual and have put a layer of pam or oil on both surfaces (we use fat free pam and it lasts us several batches).Happy waffling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died fast","review":"Made about 10 waffles decently, then something in the electrics died and it refuses to heat up any more.

It made very tasty waffles twice, in fact! Then the hinges cracked and fell off, rendering it unusable.We weren't throwing it around, mind you. Not playing catch with it or even trying to see who could smash more batter into it. Just trying to make plain old waffles, as we've done with other waffle makers dozens of times before, and since.And yet, it broke. Not just a little broke, either. So broke that we couldn't use it anymore. So broke that even MacGyver couldn't have used it.So, yes, it makes waffles. It makes very good waffles. Twice. Then it's done, and for the landfill.

The light comes on when the waffle is cooked to the machine's satisfaction. Lifting the waffles out of the appliance is a skill I have not yet mastered, and the waffle breaks into four distinct wedges due to the deep crease dividing the plates.

My husband always warns me about getting what you pay for. He was right. This waffle maker is a lightweight. Takes almost 5 minutes to make a waffle that isn't soggy and even then the outside is dark and the inside is still doughy. Depends on how you like your waffles of course.

We thought it would be easier to store in our cabinet. First of all, it has no temperature adjustment or timer. It has a light that goes on and off which is meaningless. You have to watch the steam to tell when it is done, which is generally inconsistant. It is supposed to make Belgian Waffles but in fact the waffles are thin and like standard waffles. The clean up is difficult. There are areas where the batter collects when it oozes out that are next to impossible to clean out. You have to try to work it out with a toothpic which takes forever. Lastly, the hinge broke. I found other reviews that mention the hinge problem as well. I was rather glad that it broke so I had a reason to toss this piece of junk in the trash.

I used it once after putting in the new and glued one...THE NEW ONE BROKE!... It had not been moved! Knowing the fragileness of the hinges I babied it. I only went to move it so I could put it away and the new hinge popped out in two pieces.

I was satisfied with its performance after about 50 uses. I would have given it a 5 star review on this basis. Unfortunately the hinge that holds the top to the bottom of the unit broke. This occurred with careful handling and no abuse on my part. The hinge is a hollow piece of split plastic that is very cheaply made. A solid hinge would probably have been less expensive to fabricate and would have lasted a long time. I would not recommend this unit. Luckily a simple wire nut was nearly the same diameter and it is now my new hinge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinges will break - piece of trash","review":"I hesitate to give this product even one star.

They missed many good opportunities that could have been explored, like they could have done so much with the fallout shelter they found, and the concept of what would happen to the survivors and the dynamic of how to reestablish a society in a case like this was an interesting thought, but they rushed through things that could have made the story more believable and interesting, instead going for shock and gore over a good plot.

You will probably notice the flaws, lots of them, but with that attitude you won't care much. I'd bet they are there on purpose. Some quite disgusting scenes are there too if you have a good stomach (pay attention to my advice and don't eat anything before).

Not an original premise, but a good enough premise to build a decent movie around. After that, the movie steadily gets worse and worse. It reminds me of a sloping line graph how steadily the movie gets worse at it goes on because each scene is weaker than the one before it. It gets progressively more terrible until finally culminating in one of the most awful chase scenes I've ever seen.That climatic chase scene is just atrocious. Part of it is a car chase scene where you just want to tell the director that if he isn't going to take it seriously, he should do something else to end the movie.

There are no memorable characters nor are there any exceptionally cool scenes, which are the two main characteristics that draw me to these types of films. The action sequences are only so-so, and the concept of knights versus punks was poorly executed.

Whoever licensed their car to this movie should have to explain to it's shareholders why their insanely good looking sports car can't outrun broken down post-apocalyptic rust bucket trucks and buses at speeds approaching an apparent 40 MPH!!!

Nonetheless, first time out of the box we had faultless waffles (Krusteaz Blueberry mix), and it was a kick serving them for breakfast. I hope this one lasts as long as the others did.

While mixing my ingredients, I preheated my grill for about 5 minutes with the setting about 3/4 of the way on the waffle setting. Then I sprayed with cooking spray. I poured my batter and in about 6 minutes my waffles were done.

I frequently suffered minor burns on the griddle when lifting it to remove my waffles as it's incredibly difficult to open it without touching the grill itself. If your batter is even slightly sticky, it becomes even more dangerous provided you can get it open at all. Often, the grill itself would come off its two flimsy hinges and present a whole new problem. On top of it all when it would work, it would take several minutes for a waffle to cook.Compared with the replacement waffler that we just purchased, I have a full understanding of how extraordinarily poor this waffler is and hope that no one has to endure what we did with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't build them like they used to","review":"Bought this to replace the old one I had that all it needed was new grill plates that I could not find, so I had to buy the whole unit. It is a little lighter than the old one and the metal seems a bit thinner, But what disappointed me was that it did not cook evenly. When the front was nice and crisp the back was still not done so I would have to flip my waffle around to finish cooking. I kept it for the fact that I like the setup of the unit, but the performance needs some work. I think I'm going to take the heating unit out of the old one and put it in this one and see how that works. Its sad that corporations have traded quality for profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven heating","review":"The waffle maker takes a long time to heat up and does not heat evenly all across the grill. The waffles in the front half of the grill will be brown and crispy while the waffle in the rear half will be nearly white and soft.I just bought a Bella waffle maker and am surprised at not only how fast the waffle cooks, but how evenly too. This is the type of waffle maker that you flip over once you pour in the batter.I suggest buying one of these types instead of one like the Black and Decker that I won't use any more"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could be as positive as the other reviewers...","review":"unfortunately, I cant. My experience with this waffle maker was not so great. No matter what I tried to use to prevent sticking the waffles stuck to the waffle maker. It was worse if we added anything like strawberries to the mix. Additionally, when they would stick, the top of the waffle would separate from the bottom. It would be so stuck that I had to use a lot of force to open up the waffle maker and in doing so found my hand directly in the path of the steam coming out. Plus, 2 times the top plate came out of its hinges and almost fell on my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy","review":"The waffle iron plates did not fit properly in the waffle iron, kept popping out while cooking, and those releasing the heat.

The Cuisnart waffle maker that I bought at Macy's was more expensive ($50) but had the quality of a waffle maker that would last alot longer. I buy on cost not price alone. Cost is what will it cost me long run will I have to replace it in a short period of time and cost is what does it sell for up front with no thought about weather it will fall apart or not.

It works fine for the waffles and I like the waffle timer. But you can forget the sandwiches. This product needs an adjustment made to the spring or either the sandwiches grids made deeper. My daughter used it first for grilled cheese sandwiches. Dissaster. The top of the grill is too heavy. The cheese melted all over the grids and the sandwiches were as flat as a pancake. I thought it was her that did something wrong. So I tried it; same thing, cheese melted all over the grids and bread flatter than pancakes. B&D has some good products; but, I don't know what happened here. I hope they can fix this problem. I would like to have a good old fashioned grilled cheese sandwich like my mother use to make. She had a good waffle and sandwich maker. Of course that was 50 years ago and I forget the manufacturer. I did return this with no problem. I hope B&D can rectify the problem. Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent waffle iron","review":"we had one like this before and over time the plates did get burnt oil/carbon caked on -- particularly by spraying vegetable oil on a hot grill. We are now brushing vegetable oil on before the first round of waffles. We are happy to have the same type of waffles again.

It worked great for a short while, then I noticed that one side of the griddle was not heating as fast as the other producing uneven pancakes and waffles! Now it's unusable all around. The waffles are sticking and burning no matter how much I season the plates and I can make 3 times as many pancakes on one side of the griddle as on the other because of the uneven heat! I'd like to say I'll buy another in hopes that I just got a bad appliance, but I'm not sure I want to risk throwing away the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remember","review":"It looks like the waffle maker that my mom used for all those wonderful breakfasts growing up.

I've tried several different waffle recipes, including good ole mom's and each time the waffles are flat as pancakes and soft. I've given up trying to cook pancakes, even with the heat turned up full blast, they never brown.I've always been a fan of this type of waffle maker, but based on my experiences, I'll be looking for a Belgium waffle maker and stick with my stovetop griddle for pancakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST","review":"Great product!

We wanted something that could make more waffles at once, since our old Krups made only 2 belgians at a time, which doesn't keep our kids at the table. Unfortunately, the waffles that come out of this thing are consistently crisp on top and raw/mushy on the bottom. The top gets a LOT hotter than the bottom, evidently, despite the fact that we followed the manufacturers instructions to a \\"T\\". The waffles are totally not up to snuff. We're returning this and getting the Krups one that makes 4 belgians at a time, for $40. I'd rather have a product that does one thing and does it well, than one that does multiple things poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, attractive product","review":"This is our second purchase of this same model over many years and have found it to be of good quality, reliable, and attractive square waffle maker.

They look identical except for the Black and Decker name in place of the Sunbeam name. And this is a good thing because I hope these two new waffle makers last this long for our sons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Waffles","review":"Just got this waffle maker for Christmas, and it makes waffles just like Mom used to. In fact, this waffle maker looks and works almost identically to the one Mom used back in the '70s. I followed the directions to season the plates, and from the first batch onward, the waffles come out perfectly - lightly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. I read many of the online reviews for this product, but I haven't encountered any issues with the plates - they clip in and out easily, and the waffles come right out after the light goes out. However, it's not an idiot-proof machine - it gets really hot during use (just like the one from years back), but then again, it's gotta get really hot to cook the waffles, so it just takes a little care when using. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waffle Iron","review":"This appliance has worked very well for cooking waffles and pancakes. We haven't tried it's sandwich grill capabilities. Light illuminates when heated sufficient for cooking waffles and pancakes. Both are cooked light brown. Easy to operate.

Over all we are happy with appliance appearance and operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great waffles!","review":"I have been pretty pleased with this item. It's a little slow to warm up, but it definitely cooks my waffles evenly. I love that the plates are detatchable so that I can clean them - other waffle irons are not that easy to clean since you can't really get them wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I bought this waffle iron to replace one I've had for thirty years, not because it didn't work, but because it was looking a bit grungy thanks to years of baked on cooking spray. The new one was nice and shiney, but the iron grids were barely half as thick as my old iron. Waffles stick to teflon, prepped or not. They really should advise a maximum amount of waffle mix that should be used because spillover is very common and hard to remove once baked on. I will continue to use my thirty year old model and put this one in a furnished rental unit. Such shiney appliances always impress renters. By the way, if you want good waffles, put your grids in a self-cleaning oven to bake off your teflon coating, leave your home for several hours (because the fumes are toxic), and you will have easy to clean, non-stick cast iron waffle grids to use for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe","review":"We got this off of our wedding registry and I can't believe how poorly it is made! The two flimsy clips that are supposed to keep the plates into place are a hazard. We didn't even get to use the thing! We were just putting it together to use it for the first time and the plates wouldn't stay in place. I can't imagine trying to actually cook with it. The super hot plates falling out and burning you or something in your kitchen. No thanks. We will return it for a sturdier and safer waffle maker. What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with waffle iron","review":"We are disappointed with this product. The waffles cook unevenly and they are smaller than we expected.

Nonstick coating chips *very* easily, much more easily that other nonstick items I own. Even though I am careful not to use abrasives or metal utensils, it is now unusable as the coating flakes into food.2. The upper griddle surface does not get as hot as the lower surface: this is fine when using the unit closed, but when using it open as a griddle the surfaces are not the same temperature.3. Outside surfaces get very hot; you must be very careful so as not to burn yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the price!","review":"I like waffles, this machine does a decent job making them.

Unfortunately it fails to do either especially well.The Pros:* compact machine, all in one.* removable plates make for easy cleanup.* inexpensiveThe Cons:* cheap construction* thin metal gets **VERY HOT** to the touch. much hotter than you'd expect a kitchen appliance to get.* produces inconsistently done waffles,* waffles stick badly, even when using oil.Conclusion* after taking 10 minutes to scrape the remains of the second ruined waffle off the plates this morning, and burning my finger badly in the process, the singular moment of joy this machine brought me was smashing it to pieces on the driveway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor waffle quality","review":"While this device may be useful as a grill it is a very poor waffle iron. In addition to producing waffles that rise poorly (perhaps a result of the weight of the upper assembly) the heating is extremely uneven. That, of course, results in very uneven browning. That is a show-stopper for me and after making 6 or 7 batches over a period of about 3 months, we have replaced the device.Perhaps the heating was a fault in this particular iron, but the smushed waffles can't be(Note: I have used the same, exact recipe for many years and with several waffle irons without this problem). The fact that the non-stick surface worked well for the brief time we have used this iron is of little consequence.A waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I looked everywhere for a waffle iron and a griddle, all in one. I finally ended up getting this one because I thought it looked like what I wanted. I had previously owned a waffle iron and griddle for over 25 years. Unfortunately, the electric cord frayed and I thought it might be a fire hazard and I threw it out. In retrospect, I think I should have had a new cord put on and kept it. Washing it for the first time, I see a bit of the nonstick coating is coming off. I used the waffle side of it, and the thickness of the waffles is thin, much like the type one buys premade in the freezer aisle. It is impossible to adjust the color. The waffles come out splotchy: dark on some parts and very light colored on others, which makes me think it is unevenly cooking. If I had my druthers, I'd return it and keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!","review":"My kids bought this for their Mother for Christmas.

Everything about this machine is cheep and under engineered. The clips that hold the griddles in bend out of shape making it hard to lock them in place unless you bend them back. the lock that holds the top of the machine in the half open position so that the waffles can be removed is so lightly constructed that it will only hold the top open a few times before it no longer will. The machine could really use some rubber ends on the legs so that the machine would not tend to slide all over the table.

Maybe they should make it both ways.'Less than a year later:I just threw the waffle maker in the garbage. We didn't use it much during the year we had it.

My husband went to put the batter in the iron and when he opened it, the top plate just fell out! Talk about dangerous! Luckily she has a tile countertop so it wasn't burned while we grabbed a hot pad to pick up the plate with. We cooled down the waffle iron, reset the plates...checked them and darned if it didn't happen again! We then bent the clips (our grandson really wanted waffles) and it stayed together. My daughter said it fell apart on them too. We will try it one more time, but it may be an item that gets returned!

The thing that bugs me is the fact that the first two times that I used the product, food dribbled to the inside of the waffle maker, near the heating element and in between the handle crevices. It took me 20 minutes to clean it because I had to unscrew the handles just to clean in between them. I also would have loved to have been able to have found a waffle iron that's this good quality that also has panini plates instead of just griddle plates. But like I said, it works well and is a high quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the one you want","review":"Best nonstick, and you can flip the griddles over to cook pancakes or pressed hot sandwiches, like a panini. Heats up fast and works like a champ. It's a little tricky to clean around the handles but well worth it anyway. You can put butter in a metal bowl on top to melt.

I have tried changing the recipes and oiling the plates but to no avail. I wish companies would go back to using non-teflon coated plates; teflon sucks, and so does this wafflemaker. The only upside is that the unit has a 2 year warranty from B&D.;UPDATE 1/14/13I've been using the replacement for a while now and this new one is working much better. Still not 100% even cooking but not so bad it affects the joyful experience of eating waffles. The key thing is to put vegetable oil on the plates BEFORE they heat up. No problems with sticking now.

The metal insets/plates do not line up. After using it about 10 times, the plates do not stay in place. They fall out of the cip, which makes waffle making nearly impossible. Also, the plates do not heat up evenly. The side closest to the hinge does not cook as hot as the opposite side. I purchased it because it was easy to clean the plates, but the plates don't clean that well. After some use, the waffles also stick to the plates so that The crispy side sticks to each plate. I have to peel them off and put the two sides back together like a sandwich to make it look like a waffle.

Having faith in Black and Decker, we were confident it would meet our needs.First, the positive: I like the heating control on the front.But that is totally offset by the negative. In the five times we used it, we never got a satisfactory result. The waffles always stuck and had to be scraped off. We tried different heat setting and different levels of pre-treating the plates. Nothing worked. So as a waffler, it was useless.And as a grill (for pancakes), it was not much better. The pancakes still stuck. The only difference is that, because pancakes have a flat surface, we were able to get them off the plates will less product stuck to the grill.If you are going to cook bacon or some other type of pre-greased food, this is probably an okay product.

I needed to repair the wiring a few time over the years, but it lasted another 30 years!When it came time to replace it, I wanted another sturdy product. I didn't want a Belgian-style waffle maker. This Black & Decker model fits the bill. It certainly doesn't have the heft of the products from the middle of the 20th century, but it seems well made. More importantly, it cooks waffles magnificently! We've also used its griddle side to make grilled cheese sandwiches. The kids loved them!The Amazon price was also unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid of the lower price!","review":"I have been making waffles for 26 years. During that time I had one wafflemaker. It finally gave out on me and I wondered where I could find another just like it. I found one in the Black and Decker Grill and Waffle Baker. The removable plates are a must in my opinion. This makes cleaning so much easier! The non-stick surface releases the waffles quickly and the unit browns the entire waffle evenly. It does the job just as well as any expensive brand - without paying an unnecessary high cost. Any who comment about batter oozing out have simply not learned how much batter to pour into the unit. Once you learn that there is not an oozing problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"My husband bought me this model to replace the 40 year old waffle iron that had been passed down by my Mom.

Try to find a \\"traditional\\" non-belgian square, 4 slice waffle maker is hard! I've seen the others in stores and frankly, they looked cheap!So, probably caught up in nostalgia, I was very disappointed when the waffles didn't cook evenly. They were spongy not crisp even at the highest setting. The removable plates, which could be used for grilling, did not stay in place. Everytime I opened the iron, the top plate would fall out. The steel hinge holding the plates in weren't very secure. Plus, I noticed the non-stick coating chip a bit. That concerns me.Needless to say, I'm returning the item. I'm disappointed. Maybe a cheaper one will do the work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal casing gets too hot","review":"There is no insulation between the heated coil and the external metal casing, which means that the outside can get as hot as the cooking surface.

The next to last time that I tried to make waffles the maker was stuck so tight that it would not budge without being pried apart with pliers. Aside from sticking the plates were not held tightly in place (which was probably part of the problem), plastic (cheap) handles, and a surface that would get extremely hot.

The B&D unit turns out to be just like the old one, but with a grill that releases the waffles. I am pleased to find a basic waffle maker that does what it says.

The clips which hold the cooking plates in place seem to be installed incorrectly so the plates are not secure. The product performs well but because the plates do not install firmly, the heating element is visible and I am afraid it might not be safe. Also, if a waffle sticks even slightly, the plates pull loose. I am looking forward to receiving the new baker as it is extremely useful in my rv, serving multiple purposes and taking up relatively little space. It turned out terrific grilled cheese sandwiches, much easier than in a skillet."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe","review":"Good points:*The plates are easy to remove to wash.Poor points:*There is no click when the waffles or other items are done.

Now I'm concerned that everything will burn.*Because the plates are removeable, it is easy to get things into the electronics and hot heating elements.*The item gets much too hot on the outside. Our previous waffle iron got very warm, but this one was scalding on the case. My fingers missed the very small handle and now I have some singed finger tips. You can easily see what the problem is. Since the plates are removeable you see that the casing is too thin. I have taken other waffle irons apart with my kids at school to show them how it works. I have never seen a waffle iron or toaster with this thin a case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Waffle Maker","review":"I grew up with a Toastmaster waffle iron of this size (It's still in my Mom's cabinet). My wife and I were given a Toastmaster waffle iron as a wedding gift 30+ years ago and it still works, but the cord is frayed and the waffles are now tending to stick to the plates. So it was decided now is the time to up grade, the Black and Decker being the closest look-a-like. When it arrived I was very disappointed. Wattage is only 900W. The old Toastmaster had 1500W for this size. There are 2-square units ou there that have 900W. Plus the metal just seemed thin and flimsy. The clips holding the plates in seemed very light and bendable. So we sent it back! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely not. I'm still looking for a quality replacement for the old Toastmaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when new.... 6 months later, not so much.","review":"It worked well for the first few months, as long as you were careful not to open it too quickly. If the waffles stick at all, the upper cooking surface snaps out of place when you open it ... and then you'd better have burn gel close by. I was careful not to clean with anything other than a nylon brush, but I just can not get the waffles to keep from sticking any more. I've tried preheating for 30 minutes, I've tried cooking spray, canola spray and recently I soaked both surfaces in oil to make sure they were completely drenched, prepared to \\"discard\\" the first oily waffle as recommended in the manual. It still stuck to the upper cooking surface. I love the size and the fact that it makes 4 toaster sized waffles (or used to). Luckily I still have my old single round waffle maker to go back to. As my kids pointed out, it was much faster to make them one at a time with no sticking no difficult clean up and no burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The outside surface gets extremely hot when in use, and, not aware of that, I burned my fingertips when I tried to move the unit while grilling (I guess I shouldn't have assumed it was cool to the touch as my old grill). The unit didn't work quite well when I tried to use it as a griddle - it was hard to adjust the surface temperature, and it took forever to make grilled-cheese sandwiches. The \\"grill/waffle\\" side is very hard to clean, and after only two times I've cleaned it with a nylon vegetable brush, the non-stick coating is gone in several places. Also, the manual says to \\"use non-stick spray\\" when making waffles. I really miss my cheap old waffle maker from Wal-Mart, which never needed any oil or spray. Bottom line - this grill is okay to cook some hot dogs, but if you want more, buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not function properly","review":"This waffle iron did not work properly.

I love thin waffles. Immediately, though, the problems began. The design of this waffle maker is very poor. The top griddle doesn't stay hinged in and often falls off. The waffles also cook unevenly. The only positive about this is that the griddle is easy to clean (partly because it doesn't stay well hinged). Also, there is no audible sound when the waffles are done cooking. On previous waffle makers I owned, there is a loud beeping sound, but this waffle maker only has a light that you may or may not notice go off when the waffle is \\"ready.\\" I would advise that you spend a little more money and buy a higher quality waffle maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven cooking; very slow for waffles.","review":"There's an electric coil behind each waffle/griddle plate. But the coils really heat only the area near the front. In every batch, two waffles are perfect, and the other two are pale and and soggy. I did have success when I spread the batter on only the hot side, but that's not very practical. Also, the waffles take a very long time to cook -- 8 minutes or so, even on high heat.On the pro side, it's great to have removable cooking plates, for ease in cleaning. Plus, the hinge is designed to accomodate a range of thicknesses, whick is good if you're grilling a sandwich or if your waffle batter rises a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed, Cheap!!!","review":"I ordered this waffle maker because I thought it would do double duty as both a waffle maker and a griddle (plus it was on sale for $36.) It arrived and when I unpacked it, the cooking grids fell out on the floor. I read several other reviews where people had the same problem. It is poorly designed. The outer case/shell is made of very thin sheet metal and the edges are not rolled and it has no lip for rigidity, so it bends easily and does not hold the cooking grids well.If you remove the cooking grids you can see the interior and how cheaply it is made. I am returning it today.I would recommend you buy a different waffle maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss my G5.","review":"Waffles bake unevenly. Base is not stable. It's not set up to tilt into the corner fat drain (and the channels at the edges are so shallow that if they drain off more than a drop they will overflow) but it is not flat enough to safely use as a griddle, either. I cracked an egg about an inch off the middle, and it slid raw onto my table. Handles are not symmetrical. Opening and closing doesn't feel stable. If anything sticks to the top plate, it's easy to get steam burns.I had the George Foreman G5, and this doesn't have the problems it had (B&D; plates clean very easily, coating doesn't flake, no annoying spring-handles on the plates to break, exterior finish stays pretty instead of chipping and scratching), but it is inferior in every other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I've had one of these since the mid 1980s (GE branded) and it was very reliable - there's very little to it, and the thing just worked really well. It took a spill off the counter and finally broke (the Teflon was starting to wear off too), so I got a new one (this Black & Decker one). This is 95% identical to the old one, though the build quality doesn't seem quite as nice. Is that good? If you've had one of these forever, this one will be comforting and familiar. If you've never had one of these, there are probably some better options.

The Sunbeam has worked great all those years and is still working but deterioation of insulating material and corrosion of the heating element caused me to scrap it for safety reasons. We expected the B&D to at least come close to the old unit but it did not. No matter how we preheated the new one when half the waffle was well cooked the other half was just beginning to cook and was too raw to be put on your plate.

The waffle maker is pretty much as described, but the one thing I would have liked to have known was the fact that the \\"waffle wells\\" were not that deep. I like waffles that have DEEP \\"holes\\" so that I can get more syrup on each waffle, plus it makes the waffle itself crunchier. This waffle maker also makes a smaller waffle than what I'm used to. Otherwise it is a great product! The waffle does indeed come out much easier than some waffle makers -- I think that is because the waffle \\"holes\\" are not so deep. Pops right out! :-) I like the on/off button and the light. It's a really pretty maker, too.

This one is easier to fill, overflows less, is FAR easier to clean if it does, and makes waffles in a more useful size. The cooking surfaces can be reversed to grill sandwiches or make panninis or quesadillas (it's the right size for a burrito-size tortilla). It could be improved by a more powerful heating element, by insulating the case to keep heat focused on the cooking surfaces, and by a tougher non-stick treatment, but still -- it's half the price and a far better design than any other alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The combo griddle waffle iron is a super product.

He has not yet received this gift yet, but I know he will be pleased because these are hard to find. I am thinking of ordering myself one.

I think my parents' was bigger back then, but then maybe my perspective has changed (ie - I'm bigger). Theirs was also pea green. Thank goodness this thing isn't pea green!!!! Even if it was green, I'd still buy it.Cons - this is a bigger machine and will take up room in your cupboard. Also, the surface gets very hot. I remember burning myself on it more than a few times growing up.Pros - you get to make 4 \\"eggo\\" size waffles at once. Opens fully as a griddle so you can make 2 pancakes at once. Plates come completely out for easy washing. Cost effective.After much searching for a waffle iron a while back, the only waffle iron that seemed to come close to this was endorsed by Emeril, so the cost was much higher. B&D; is totally the way to go! Frankly, the fact that this the the same design for a waffle iron that I remember growing up with says enough -- the design has stood the test of time.

The waffles always stick to the bottom or the top making it almost impossible to get them out when cooked. Lately, I've had waffles that are more cooked on one side, so it's not working probably. Lastly, the plates get very hot and so does the outside and I've burned myself twice on this applicance. Both burns were very painful.

This one fit the bill nicely. It takes a little time to get used to the temperature settings, and figure out what works best, but when you hit it right on, the waffles come out perfectly. Just be careful not to add too much oil. It does best with minimal greasing.The griddle side has been a great bonus. We use it as much as the waffle side. It's perfect for pancakes, but also works well for general indoor grilling since it has a nice flat surface with drainage.I gave it 4 stars only because I do find it a bit cumbersome at times and though the removable plates are awesome for cleaning, it can still be a bit hard to clean at times. Even so, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker Grill & Waffle baker","review":"I was looking for this and it's difficult to find in stores. Love it!

Having looked there and just about everywhere else I could not find this unit so it become a quest. Luckily, Amazon had it at very affordable price.I been using it mainly for waffles so I am not sure how much of pancake or french toast grill this unit can be but the waffles are great. It girls very evenly and I would recommend setting the nob on higher temp on 'waffle' setting to get nice, crisp and brown waffles. Unit does get a bit warm so careful - I mean, even your average toaster gets hot so if you need this warning I would see a specialist.Great buy, super fast delivery by Amazon...and Black & Decker simply puts out primo products.If it ever burns out, I will be getting the same model for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality construction","review":"I received this product and was forced to return it immediately. The black, non-stick coating was peeling and flaking off of the cooking plates in the box. After inspecting it further, it appears to be poorly constructed.

I had hoped for better quality, but I guess I'll have to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have had issues","review":"I wanted to love this waffle iron/griddle combo....but it hasn't worked out between us. While I love that it's big enough to make multiple pancakes or huge waffles (theoretically), or grilled cheese sandwiches at once, I have had several issues.First of all....to me, \\"nonstick\\" means food should not stick. Food DOES stick. Feel free to view my photo (appropriately captioned \\"we have had issues\\") of a very stuck waffle. Mamma wasn't happy that night.Second, the griddle gets so hot that the shortening we use bakes onto it permanently, making the surface tacky and gross. Even multiple trips through the dishwasher have failed to remove this residue.Third, this thing gets scary hot. I am afraid of it.This must have worked well for some people, based on the good reviews I read before purchasing, but I want my old waffle iron back....the one where I could actually get my waffles out to be able to eat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stick coating flakes off","review":"I didn't learn the first time!

When I called Black and Decker customer service to buy replacement grills I discovered the replacements cost $55.00 which is almost as much as a new appliance. I hate to throw away a perfectly good electrical appliance. So I won't be buying this particular device again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product","review":"We've had this product for a couple years. The clips no long hold the plates in. Just imagine--pouring the batter, then trying to close the lid. If the top plate does stay in, it certainly will not stay clipped when the waffle is done and you try to lift the lid. Then you have a very hot mess.The only thing we use this for now is pancakes because we can keep both lids open so it does not fall apart. In my opinion, Black & Decker should recall this evil monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday Night Waffles","review":"We have had an almost identical model by another manufacturer. It lasted for years with waffles almost every Sunday night. ( A good tradition - church in the morning and waffles in the evening. ) The only comparison we can make with the other is that these plates are not clipped as well to the housing. -Please note B&D. If you want regular waffles and like to grill sandwiches ( the reversible plates ), this is as good as you will find. Good controls. We are happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME WAFFLEMAKER","review":"I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT THIS WAFFLE MAKER IS WORTH IT. YOU CLEARLY SHOULD READ DIRECTIONS BEFORE USING AND YOUR WAFFLES WILL TURN OUT AS PROMISED. AS FAR AS SOME EXPERIENCING BATTER OVERFLOW, THAT IS THE PERSONS FAULT ENTIRELY. IF YOU LAY THE BATTER IN THE MIDDLE OUT TO A HALF INCH FROM THE EDGES AND USE A SPOON TO SPREAD IT AS THICK AS YOU DESIRE YOUR WAFFLES WILL NOT OVERFLOW. THIS IS WHAT I DID ON THE WAFFLE IRON I HAD FOR 30 YEARS. A LITTLE COMMON SENSE GOES ALONG WAY. THE REST TAKES CARE OF ITSELF. USING A HEAT PAD IS ALSO A GOOD THING ON MOST WAFFLE MAKERS I KNOW ABOUT. MAKES THE BEST GOLDEN BROWN WAFFLES YOU CAN MAKE."},{"rating":"2","title":"use it all the time","review":"We love this product and we use it all the time (3 or 4 times a week)to make waffles, quesadillas, and sandwiches. I even used it to grill onions. It is by far the most used small appliance (after the microwave) in our kitchen. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the outside gets so hot. I've warned my children to NEVER touch it-plugged or unplugged. Even so, my 3 year old touched it last night and has a small blister on his finger. I don't think he's going to do that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Baker","review":"There are 4 sections to the waffle baker. The 2 front sections bake the waffle very nicely, but the back 2 sections do bake very poorly.

Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent waffle iron, poor griddle","review":"Yes, this product does get very hot, but the instructions warn you of that. I didn't have the sticking problems making waffles that other reviewers had, but the non-stick coating on the griddle started flaking off the first time I used it, and every time since.

No matter how the waffle plates have been seasoned the waffles are impossible to get out. If the grids are over-saturated with oil to get them out, the waffles are inedible. Also, the plates fall out very easily and are not held well in the clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I've had this appliance for several years and used it lightly (2x per month). The plates have never heated evenly - one side was always hotter than the other. Now it's so bad the waffles only get done on one side."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS!!","review":"On face value, this looks like a great waffle maker. But the clips that hold the waffle plates are very flimsy, and do not hold the weight of the plates. The first (and only) time I used this, the plate kept falling off, it's a very hot iron, and was very dangerous having it slam down in the middle of taking the waffles out. Black & Decker will give you the run around, and there's no ability to replace the parts. It is a faulty design. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This thing is cheap, light, and poorly made. Although it looks like an old fashioned waffle maker, don't be fooled, as it weighs about 1/10 of the old ones it is made to resemble. After using it 2-3 times the plates would not line up with each other, and no matter what we did with the cheap spring that is supposed to keep them in place the plates would just fall out. It's being sent back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really like mom used to have","review":"This may look like mom's but it sure doesn't work like hers. It doesn't heat evenly.

I replaced this with the Villa waffle iron. What an improvement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this waffle maker to replace one just like it that had stopped heating the lower grill.

When it arrived I was more than disappointed. The quality of the waffle maker was poor. The hinges seemed as if they would fall off with a good shake.

First of all, the plates are not the cast iron like what I have now and they are smaller. The clips to hold the plates in are flimsy, I could easily see them bending or, worse yet, breaking off. The topper of them all, the clips don't hold the plates in securely. This is a cheap imitaion (made in China) of quality product that was made in America that apparently can not be purchased anymore.

It reminded me of the one my mom used over 40 years ago & my memories of light fluffy waffles prompted me to buy it. It does looks great but it is very disappointing. The waffle iron takes over 15 minutes to warm up...a long time when you're trying to feed hungry impatient kids in the morning. It also neeeds to be oiled before every use or the waffles will stick to the iron. They stick sometimes anyway & it is maddening to wait and wait to see that red light go off only to find the waffles split in two, stubbornly clinging to both sides of the iron.

I'd never seen the original show, and it has quite a few songs I've never heard or seen John sing, which was really lovely. He seems to be having a great time, and the Muppets are always fun. This would be a great gift for any JD fan, or anyone with kids, since it's very kid oriented, but not boring for adults. What a sweet surprise. Only question: why have the songs not been released on a CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for John Denver fans","review":"This 1982 special is just beyond cute. While Miss Piggy only shows up in a cameo, the rest of the core gang is here...including Kermit's nephew Robin. It's a mix of campfire classics and some wonderful John Denver songs. The highlight of the whole show is John singing CATCH ANOTHER BUTTERFLY to young Robin when Robin is feeling blue about being so small. BTW, the kid's in that vignette just happen to be Joh'ns own kids Zach and AnnaKate. This is an awesome special. My only \\"complaint\\" is that it was over so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"a walk down memory lane","review":"The video was in the wrong format for Australia but I quickly learned I could change the setting on my PC.

As a JD fan it was lovely to see a young, fresh faced John interacting with his good mates; and a nice touch was footage of him flying kites with his children.

So glad to have all of these on DVD. Yes, the packaging transition is odd but that's nothing compared to seasons 5 thru 7 where for some unknown reason (I hope it's not just greed, but.....) they split each of the final 3 seasons each into two volumes. Lastly the music for most of the series didn't quite make it on to DVDs. I assume it's due to licensing issues but the opening number to each episode (which was a different popular song each week when the show originally aired) has been replaced with seemingly unknown or at least uncredited music that I don't think any 90's melrose fan ever heard before.So if you get get past the packaging and the strange music the show is still amazing.

If you take a listen to NUFAN's album \\"More Betterness\\" or \\"Hard Rock Bottom\\" you will see no similarities in those albums to this. NUFAN has, thankfully, matured into a talented melodic punk rock band. This is a cd that was made by young guys just wanting to play crazy fast punk music. There are no real tunes on this, you definitely won't find yourself singing along to it like you will on NUFAN's other albums. Tony Sly has also improved his singing an unbelievable amount from this album. I consider myself a die-hard No Use fan, but I find it hard to like this album. I never really take it out of its case.

You can choose to do low impact, intermediate or high impact moves and as your fitness level improves perform harder moves for more or all of the minute. I find this workout particularly good as I don't like very complex moves, I can't normally do dance videos without a lot of practice as I get a bit lost.

Considering the low budget it is sort of fun to watch. Desperado however is pretty much a waste of time. I find it incredible that so many people can be giving it high marks, unless they are friends of the director's. The beginning of the film is decent (the parts with Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino are good.) The first action sequence is good. After that it is pure trash. No plot. Senseless, boring action scenes. A soft porn sort of scene that is truly pathetic.

The songs can be described as slow blues, but not in the Robert Johnson way. But there's a big problem, and that is regarding the quality of the songs as well as the originality. Chris Rea is getting very boring to say the least, with these very slow numbers that lack melody. It's almost impossible to separate one from the other since they all sound more or less the same. If you have sleeping problems, this might be the solution.

I have had surgery on both wrists, so I was looking for a sander that was light weight but still able to accomplish the job at hand. The sander is a great performer, and I will most likely use it quite a bit for smaller jobs. My only complaint, which I was able to overlook, is that the dust collection unit doesn't work all that well. Other than that, it works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as shown with quantity of sandpaper","review":"No sandpaper with first shipment - small quantity with second - customer service refunded 1/2 purchase price - item was supposed to be withdrawn??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Untrue Description","review":"This item describe as a new.

The only thing it does in a cyclonic action is blow dust all over your room.From a sanding perspective, it does a good job and the tip will get into tight areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from the git-go but not as shown","review":"I used this sander as soon as it arrived to finish up the end of a handrail I had rough cut and installed, and it worked to perfection, the orbital sander being just what I needed. I can see myself getting a lot of good work out of this baby, especially for small jobs like furniture refinishing.One complaint I have is that the box arrived missing one of the \\"nine accessories\\" listed on the outside of the box. I assume the nine accessories are sheets of sandpaper. If the accessories in question are indeed pieces of sandpaper, then the photo Amazon is using to sell this item is misleading, as there are something like 20 pieces of sandpaper shown, and even more if you want to get picky about it. Did I get short-changed? Or is false advertising a \\"tool\\" Amazon uses to lure buyers? If bait and switch techniques are part of the Amazon arsenal, then I, for one, will think twice before my next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad sander to have around.....","review":"I was looking for a small sander, so when I saw an add on TV for this Black & Decker unit with the dust accumilation it was interesting & checked out the reviews. So for the price took the plunge, it arrived the other day & tried it out. It doesn't pick up every piece of dust, but it does a darn good job. The collection cup does fill up fairly fast, so you have to keep an eye on it to see when it needs emptying, but that's no big deal if you pay attention. And the attachments are perfect for details such as corners or sligtly larger jobs. The velcro system of installing sanding pads is convient, haven't had to get new ones yet, so I don't know how much they cost. So the one downside of this sander it would have been nice to be able to adapt & use sandpaper sheets of one's own choosing. Overall I'm pleased with this item. It won't do the big job of a belt sander, but it doesn't pretend to be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the 4-5 hours of use and then it stoped working","review":"I bought this sander for some misc. work and sanding down two coffe tables so I can refinish them. As I write this I am filled with frustration as my SECOND Cyclone within the last month has now stopped turning on. The first one suffered the exact same fate. The sad part is I am only half way through my second coffe table.The unit when it works is great. I love the ability to switch between the orbital and the detail sander as I have a need for both. However both of them have died on me after 4-5 hours of use. I turned them both off to clean out the dust collectore and then they never turned back on again. I am now returning the second Cyclone back to the store where I bought it and buying a Dewalt.

Automatic pump that has separate controls for inside and outside chambers. Sheets fit great and the bed itself can be as firm or as soft (super-soft makes it feel like a water bed...awesome!

Not only does it look a full-sized bed, but the pump that inflates it is really powerful. It took about 5 minutes to inflate completely. It appears to be very well-made and hasn't lost significant inflation yet. Very satisfied and the price was very competetive. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good air mattress","review":"Very comfortable air mattress. I've had several people sleep on it including myself - no complaints! Retains air for several days.. I think I refilled it once a week?? I really like that there is an inner and outer section to fill air. But I did find that I had to refill the inner tube more then the outer tube. After about a week, it seems like the the outer section retains air better, which means if there are 2 people in the bed, you tend to roll towards each other :) But its easy to inflate/deflate (though it does take several minutes) and stores easy. Comes with a bag. I like that there are no extra parts - that the wires/air pump are all built in. After some time, the sides do push out, and the sheets tend to ride up...so be weary of that. I couldn't find anything sheet wise, that makes this look pretty... the deep sheets work better then the regular ones. Also, keep away from the wall.. the knobs for inflate/deflate tend to rub against/scuff the wall.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"This bed was purchased for use during a move when we were at the new place but the beds weren't. It was comfortable and easy to inflate/deflate. We've used it more than once now and are confident we'll have a comfortable spot for any visiting friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Does not live up to its reputation as being qood quality. Sure grip bottom did not prevent it from moving when placed on a carpeted floor. Worst feature was the way it sags from the edges of the top toward the middle of the bed. Quite obvious soon as it is full of air but more importantly extremely uncomfortable for two people. We returned it which is something we rarely do. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before the first week!","review":"My husband and I use the air mattress to play video games on when he has a really long one. Within the first week one of the chambers had popped up! I never liked it as much as our Intex one that lasted us over a year. It just never was as comfortable. We had just thrown out the box, so I'm not sure what we are going to do next, but I really wish we had either gotten the Intex again, or gotten the more expensive one. Will not buy Wenzel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Issue","review":"The two Wenzel Insta-beds I purchased had leaks.

I was hopeful, as it was fairly nice quality until it stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNEVEN and UNCOMFORTABLE","review":"If you like a bed that pushes your body into the center with raised edges, than this is the bed for you. A bed should be flat. This bed was designed by someone who never even tried to lie down in it. The design is totally flawed. My biggest fears were buying an air bed that leaked, not one that puts strain on your body because it is not flat. Horrible design. F. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as advertised","review":"We've only had this bed less than a month and it leaks, and each time we blow it up, it swells up a bit more, in other words, it don't hold its original shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable at first, but has sprung a leak after 1 month","review":"I bought this bed a month ago and have been sleeping on it with my partner every night (our bed is in storage, we're in the process of moving). It was pretty comfortable, but I have two complains.1: The sides of the bed were higher than the center of the bed, causing us to roll towards the middle. We solved this by taking enough air out of the bed so that it was level, but this caused the edge to be under-inflated and thus not sturdy. Whatever, we dealt with it.2: The bigger complaint is that after a month of gentle use, it has sprung an undetectable leak. We now have to fill up the bed at night, and by morning nearly half the air is gone. We can't find the leak and I think we'll have to throw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this airbed","review":"I have been sleeping on this bed alone and with a friend while I await my furniture in a new apartment.

They are thinking about getting one and putting it in their guest room for their guests to sleep on.My wife and I slept on it the next night and Oh Boy!!!! Excellent! This is top of the line in air beds. I have not slept on many, and now never will, b/c I plan on keeping this one for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No leaks after 8 months...","review":"Heavily used after 8 months of ownership and no leaks to date. I can't say the same for other air mattresses that I've tried and replaced. I would also add that the raised height makes the bed much more comfortable. The only drawback is that the internal pump can overheat when inflating/deflating, but you only need to wait 5 minutes before trying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"sliding bed","review":"I just bought this air mattress because I read alot of positive reviews but am not satisfied with it. Everynight we inflate it we were comfortable but after an hour or so it would lose air and we would both start sliding toward the center. It was very uncomfortable when both of us ended in the middle. It would of pershaps been better to buy 2 twin size instead of a queen. I don't really recommend this product to anybody. Pershaps a twin for each person but never a queen for 2 people."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"I purchased this bed for my parents to use while visiting over the holidays. It lasted three days. On the third night, the mattress rapidly lost air (during the middle of the night) and I have not been able to locate where the air is leaking from. It is not returnable and so I spent $100 for the use of an air mattress for three nights. Two and half if you want to get technical since my parents ended up on the floor by 1am. Also, my parents are elderly and this was not a pleasant experience for them. I was greatly dissapointed in this product and would not recommend anyone to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bam!","review":"After a couple months of moderate use, it kersploded. It was just me on the bed. I am of average weight, I wasn't jumping or standing on it, it wasn't even very full of air. I repositioned myself, it went pop, now I have a lumpy child-sized bed. This is not a small hole that can be patched. It is a catastrophic rupture.Edit: It's still under warranty, so I called customer support. Wait time was less than a minute, and it sounds like getting a replacement should not be too difficult. The customer support representative sent me an email while I was on the phone, so I have a personal contact--much better than some anonymous support@company address. Will update further when the replacement has been received."},{"rating":"1","title":"These beds are only good for a few months","review":"We'd bought one for our cabin.

Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bed that wouldn't hold air","review":"We were traveling to visit family and had ordered the bed to be shipped to their house so it would be there when we arrived instead of having to pack it and drive it up there. Little did we know that we had purchased a defective product and the bed would not hold air. We attempted to work with if for 6 hours (while we were visiting family) and finally gave up. Luckily, in a town of 2500 people in Michigan's upper peninsula, the only store in town sold a nice coleman queen inflatable with built in pump that we were able to sleep comfortably on. The only redeeming feature of this purchase was Amazon.com's easy internet trade in system where you print a label from the computer ship it back for free.I should have remembered the Wenzel tent I purchased 2 years ago when the center pole snapped in half after two uses!!! I guess this is a brand to avoid completely. I have certainly learned my lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly comfortable for an airbed!","review":"We utilized this bed as a temporary bed while we moved, allowing us to pack mattresses to be shipped. I was a bit skeptical as we were going to use the airbed for 2 weeks. We are a middle aged, \\"pleasantly plump\\" couple who approached the maximum wt limit also! The bed was GREAT! It had such a mattress type feel and comfort that you would forget it was an airbed! The adjustment of air pressure for comfort was perfect; NO rolling into the center of the bed! I would recommend it highly! True full Queen size,qWenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with Built-in Pump (Green)queen sheets fit it perfectly (with a mattress protector, also), setting up and disassembling is a breeze!

It proved to be defective, as one of the two pump switches was jammed and would not operate. I called Wenzel's customer service line, and was on hold for over 45 minutes No one picked up my call. I called back, and waited a further 30 minutes. Again, no one picked up.At this point, I decided no matter how good their product may be, I no longer wanted anything to do with a company with this type of \\"service.\\" I have requested a refund and am returning this product. Further attempts to contact Wenzel have proved fruitless.I would NOT recommend dealing with this company based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUUUUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Very, very disappointing, not usable unless I can figure a way around the \\"fall toward the middle\\" issue. Directions are clear and mattress is easy to inflate; however when you sit or lay on it, you immediately roll toward the middle of the mattress. In my situation this was to be used as a temp/guest sleep solution, but no way two people can sleep on the mattress. If one gets up, it's like being at the top of a seesaw and having the person on the bottom get off and drop you. Even one night on it alone was a bad night; if you turn from your side onto your back in your sleep, you'll just keep rolling. I've tried manipulating the air in upper/lower chambers, only makes it worse. The line in the ad about \\"flex coil construction for sleeping in stable and firm positions\\" is a bunch of baloney. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen","review":"The bed inflated quickly, which was a plus; however, after sleeping on it the air leaked out.

I returned it and took a chance and ordered another from Amazon. It arrived just in the nick of time for my house guests. That was 3 weeks ago and since I was expecting another house guest soon, we decided to leave it inflated. It has inflated for three weeks now and I haven't had to add any more air! We have been lounging around on it and I'm happy to say that it is quite comfortable. I did notice that the \\"sure grip bottom\\" doesn't really grip on a hardwood floor.

They were returning from six months abroad and renting an unfurnished house. I thought it would give them comfort during their first nights home and could later be used for guests.

I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jury is out...","review":"Read many reviews and was super excited about purchasing this bed since we were about to have our first child and would be expecting several out-of-town guests. From its first use though, it leaked and had to be re-filled with air each night and our guests were very uncomfortable sleeping on it. After about 10 uses there was a big bubble coming from the interior chamber and by morning our guests were virtually on the floor it had sunk down so low in the middle! Unfortunately, Amazon only has a one-month return on this item and so by the time we discovered it was defective, the month had ended and they will only offer a partial refund (?) and require buyer to pay shipping both ways. Not fun. Going to call the company and hope for better customer service there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bed!","review":"We bought this bed for guests and just recently had our 60yr old mother-in-law (who has several health conditions that make her uncomfortable) sleep on it for a week. SHE LOVED IT! In fact, she's buying one for her house for guests - so I guess I will be sleeping on it someday. She said it was VERY comfortable and it felt great to me as I laid on it. It was a nice height off the ground and could get very firm if you wanted.The bed inflated easily just by turning 2 knobs. It was a little noisy (emitting a slight squeal) but not so much that it was a problem. We did inflate it each night for about 5 seconds, just to keep it as inflated as day one, which was not a hassle. The deflation was fairly quick, totally automatic and easy.We also purchased the Pike Street comforter to go with it and it fit snugly like a glove and added some extra comfort. We used normal queen sheets that seemed to stay on well.All in all, we're glad we bought this bed and would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"I have had this bed for a few months and had a few guests sleep on it so far. They all comment that it is very comfortable-- at least as comfortable as a normal bed. My only suggestion would be to buy a mattress cover for the bed as well. My first guest visited in the winter and said that the surface of the bed never got warm. We bought a mattress cover for it and that solved the problem. A blanket would also work."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks down horribly","review":"I ordered this for a back up for my son that was coming home for Christmas. I followed all the suggestions of inflating and deflating several times before putting any weight on it. I didn't need it to be perfect, but it is awful. My son weighs about 140 lbs. and he can't get through one night without losing 1/3 of the air. It would be great if we just had to touch it up each night, but this is terrible. I think my son would rather be back in his bunk in Iraq!I can count on one hand the number of products that I have returned to Amazon. This would be one of them if I could. Unfortunately, I ordered it early so that it would be here and I could do the prep before he got here for the holidays.

There is NO WAY that two people could sleep on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wenzel Air Mattress","review":"Great air mattress. Had our family use it over Thanksgiving.

I am considering returning the mattress, if that is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't stay inflated","review":"We used this bed every day for almost four weeks while family was visiting from out of town. It inflated easily and relatively quickly. It would have been ideal if the inflation tool shut off automatically when the bed was inflated, since it was hard to be sure when inflation was complete - but this is a small matter. The bed was was a good size and was moderately comfortable. It was softer than anyone preferred, and made a lot of noise when one moved on it, but I suppose that's normal for an air bed.For the first week, it held air well. For the second week, we had to re-inflate it every day. But after about three weeks, it didn't hold air at all. It was a soft, sagging mess that trapped us in deep pockets and pushed us off on to the floor. Repeated attempts to re-inflate were unsuccessful, as the bed always lost its air in reasonably short order.The bottom line is that I can't recommend this bed for anyone who plans to use it for more than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return","review":"I was psyched at getting this.

We purchased these beds so that we would have a place to sleep when we visited our children in other states. It was so disappointing when we visited our daughter's family recently and the bed would not stay inflated and the leak was so bad that we couldn't repair it. It's too bad that products are not made to last.

My husband and I woke after about 2 hours of sleeping to find ourselves sunken on the floor.

After returning the first one due to a leaky seam from day one, the replacement is now leaking after two uses. The product was babied, the seams are not durable enough to handle pressure. I took the precaution of sweeping the carpet where the product was placed and letting it sit for several hours filled half way to give the material a chance to stretch. I am 100% sure I did not overfill. It was not even firm. Someone who weights 130 pounds slept on it. Well below the maximum weight limit. The first night was fine. Throughout the second night it began losing a majority of the air and continues to do so. I should have tested the replacement before the 30 day return window, but I really thought the first one was just bad luck. Now the second is even worse luck and I am stuck with a useless pile of vinyl. Wenzel should not even offer a warranty. It is impossible to talk to an actual person from the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deflating doesn't work so good","review":"First the good news; the price was right, it inflated with no problems, held air (so far), and is comfortable to sleep on.Now the bad news; the \\"auto deflate\\" feature doesn't work as advertised. The electric pump sucks out the air from the bottom of the mattress, but then the plastic material collapses around the pump so that it no longer can pull air from the pillow top section. Ultimately it overheats the pump and you have to turn it off for 30 minutes to let the motor cool down. In order to get the rest of the air out, I had to have one person wrestle with the built-in pump and the collapsed material around it so it wouldn't clog the inside of the airway, while I laid on the mattress to help force air out. It would have been much simpler if this mattress had a manual release valve to allow air out. With the pump as the only method of pulling air out, this is a PAIN.The price made this an appealing purchase, but I wouldn't recommend it and I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold air.","review":"Just purchased 2 of these bed for my upcoming camping trip this weekend. Received it in two days using prime shipping. Tested both and both would not hold air over night. I would understand having one of them being a defective unit, but both???There are two separate air chambers in this bed. Outer air chamber seems to be fine on both untis but I think it's the mid air chamber that is leaking. I also noticed that there aren't any \\"support\\" on mid section either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deflated significantly overnight","review":"I was really sorry about this bed, which I returned within a week. It is wonderfully comfortable--easily as comfortable as my own bed--but I tried it three nights in a row, and each morning I woke up to a significantly deflated mattress. Given that other reviewers here have had better experience in this regard, maybe I just got a dud. By the way, like all inflatable beds, this one emits a very powerful chemical smell. I imagine it would dissipate after a few uses, but if you get it, plan on putting it in a room with an open window at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bed","review":"This is a wonderful bed. I took it along on a girl's getaway week-end and used it in a friend's livingroom. It looked like a real bed and it certainly felt like a real bed. There were two of us sleeping on the bed and it supported our weight with no rolling to the middle. The lip prevents sliding off of the sides. It held the air very well. On the third night I added a small amount of air and it was enough. The set-up and take-down was quick and easy. I recommend this bed very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Promised","review":"We took it along to visit our son in his small apartment. Used it four nights. It inflates easily, holds air well and (maybe best of all) deflates quickly and completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey! An air mattress that holds some air!","review":"I have slept on a number of air mattresses of varying brands that become a queen-sized plastic area rug by morning. I thought there would be a better chance of not ending up on the floor if: 1) I got a really thick one, 2) I spent a little money.It has an air chamber for both the sleeping area of the bed and the sides of the bed, which are slightly taller than the center to keep you from rolling off, I guess. I found that the sleeping area chamber held its air like a rock (a good rock, that is). The sides on the one I got seem to get a little more soft over time and need an extra shot of air here and there. This mattress inflates pretty quickly for having so much air volume. It deflates a bit slower, but still within five minutes. Folding it up and trying to fit it in the included bag is a little tough.Overall a good purchase and I would recommend it to anyone sick of sleeping on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"Inflation and deflation are super easy and fast. Flocked top holds onto sheet throughout the night. Loses minimal air during use, but it's so easy to top it back off to the desired fullness. Packs away well, and it's not a major pain to get it back into its carry bag. Glad we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air mattress that felt like a real bed","review":"This bed was everything that it was advertised to be. It was comfortable, easy to setup, and easy to deflate. The bed was so comfortable and stable it didn't feel like an air bed. I used during the summer months with just a fitted sheet and regular sheet. For added comfort when it's cold out, I would probably add a regular mattress pad. I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Guest Room","review":"I recently purchased for the guest Room. I put regular fitted sheets on and bedding set and it turned out very comfortable and looked great. It looks so good I'm leaving it set up for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed for the price!","review":"Spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews on air beds and was just about to spend way more money on a famous name bed when I ran across the reviews on this bed. I purchased it and granted, it's only been used once, but with good results. I filled it several days before company came to make sure it would hold air and it did great. It did soften up a bit and we had to add a little more when they slept on it, but they said it was a good nights sleep. I also love the size. I am 5'9\\" and my son is 6' and I made him lie down on it with me and neither one hung off and had plenty of room. It was easy to deflate and roll up too. I think it was a very good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.. Sent back after one night. Defective","review":"I purchased this item after reading about an hour of reviews. I was excited to use the product on a upcoming camping trip. When the item arrived I inflated the bed according the the instruction book and immediately noticed that the outer chambers inflated approx 4\\" higher then the inner camber. This caused a V shape to the bed. I tried even letting some air out of the outer chamber and adding more to the inner but if you laid to close to the edge you would fall out then. I figured I would try if for the night, that was a mistake. when I woke up about 7 hours later, the bed lost about 2\\" of air and had a back ache from hell. I packed the bed up and had UPS pick up the package 6 hour later. That's my experience. I reorder a different mattress from a different manufacture, have my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supports two 200-lb people","review":"Used it for four nights while we had company. We were quite comfortable and slept well. Didn't feel the mattress move when partner moved (better than our regular mattress in that regard). Slight tendency to tilt toward the center, whether in bed alone or with partner. With partner, the tendency put us closer together. Just a little, not like a dip. The mattress felt firm and supportive whatever our positions.Easy to inflate.Queen sheets fit perfectly.Easy to deflate.Fits in the bag it came with.Definitely happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"sloppy, and it also kind of deform over use, leaks air over hours of laying on it.. not for 2 people... wish it was firmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"Nice bed. I found that it sagged just a little in the centre when more than 1 person in the bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, pump inside is great, but it is not perfect","review":"This air mattress it TALL. If you are used to the standard air mattresses, this will be quite a surprise. The height is about the same as the seating height of a couch. It makes it harder to move around full than a regular air mattress, but it also makes it more comfortable.The built in pump is awesome, EXCEPT that is has a tendency to overheat... This means that about 1/3 of the time we pump up the bed, we have to let it sit mostly filled for 30 minutes while the pump cools off before we can finish inflating it. This is the reason that I cannot give this mattress a five star rating. It is annoying, but you can work around it.You cannot go wrong with this bed. It is not perfect, but it is very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked as advertised","review":"great bed. perfect height. inflated and deflated with ease and speed. we slept very well on it for 2 weeks .

It's comfortable, attractive, and if my 80+ inlaws were happy with it, it must be good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"I bought this bed on August 11 of last year. Today, August 10, 2012, I came home and found a huge bulge in the middle.This is the great curse of air mattresses: the internal baffles detach from the surface, rendering the bed unuseable. I've been sleeping on air mattresses for 15-17 years now, and this has happened with every one. Why can't they figure out how make the baffles stay attached? We just landed a space vehicle on Mars, why can't we make an air mattress that lasts for more than a year or two? I'm giving this product two stars, because it was pretty comfortable, while it lasted. But I think a product like this should last at least four or five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product but great seller (Amazon)","review":"I purchased this air mattress 5 months ago on Amazon. Long story short, a few nights ago my boyfriend and I went to sleep on the inflated bed and woke up on the floor because of a hole in the mattress. No kidding. This \\"premium\\" air-mattress lasted only 5 months. I gave the bed 2 stars because even though I did not like sleeping on it, my boyfriend thought it was comfy and slept on it without problem. If you decide to buy this pretty expensive mattress, don't have high hopes for it in terms of durability and anticipate that if your mattress rips/breaks after Amazon's 30 day policy, you'll be forced to deal with Wenzel and their limited 1 year warranty which depending on how great their customer service is, could have you eating the cost of the mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy inflatable bed","review":"Comes with a built in pump and storage for power cord. Plug it in turn the dials for the upper and lower chambers to inflate and the mattress is ready in about 10 minutes. Held pressure during 3 day visit and was as comfortable as a regular bed - improves a bit after use as the product stretches some initially. Plug in again to deflate, turn both dials to deflate setting and all air is sucked out and ready to fold and store.A bit heavy for travel (24lbs?) but could be checked on a plane in its provided stuff bag. We'll probably keep it at home for guests - I think a pillow top mattress cover would make it perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to leaks","review":"I bought this bed for guests coming over, and it's already spring a leak after 2 times of use.The design is poor because the hard plastic holding the pump controls cuts into the softer elastic material when you fold the bed. This creates tears around the pump controls. I don't know how the designer could not have anticipated this.The patch adhesive that came with the bed doesn't work well, so my guests have now had to endure sleeping on a bed that turns soft in the middle of the night, only having to repump it every morning.The materials used are too fragile for normal use, so stay away from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good confort and fast to inflate","review":"My biggest impression is the speed to inflate and deflate it. In like 5 minutes you can inflate/deflate and enjoy your bed. The noise to inflate is not extremely high, is almost the same of one aspirator.The confort is ok, you can make it more soft or hard, separated of the height. So, basically they have 2 parts, one is the height and other is the \\"cover\\", which is really to cool to customize based on the person/couple.When done, it grips to the ground and do not move.The only downside so far is the sides inflate more than the middle, which is not great for people that like to put the feet out of the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but pricey","review":"Only lasted for about a couple of months before it sprung a leakWe were using if for guests then lent it to a family member who reported it started leaking the second day they had itDon't know the circumstances or reason but for the price, it would have thought it would have been more ruggedThe leak is in the seam so it is nearly impossible to fix"},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased...","review":"purchased this item for out of town company. easy to get set up. very comfortable. would recommend to anyone needing extra bedroom space."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird","review":"Had to return this product simply because of the dual chamber, which I thought would be a positive.

I expected it to be made of a thicker material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little different than expected","review":"I thought the two chambers on this item was a bottom and top chamber. Turns out it is an outside and inside chamber. Still works well. Takes a couple minutes to blow up. The sheets tend to slip because the seam they should grab onto is shallow. I would make this purchase again.We have it topped with 2\\" of foam and a quilted pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No contact from manufacturer for warranty service","review":"I purchased this air bed for a spare bed to be used by guests. Immediately upon trying this air mattress, it was apparent that it wouldn't support two people. It sags terribly with two people regardless of how often you try to inflate it through the night. I thought that maybe the mattress was faulty, but I can get no response from Wenzel for any warranty service. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and simple to use.","review":"Guests who have slept on this bed for as many as five nights say it's very comfortable. Really like that it inflates to the height of a typical bed. Simple to inflate and deflate. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I bought this because of the price and because it's a little thicker than some other models I was considering. Overall the product works very well, although I do advise blowing it up and deflating it once or twice before actually using it to break it in a bit.The pros: Stays inflated, is nice and big and is very comfortable.The cons: The the inflate/deflate motor is a bit confusing at first, but I figured it out. The storage bag is flimsy.Solid purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked from day one","review":"Forget buying this air mattress.

This bed is more comfortable than my bed at home. Filled it up the first night, didnt have to add any air the whole 3 nights. Had to use an inverter to plug it into my car. Bought it thinking I could plug it into my coleman pump, but it is electric. The only dissappointment, was the size. I dont think it is quite a queen size, more like a full size. Otherwise, I would recommend spending the money for a good nights sleep in a tent or anywhere.

How clever to design an outer chamber and an inner chamber.My sister and brother in law found it so comfortable that they are considering buying one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, poor quality","review":"I received the bed via express shipping for a $60.00 charge. When it arrived, I immediately set it up. It was great for the first night. By the second night, it had begun losing some air from the inner bladder, not too bad though. The air loss increased throughout the following week so that I was reinflating the mattress several times during the night. I was hoping this airbed, due to its dual bladder design, would last a while, but it did not. I have yet to find one that has any lasting power. I will not purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"air bed","review":"It was a beautiful and comfortable bed but would not hold the air.

However in less than a month I found it losing air in the night and it was annoying to use the noisy pump a couple of times at night. I have used other cheaper air mattresses in the past and they lasted longer than this higher-priced piece. I expected better.I called the customer service to exercise my warranty and they said they would forward me documents towards the same. I still haven't received anything. I am not happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective...","review":"We enjoyed this bed for about 5 days, found it very comfortable and easy to inflate. However, one day, we walked in to find that it was pregnant. That's right, there was a huge bump in the middle of it, and nothing we did could get rid of it. An inner chamber must have burst or something. We never moved it, etc, so believe that it was something faulty with the bed itself. Just glad this happened in time to get a refund. Also have to note that some family members got the same bed around the same time and had to send theirs back because it was saggy in the middle - we did not have this problem with ours, but because we both had defective beds, we decided not to replace it and just get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible *Stay Away*","review":"We bought this mattress only looking at the positive reviews.

It actually made me sick. We placed it outside with box open so it could \\"air out\\" overnight, but it is still just as strong and horrible. We are extremely disappointed and can't get it to fit into the original box to even return it for our refund. Why can't anything be made in US now?

We have relatives visit throughout the year, after all this is Maine :-). Anyway, the first lasted about 4 months before it tore around a seam and the in-laws headed for the floor. The company that makes these replaced this with a much smaller and cheaper model. We figured the first was a fluke so we ordered this one as it is much larger and seemingly better then the one they sent us. So imagine my surprise when just 4 months later, once again, the thing tears in the exact same place as the first, this time my elderly Aunt headed for the floor screaming in the night!I thought Amazon would make this right, the reason i bought it here to begin, but they tell me I have to deal with the manufacturer again.

The first two times the bed was used, it worked perfectly. The third time it was used (which was within the first month of purchase) it lost so much air that my guest had to refill it at least twice during the night.

Almost too big for the space I had. I wish I had gotten 2 twins since I don't always need a queen size bed. It was very comfortable although I would suggest a blanket or some other cover on top (it does comes with a \\"velveteen\\" top not just plastic)- in a cool house at night the \\"air\\" wasn't very warm. It stayed inflated with just an occasional re-inflation until the 5th day. I don't know if it developed a puncture in the outside area around the edge or what but it wouldn't stay inflated for more than a couple hours (only in this area, the rest of the bed and center was fine).

I was prepared to see some stretching so filling it the first several nights was not unexpected. I guess I got carried away though, and it looks like it is now a king size bed. When we use it again, I plan to get king sheets with deep pockets I'm pretty sure that will solve the problem. I will also use either a memory foam topper or a couple of quilts to soften up the surface.

Took it on our trip, set it up and everything seemed to be fine until my husband and I went to bed. We were constantly fighting to stay in the bed because there was a huge bump/mound in the middle which kept making us roll off either side of the bed. I just couldn't see paying the obscene amount of money AeroBed wants, but maybe that's why they are so expensive. However, paying close to eighty bucks for this one is pretty obscene since I have no idea who could sleep on it. We tried increasing the air, decreasing the air and nothing worked. Really wish I could take this money and apply it toward an AeroBed. Back to our little camping air mattress that we have to keep pumping air in, but at least we can stay ON the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen for One","review":"The bed is supposed to be a Queen size, however with the raised sides you gravitate to the middle, making sleeping for 2 people uncomfortable. You are basically getting a Twin but with a Queen size footprint. The bed is going back and I'll have to spend the money on an Aero bed which actually gives you a full Queen size sleeping area. The reason I give it a 2 star rating was it is actually pretty comfortable for a singe person, but way too large to really use as a single."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were Deflated","review":"We ordered this air mattress for some guests arriving that weekend.

I ignored the bad reviews of deflation because of the overwhelming amount of good reviews. I've been using this mattress for 7 days before I can go back to my hometown to get my ACTUAL bed and low a behold, I come home to a massive LEAK and HOLE in the SEAM!!! This product is seriously defective!! A hole in the seam! Come on! You spend $100 thinking you'll get something that will last, and it should!! Seriously please don't buy this product. Just imagine having to get up every 3 hours to reinflate it because you wake up with your butt on the ground. There is definitely a better, probably cheaper mattress out there that actually holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sags in the middle","review":"Using the bed for a second time and now it loses air in the inner chamber so you sink in the middle of the bed. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 5 months","review":"Single user (mostly), 240lbs. Received mattress in late January 2011, inflated and began using in February. On 25 June a \\"blister\\" (a large bubble) developed on the top, about 16 inches from the foot of the bed. It is in the center, 3 feet across (width of bed), 21 inches long and 5 inches high. It is getting larger as I was able to continue using the bed until this morning - 4am. Was able to keep using the bed because initially the small bubble corrected the trough that had developed in the bed.Bed was inflated to a moderate firmness and did not leak. Once I had the desired firmness set by the end of February, never had to add air.Note: If you return the mattress under the warranty, you pay for shipping.The $20 Ozark Trails mattress I got from WalMart was still working after 6 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Alright","review":"The bed wasn't that comfortable especially for two people.

Not a happy camper. My wife and I tried to sleep on it. Both of us keep rolling to the center and it looses air each night. I think I would have better off buying two twin beds and pushing them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold air","review":"Purchased one and it was immediately defective, would not hold air. I was able to exchange and get a new one, but that did not help my guest at the time. Replacement seemed ok at first. Read the reviews about stretching and needing a refill - my experience is ths this is much worse than stretched fabric. One small adult was almost on the ground every morning. Two people can't sleep on it or they roll into the middle together, until the air is gone, anyway. I plan to try a different brand or get a futon because it's embarrassing to have my guests go through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original and replacement both leaked","review":"The air mattress wouldn't hold air after the first two nights when this was being used by my (skinny) friend. The company replaced the air mattress -- customer service was great. However, the replacement slowly leaked the first few nights. Just got it out of the closet and tried to use it again, and the leak is terrible. It loses a third of its air during the day (when no one is on it) and loses half the air when someone sleeps on it. Airing it back up in the middle of the night is not an option, as it's very noisy. I'm going to try to get my money back rather than have a third replacement. This thing is heavy and not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I read the reviews and bought this one. It's horrible. There are two air intake pump knobs leading me to think there are two air air chambers independent of one another. I am only 5 foot tall and light.

I really thought this as going to be the one after reading the great reviews seen here. :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable!","review":"I purchased this bed based on the reviews I read.

I have had two different air mattresses in the past: An Aerobed purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond and an unknown brand purchased at BJ's Warehouse. Both mattresses developed tiny leaks after one or two uses and, despite diligently repairing every leak, a new one quickly developed. After reading the reviews of this brand, I decided to give it a try. So far, no leaks, my husband and I slept comfortably through the night, and it was simple to inflate and deflate. After almost a year of occasional use (probably used six times in eight months), I can confidently declare this one to be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"I purchased this Wenzel bed, the reviews I read were all very good, Well I filled it with air and it performed very well. I understood that the material would stretch and I continued adding air every night to take up the stretching. After a month of keeping it filled, it still goes down every day. I have tried to check for leaks with a spray bottle of soap and water and cannot find any place it is leaking.The bed also fills more on one side of the bed, so one person rolls to the other side of the bed and you have a very hard time getting out of bed. It is a very comfortable bed when it is full of air but it will not stay full for the night and always fills more on the same side. The middle sinks in and the Girl friend is not happy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good night sleep","review":"Purchased two Wenzel's so we could sleep comfortable while updating a rental home. It's been over a month and were sleeping good. Set up was simple and we add air about once a week. We like being off the ground (22inches). Only problem is when two sleep in one bed you sink to the center. A tip online was to put blankets in the middle to build it up and put your sheet over the blankets. It works ok but not great. Overall I like the Wenzel and the price enough that I will purchase one more for quest that want to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"My husband and I felt this air mattress was not comfortable for 2 people as we both ended up rolling to the middle of the mattress.

We slept on it for three days straight in one house and another two days in the new house. It's very comfy, doesn't have the \\"center roll\\" issue that most inflatable mattresses have, and the auto-fill pump sits at your head so that even if you're half asleep and need to add a little air, you just reach over your pillow, flip a switch, and wait a few seconds. Done. From flat to full? Maybe 3 minutes, tops. Even though this is a queen size mattress, you will need a king size fitted sheet. Queen size is fine for all other linens.

Filled it again, and 6 hours later is was a third deflated again. Totally useless. I saw the overall 4 out of 5 star rating and figured it had to be good, but my experience reads like all of the 1 star reviews. Won't hold air. No obvious leaking points.

The height makes getting on and off far more convenient than the flatter air beds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money, but not perfect","review":"Ok, so first let me say that I am totally satisfied with this bed. I needed a bed for temporary living conditions. This bed can inflate and deflate quickly. It inflates pretty firmly. I do not notice significant leaking, but I usually re-inflate it about once a week. The only complaint is that the most comfortable area to sleep is the very middle. If you're sleeping by yourself you'll be fine, but if you share it with someone else... I hope you've been acquainted.Overall, this bed is a great substitute to a spring-mattress for someone who may need to pack up and move often, but not quite as comfortable as a regular bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for two.","review":"We received our Insta-Bed today and will be returning it promptly. The 'sure grip bottom' is acctually a void of 2-3 inches deep within the perimeter of the bottom side. When you lie on the bed, it creates a suction if it's on a solid surface like a hardwood floor. Also, the top has a raised edge around the perimeter. Both of these factors result in the feeling that you're sleeping on a slant, unless you are alone in the middle. The bed might be okay for one person who didn't mind sleeping in a valley. No good for two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pump works quickly and sheets fit perfectly!","review":"This is a terrific inflatable bed.

After reading reviews, it sounded like a great air bed for an attractive price. It had a little bit of a plastic smell after opening and inflating, but that disappeared after one day. I had it blown up for about 3-4 days the first time (without using it) and it kept air pressure great. When my parents came to visit they slept on it for 5 nights in a row. The first night they mentioned they were sinking toward the middle a little bit. After letting some of the air out of the outer chamber, they found the perfect setting. It held air great, and is very comfortable. Unlike my older eddie bauer air bed, which I would pump up as much as I could, and would be half on the ground by the morning. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"My experience with air beds to date has been that they only last a year or two before developing leaks. I'm hoping this bed will be different but it's to early to comment on that yet. So far the bed is everything it claims to be, hence the good rating I've given it. I only use an air bed intermittently, when we have more guests than beds, like at Xmas or for a big party.

She said she didn't feel it losing air, but every morning she woke up, the mattress had lost nearly half of its air.We continued to inflate it to its maximum level, and never discovered any leaks...we were ultimately discouraged and had to send it back.

I only ever kept it inflated when in use and I then I would directly put it away the next morning. It was never even around a pet or anything that could have scratched it, so I'm just not sure why it stopped working.

No matter how much air you put into the bed, in a few hours you sink into the middle. We have all tried sleeping on it. We are not in the least heavy people, and my 18 year old is quite thin. Down we go into the middle, sinking like a rock. This is not going to be fun when we go to visit. I am very disappointed with this product. I wish I had bought a cheaper queen size version of the twin Simmons I have.

It lost some air each night but I would simply turn the \\"inflate\\" knob(s) for a few minutes and it was back up.

No air going in, so I turn it to deflateMode and same noise happens and no air is being sucked out. I'm really disappointed that this air mattress failed me. I needed one by this week so I guess I will be sleeping on the floor now. Another thing is I don't know how this product is a Wenzel? It does not say anything about that brand on the box, on the mattress, or even on the pump? It just says I insta-bed all over it. I am going to try exchanging this product to give them another shot.

I slept on this bed while waiting for my furniture to arrive in my new home, a couple of weeks. Eventually, I started waking up on the floor, in a big hollow in the middle of the bed. I found the hole, a separation in a seam. I tried to patch it using the patches they provided (following the directions) but they couldn't hold back the force of the escaping air. I called the company, who are very helpful and nice. They forced me to destroy the bed -- cutting out the logo and sending them a photograph -- and then sent me a new one. They told me to \\"recycle\\" the old one. I called my town's recycling center and they don't take airbeds made out of PVC plastic, so I ended up throwing this out and now it's in a landfill *foreverI!!! They sent me a new one, which I don't want to use. I don't want to dump another airbed in a landfill. A real dilemma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Wenzel!","review":"I just received my package. I purchased it directly from amazon, not another seller and it wasn't a Wenzel. It was a generic brand. I have seen this complaint in a few other reviews.

If not, use it as a tarp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deflate properly","review":"The item inflates and works fine.However, the only way to deflate it is to use the pump and the suction pulls the plastic against the pump. We had to physically pull the plastic and attempt to hold it away from the pump while it was deflating. This took 10-15 minutes and did not ever get all of the air out. I'm not sure why they don't just have a quick release valve that can deflate the mattress like previous Aerobeds that we've owned.The item was returned to Amazon due to this terrible design flaw. I don't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"This bed lost air way too often. Received a replacement and had the same problem.

If two people, it is far worse. The only alternative is to add air during the night. I wouldn't want to wake up realizing I need to find the control and add air. It would be loud, and would further wake you up.Even fully inflated, I wouldn't confuse this with a real bed. It is a single( for the mattress) bladder and feels like it. Hard or under inflated. I have water floate s wih 6 bladders and they work well, why not that kind of control here?Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb air bed","review":"While I can't yet formulate a review on longevity or durability (haven't used it enough yet) I can say that this air bed is awesome. It's tall and gets you off the floor. It's stable. It's comfortable. It's extremely easy to setup and take down with the built in air pump. It actually folds up easier than expected and it fits in a convenient carry bag - was not hard to stuff back in after use. I am amazed how this bed functioned right out of the box. My primary purpose is for overflow bedding with a house full of guests. No complaints from the guests. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Complain","review":"My husband and I really needed an air mattress that would last at least a month with daily use (in the middle to moving to Germany). I have lower back and hip problems and I can say that I can sleep soundly on it. The built in pump is great. We have to fill it up a little every day before we use it and it makes small popping sounds when getting off of it; but other than that it is great. We have been using it for about two weeks and have not had any leaks! It looks like it will go the distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed it the first few uses, but then a bubble formed","review":"I love the height of this airbed and the fact it has an inflatable pump. However, after a few uses a bubble formed on the top of the air mattress. It doesn't leak, and it didn't pop. But I suppose one of the internal components that keep the top of the bed flat busted, which causes a huge bubble to form on the top. Unfortunately it has been more than a year since we purchased it and it doesn't fall under warranty. Probably a fluke, but bad experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"saralex","review":"Very disappointed with this mattress. The sheets have no where to grip around thesides and end up bunching up. On the top of the mattress, there is a 7\\" band aroundthe edge and this is higher than the rest of the top. This makes it seem like you sink in the center. Much better beds on market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well","review":"Bought this for the visiting inlaws to use and after the first night my Father-in-law was almost sleeping on the floor due to air loss. Tried again day 2 hoping this would have improved after stretching out and while it was a bit better product still lost a large amount of air leaving this product sagging deeply and almost looking like a taco with a person in the middle. Tried it out one last time filling it with air and having no one on it. After a few hours of letting it rest the air loss was still pretty major so I printed out a return slip from Amazon and will send this back tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy..","review":"This was a great buy. Its way cheaper than an Aerobed and more comfortable. It takes a good five minutes to inflate and the same to deflate, but, its worth it for the value and comfort--of which there is lots. ;) Def recommend for folks looking for a guest bed! One thing: its kind of heavy and doesn't squish down that small...but, I am over it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value, and a comfortable airbed","review":"It's a pretty good bed, one of the best in its price range. The only complaint would be that it's a little harder to get all the air out (due to the location of the built-in pump). But otherwise, it's working great so far, and keeps its air for several days. It may need a little top-up from time to time if slept on by 2 people (or one larger person)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Air Bed, I recommend it!","review":"This is an excellent bed. It inflates to a more firm support level than the other two airbeds I have owned in the past. It keeps its air for over a week without adding more. Very comfortable, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable but loses air","review":"I bought this to have a bed to sleep on for when my first grandchild arrives. It was easy to inflate and deflate. It was comfortable. I added air after it sat for a couple of hours. By morning, it had definitely lost more air. I don't know if it's the ambient air temperature (air contracts as it chills) or just the nature of air beds. For the price and what I bought it for, it does an adequate job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"We bought this as a quick \\"spare\\" bed and it was fine - no complaint from the guests, but I haven't tried it myself. But I did have to wonder about the \\"sure grip bottom.\\" I didn't notice anything that kept this from sliding about on the floor. But...it did the trick for our guests so I'm happy for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"High, tall, queen-sized, non-slidey but losses a little air overnight","review":"This is probably one of the best air mattresses out there. I choose it after seeing that it had the best on-line reviews.Once you fill it up using the built in pump, it's firm and solid. It feels like a regular bed, not like an air mattresses. The top has a fine, non-slip fabric that's quite comfortable, and when you put a sheet on it, it's just like a regular bed. And I guess the fact that it's tall makes it vaguely more comfortable.My only complaint is that overnight it loses air, and becomes much less comfortable, sort of saggy. In fact, once in a while -- like once a month -- I awoke with a crook in my neck as a result. That being said, we have two adults (probably 300lbs total) and it's 80-82 here at night.The great thing about it is that it saves so much space since you get your guestroom back when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The built in pump would cease working while filling and when releasing air, but worse was the fact that the bed sunk in towards the middle - regardless of how much air was inserted. To stay on either side of the bed, you'd have to hang on to the side. I returned this bed the very next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product malfunction after 6 months","review":"I purchased this product in March of 2012 and at first the product worked great, comfortable, easy to inflate/deflate, and easy to store. After 6 months of use the outer pool suddenly failed to retain air. The leak was slow, but the mattress would only be useable for a period of 4-6 hours for one person and less than 3 hours for two people. The worst thing about the malfunction is it was not just a simple hole that was able to be patched. Rather it was an outer pump issue or something else internally focused that could not be manually fixed. Since this was outside of the 30-day return policy I was forced to eat my initial cost without any recourse."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I was skeptical when I bought because I thought it would not be great to use it or not very comfortable. I was wrong. The queen bed is a good size for an air mattress, the plastic is very thick and the electric air pump makes things very easy. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOUGHT 2, BOTH LEAKED!","review":"This air bed, out of the box, was the best one that I had bought so far. It was comfortable, felt as close to a real bed as you can get, and the built in 2-way pump is awesome. However, the first bed I bought leaked after 1 night of use. I contacted Amazon and, to their credit, they replaced it even though the return period had expired. The second bed arrived and performed in the same manner. It held up for 1 night and then started leaking again. I don't believe we abused the bed or misused it in any way. There was no kids jumping on it, and my wife and I only combine for about 330 pounds. I am going to attempt to get a refund for this 2nd bed, but I don't have very high hopes. For spending $100 on this air mattress we are very disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 7 days, I awoke on the floor!","review":"This air mattress worked great, for the first night. I was only using this until my bedroom set was delivered. Fourteen days was my max time. But it only lasted 7 days. The first night was great, but the second night I could feel a change, when I layed down the mattress caved in. The instructions that I received stated it could hold up to 450 lbs. I'm 124 lbs. I really hated this mattress. On the 7th night I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was on the floor, literally. So instead of returning it to Amazon, I decided to call customer service for the company that manufactures this air mattress. They were very helpful, I told them what happened. After completing some paperwork I received a new upgraded mattress. Although by the time I received it, my bedroom set had already been delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice raised air mattress","review":"I was originally going to get a queen-size Aerobed (Guest Choice), since I'd had good experiences with the twin-size that I borrowed from a friend. At a certain point, I got it into my head that having something raised might be good, since I can't predict who might be using this thing, and it *is* sort of pain to roll out of the Aerobed, which is pretty close to the ground. I figured for an extra $20 I'd give this Wenzel a shot (it gets good marks on other consumer sites). Totally worth it. It might not inflate as quickly, but it is a much nicer bed, easier to get into/out of, with a clingy surface to keep the sheets on. It also felt a bit firmer when fully inflated than the Aero (which admittedly was more used), which is a plus in our household.My only complaint is that you need to keep it plugged in and switched to \\"deflate\\" while rolling it up for storage, as it doesn't have a release valve (at least that I saw)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I ordered the wenzel inflatable bed a couple months ago and as stated, it did stretch a bit and I had to inflate it just a small amount. I sleep on it for a week at a time and thus far it has held up great without any issues. every couple weeks I plug in the pump and give it a short boost to bring back the firmness. No complaints or problems. The pump is a bit loud but works just fine inflating or deflating the mattress. Also, I'd recommend getting a mattress pad / cover as the bed can feel colder than a regular mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insta-Bed was an Insta-Hit!","review":"My mother-in-law recently injured her leg and couldn't walk up my stairs to the guest room so I decided to buy the Insta-Bed for her to use instead. The bed was very comfortable and the perfect height for her. It stayed inflated for the entire weekend which we were really happy about as well. The only negative (and it's not a big complaint) is that is takes a long time to deflate completely. I would definitely recommend this bed -- I, for one, am a happy customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Higher than other air beds, more like a real bed, happy with this choice","review":"When my daughter said she wanted to replace her college room aerobed with a bigger one, I thought she was finally ready to accept a real bed. No, it just turned out she wanted an air-bed that was taller like a real bed, so that she could sit on it like furniture.This one has worked out very well for her. She likes having an inflatable bed because it makes moving easier. This one is high enough to sit on comfortably. Also the aerobed was actually slightly smaller in all dimensions, so this one is a better fit for her sheets.The cons: The top was a bit plastic hard, so for comfort she got a soft puffy mattress pad. It is hard to get deep pocket sheets to fit on it tightly because there is nowhere for the sheets to actually tuck under, and the ridge for the sheet elastic is too high for deep pocket sheets. Finally she has to top it off with air every few days.In spite of the cons, the height of this one makes it a winner for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"less expensive than aerobeds, and pretty much does what i expected it to do. i like the height, which is closer to a regular bed's height than any other air bed. i've found that it needs to be \\"topped off\\" nightly, but that's no big deal since it's just a turn of the knob. it also has a tendency to expand horizontally, so make sure your room has plenty of space. otherwise, my guests have said it's a good, comfy bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"George the Saint Bernard","review":"Ok so I'm biased. I was on the set of George in Grindelwald, Switz. in the early 70's and got to meet Marshall Thompson(Daktari), George and Inge Schoener who were all wonderful.

Then the whole thing was put on the original mini lathe stand which was about half the total length of the new lathe. I centered the stand a bit to prevent the new lathe from tipping over.

I called the local stores (Woodcraft, and Rockler) and it seems to be a manufactures issue (they have back orders as well).

I had to go out and buy a grinder bit ($26) to ream out the holes so that the extension would sit flush. If I could go back, I would buy a different brand of lathe just because there is no excuse for such sloppy manufacturing. That was a 50% increase in the cost of the bed extension.The tech support told me to just grind it out, instead of just sending me a new one. Perhaps they should either make them right, or over drill the holes in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly increases capacity.","review":"Extension makes the Mini Jet a much more capable tool.

The story begins after the war, rationing is a problem, and a girl recieves a gift from America- a party dress and shoes!

This book just drags on with endless descriptions of rehearsals. This one was just not worth the tiome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Streatfield's Best","review":"If you love all of the other \\"Shoe\\" books, then, for completeness, this may be worth reading. It's targeted to girls around age 9-12. I'd recommend pretty much any of the other ones over this one, though. Get Ballet Shoes, then Dancing Shoes, perhaps Theater Shoes and Travelling Shoes and even Tennis Shoes first. This one is very dated and if you don't know a fair amount about World War II England, may not make much sense.

Shallow characters, empty lives.

This is the book that put McInerney on the map, and it serves as the blueprint for a certain brand of contemporary fiction. Without this book there would be no Brett Easton Ellis, Jonathan Ames, or David Foster Wallace. Still entertaining after 15 years, it's important because it changed modern fiction. McInerney may not write sprawling epics like John Irving, but it doesn't make him any less important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"\\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is notable only for its second-person narrative, a device that would have been interesting in the hands of a more skilled author; with McInerney, however, it comes off as little more than a cute trick. This book somehow manages the feat of reflecting the shallowness of 80s yuppie culture without offering a single perceptive observation about it. Indeed, this may be the only book ever written specifically for shallow yuppies who have never read a book and will never read another one. The main character's \\"rebirth\\" at the end is trite beyond belief. (He walks past a bakery and smells bread. It smells \\"wholesome,\\" so he trades in a yuppie status symbol for a loaf and eats it, thus saving his soul. Get it?) The great modern American novel about a young man at war with himself in the Big City remains \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" This book isn't a tenth of Salinger's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Immature New York turd facing life issues before Ellis decides to turn him into a national psycho.

It moves along so quickly, and although it was written the year after I was born, I still feel like it does the best job of capturing a lot of the ideas and feelings of the current generation. The feeling of not knowing what you want, of not knowing what it is you're supposed to do with your life. Although, I have to admit that the ending is a bit weak, everything leading up to that is superb. The way the narrator (a 2nd person YOU) is constantly doing battle with what he wants to do and what his friends want him to do and what he needs to do. Overall, it's a great short novel, and I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the New Yorker","review":"Bright Lights, Big City is a great book.

And not very well-written, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"This is an iconic American novel? Seriously? In that case, fans of this book must be used to reading mediocre crap. \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is about depressed, shallow, pathetic yuppies embracing drugs and sex in New York City during the 1980s. The second person narrative is interesting, and the author does a good job of portraying the unnamed narrator's sense of desperation and hopelessness. However, that's all that the book really delivers. There's nothing groundbreaking here, and there's nothing likable about any of the characters in the book. The ending is very cliche, and for the life of me I just do not understand why so many people rave about this stupid book! It is no \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" that's for sure.

This is the post hippie generation coming of age!And as with every generation, values and mores are part of the culture. This story tells of the trails and tribulations of an individual faced with tragedy, the difficulty in dealing with it, and the self questioning it imposes after it is discovered there is no where to run and hide. Like many stories before it, the self-discovery provides a ray of light, and a day of hope!A good quick read told by McInerney that captures both the pulse of its time, and age old internal strife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not excess, LOVE","review":"This book is for me, nothing more than a young man dealing with the end of his relationship, confused about the circumstances surrounding that end, trying to find a way to cope. The fact that it takes place during the 80's has no real bearing. He does coke and drinks vodka simply because he needs something to dull the pain of this breakup, and since it is the 80's, these were the drugs of choice. If this book took place now, he might take ecstacy and go to a rave as a way to cope with his confusion. I don't see why people are so obsessed with talking about the historical setting, or the second person narrative, or the book being compared to Catcher in the Rye. It's about a man dealing with the end of his marriage. If you've ever been dumped for seemingly no reason, READ THIS BOOK. You'll feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"so entertaining!","review":"I found this book to be so entertaining. I love how the author used a second person narrative.

Bight lights, big city, however, is by far the best novel to come from this period. High Points: Excellent, unprecidented use of 2nd person narrative; witty, satiric, paraodic, and humanistic at heart; very accesible, nothing too over the top, and it avoids pointless refernces to the flat pop-culture of the 80's. I actually have no complaints about this book, but then I don't think many people are going to be talking much about it hereafter. It is more of an entertaining artifact of the 80's than a great work of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, not funny.","review":"I found this book to be frustrating and sad. At first, I thought the unnamed main character was your typical yuppie who is caught up in Manhattan's fast paced, drug induced night life because that is what young, unattached adults do. But then you find out all the bad things that have happened in his life. The drug induced night life made more sense. It was his way of coping with his loses. I thought the writing was clever. Maybe too clever. Some reader's found humor in it. There were some witty parts. \\"Tad's mission in life is to have more fun than anyone else in New York City, and this involves a lot of moving around, since there is always the likelihood that where you aren't is more fun than where you are.\\" I wouldn't classify this book as \\"funny\\" however.

Set in the 1950's, the movie is made to nauseate. From the ultra-squeaky dubbed female voices, to the horrid caricature of a Jewish mother, to the subplots about fish and ice in a bathtub, and a fixation about stewed prunes, this really is the Yiddish \\"Porky's,\\" and that's terribly unfortunate.The film is like a sharp poke in the eye: the script, acting, and especially music are ultimately annoying. The level of humor is extremely juvenile (throwing eggs at a budding violinist, loads of sexual innuendo, etc.), and seeks to prove, among other things, that stalking is fun.The actress playing the female lead, Tammy (Yvonne Michaels), is modestly talented and pretty, all other participants are homely hacks.

The book covers all aspects of rabbit care from getting a rabbit, to housing, feeding, training, behavior problems, illness, and death. The format is easy to read and specific information is easy to find. The Appendix offers some great resources on education, activities, rescues, publications, shopping, and registries. The book brings together both ARBA and the House Rabbit Society. It knocks neither and presents both sides; so its a safe pick-up for a believer of either spectrum. I recommend it in addition to \\"Rabbit Health in the 21st Century\\" by Kathy Smith as the only two books a beginner needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic book","review":"I've fostered rabbits for the local SPCA, and this book definitely helped me understand rabbits and their behavior.

Don't get me wrong I like dramas just as much as I do actions or comedys or lovestories, but this wasn't even a drama!

The acting wasn't very good; Mark Easterbrook and Kate Mercer were supposed to be \\"dating\\" yet there was no passion between them. Also Mark was under suspicion for murder and he was extremely cool and calm. The plot was hard to follow and slow. The inspector's sidekick was trying to help Mark prove his innocence even though the inspector was set on Mark being guilty. Also it isn't very suspense filled or mysterious for being a mystery, I figured out who was doing the murders 30 minutes into the movie. Also for an A&E movie it looked like the cameraman was drunk. And the film was 20 years old.

This was one of the first ones released. It definately shows that Wishbone Ash moved into the 80's and away from the progressive 70's. These guys are talented musicians and this album definately shows that. The only hang-up is that Wishbone Ash also had some decent vocals and they are not on this album. That was what really made this band stand out. The dual guitar attack is also limited. It has a very 80's, high-tech sound.

There is little in this album that will please the avid Wishbone Ash fan. One aspect even turned me off. The drumming on 'From Soho to Sunset' sounded very similar to Stewart Copeland's (The Police) drumming. No surprise because the album was produced by Stewart's brother Miles Copeland.

I do not, but if you do, The Time Bike is the book for you. The book is about a boy named, Eddy, who gets a mysterious bike. He doesn't know what kind of bike it is until he sees a clock on it. When he figures that it is a time bike, he uses it many times. I gave this book two stars because I liked some of the adventures that Eddy went on, but not all of them. For example, on one of them, Eddy went back in time to learn about Henry David Thoreau. One of the adventures that I liked was when Elenor (Eddy's sister) had a turn on the bike. I wish that I could go to some of the places they went. I was disappointed that I didn't learn about Mr. Thoreau when Eddy went back in time. I recommend this book to an eleven or twelve year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!","review":"This was the first novel of Ms. O'Connor's I read. I had read her short stories and loved them. Let me say this; I finished reading this book and IMMEDIATELY flipped to the beginning and read it again. It is AMAZING. So dark and true and humorous and everything good literature should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Wins in the End","review":"Wow. Reading O'Connor is like taking a punch in the gut, but what a punch. WISE BLOOD is an uncomprising tale where you get the impression that not one single word is misplaced, that the story states exactly what O'Connor wanted to say. Admittedly, it takes a while to get the mote out of one's eye to see what she is doing, but it is a journey well worth taking for she lays waste to the secular world and its esteemed treasures. Consequently, what is seen is inferior to what is not seen.Motes' redemption comes when he realizes this is the only truth.Jesus does win in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current Favourite Novel","review":"I'm a huge fan of Flannery O'Connor so when someone asked me to name my favourite novel I picked a little bit-of-a-book and said \\"Wise Blood\\".Partly because the characters are, if not wholly understood, at least wholly familiar. Despite growing up around an assortment of Evangelicals and Foundation types I managed for the most part to maintain a pretty superficial view of them. Things like snake handling and female oppression were odd but ordinary and because of this ordinary I never spent too much time thinking about the misguided spirituality that a lot of it sat upon. Through a glass darkly, and all that.Mostly, I'm moved to recommend Wise Blood again and again because it's such a brilliantly layered and grotesque comedy with powerful and appealing themes of integrity, the disaffected young and redemption. It's just one of those books you never really walk away from. Not really.And that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise blood \\"A must read\\"","review":"Wise blood explores the depth of a man who wants to fix his live, but along the way comes in to strange people. Keeps you in the story all the way in. A must read in high school.Great for essays, reports , etc. I created one of my best essays from this book, and trust me i did alot. Anyways a very gruesome and extremely detailed book with great sense of humor at parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met Expectations","review":"I am very happy with this purchase. It arrived 4 days sooner than it was supposed to. The book is in the exact condition as it was described. I'm pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your blood run cold with the wise satire of O'Connor","review":"O'Connor is one of my favorite authors and this novel is one of my favorite novels. O'Connor is simply brilliant; her stories are satirical portraits of a secular society that has blinded men and women from the truth and distanced them from God. O'Connor is known for her caustic tone, and this novel is no exception. Be prepared to laugh at the protagonist and to be shocked by his final action. Don't be quick to judge O'Connor's intentions and opinions. She's a tricky woman to understand, and I certainly do not pretend to understand her, but the more of her you read, the better you'll grasp her notions of faith, grace, country folk, and secularism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World for Our Prison Framed","review":"This first novel by Flannery O'Connor gives a dramatic, vivid etc picture of a young man entering strange territory. The author's vision of our society is violent, but not bleak. The novel is a Greek tragedy with a hilarious streak. All about entrapment, compulsion and religious obsession. It is impossible to remain exactly the same reader afterwards. It is not a really great novel, \\"perhaps\\", but one that you will savour with a particular fondness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wise Blood is JUST AWFUL !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I took this book with me on vacation to TOPSAIL ISLAND and after reading it I left it there. I've got a degree in English Literature and truly enjoy Flannery O'Connors stories BUT this was a mess! I kept hoping it would get better but it never did and maybe it is too deep for me to understand but being from the South I would think that some of it would have made sense. I wish O'Connor were still alive so she could explain this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Shall Wisdom be Found?","review":"\\"Stupid Minds\\" would be an equally tendentious but more accurate title. Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania. We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic. Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.Faulkner plumbed the humanity beneath the grotesque. Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge. Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar. If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, a suicide bomber would be wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SYMBOLIC VENTURE","review":"Wise Blood has got to be the most ridiculous \\"novel\\" I have ever attempted to read. It's like some idiot sat down and thought Hmmm How can I write a book? I know, I'll think of the stupidest thing that comes to mind and write that.I have witnessed first hand that many literary critics,\\"experts\\" bla bla bla, in reality have sticky wet brown stuff for brains.One of those kind that taste 20 year old cheese and just because it cost $300 \\"Oh that is delicious\\". It seems like just because writers use symbolism,metaphors and hidden meanings that makes it a work of art or something. Well, a horses rear can be symbolic also."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't sleep with this...","review":"I assumed that for $15, plus shipping, that this would be a very nice mask. It turned out to be extremely uncomfortable though. The mask itself is black pastic (which is fine), but it has foam around the outside that is cut for a person with a very small head - it never felt quite right since the foam would be really close to my eyes. In order to keep it tight enough to keep it on correctly it would crush my nose so that I couldnt breathe. The strap is made out of velcro, which always rubbed/scratched my ears. I havent been able to fall asleep with this mask on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"The mask consists of a heavy cheap piece of black plastic upon which ovals of foam rubber have been added to cover but not touch the eyes. How can they charge $15 !!!! Probably works reasonably well if you're leaning back on an aircraft, but if you turn your head slightly while lying in bed, the large plastic edge begins to push the mask away from your eyes. I next bought the large blue sleepmaster mask and very highly recommend it for larger face coverage than the standard masks and its softness + no elastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"as expected","review":"When I received my mask and saw it for the first time, I thought that it would fall apart after a few uses. I was wrong ! I have had it for over a year and a half and it's in as good a shape as the day it came. I also sleep on my side, and it takes a bit of adjustment , then it works fine. I use it on a daily basis, and I am very pleased with it. And I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants a good DARK sleep environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED!!!!!!","review":"If I were to give an honest appraisal of this item,I would would say it had a value of about five dallars!!! (at most)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blocks the light, but NOT very comfortable !","review":"This mask totally blocks the light, this is the good thing. The bad thing is that it's made of plastic at the top so it's not comfortable to sleep while wearing it. it might be useful for a nap in a car or a plane, as long as you are sitting still."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this mask","review":"This is a great product. I am buying my third one. I do wish they lasted longer, but this mask blocks all the light and is very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Sleep Mask","review":"I have worn these masks for years. It not only keeps light out but keeps air out of my eyes. Through the years they've made them a little smaller so you are not pushing against the side of the plastic on your pillow and causing them to move. I am a side sleeper for the most part. I've awakened to broad daylight with sun streaming in and was completely surprised. It would be good if they made them in 3 sizes or at least two. I think you have to get used to them and be sure they are centered and the velcro strap is at just the right pressure to keep the mask on without pressing against your eyes. I adjust them from time to time as they loosen.I rarely sleep without them and use them on planes all the time. They were recommended by a friend of mine a long time ago who uses them for the entire family for travel on planes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic with Foam Cutout","review":"This is just a piece of plastic with a piece of foam glued to it. The foam has cutouts for the eyes, so you'll get good blackout when using it. Ergonomics are poor, and it oozes cheapness. So, practical and useful, but not very nice looking. I keep it in an end table drawer for occasional use in the living room on the sofa."},{"rating":"1","title":"MINDFOLD","review":"Glad I didn't pay the full price of around $20 from the Mindfold website. I paid $12 w/free shipping on Amazon but still think that is a bit much. I Love the concept of opening your eyes in total darkness but this product is pretty cheap. I agree with one review stating that they could've went to a crafts store and made their own. Other than being overpriced, the only issue I have is that the strap is uncomfortable around the ears. Definately not for sleeping(unless you're on your back all night) but good for meditation.NOTE: Depending on the size of your nose some light may still seep through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy...looks like a child's craft project","review":"I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of this mask. It's basically a cutout of flexible black plastic backed by a foam cutout that sits between the plastic and your face. The shipping cost was outrageous...almost as much as the cost of the mask itself. I wanted to return it, but the cost of the total shipping would have exceeded the cost of the mask itself, so I kept it. Do not make the same mistake. You can easily recreate this in a craft store for about $1.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"While this product does what it claims; it just doesn't get as cold as the cold pack product I used previously. However the \\"cloth-like\\" exterior is very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE LOUSY PRINT","review":"It's a shame that this DVD of one of Jane Fonda's sexiest films has been struck from a badly deteriorated master. The print is grainy and distorted, lacking clarity in focus. Also, compare this print to the earlier VHS version and you will discover that there are key shots missing from this French language version.If this film can't be restored to the rich textures I recall from the original, then consider THE GAME IS OVER one lost film. The product available for purchase here is completely worthless, making its high price of $39.00 ludicrous. It ought to be yanked off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had forgotten how lame this Roger Vadim effort was. It's only redeeming value in its original form (for those of us who enjoyed it) was a generous amount of young Jane Fonda nudity. Unfortunately, this heavily edited version retains little of that, and not much else worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Sat in it's box with no battery for 3 years.

I have used the Lignomat pin meter and have had pretty good success with it. Butit doesn't read a very large area, but does tell the moisture in that area. I went to the MMC220 to avoid the pin holes and had heard raves about it.The MMC220 tells you the density of the wood but is very confusing when trying to tell the moisture.The Lignomat tells you the moisture, the MMC220 gives wide variations in the density which confuses the real moisture level"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast read, little substance","review":"It's true that Andrew Lyons has written a fast-paced little thriller. But there's very little meat on the skeletal story and even less on the flimsy characters.A simple accident becomes a murder when Jake finishes the job. But then he's suddenly transformed from frat-rat to stealthy psychopath. Perhaps we're supposed to believe he had this \\"darkness in him\\" all along, but we get no references of his history or prior antisocial behavior. Thus his sudden transformation is hard to take seriously, and his subsequent acts of murder, extortion, etc., are hard to swallow.In the end, the book reads like a shallow, vain, attempt to emulate Brett Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho\\". But Lyons' cast of drunken frat boys, promiscuous sorority girls, and overbearing detectives are dull cliches and thoroughly uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get me out of the darkness!","review":"This story had great potential but was totally unbelievable. The plot, the dialogue, the characters - didn't believe Jake could really be that smart or quick thinking. I couldn't wait to finish the book - I wouldn't have except I didn't have anything else with me to switch over to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat predictable, and a little over the top","review":"The book sounded interesting when reading a synopsis, but after reading it was not as good as it could have been. It was an interesting read due to the fact that it was done in the first person, but that is about all I can say.The main character is definitely twisted, in his logic and everything else. To think that he could be that quick on his feet with his thinking, especially when he has been drinking etc, brings it down. Definitely not the worst book that I have read (thus 2 stars and not one), but not all that great either. Hopefully he can do better with his next novel. There is potential, but it was not fulfilled here."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far, so good.","review":"I've only been using this off and on for two weeks so it seems to be doing okay.

Do not buy cheaper products that use the dl-alpha, etc tocopherols as they are synthetic forms of Vitamin E and can cause more harm than good. not all vitamin E's are the same.the only thing that could make this better is if it also contained the same mix (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the Tocotrienol family of vitamin E (yes, there are 8 members of the vitamin E family).

The various products listed here are NOT all the same.Look at the zoomed labels for each before you buy. I am a college professor who teaches an upper level nutrition course, and I PERSONALLY feel the evidence to date suggests that the only the MIXED should be used as a supplement.

No, not because it was scary. Far from it in fact. Because it is so bad. This might have made a good children's book; if not for the discussions of political matters. Or it might have been a good social drama; if not for the meaningless addition of demons.All in all this is a pathetic attempt to rip-off Frank Peretti's work. It is neither scary, nor insightful. The only thing frightening about this book is the grammatical structure and punctuation errors.EDIT: I don't know why Amazon says I reviewed the audio-cassette version. I had the misfortune to read the paperback instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better 90's punk albums","review":"Streets of San Francisco's pretty underrated.

They're not exactly the most innovative band on the planet but they do what they do well. Good lead singer, good lyrics, old school production quality, and good songs.

Disgusted with the product and very disgusted with the vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first day","review":"Both of these belts broke on the first day. The previous belt had lasted over a year. I thought these would be better, since their labeled as Extended wear. I picked up some cheap ones (not Eureka brand)at walmart, and they are fine.

This is not a shortcoming of the belt itself but a drawback of the vacuum's roller system which gets stuck if not cleaned frequently, snapping the belt as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but you have to make sure it's installed correctly","review":"I read the reviews previous to mine about the belts breaking after one or two uses so I was a little skeptical. The first one I used did break after only one use but after I put the second one on I made sure that it was installed correctly in the grooves and it has lasted every since so I don't think that the first one breaking has to do with the quality of the product. Will buy again when necessary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a few seconds of a jam","review":"These were delivered in a nondescript package, not in the factory packaging shown in the photo on the product page. I installed one of the belts with a brand new beater/roller brush, and all seemed to be fine. On the third use of the vacuum cleaner, I snagged a bit of cloth that jammed the roller, and although I reacted fairly quickly to switch it off, the belt was quickly eaten through. I have jammed this machine in a similar way in the past with no discernible damage to the belt. I think I will stick to real brand-name belts from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Turned out to be a dud, both of the belts lasted for couple of weeks.

If you do a lot of vacuuming, you may need to replace it every six months.UPDATE: These belts break far too often, therefore I changed my rating from 5 stars down to 2.

Major disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Gamble and read Queen's Gambit","review":"An excellent addition to the authors resume. The one who brought us The Hustler and the Color of Money - Walter Tevis takes us on another pyschological thrill. We meet the heroine, a young lady who finds she has a gift. She can play chess and play it very well. Tevis takes us inside this prodigy's troubled and brillant mind as she finds what she is truly about. As a chessplayer... it offered me a great insight to my own thinking. I highly recommend to anyone though... like Searching for Bobby Fischer you don't need to be a chess player to enjoy or understand it... It may be better if you aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story - not just a chess story","review":"I read Tevis' brilliant \\"Mockingbird\\" many years ago, went looking for his other books, and found this one. No one had read it or heard of it, and I always considered it a lost gem, re-reading it every few years. I'm glad it's being reissued. This isn't a book about chess, you don't have to know a thing about the game to enjoy the story. It's about Beth, a young orphan who discovers her chess genius by accident, nurtures it, uses it as a lifeline to pull herself into the real world after her adoption and painful adolescence. Without her, the book would be a magazine article about a chess prodigy. With her, it's a story of a young woman who doesn't really know how to live in the world, but finds a way through the pain of an incomplete childhood. If you enjoyed books like \\"She's Come Undone\\" or \\"The Liar's Club\\" you will love this one. You want to root for her, no matter what she's doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite genre novel ever!","review":"Every few years I reread this novel cover to cover in one day. From a pure pleasure standpoint it's my favorite novel.The protagonist, a drug-addled, brilliant orphan who discovers she has a talent for chess is, in my opinion, the most believable female protagonist produced by a male writer. Her emotional life and sexuality are not overemphasized but are always there, lurking below the action. Tevis stated in a radio interview that what he wanted to explore in this novel was \\"the operation of genius in a woman.\\"Tevis's writing is fast, rhythmic, and unsentimental. Like his pool books (The Hustler, The Color of Money), you don't have to understand or even particularly enjoy the game in question to love this book, as he does a wonderful job of narrating the drama of the match, and particularly the way in which each match is like a fight to the death between the two parties.I also recommend his wonderful sci-fi novel Mockingbird."},{"rating":"2","title":"an absorbing story","review":"I rarely read \\"popular\\" fiction, I generally will read the classics or great contemporaries... but I was enticed by other reviews to read this...I was totally absorbed into the story of Beth, and her magnificent obsession with chess (and surprisingly drugs).. so much that I hated to reach the last page.. I loved the journey and wished it had a sequel...so I turned back to page 1 and re-read it a second time.. something I've done with great books.. 100 Years of Solitude, Narcissus and Goldmund, The Illiad, Tolkien's The Ring....Read the book, you'll enjoy it and Beth will be a person you think about long after you've finished the book.. she'll become part of you and your life... what more can you ask of a novel?Note: You don't have to be a chess player to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense, gripping, thrilling book about chess and life and women","review":"Classic. Set in the 1950's this story of a female chess prodigy makes chess enthralling, even if you don't play it. I love the way Tevis introduces us to this world, where Beth Harmon, 8 years old and given daily tranquilizers by the orphanage, discovers chess in the basement by watching the janitor. The tone is dry but gripping, as we follow Beth and her discoveries of world and self via chess. I read this book when it first came out (early 80's?) and it hasn't dated a bit, it's still wryly riveting and well worth spending time with. It's a keeper, buy it you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for all ages","review":"This is and remains one of my favorite all-time books. As others have said, whether or not you know or understand chess is irrelevant -- the story and character development carry you along swiftly.

A little less humor, yes. A little more drama, you bet. But why is that such a bad thing when the drama is so good?Personal highlights: When David finds unrelenting terror in \\"That's My Dog,\\" Claire and her high antics with her artsy friends in \\"Terror Starts at Home,\\" and the sinister atmosphere in most of the season finale \\"Untitled.\\"Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This is not a subject we have previously spent much time thinking about but it is interesting.

That being said, I personally feel that this season only added, in a positive way, to a series that is already great. It placed more emphasis on character developement than the previous three seasons and was certainly more thoughtful. I am not a big fan of most of what HBO dishes out to us, but in this case I feel they got it right. This is one of the few \\"T.V. Things\\" that I am going to hate to see end. All in all, I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show has gotten stupid","review":"We really enjoyed season one and two, liked season three pretty well so we were excited to receive season four.

Glad I did. Very funny film.Though the dvd quality is not that great (and several scenes have been deleted), the film still stands up to the test of time. A drugged out singer takes refuge in a convent run by nuns with serious issues. These nuns do heroin, drop acid, read trashy novels, and even have lesbian tendencies.The acting is great, the women (most of whom you are familiar with if you've seen other Almodovar films, Carmen Maura, Marisa Paredes, etc)do a fine job, they created a very charming and entertaining group of \\"sisters.\\"While this is not the best Almodovar film, it is still a funny ditty that is better than 95% of the films that come out these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly weird","review":"Classic Pedro Almodovar movie. Dark and strangely funny. Not as commercial or light as \\"Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\\", but still entertaining. Almodovar uses the usual stable of actors and they don't disappoint. I love Carmen Maura's acting choices. Always unexpected. Movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. If you like this and/or want to see another GREAT Spanish film, check out the South American film \\"Destiny has no Favorites\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"dark satire that shows a humorous side to Spanish religion","review":"While this movie dragged a bit and is slightly cheezy, there is definitely deeper meaning in it. A tiger in the church? Mother Superior snorting coke? It's all messed up in a truly creative way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck Norris fights Bruce Lee?","review":"A few things are obvious from the start, the movie is boring except for the few martial art scenes. I get the feeling that Bruce Lee is putting-down Karate, this starts when a Karate student is easily beaten by a boxer (one punch), then at the end of the movie Chuck Norris (Karate world champion) is easily beaten by Bruce Lee. There is no way the Chuck Norris would have been so easily beaten if the fight was real. Until Chuck Norris enters the movie the movie is boring. I also think if Chuck Norris had seen the final movie he may never had been part of it. The movie appears to be an attempt by Bruce to advertise his Chinese Boxing, while putting down Karate at the same time. The worst acting/plot I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"This movie has bad quality it is dubed in they have deep voices and it sounds bad.If you want a good bruce Lee movie get Enter the Dragon I thought it would be a good movie but I was worng.It was not even a hollywood movie maybe if you were a big fan of Bruce Lee you could handle the bad quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"product came fast and in perfect condition, i havnt played the movie yet but im sure its all good... thank you again, will order more.. if the dvd dont work i will let you know.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martial Arts-Comedy","review":"Return of The Dragon had me rolling more than many comedies I've seen. From the ghetto looking opening animation scene, predictably bad dubbing, and the very sight of this scrawny pimped out gay guy (gotta see the outfit) among other subtleties, its pretty damn funny.The action in the movie is also pretty good. Not as great as some of Bruce's other films but still impressive. The pinnacle of the fighting comes at the end with Bruce taking on a furry looking Chuck Norris at the Colliseum (whats the deal with that cat? lol). As usual Bruce performs throughout the movie with his trademark charisma and brashness...he's simply the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast hands just as fast feet","review":"This is the first bruce lee movie i ever owned or saw and I was pleasently surprised with it, as a matter of fact it sent me spining into the world of martial arts and kung fu movies.

Transfer to Blu Ray is average. Sound transfer is awful. Better to play the collectors edition in ordinary DVD on a Blu Ray player than this one. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Any fan of Martial Arts films should see Return of the Dragon. Bruce Lee wrote and directed this film and it shows. While the story and characters may be weak, Lee knows how to provide excellent fight scenes in interesting locations. The best example of this is the final fight with Chuch Norris. Lee makes it look as though he and Norris are two gladiators fighting in ancient Rome. The film's attempts to be funny are kind of pathetic but you'll be too mesmorised be Lee to notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fight scenes","review":"The fight scenes in this movie are incredible.Lee was so fast with his hands and feet he makes everybody else look like they are moving in slow motion.The fight scene between Lee and Norris was excellent,although in reality Lee really wanted to do that scene with Joe Lewis who was the world heavyweight kickboxing champ at that time,but Lewis turned him down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some cutted parts but it's OK !","review":"This is the last CHINESE movie that Lee did, before Enter the Dragon. In this movie Lee really showns (in my opinion) 2 things, his art (putting a spet forward when talking about SPEED !) and his phisic. At that time his training by himself, it'd make any Schzenegger get furious. His physical fitness is the best I've ever seen ... And his speed, own MAN ! But how can someone be that fast, that lighting with the legs ... But the movie has some cutted parts. For the ones who have seen the movie before should remeber about this parts: The one in which Lee doesn't know how to ask for a little boy some of his ice cream and he runs away (Lee scared him), the one in which Lee doesn't know how to ask for food in the Restaurant and keeps going to the toilet then, and the one in which a prostitute takes Lee to her apartment while Lee keeps doing some kung fu moviements in front of a mirror. But don't worry. THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES ARE ALL THERE AND COMPLETE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is Chuck Norris the messenger !","review":"Enter the (CUT) Dragon!

Big names, good reputation- it sounded good. Unfortunately, it was a sad disappointment. It was almost totally moronic- just stupid characters reciting stupid, dubbed lines while posturing ridiculously. The only somewhat redeeming feature was the fighting- and that wasn't even that good compared with what we have today. The curiosity factor of the weird 70s outfits and hairdos was amusing, but you see that in any movie of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"way of the dragon","review":"I love this movie,but you have to read it instead of watch it,cause it's not in english.It's still my favorite bruce lee movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"American DVD release only, not the movie.","review":"Retrun of the Dragon was the American re-cut and badly dubbed version of Bruce Lee's classic Way of the Dragon. Believe it or not this movie was Lee's highest grossing film in Hong Kong. He made this movie especially for that market. That's why it's so different than the others. But the DVD is bad. Go out and get the import disc title Way of the Dragon. The movie is a lot longer, it's uncut and in cantonese with english sub-titles and the movie is correctally matted at 2.50.1. You'll see it like you never have before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXIT THE DRAGON, ENTER THE COWBOY","review":"ENTER THE DRAGON was Chuck Norris' first movie part, and he did it as a favor for his friend, Bruce Lee. This movie contains the only fight scene to my knowledge in which Lee is decked by an opponent. While the fight scene between Norris and Lee is somewhat stiff on NORRIS' PART(he hadn't yet learned the art of movie fighting), the exchange between the two reflect the two classic styles of solid rock-hard karate versus fluid, graceful kung fu as it was practiced at that time. The plot and acting may have been less than first rate, but the fight scenes are some of the best filmed up to that time and well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my Husband","review":"This was a gift for my husband.

Every movement prue poetry!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little known aspect of WWII in the Pacific","review":"This was a winner with second graders, and could also enthrall older children (as well as the adults in their lives). Skillfully weaving the military experience of a Navajo grandfather with the very contemporary emotional angst his grandson is going through, the author delicately explores the importance of cultural identity -- and how it can support a person who must step outside his comfort zone for reasons beyond his control.

It's a cute DVD. I actually like the Yo Gabba Gabba section. Yes, it's odd, but they have great messages to their songs about nap time, being scared and lonely when you go to sleep and about dreaming happy thoughts. They're catchy, sweet little tunes. I even caught my husband singing on the other day. Overall, I think it delivers what it suggests...a good collection of age appropriate bed time stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Hearts!","review":"It's always so great to see directors who write (in this case co-write) their own film and star in it as well, especially when they pull it off. You get a real sense of the story when the director is behind the whole vision. One of the greatest aspects of Queen of Hearts was seeing the four love interests being played by the same actor, Jérémie Elkam, who gave such different personalities and awesome performances for each Mathieu, Pierre, Jacques, and Paul. Valérie Donzelli's character, Adèle, is all over the place with love and she plays it with that great type of dramatic post-relationship female energy that is not too far from the truth of the real emotional rollercoaster that life is. She puts the fun French spin on the crazy crashes and attractions between men and women and when the plot's situation gets a bit wild at the end, it was hard not to get a kick out of it. It's romantically entertaining for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"mcleods daughters","review":"same as third series reveiw it also was wonderful. you can be apart of the happy family in there upss and downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Time","review":"At first it was just my husband & I used to watch this show .Then our kids started to watch it .Then wehen we had family from out of town vistit they started watching it .What more can I say it is a great show to watch ."},{"rating":"2","title":"McLeods Daughters 6th season","review":"This one really turns your head.

My disappointment, however, is related to the plastic bin the shredder sits on top of which has what I'd consider a design flaw. The shredder is designed to only work when it's placed on top of the paper bin to protect from any accidenal injury when the shredder has been removed from the bin. The problem, however, is that the safety feature on the shredder is activated by a very thin/weak 'rail' on the inside of the paper bin which has broken during normal use over the last several months. As a result, the shredder is now useless because the paper bin can no longer de-activate the safety shutoff device when the shredder is placed on top of the paper bin. The bin/safety cut-off device is too flimsy for this shredder....buy another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting","review":"I was excited to purchase this book as I was a big fan of Tucker's during his CNN crossfire days.

If you delight in ignorance and misinformation, he's your man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, witty, and laugh out loud funny...","review":"Tucker doesn't waste time into pulling his reader right into the heart of the tumultuous world of cable news, from the ill-fated Spin Room to his seat on the CNN flagship Crossfire. Anyone who watches Crossfire knows Tucker to be the most informed, and without a doubt most reasonable \\"conservative\\" voice on television, and his first book doesn't disappoint.That said, the book is no policy wonk manifesto, as it is concerned mainly with his experiences, anecdotes and cocktail party stories of his (brief) career to date. Each are well chosen, and he uses them to amplify the handful of maxims he has gleamed from his time in the business.If your looking for a fun and light read on the characters in our nation's capital, Tucker will be glad to serve as your personal guide!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, entertaining, and names names","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Carlson is not only witty and entertaining in describing his experiences with contemporary politicians and pundits, he almost always (and, often, surprisingly) names names. I suspect his candor may come back to haunt him at some point in his career, but a large part of his appeal is that he genuinely doesn't seem to care. He strikes me as a \\"let the chips fall where they may\\" kind of person and one who is sometimes bewildered by the oddities of the well-known characters he encounters. (He offers plausible theories for some of the more outrageous patterns of behavior that he's observed.) Regardless of your political views, I predict you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Palaver","review":"I wanted to like Tucker Carlson's book. He has the opportunity to show the interesting side of politics. The truth is, the writing is horrible. I wouldn't waste the money on this book new. I'm sure there will be plenty of used available soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big snore with a bowtie is still a big snore....","review":"If someone gives you this book for free, politely accept it and use it for kindling. If no one offers you this book for free, don't waste your money. The author fails to engage anyone but himself and fails to recognize the irony of his own book's title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show-biz and nothing else","review":"It is amazing that Carlson, who makes a living of spouting untruths and playing the show-biz game like Limbaugh, would criticize others for behaviors that make him popular himself. If you want pure fiction, there are better alternatives. If you want \\"fake\\" news, tune into the Daily Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics in moderation","review":"I never saw Tucker Carlson on Crossfire, but I wish I had based on this book. Carlson strikes me as a moderate, not really a conservative, and this was one of very few books that delve into politics without an overload of spin. Limbaugh on the right, and Franken on the left, try to make their audiences angry while they entertain. Tucker appears to have no agenda. To some, that might make him seem tame, but to me, it was refreshing. He has many entertaining and enlightening stories to tell, so if you want a break from party warfare, but you are still fascinated by politics, this might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. Carlson seems less partisan here than elsewhere. He freely bashes and praises liberals and conservatives alike. Speaking as a Washingtonian, his stories ring true. I would have given it 5 stars, but it was way too short for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute, fun fluff","review":"If you want (a) a learned discussion of major national issues or (b) a grim anti-liberal tirade, this book is not the book for you. But if you want to spend an hour or two reading amusing stories about Carlson's fellow pundits (and the occasional politician), this book is perfect. It is a cute, fun piece of fluff - the modern equivalent of the Hollywood fan magazines of decades past (except of course about the press instead of about actors)."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny","review":"For a movie starring two comedic geniuses Bernie Mac And Chris Rock this dissapoints.

It is a good movie though and i liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"The movie was a disappointment for me. The comedy about unknown black guy (Chris Rock) becoming a president could be very funny but unfortumately, it wasn't funny at all.

Not recommended, unless you are a die hard Chris Rock' fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE","review":"I saw this movie when it came out in the movie theaters, and i did not like it at all. I am a huge Chris Rock fan, I think he is hilarious and I usually like his movies. I think Chris Rock might have ruined his reputation with this movie. This movie was so boring.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, this wasn't funny","review":"Chris Rock is funny. Bernie Mac is funny. Both comedic geniuses are funny together. The problem? This movie wasn't funny. Perposterous plot, stereotypes lambasted trhoughout, and worst of all - poor comedic timing. I knew the punchlines way before they were delivered. This is why it was in the theaters for less than 3 weeks... it bombed. It was hyped up well, so it took in a lot of money during the opening week - but word of mouth quickly killed this bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!!!!!","review":"This movie is hilarious! This is a very enjoyable comedy.You definetly get lots of laughs in this movie. Chris Rock is a comedy legend! How he comes up with this stuff is amazing. He was the films writer director and star. If your a fan of Chris rock you should definetly get this. It is wonderful politicial satire. If you are a Bernie Mac fan you should get this also. He is very funny in this also. Definetly a laugh out loud comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have voted for the other guy","review":"Okay people, Chris Rock is funny. I usually love his movies and own a few of them. However, whoever let this one out of the idea stage needs to be shot, burned in effigy, shot again, and then fired.This movie was so bad I nearly walked out of the movie theater. I'm sorry, but any ability I have to pretend that a movie is real was destroyed in the first 30 mins of this travesty.If the most astute commentary that Chris Rock has on US politics is \\"I know you are but what am I?\\", perhaps he should find another genre of film to do. There are laughs to be had, because face it, Chris Rock is a funny guy. He just should steer clear of political satire until he understands politics and/or satire. All he did is make a fool of himself onscreen and set back the quest for an African-American president offscreen. If you had to waste your money so you could sit through this sorry excuse for a political comedy, let me hear you say \\"That ain't right!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head of State","review":"This movie is in a so-so state. Too serious to be funny - too funny to be serious. Now don't get me wrong, there are some laughs, but those are tempered with a government whose election isn't the democratic way. Maybe the lack of zip makes this undemocratic election too close to home and drags the film down. Maybe Rock took on too much with starring, writing and directing. The whole thing's a maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterically Funny!!","review":"I really wasn't a Chris Rock fan until Lethal Weapon IV, but after seeing this movie ... it's continuous laughter, from the opening credits (high-profile political names are rolling across the screen as if they're in the movie, but they're not!) to the ending. Chris Rock plays a \\"wet behind the ears\\" alderman who is chosen to run for President. He has his own style (campaigning while dressed like a hip-hop rapper), but whatever works. I think that his pairing up with Bernie Mac was great. Looking forward to seeing them in more movies together. Keep in mind ... this IS entertainment! Would I add this movie to my collection? YUP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why does everyone not like it?? its hilarious!","review":"Why doesnt anyone like this movie? I'm suprised it didnt do more at the box office, but once i saw it im really wondering. This movie was constantly funny thoughout, and I'm pretty hard to please. As would be expected there are many racial jokes that come across, but unlike other chris rock movies doesnt totally glorify the black man over the white man. with all that aside, it actually had me cheering for the liberal. heh. great length- it got right on top of things when it started and never was a dull moment. sure, it had its share of flaws, but all of that can be easily over looked. it's almost as good as bringing down the house. i definately recommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Laughs, but Mostly Embarassing!!","review":"Down on his luck, a Washington D.C. alderman accepts a chance to run for President of the United States. Chris Rock's fantasy comedy certanly had me laughing at times. Bernie Mac, Tracy Morgan and Robin Givens were hilarious in their roles. But overall, the stereotypical urban humor was rather embarassing to watch. It could have been a much more funnier film if they stayed away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie","review":"Iliked this movie, I thought it was pretty good, not too over the top, semi-sappy love story and good supporting cast.

While I am not completely naive to volunteerism, study, and work in developing countries (and the accompanying hardships), I felt that Thomsen never gave the reader hope. Did he have hope? Maybe his motivation for this book was not to focus on all the glamour and goodness that many other books do. However, we can see through different eyes without being clouded by negativity. That is the path I hope to take as I embark on my 2+ year experience. I guess this book did not provide the inspiration I was looking for. I'm sure I'll feel differently after I return.

This book has a lot of feel-good fluff and lacks the deep wisdom that I enjoy.The one insight that stands out the most from this book is: what you look at (focus on) you become. So turn off the TV, toss out the music, eliminate all sources off discontent, misery, violence, etc. And focus on the most loving, most magnificient, most powerful source of love and life that we as humans know...

HOS has a good reputation and has always treated me fairly, so I have no axe to grind. But I completely agree with C. Amara's review of this set. These HOS plastics look and feel cheap and clunky, and are impractical, particularly for speed chess. So, I too, am still using my generic weighted \\"Club\\" set.The club sets are the de facto standard for good reason. They are attractive and the \\"triple weighted\\" club models have good balance and heft. They're durable, and affordable, typically priced at 1/4th (or less) the price of these HOS plastics. The club sets can be found in a variety of color shades (e.g. ivory, antique white, yellow, etc.), finish (glossy or matte), and durability (ranges from brittle to kid-proof) so it pays to shop around. Generally, the better quality club sets cost a bit more, but even the worst of the weighted club sets are a better deal than this HOS set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deconstructing Harriet","review":"Ah poor Ishmael Reed! Doubly overlooked because he's a truly literate African-American writer AND more so because he's a postmodernist.This outrageously wonderful book manages to dissect and skewer both America's past and present with an off-beat sense of purpose. Merely my second foray into Reed's body of work, he's rapidly climbing up my All Time Favourite Author list. I suppose this won't appeal to everyone in the John Grishman/E. Lyn Harris/Harry Potter set, but Flight to Canada does what great art should - challenge the beholder.Reed tackles everything from the Civil War, Lincoln, Harriet Beecher Stowe, the grand ol' south, the nature of slavery and slaves and demands the reader to push aside common held beliefs and take a fresh look at this much-studied (and much-rehashed) juncture of American History.Bottom line - a hip and funny read that'll make you think. What more d'ya need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Do We Really Know About Canada?","review":"\\"Flight to Canada\\" was one of the required reading for one of my literature classes. One debate that came up regularly during class discussions was whether Canada is used by Reed as a literal place or a metaphor as a \\"state of mind\\". There are solid arguments for both based on the text.For me, it became clear how fuzzy our history lessons were in grade school. We were taught how slaves escaped to Canada. But that's where the story usually ends. Happily Ever After in Canada.

Sadler's Lone Star Service is a fascinating history of Texas as revealed through the biography of William Turner Sadler (1797-1884). Sadler was one of the leading pioneers of 19th century Texas and participated in most of the major events of the period. He migrated to Texas from Georgia in 1835 to become a farmer. He soon found himself in command of the ranger company that built Fort Houston, served as a private in the battle of San Jacinto, was active in quelling the Cordova Rebellion, and became a leader in the campaign against Chief Bowles and the Cherokees. Eventually Sadler served as a representative in both the Republic Congress and the Texas state legislature. During the Civil War, at the age of 66, he served in Terrell's Texas Cavalry. Highly recommended reading, Taming Texas is informative, engaging, offers a unique perspective on Texas history, and is enhanced with photographs, roster lists, and line-drawn illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The description is hard to follow","review":"This book looks structured at the first glance.

While it was fine while it was being used when I picked it up to put it away the top portion snapped off just above the nut. \\"Heavy duty\\" it isn't. Perhaps there should be a warning to only lift it by the base because the metal is so weak. I did pick it up by the upper portion but I would imagine that that would not be unusual or unanticipated by the manufacturer. I don't think it's too much to ask that the metal connector be strong enough to lift the base.

His part is very small and his haircut is not so good. But he does exhibit some sexy, boyish charm. Jude Law is the star of the film about a vampire who preys on vulnerable women. He is creepy and maipulative and feeds on love. He believes if he can find a woman to love him \\"perfectly\\", he will stop. There are some very bloody scenes and one tracheotomy scene that is absurd.

Years ago, I only paid attention to Jude Law because someone said he resembled a young Anthony Hopkins channeling Hannibal Lector. Well, he's not playing the young Doctah Lectah in the movie so catch him in this nice movie to see why its a shame he didn't get to play the character (better this than ALFIE.)

The movie is very slow moving, and Jude Law, while usually a fantastic actor in even the drabbest setting, was unmistakably boring.

He wooed his victims for a time and each fell in love with him before meeting their death.

It was easy to see their points. But I enjoyed my time with Maisie and her fellow travelers. All the characters, even the bad guy are sympathetic. The real villan is WWI and its horrors. It was enough evil for the book. Winspear didn't have add much more. What comes through in the novel is the author's passion for the time and her admiration for those who lived through it. I'm not the type to cry while reading but there were a few times I got an ache in my chest, especially the scenes with Maisie and her Dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"The book is boring and should be billed as a romance novel rather than mystery.

First, the accuracy of her historical account. Second, her characterizations are excellent. She describes each of her characters, both main and secondary, with such force, you feel you know them personally. And saving the best for last, her writing skill is superb. The ebb and flow of her ability to paint a picture with words is unsurpassed. It was a joy to read Masie Dobbs as well as Birds of a Feather. The only downside to Winspears books are the length.

I have to have some connection with a complex hero, but Maisie was not that hero. I kept waiting for some character development, some inner conflict. No. Maisie is a two-bit psychoanalyst, and a very boring one at that.

I love the Royal Spyness books and this was suggested to me by amazon. I thought the writing style was choppy and none of the characters were properly developed. At the end of the book I felt like I really didn't know much about the characters. And the story did not flow smoothly. I liked the idea of 'The Retreat' but it wasn't exactly thrilling.

I have to agree with those reviewers who felt that it was incredibly over-rated. The title character could be a \\"Mary Sue\\", she's so badly written. Breaking a novel's narrative flow with a very long flashback is generally a mistake, but in this case was probably done in an attempt to conceal the thinness of the plot. It didn't work.

Not bad, but not as good as touted, either.","review":"This won an Alex (young people's library award) NOT an Agatha. It was also nominated for an Edgar. This is hardly suprising given the author's lenghthy experience in the publishing industry, and the numerous contacts which she has as a result.As one prior reviewer noted, the dialogue and characters do owe much to Barbara Cartland. However, let's remember that Barbara Cartland made millions on her predictable stories and is now a Dame of the British Empire.I think your opinion of this story will depend on your ability/willingness to suspend credulity and believe in the numerous coincidences which are the backbone of the plot. Personally, I thought the charcters were cliched, albeit well-researched.Is it worth reading? Sure, borrow it from the library and take it to the beach.

I listened to the unabridged audio and was enchanted by the narrator and the story. But the odd thing is, I can't quite tell you why I enjoyed it so much. The mystery aspect was not quite as apparent as with most contemporary mysteries and this story had a lot more personal stuff than what I usually like.However, I could not stop listening and when the audio ended, I was very sad to not have more. But wait...there is a whole series of Maisie Dobbs books and I can read them all.Maisie's supporting characters are quite colorful and really do help enhance the story.

However Nancy had Ned and her girlfriends while Maisy is a bit of a loner.Maisy has a speedster car and dresses fashionably yet practically like Nancy.

You really feel the damage WWI had caused England's spirit. Maisie's young life is well drawn along with her time in the VAD in France. The only part that really didn't go down well with me was the way Maisie's use of psychology is wrapped in a coating of psychic/supernatural/mystical ability. I found it hokey. I'm also not so sure that class barriers were quite as easy to bridge as Maisie appears to have found it.

It also has the flaw often found in books set in Britain, but written by Americans, that titles of nobility are entirely inaccurately bestowed.The concept of the book is interesting, but Maisie is a comic-book superwoman. If the characters had been better developed, and the plot less rickety and ridden with coincidence, perhaps the author's impressive research might have been put to a more meaningful use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery with a Message","review":"In Masie Dobbs, Jacqueline Winspear has created an unforgettable character and painted a vivid picture of The Great War and it's legacy of horrific effects on the survivors. As much historical novel as mystery, Masie Dobbs is a vehicle for a personal reflection on war and its aftermath. With a female hero who derives her power from her classical education and applied psychology there's a powerful role-model in this protaganist. I can't wait for the next in the series. Now that we have come to know Masie's roots, we can't wait to see where her brains, intuition, and her Swiss Army knife will take us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bah Humbug!","review":"To all those nay-sayers who dumped on the author, the character and the story, I say, \\"BAH, HUMBUG!\\" I bought this book because of all the positive reasons stated by others; I enjoyed it thoroughly.I read this type of book because I want to be entertained, not enlightened. If the latter occurs then its a big plus. If not, on to the next novel. In this case I've already obtained four of the follow on books and look forward to reading them all with great pleasure. Why? Because Maisie Dobbs is a nice person and the story, except for the bad guy(s?) is filled with nice people, even a nice horse. Its a warmish sort of tale, brought occasional smiles to my face, and the good feeling of a simpler time gone by.

From what I can recall (I no longer own this CD) the singer's voice reminded me of some bad 80s hair band vocalist. Perhaps this is why Rubicon never made a second album and the rest of the band went on to other projects.

This book fails to meet my expectations because it's all theory; written by academicians for academicians. For example, in the sections on spectral analyses and wavelets the authors briefly describe what each is, provide equations for generating the curves, but do not explain under what circumstances one would select this analytical approach over others, show how to apply it to real data (all data are contrived to better illustrate concepts), and -- most importantly -- how to interpret the results. Both authors are plant ecologists so there is no discussion of point data in animal populations, but that's a minor consideration. It's less a guide for the working ecologist than a reference source to the literature of those researching spatial analytical tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spatial Analysis - Excellent!","review":"Excellent book.

This movie is more recommended to scare a twelve year old, other than a sixteen year old.If I wrote this review when I was twelve, I probably might have given it three stars. But I recently saw the film a year ago, and it wasn't scary anymore.Most of all, I like the cover art for the movie.

I surely hope that he had nothing to do with the making of this movie. The only similarites between the movie and the short story are the big rats. The makers pumped this full of so much crap to make it movie length. The acting was weak and the premise was just stupid (if they could see the mill from the rat's \\"lair,\\" there's no way it would have gone undiscovered). Don't even bother. If you're interested at all, just get Night Shift at your library and read the 10 page story."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable horror film","review":"Graveyard Shift is a short story written by Stephen King that should never have been adapted to the big screen. It's about a giant rat-bat creature living underneath a basement. The idea is fine and creepy for a story but for a movie, its treatment is horrible. The acting is sometimes good, and sometimes really bad. The characters were so one-dimensional it was hard to care if they were killed or not.

Rats, rats and more rats is what \\"Graveyard Shift\\" is all about and for that reason alone, I can honestly say this movie sucks. But, aside from that, the acting is terrible and the plot is pathetic and stupid. It is difficult to sympathize with any of the characters especially that boss guy who is a real jerk for sure.The idea of this huge killer rat is kind of lame in my opinion. The movie is entirely ineffective as a horror movie as there is absolutely nothing scary about it whatsoever...you might want to vommit after seeing the movie, but you won't be scared. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this trash unless you like rats, rat blood and guts, terrible acting and a terrible story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange","review":"This movie is made rather half-heartedly, but it wallows so deep in the strange and disgusting that a fan of the horror genre can't help but be intrigued. It is based very loosely on Stephen King's story out of Night Shift. Its about a drifter who gets a job at an old mill where a bizarre death has just occured. The foreman is a sleazy adulterer who sleeps with his lady employees. The drifter falls for one of them and they become good friends. When one of the secretaries finds out she was put on cleanup, she trashes the foreman's car. Drifter stops the foreman from hitting the woman and the foreman asigns him to cleanup to take her place. That is when the party really gets started. The movie is by all means horrible, but it is still incredibly entertaining. It has no logic and the story is par at best, but you feel so compelled to watch it because it does hook you. Wich is why this is still one of my favorite horror movies. Look out for Brad Douriff as the exterminator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much in common with the King story but a good movie.","review":"A lot of changes made from King story to movie, but the atmosphere of the old mill with graveyard next to it is perfect. Warwick character played by Stephen Macht is very strong. David Andrews is excellent as the mysterious drifter. Interiors of mill are very well done. Very good special effects and plenty of gore. I cant leave out Brad Dourif as the exterminator,perfect. Everything combined this is an excellent horror movie. Can be watched over and over to pick up more details each time. Last but not least is the final credit theme with lines from the movie stung together in a chilling and memorable song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy movie from the early 1990's","review":"This movie is definitely cheesy, with B-rate actors, an awful-looking creature/villain and it looks like something that should have bee made in the 1980's, not 1990.

Instead of moving from beginning to end, Jim Mortimore chose to tell the story out of order, flashing backwards and forwards using multiple first person narratives.Does it work? Surprisingly so. EYE OF HEAVEN would have been a rather straight-forward story otherwise, involving a long sea voyage and Easter Island's statues. Instead, by shifting back and forth through the story, Mortimore is able to raise the suspsense level in an almost lyrical fashion.EYE OF HEAVEN was Leela's first major outing in the Who novels, and it worked surprisingly well. I wouldn't recommend this style for all books, or for even most stories. For this, though, it worked admirably. The resolution of the plot is a bit flimsy, but the rest is enjoyable enough that it's not as big a deal as it would have been. Lots of fun for the reader who's ready to be challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for Leela's History","review":"One star as we learn a bit more about Leela, yet her character is written as one step above a chimp in attitude and language. The first person narrative is very confusing as with over six major characters, you never know who is speaking until three lines into their speach, not to mention where they are in the story. Overall a minor sci-fi new concept but for me, the worst 4th Dr. book in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Style over Lack of Substance","review":"The narrative is told in an extremely disjointed fashion for no discernible purpose, other than to indulge in rather tedious foreshadowing, or perhaps to disguise the fact that, told in a straightforward narrative style, the plot is tedious int he extreme. Additionally, for purists of the series, the character of Leela bears almost no resemblance to the series character and is portrayed more as if she is Superman's sister than a real human being. There is a sequence when she is in the ocean--fighting off sharks and giant squids, and hitching rides on whales and surviving tornadoes, etc., etc. that is simply too ludicrous for words. As with most of the Doctor Who novels put out by BBC Books (and, for that matter, the earlier novels from Virgin), it would also benefit from tighter editing and a reduced page count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes and No","review":"The only reason I gave two stars to this book is because of the insight into Leela's character.

Unusual style.","review":"The main detracting factor of this book is the fact that it is written \\"out of order.\\" That is, it keeps going back and forth, telling events that happened later before events that happened earlier, and then back again. Also, it is written entirely in the first person, though the person from whose perspective each chapter is written changes from chapter to chapter, and one is left to figure out who the narrator is by the context.For those who enjoy experimental types of reading, you might like this book.

The melodies are more complicated and the harmonies and orchestrations are soaring.The first half of the CD is very up and very tuneful, kicking off with \\"Springtime\\" and \\"Come Out to Play\\", but then things take on a darker meaning. \\"Last Breath\\" is very disturbing, but \\"Mama\\" brings you back brilliantly and then \\"A Summer Dream\\" sends you on your way.I like the fact that Shirley includes her lyrics, even if they aren't sung. I really got involved with the unfolding story.I loved this cd and I urge you to check it out!! Ms. Cason has come a long way, but, with the promise of this album, she still has a lot to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"trunk organizer","review":"The organizer fits in the rear space of our BMW sportwagon very nicely. the adjustable spaces in the organizer are easy to configure, and stand up well to varying loads. good product, but a little pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexible space, well constructed","review":"Very pleased with this product -- very easy to use, the dividers offer a huge amount of flexibility, stays put in the car (no sliding around whatsoever).

When \\"popped\\" up, the dividers can be completely customized and moved around. The dividers stay in place very well once set. Lots of storage space and definitely cleaned up my trunk as I'm OCD and I insist on having a bunch of crap in my trunk for convenience and just in case its ever needed. Currently, it is storing a rolled up sleeping bag, an air compressor, jumper cables, various cleaning supply bottles, two towels, ice scrapers, and two sets of gloves. It hasn't moved an inch since its been placed and nothing has fallen or rolled out. I have never owned one of these trunk organizers before, but I think I will always use one now based on my experience with this one. This size fits a 2011 camaro trunk perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"When we bought a new car the trunk was especially big. I would load bags of groceries in it with plenty of room left over. By the time I got home all my groceries were strewn all over the trunk. This organizer is wonderful.

I stored it on the balcony for a week and that took more or less care of it. As for the organizer itself, it is very well designed. The center barriers are held with thick Velcro and the box itself is very sturdy. The rubber bottom prevents the organizer from shifting/moving around while driving.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for storing \\"all that stuff\\"","review":"I bought this item to store all my truck stuff, bottles of water, and footballs in my truck bed. (I have a bed cover.) This is excellent. The two dividers can be moved to adjust the storage area (3) sizes. Quality construction. Heavy duty. Does not skid on the truck bed. Has two handles. If the organizer is filled with heavy items I wouldn't use the handles.Really, the only question is what size do you need! I bought the large, as it was just a few bucks more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely made product","review":"I use this as a trunk organizer, especially for grocery shopping. It keeps all the bagged items from falling down or sliding around the trunk.

It usually doesnt move even when I am driving agressively. This organizer works perfectly in my explorer. I actually want two of them so that when we take the other vehicle we are equally as prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Madeline book","review":"This is not my favorite Madeline book. My daughter usually likes Madeline, but was not as keen on this one. It does not have a good flow of rhyming cadence that is present in the rest of the series.

The action is on par with other movies of its type at the time, the fluidity of the story is sweet, and it always keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. I swear every time I watch this movie I learn something new about the story, which can be confusing to some. Arnie also has some pretty outrageous scenes which are memorable.

The action is fast and furious with grotesque images. The plot really, is straightforward. Who can't follow this movie. Only geniuses can understand this movie and I do! Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rachel Ticotin have chemistry! So does Sharon Stone! The make-up in this masterpiece is exceptional and truly stands out from any other science fiction film.

BluRay at home with a 5.1 sound system is the way to go. If you're a fan of Arrrnold, SciFi, Philip K.

A keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Awful Rubber Mutants!","review":"When Total Recall was first released, I dragged a friend to see it. I had seen the trailer and I thought it would impress others as it did for me. Big mistake! The movie started off great. The plot seem interesting and suspenseful. Then, some rubber mutant freaks came wandering and I was left pondering over the embarrassment for recommending the movie. This embarrassment includes a rubber puppet popping out of an actor's chests, a chick with 3 rubber breasts and some other deformed plastic all-sorts walking around the set. If only they hadn't used any mutants in the movie. This film could have been more mature and if it was, it might have been a great all-time sci-fi classic. Instead, it turned out like a kiddie's movie. Personal Opinion! Schwarzenegger still rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray not worth it.","review":"First off what people are saying about the quality is true. This is pretty much an upscaled DVD. If you can find the special edition DVD I think it has some actual extras like making of documentaries. The only thing like that that came with this blu ray that I got from Wal Mart for 6 bucks is a 3 minute documentary that has nothing to do with the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor styling and dated sets...","review":"Nobody watches an Arny film for his acting - it's all in the action! So what's wrong with this film?Paul Verhoeven gives his usual best in sex and violence - problem is with the art direction. The interior sets for the Mars colony look just like that - dressed up sound stages. Compare it to the visual brilliance of films like City of Lost Children, Blade Runner and even Dark City... these films take the audience to another time and place, even after repeated viewings through the years.Total Recall just looks dated after barely a decade - styrofoam rock walls, plastic-looking doors, outdated hair styles... Just doesn't mesh well with the admittedly great SFX sequences. The magic is lost..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sci-fi film - truly terrible blu-ray","review":"Total Recall is a great old style sci-fi film. I was really looking forward to seeing it in high definition at home, so I picked up the blu-ray to replace my DVD. What a mistake! This blu-ray is absolutely pathetic. It is the worst blu-ray I have ever seen. I don't care how cheap this disc sells for - it is a waste of money. I cannot believe the excessive grain and video noise that dominates throughout this title. It is terribly distracting.

Wait until it's properly mastered. If you don't own the movie already, it's worth ten bucks just as a dvd would be but certainly don't rebuy it expecting it to look better than you'd see on broadcast television.

Absolutely terrible transfer, has obvious blocky compression artifacts starting in the first scene and continuing on throughout the movie. Film grain is intact (a good thing) but there's a ton of jitter and film spots/hairs/lint etc. Looks like you're watching a bad print in a $1.50 movie theater. Scratch that, the compression artifacts make it look like you're watching a youtube video of a bad print from a $1.50 movie theater. Seriously, most DVDs have fewer compression artifacts than this.I want to make it clear that I'm not one of those people who insists that all films be cleaned up and vaseline-d for the digital transfer. I like gritty film grain and natural colors on films where that's what the director or the technology of the time dictated. This is simply a bad transfer. The compression artifacts alone kill it. Skip it, and wait for a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor transfer to blu-ray","review":"This is a bad-transfer to Blu-ray. My DVD is just as good and has more extras also!

Besides having a cool story (how many post-Terminator Arnold flicks can claim that?) it contained some of the best one-liners the Austrian actor got to say in films. I was glad that it got a new DVD treatment, as the last one was devoid of extras. This one gets a bunch, with cool little Mars-like snippets and the usual trailers. One of the high-points is the commentary by Arnold himself and dirctor Paul Verhoeven. Really informative.The worst part of the deal is the terrible packaging it comes in. The disc is contained in a stupid round tin, not the usual slimcase packaging of other DVD's. But this is a small complaint. Total Recall Special Edition is an awesome disc to have in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick must be rolling in his grave...","review":"\\"Inspired\\" by the short story of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick, \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,\\" this movie starts off as a mysterious, intellectual, and action packed thriller, up until the line \\"Conseeder zis a divohse!\\"And then we go down from there.To its credit, it stays true all the way until Quaid battles his wife. While the story involves more and more possible true/implanted memories in Quaid while he strikes deals with the powerful government, the movie quickly goes to a Doom like shoot em up on Mars. What could have been a sci fi \\"Memento,\\" 11 years before the fact, turned out to be nothing than a Swarzennager blood bath. A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"not arnolds best, but not his worst either!","review":"Total Recall had an interesting idea and plot. It's got some good twists & turns. I personally like the first half better, the part on earth. The villians in this one arent pathedic like they sometimes are in Arnold movies. The plot focuses on Arnold going to a place called Recall, for a memory implant on Mars. After realising something important he decides to actually go to the planet.

It's really sad to see all these years go by and still nothing to match T and T2, Predator, and, lastly Total Recall. One thing's for sure, Paul Verhoven, director, and Arnold go together very well. This is one of my all time favs, for sure. I can only hope that Arnold and Verhoven (Starship Troopers) can somehow do another Sci-Fi. Johnny Cab has to be one of the best parts that make this movie so cool and different. I just loved the Mars off-world idea, too. It's just a unique movie, much like Predator. The scene where Arnold fights Micheal Ironside on the elevator in the alien device, could've been done different, script-wise, in my opinion. When Arnold ends up holding on to Ironsides' arms after the elevator takes them off, he could've said \\"need a hand, or two\\" instead of \\"...see you at the party, Richter\\" That would've made this movie perfect. Oh well, a comic opportunity missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS \\"Blu-Ray!\\"","review":"I feel completely ripped off and am pretty angry.

It is the worst transfer I have seen so far. The picture is constantly grainy and ruins what is otherwise a fine film. It is just outrageous that they would market a film in blu-ray in such poor condition. That accounts for the two stars, which otherwise would have been at least four for the film itself.

Playing this one side by side on my 1080i TV, does not look any better than the 4 year ago release. Maybe I need a 1080p or better (faster refresh??) TV. My TV is 4 years old.What this version had is a plethora of behind the scenes and interviews that was not on the earlier Blu-Ray. The Deluxe DVD of 2002 had the extra material but it was nice watching it again.Sort of felt a bit cheated buying this but at $10, OK. So, unless you have a really nice HD TV and the best Blu-Ray player on the market, you'll not see much improvement.I do rate this movie one of my TOP 10 movies!

Try to imagine Arnold as a passive construction worker who is also completely under his wife's thumb (for the most part). Hard to wrap your head around, no? Well, he doesn't do too badly, but not entirely believable, either.That being said, this film does have some intersting concepts regarding a one or two generation colony on Mars and is worth watching just for that. bear in mind the context of the time this film was made versus the more recent version (which I haven't seen, yet).All in all, a thumb and a half up and 4 stars.

Based on a story by Philip K. Dick, this film, which also stars Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's wife, was a great financial success (despite its then-huge $65 million budget) and added to the appeal of both of its star actors. As one of the more memorable articles of Contemporary Era science-fiction cinema, Total Recall is a worthy addition to your DVD (or even Blu-ray) collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This movie is a sci-fi classic.

The volume can't be made loud enough to be played on certain media, like my xbox or kindle fire. It's all there, but for my xbox I need to have the volume on my TV at 99, and I still can't hear some things if there's any other background noise in my apartment, even a ceiling fan.

The standard for the U.S. is 23.98fps. That means my blu-ray player will drop a frame after a few minutes. For me this is noticable to the point of distraction. It looks like the disc has skips throughout the entire movie.

If he could have ended with the classic \\"I'll be back\\" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"porn","review":"Paul Verhoeven started as a pornographer in Europe and he has not changed at all. Not surprisingly he has flourished in today's Hollywood. Total Recall is a putrid mess that is designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator on every possible level. To call this thing a Science Fiction film and therefore place it on the same level as Planet of the Apes or Destination Moon or even The Giant Claw is obscene as the thing itself. The thing completely embraces the nihilist philosophy of Communism. Humans are disposable trash. There is no good nor evil, just the right idealogy. Mass murder is only bad depending on whose side you're on. Life is death. To be fair, verhoeven IS consistent. Everything that he has made, from FLesh and Blood, up to his blasphemy of Heinlein's Starship Troopers has had the same stench of hell. To think that this is what American film has degenerated into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech problem","review":"Movie wouldn't load (though I was charged).

I did not remember this movie being this cheesy. Just saw the new version with Colin Farrell which I totally enjoyed, so I wanted to see how the original compared.

I remember enjoying the Schwarzenegger version when it was out, but that was a long time and many great technological advances ago. Still love the full-body scanner scene in this one!

This is a complete rip-off and greedy Lionsate should be ashamed of themselves for pawning off this shoddy, low-quality transfer as hi-def Blu-Ray.

Also while the Audio says 5.1, my new receiver showed that not being available and switched to some VCR audio mode. So right from the beginning I knew something was wrong. Then the company logo and credits started to roll. I felt like I should be looking for a tracking button on my blu player.

The deal is this, people are calling it a poor transfer with lot's of grain, which is probably true...but the big problem is that they are saying in many cases that the dvd is better. I have both, I compared them side to side (although I didn't have to). Besides some grain the movie looks AWESOME. Not as good as a newer transfer like a transformers or across the universe but awesome nevertheless. You have to ask yourself if a little grain really bothers you considering that the resolution is incredible? The truth is the detail is ten times better then the dvd! There is grain, but it is not anything to worry about unless you are some sort of purist. Personally, I don't care, as many movies in the theater have serious grain (Sometimes intentionally on behalf of the director). For the price, this is totally worth it, I am also going to buy Stargate despite the bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible blu-ray","review":"Everyone knows this is an awesome movie... but the blu-ray has nothing BUT the movie!

I turned it on and thought it was the cable or something was set up incorrectly. The brightness in some parts of the screen goes up an down with a white grain - The horse in the beginning looking like she is running in a rain storm. After spending 2 hours trying to fix the new player I tried a different Blu-Ray disc and was incredible.We tested the HD DVD version of Total Recall and the conversion is like Terminator 2 from the UK that is flawless like a jaw dropping movie effects show where special care was given to the grain in addition to remaster to highlight the shows performance. I am very disappointed with the Blu Ray version. I hope they read this and will fix for future presses as people deserve more like the HD DVD version. This one deserves to be at the dollar store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommendable after bladerunner and minority report.","review":"Phillip k Dick being the great writer that he was had written some of the greatest sci fi stories that have been put from book to film including bladerunner and minority report and while this is the worst one been put to film it really is'nt that bad infact it's very good to say the least, total recall is certainly one of Arnies greatest films along with terminator and end of days.

Haunted by his spontaneous shooting of a store clerk in a failed robbery, he craves reconciliation and returns to his old inner-city neighborhood where he encounters a troubled woman (Kirsten Dunst), a mysterious street preacher (Morgan freeman) and the sister (Holly Hunter) of the boy he killed.It's rare that a movie tackles such difficult themes of guilt, forgiveness, reconciliation and atonement with such insight, grace and intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great price!","review":"I had heard good things about Levity, so when I found it for $5.50 at Wal-Mart, I decided to give it a chance. It's a very welcome addition to my DVD collection indeed. The acting is excellent and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. I particularly loved Kirsten Dunst as the drugged out club kid. I also loved Holly Hunter as the older sister of the boy that was murdered by Billy Bob Thornton. The theme of trying to right a wrong and helping others is something we should all keep in mind in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Boring","review":"When I put this movie in my DVD player, I was expecting a heist with cool characters and snappy dialogue. Obviously I was way off! As the film unravelled ever so slowly, it just got more and more confusing, stupid, and pointless, and it stayed boring. Morgan Freeman's character didn't make sense and didn't have a point or a reason. The same was the case with Kirstin Dunst. I just can't believe that four big named (some highly acclaimed) actors would play these roles. I also can't believe that I sat through this entire movie. All in all, Levity was horrible and torturous. I would rather watch paint dry than watch this again. It is obviously not something that children would want to see, nor would they enjoy. It's R rating reflects a noticable amount of profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems very puny","review":"very flimsy,, poor markings compared to Staedtler brand items.

All the songs sound alike, the pace is too slow, and the female lead singer sounds technically-enhanced. There was also an annoying, grainy quality to it. I listen to many New Age groups, but I will not purchase another CD from this one. I listened to it once and then donated it to the public library. On the positive side, it was soothing as I drove home in heavy traffic, but only because the songs were mind-numbing in their similarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy as lullabies","review":"I'm very disappointed. I bought it for my 8-month old but it does not work - instead the music agitates the baby.

I'm going to give it away.Later I bought Wee Sing for Babies which was recommended by another mother. I love it, so does the baby! It comes with a CD, cassete, and a book with lyrics, music scores and instructions of simple games you can play with your baby. The second part of its 65 songs are lullabies, and they are so soothing and beautiful! All these cost only $8.99.

That's a quibble of course, since it doesn't detract from the fun of the book, but don't call it a Regency when it's not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Capital H for Hilarious","review":"This was just too funny: the lines, the drunken singing, and the random bushman.

It does a pretty good job of representing the factions in Angola. It has a solid plot. Red Scorpion does what its supposed to do, which is make Dolph the savior of the people in Angola while showing off his body.

The volumes featuring his art in recent years, beautiful as they are, usually do not emphasize his drawing skills as this book does. This is truly a fascinating look at the creative process of a modern master -- secure yourself a copy, if you see one available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"In my opinion this albus is not perfectly produced, sound a little bit as a demo-tape from an unknown band, and the musicians are not tecnical monsters.

The three songs have something to communicate, even if u don't know exactly what. The voice of the singer is profound and a bit sad.

It also says right in the description that it is blue. Going on that info and by those photos I thought this was going to be a beautiful icy blue color. But when I rec'd it, I was disappointed to see that it was more of a light silver blue color and not anything like the icy blue I thought It would be. I noticed also that this watch is selling like hotcakes this past week and I thought it was important to note the color difference for those of you who think your getting what is pictured here or otherwise. It is still a very nice watch for the price and totally worth buying as long as your not expecting the color I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Right","review":"Although Seiko is a trusted name in watches, this watch misses the mark.

Disappointingly, Mr. Callow's affected speech proves very difficult to follow, even after repeated hearings. He speaks far too quickly and musically, which distracts from the sonnets themselves.Additionally, the sonnets are not each clearly delineated from the other. Strained ears find the occasional familiar line, but such effort is ultimately better spent reading the sonnets aloud ourselves. Spend your money elsewhere, if you wish to keep the babies entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for mothers of teenaged girls","review":"If you're looking for a 'What to Expect When You're Expecting' guide for your daughter's teenaged years, Queen Bees & Wannabeslands on top.

I must admit, I've quoted things from this book to my daughter verbatim and used it to guide activities when I was a girl scout leader. The advice and insights found inside this book are priceless. A must-read, hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Islam bashing perspective","review":"As an American-Muslim, it was not surprising to see another distorted perspective of Islam from a non-Islamic person. Reading the chapter on Islam basically reinforced my views that Islam as a religion is totally misunderstood in the West. It is about time we start looking into this religion more carefully as a belief, and not as an enemy. Author's bias against Islam cames accross clearly and he should have been more carefull in that regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-history","review":"Do not read this book if you are looking for anything resembling a work of non-fiction or scholarship. It is a meandering collection of new-age pablum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfettered political correctness","review":"Unfortunately, the author seems intent on re-inventing Abraham as some sort of ecumenical superstar. Abraham lived about 3,800 years ago -- many years before the advent of Christianity and Islam -- leaving the Jewish Abraham to exist for many hundreds of years as the original.Who is the original Abraham? The one whom God promised, through Isaac, that he would be the forefather of a people chosen to receive God's law and inherit the Holy Land. Today, Abraham's name is being invoked to promote ethnic and religious agendas outside the pale of Judaism.It's rather peculiar that the people who made the song Ana Bakra Isra'il (I Hate Israel) a hit, would profess to honor the partriach of the Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing bible games with Abraham","review":"Saying that Abraham reconciles the three religions is like saying Adam reconciles special creation and evolution. Unfortunately, for Feiler, those who deny that Jesus is Messiah, God, eternally separate themselves from the christian faith. Jews and Muslims can only be reconciled to Jesus by accepting Jesus as Savior and Lord, not by playing games with Abraham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Explanation of Abraham","review":"I thought the book provided a good explanation of the commonality of Abraham to the 3 monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I enjoyed the author's discussions with religious leaders of all three faiths and his trips to various sites in Israel. It kind of bogs down in a couple of places, but overall an easy, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Shared Patriarch","review":"Every Jew, Christian and Muslim should read this book to help us understand the similar background our religions share through our common patriarch, Abraham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham","review":"The origins and current status of three religions are gently exposed. This is a tour without anger, or self-righteouness. It brings the reader to an understanding of the fundamental similarities of Islam, Judaism & Christianity, while bringing forward many of the stressors in their relationship. Nicely written, nicely said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and fluffy disappointment","review":"If you are looking for a penetrating , interesting,and scholarly exploration of Abraham, this is NOT the book for you. The tone is flippant, casual, and cutesy. In this book Abraham and God negotiate with each other and God isn't much more than Zeus, a weak egocentric being. In fact, God needs Abraham! It's written as a travelogue and an essay. Much of this work is opinion and more opinion.What I liked -- I enjoyed the personal relfections Feiler inserts about his Judaism and his visit to Jerusalem. He has a bright cheerful voice that's nice to read.I expected to learn and for the writing to be backed up with solid scholarship, but it wasn't.This is light, for the beach, summer reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Living in this post 9/11 world, this book has the potential for bringing people from different religious backgrounds together at last. For all people to read so that everyone will understand finally why the three great religions believe the way they do.With understanding will come peace.If you loved the adventure of \\"Walking the Bible, you will not be disappointed in \\"Abraham\\".

Plese read all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"AbrahamA Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths","review":"I found the author of this book unreliable as to both facts and scriptures. Linking the three faiths to Abraham is a very promising idea. However, failure to modify sweeping statements, unhistorical interpretations of some incidents recorded in scripture, treating matters of faith as matters of established fact, all contribute to a book that is less than it might have been, less than it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I have a limited religious background and I was looking for this book to give a high-level explanation of the 3 religions and to try to understand why they are so violently different (especially since they originate from the same place). But it was difficult to follow, mainly because I think that the author assumed you have a fairly solid religious background; he used a lot of terms which he didn't define. I may have had different expectations than what the author was trying to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic for Most Readers","review":"Feiler's \\"Abraham\\" is a good book about the father of three religions written for people who have never bothered to read the Book of Genesis. For the totally uninitiated, Feiler gives a summary of the biblical stories. Instead of Feiler's \\"Abraham,\\" I would recommend first that people read the biblical Genesis. This is a much more interesting and lively book than Feiler's. And second, if you want insight into the same material that Feiler is writing about, read Dennis Shulman's \\"The Genius of Genesis.\\" Shulman's book has more depth, and is as well written as Feiler's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham: A Journey to the Hart of Three Faiths","review":"This book covers Judaism, Christianity and Islam with diginity and thoughtfulness. Our father, Abraham, joins us and separates us at the same time. The author in his searching has found information that helps us to understand each other and how we are all connected through this man named Abraham.I recommended this book to lay persons as well as ordained clergy in assisting us in clearing our vision of others and how their way of faith is perceivedMay all God's people be one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL BOOK... VERY INSPIRING... REMARKABLE... AMAZING","review":"REMARKABLE... AMAZING... INSPIRING...

Feiler's writing style is not only remarkably intriguing but also inspiring.As Feiler explores various notable landmarks in the Holy Land the reader is taken on an exciting journey through one of the Bible's most remarkable figures -- Abraham. This novel is bound to become a classic to be utilized for generations to come in religious education classrooms.As a religion teacher of seven years, this novel will hold a special place on my bookshelf. This is a perfect companion for anyone looking to further their knowledge of Abraham or just for those starting to explore the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abraham the Chaldean","review":"Perhaps the main thing to remember regarding Abraham, is that he was NOT a Hebrew, but a Chaldean.

I recommend it highly for the perspective it provides--reminding us we are ALL one people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly-simplistic. Not a lot of deep theological food here","review":"More of a cursory overview of Abraham with a watered-down perspective of the big three religions view of this individual, with plenty of glossy descriptions of holy sites and politically-correct \\"BCE\\" verbage, but not a lot of deep theological content, which was what I was hoping for.Bruce Feiler is no theologan, apparently, and there wasn't much to this book. There have been better works written about Abraham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Slanted Against Islam","review":"I don't know why the author even bothers to say he spoke to leaders of Islam. It's obvious that he just made up whatever he wanted about the religion. He makes it sound as though Mohammed, pbuh, just changes his mind to suit his political needs in regards to how Islam should be. What a crock! What imam or sheikh would ever say such a thing is beyond me. Then the crack about how mainstream muslims really believe that God wanted 9/11 to happen?This book has an agenda and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction","review":"It is unfortunate to see so many inaccuracies, non factual opinions and biasness in this book. Read it if you mostly like fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of noteriety!","review":"Feiler does make interesting and true accounts of the three major religions. Feiler also adds far too much personal (and unsubstantiated) conclusions. One is left with as many questions as one started off with. Much of Feiler's \\"investigations\\" are not from scholars and are not noted properly. I cannot understand why this novel has had so much success unless it is only because there is not much else to choose from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting thesis but ultimately incorrect","review":"This is ultimately an unsatisfactory book. Feiler does little scholarly research and depends mostly on personal encounters. His thesis that Abraham is claimed as the father of three great religions is incorrect. Feiler tries to account for 4000 years of history in a book of a few hundred pages. As a result much history is oversimplified.For a more detailed discussion of this book go to seniornet.org and look at the book discussion section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh gosh -- the voice","review":"This is a review of the audio book, not the book itself. It's hard for me to evaluate the book itself because Bruce Feiler's reading was rendered so horribly.Memo to Bruce: Leave the reading to the professionals. Just because we can endure your voice for a few minutes on NPR does not mean we want to hear you for six hours on the audio book. Feiler has an odd, whiney voice that is painful to listen to. I don't recommend this audio book"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent objective view","review":"I thought the book was very well written. The first half of the book gives a very nice history of Abraham. The next chapters look how Abraham is linked to each of the three major religions while the last chapter or two show how each of the religions are different yet so much alike and through both of these we could all be at peace. I really enjoyed the objective viewpoint of the writer and will read more of his books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview Of Christian History","review":"This is a wonderful book which explains the development of Christianity from the death of Jesus, right up to the present time.

This is not one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing-- wish I hadn't read it","review":"I did not like this book because the author seems to be a very unhappy person living with a dysfunctional family. She seems bitter that during the divorce between her and her husband, her daughter decided to live with her father. Another son and his wife she doesn't even speak too. It seems hard to read about a homeschooling experience that leads to such an unhappy end. The author tends to blame everyone else for these problems and I winced to think that she would print the things that she didn't like about her ex-husband for everyone, including her children, to read. I wish the author had taken a better look at herself and her role in the dysfunction in her family and solved a few of these problems before writing this book. This book unfortuantely can be very discouraging to new homeschoolers and in the end, I am sorry to say, I wish I hadn't read it.I did want to say that I thought the author has a talented way of writing and I hope she tries again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a copy from a friend","review":"I got this book from another homeschooling mom. She said that she did not like it. So I thought I would read it. I would have to agree with Rachel! The only thing I found: If this dysfuctional family can homeschool anyone can! I think that the author seriously needs to look in the mirror for the answers to her problems and quit blaming everyone else. I would not pass this book along to anyone. I burnt my copy as I know others did as well. Overall book was a waste of my time.

This time it appears amongst some less than honest talent agents.Next, a bedridden woman manages to live out some very nasty fantasies by possessing the nurse who works for her.Then an architect becomes obsessed with a woman he sees in a plaza during a business trip. His fantasies begin to take life, but whose fantasies are they anyway?Finally, a security guard discovers that the decrepit property she guards may be home to something very dark and sinister. Can she control them?Four fun tales, but the red dress story works best if you have seen the original as there is too little time to give a proper history.

The album features four parodies of then recent hits, five original songs and one polka medley of recent hit songs. The parodies of the songs \\"Living in America\\", \\"Addicted to Love\\" and \\"Who's Johnny\\" are quite good. I don't really care much for the parody of \\"Ruthless People\\", possibly because I barely remember the song being parodied. The original songs are all good, including the Talking Heads style song \\"Dog Eat Dog\\". But the best song on the album is \\"Christmas at Ground Zero\\".

After three top selling CD's, (The same named \\"Al\\"-bum, \\"'Weird Al' Yankovic\\", \\"In 3-D\\", and his best so far, \\"Dare to be Stupid\\"), Al was in demand for a new and funny album, so he threw all of these rushed songs together into a 10 song album, by far his worst.

What follows is the most famous (or infamous) counter-insurgency campaign in recent history. The Selous Scouts were the finest counter-insurgency force ever to take to the field and hunt down guerillas. LTC Reid-Daly has written an honest, detailed account that draws the reader's interest on the first page and never lets go. This book is a must read for any military historian.

Playing the flute is fun AND easy!","review":"Scott makes playing the flute a treat with this instructional book on flute playing. It had been about twelve years since I'd picked up my dusty, tarnished flute, and I admit that I had forgotten everything I learned. After the first few lessons, I was hooked again! My husband was shocked that I could remember so quickly, but it's not me, it's the book!The book goes through the necessary steps including how to make a sound (which is easier said than done), fingering, charts, and the language of music. It is simple, fun and you'll be anything but frustrated! It may be a bit juvenile (come on, the first songs you learn are \\"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\\" and so on) but it is still a very worthwhile investment. If you're serious about learning to play the flute, this is the beginner's book of choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small miracles everywhere","review":"Lydia Davis's second short stories collection displays a fine tuning of her talents for minimalism. In the 51 stories - some short, and some shorter - \\"Almost no memory\\", she digs deep into the human condition and the beauty of everyday life. Each word counts and makes a point.\\"Lord Royston's Tour\\", for instance, is a beautifully traveling account through Eastern Europe. This is story is placed right after \\"To Reiterate\\", a single-page comment - rather than a story - about traveling accounts. Story after story resonates in the reader's mind, because together they bring a mural of human life. Some of them are interconnected by characters and/or places.In \\"Almost no memory\\" Davis uses a fist person voice that makes the stories sound like confessions, as if she was opening her heart to the reader. In her first book, \\"Break it down\\", she also uses this approach that is very effective in her hands building a straight connection between writer and reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"critics may praise, but....","review":"I have heard such good things about Lydia's short stories that I almost feel the need to apologize for writing this, as it seems that I am the dissenting voice.Plain and simply, I could not get into this book. After each story I expected the next to get better, I looked for a saving grace, but I found none. Her voice is a departure away from the usual and that is refreshing, but I could'nt get over the feeling that anyone might sit down and write something much like this. There are some books I have not enjoyed at first reading, only to go back to them at another time, in another mood and found that my feelings had changed. I am sorry to say this was the case with Almost No Memory. I even found it difficult to finish, but I wanted to give this book the benefit of the doubt, a last chance to redeem itself.I would not say it was a waste of time, but I can say that it was worth my time , either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfectly Good, Boring, Collection of Stories","review":"If this type of short fiction is hailed as masterful, intriguing, exquisite, etc., then I must be missing something here. Davis is indeed, a good writer, but, I feel nothing for these sketches and the characters that inhabit them. If she is portraying the emptiness that so many people feel today, then she is masterful! But, what strikes me more than anything is a formula that she has contrived to be her 'style' and this leaves me very cold and amused that so many find this type of writing anything more than a mental exercise on the mundane. Her deliberate lack of emotion and endless trivial details in these stories leaves very little in my own mind or heart to mull over. Maybe Lydia Davis has been a housewife too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book should be re-titled: \\"Almost No Point\\"","review":"Our Book Club read this and gave it the lowest rating of any book we have read in the last five years.

He does really interesting things with his voice on all the tracks -- there is so much versatility!My favorite songs are \\"Night of Our Lives,\\" a beautiful ballad, \\"Change All of That,\\" which has some terrific background vocals and instrumentation, and \\"Revelations.\\" David wrote many of the songs, but others are written by other artists, like Philip Bailey, Josh Kadison, Jay Oliver and Michael Kamen.The liner notes include David's tribute to background vocalists, probably the most extensive list of background vocalists in the world. They also have some interesting stories about David's early years as a singer.I highly recommend this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations exceeded","review":"(...) For a collection of demos, this album holds up better than a lot of standard concept albums. David Lasley's smooth, soaring, effortless voice for the most part covers up the lack of a real band. His voice is always dead-on pitch and full of soul.David also proves himself as a songwriter, co-writing the majority of the tracks.Stand-out tracks include the funky Revelations, the heartfelt Joey (I Believe In Our Love) and the inspiring hymn-like Change All That.The album is full of catchy songs with great vocal arrangements.For beautiful vocal artistry, get this album.Go on, I'll wait here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Providing a series of spiritual messages","review":"Shapiro's spiritual experience resulted in her production of a journal transcribing the thoughts that were reaching her from beyond.

The first group of pictures I took came out fuzzy when I downloaded them. I thought it was just my not knowing how to use the camera.... not the case, the next times I used the camera and downloaded them I got the same thing.Another Feature(?) is the auto shut off. I was on vacation and tried using it for pictures of action. I didn't want the continuous pictures so I used the regular point and shoot mode. When it got to a part that I was wanting to photograph the camera had shut off, causing me to have to go through the whole cycle of setting up the flash, pixels, and the amount of light etc.I will probably end up giving my 9 year old this camera and will buy myself a \\"real\\" digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera","review":"This camera is nice.

My Father would have loved this watch. It was kind of a joke gift for me, and yet I have come to rely on it every day. It has a great speaking voice to tell you the time, funny alarm sounds like the Rooster Alarm to wake you up, and a nice glossy gold look. It's a great gift for anyone hard-of-hearing, and they will love the look and sturdy feel of this great watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Quiet","review":"I bought this pocket watch for my legally blind father-in-law. The watch is attractive and keeps good time. The alarm (especially the rooster) is reasonably loud. The voice telling the time (upon pushing a button) is clear and speaks slowly enough to be easily understood.However, I can't recommend this watch because the voice telling the time is too quiet. Since many of the intended users will be elderly, with failing vision AND failing hearing, this is a serious problem.

He ends up chasing all over Wyoming and Colorado to sort out the whole mess. The plot is excellently written so that the reader can discover the clues and put them together just as Sam is doing. In addition, this book adds great characters like the Doc and Jake and explains more of Sam's past.Again, Sam seeks to uncover deeper truths. However, the truths he discovered in the first book don't seem to have been absorbed and he relearns half of what he should have already figured out. That can be a little tiring, but generally it isn't so bad.Finally, (perhaps I just did not get it) but the title of the book absolutely baffled me. Sure, it's referred to once or twice, but it didn't seem to fit with anything else.

I found it predictable and the physical relationship gratuitous. This is not a Shinn book I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"a parody","review":"The characters in this book were paperthin and stereotypical for their professions. Every thought and action was predictable, but not necessairly realistic. That the Fidele heroine, Laura, did a lot of walking at all hours of the night and the hero spent a lot of time cruising around in this car at the same time didn't do much to develop their characters, nor was their behaviour credible in view of their action-packed days. The hero's social and diplomatic skills portrayed in the book wouldn't have worked for a pre-schooler, let alone for a clearly delicate interplanetary mission. The obvious analogy between Interfed and The good ole US of A. didn't work for me being the wise, magnanimous and powerful entity until I started to read the book as a parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite of Shinn's Novels","review":"Sharon Shinn is the sort of writer I go to when I've had a bad day. Her stories are, quite frankly, nothing wildly new or unpredictable. But I don't go to them for novelty. I go to them for a kind of literary equivalent of a warm blanket.This novel did more for me than the vast majority of her stories, which really are just...a literary warm blanket. In it, there's an at least moderately interesting discussion of different types of faiths and way of expressing them in a way that is complimentary rather than divisive. It's nice. It's warm and fuzzy. It made me happy.Is it great literature? Probably not.

I scoured the web for something that would get the job done -- the Swatch seemed to fit the bill. Not so. I am appauled with the sound quality. It is very bad. Both the outgoing and incoming messages are muddy. Don't confuse volume for clarity. The volume can reach high levels, which is nice. However, because the messages are so muddy, it is very difficult to hear what is being said, despite playing it at a high volume. I can't believe that some company can't manufacture a DIGITAL answering machine that is high quality, and sounds as good, or better than a tape machine. I'm willing to pay for one if it exists.

The presence of Sebastian Bach alone signals hilarious trouble. The loss of Trevor and Cory is handled well enough (Twiggy Alien Cory does an admirable job, but it's Philadelphia Collins that really creates some laughs with his huge belly and love of greasy burgers).Bubbles loses his mind bit by bit and some episodes end with great \\"what the heck??!!\\" moments. All in all, it's a shame this could be the end of the show, but only because they were still capable of creating consistently funny episodes leading to a great closing episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canada's Seinfeld","review":"A friend from work got me interested in this show, unfortunately after they stopped filming the 7th season. If the US weren't so uptight about marijuana and petty thievery this show might have gone bigger, but after seeing a couple episodes I was hooked. Luckily Amazon has the whole regular season set for a decent price. From Ricky's mis-phrased witticisms to Mr. Lahey's sh*tisms, this show is packed with all sorts of laughs.

Sorry to report that the Hong Kong Symphony was not up to the task when this recording was made back on 1985. This sounds more like an early orchestra rehearsal versus a recording performance; there is out-of-tune playing from all sections almost constantly.

It is a book you will never forget, and documented reveiw on a woman the world have loved since the beginning of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Experience...","review":"I bought this item from Acedepot at Amazon.com, and had a terrible experience:1. The item received was not the item we ordered2. Acedepot does not have all the items shown as \\"In stock\\"3. Poor Quality Control... some items appear to be broken on origin, yet they're sent out to customers4. You'll be forced to follow through closely in order to get them to refund you money backDealing with Acedepot was such a waste of time, I would never buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great albums of all time.","review":"Quirky hip-hop meets sublime acid jazz in a creative, subversive, sometimes humorous, and possibly psychotic masterpiece.This album was a jaw-dropper the first time I heard it, and still absorbs me every time I play it. Solid all the way through, but not for everybody. There's stuff in here that will scare some people off, but for the rest of us, it's therapeutic, allowing listeners to get in touch with their inner sociopath and blow some steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bachata para todos los gustos-buen disco de verdad","review":"For a compilation cd, I must say it is wonderful. This is the first of this series by J & N records (the originators of the Merenhits series) and they definitely have showcased the best of the best. I was particularly impressed with the sequence of top bachatas one after the other which would make for great listening in any type of setting. The only surprise is that some of the bachatas are from '98 and for a newly launched series it may have been more attractive to have the newest and latest bachatas but other than that this cd is a winner. I highly recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dulce Sensasion","review":"Great CD overall, all the tracks but one are potential #1 HITS. Best Tejano/Spanish language I have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's much better out there now","review":"Who picked these songs? For Dominican music, many of them have a strangely Mexican sound. And some of the songs are rather rough-- stress that doesn't fall on the right part of the word, etc. You can do much better than this these days-- try \\"Bachata #1's\\" for a mix of modern artists (with Monchy y Alexandra and Xtreme heavily represented) or the \\"Rough Guide to Bachata\\" for a wider selection of more traditional (but still recent) sound. Even \\"Bachatahits 2002\\" is much better than this disc. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME ...

The collar does not lay correctly and the faux fur on the collar is not wearable. The material is not as nice as it sounded or looked and after wearing it twice, the coat looks older already. Wrikles and looks as if it is dirty and it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great versatile jacket","review":"My wife wasn't too thrilled when she saw the faux fur collar - but as soon as she took it off, the jacket came to life for her. Once the fur is gone, you are left with a stylish Mandarin collar on a cute short coat perfect for cool weather (though long enough to cover hips and midriff)."},{"rating":"1","title":"it looks awful","review":"The color is totally different from described on the website. The size is huge, I bought an extra-small, it is still too big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, well made!","review":"I just received this jacket and I'm very grateful to the reviewers who noted it runs large. I ordered a small black, normally I would have ordered a medium and it fits perfect. It is very well made for the price as it looks and feels much more expensive. When it is on a friday sale again, I will order the grape and spice color without hesitation. An added plus for me was the detachable fur collar, although it dresses it up a bit with it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The size is inaccurate!","review":"I am not happy with the purchase. The SX size is more like S - M. Although the fabric feels soft. If you can wear regular S size and above, this is still a nice jacket for the price if you need one. This is atleast one size larger than stated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A find!","review":"I don't know what everyone else usually pays for a jacket but this one is hard to beat. I have had nothing but compliments on this jacket and am enjoying it immensely. It is very warm and nicely finished. I read some negative comments about the fur collar, it is detachable if you don't like it. I have paid more for a casual sweater and not gotten near the use I have out of this jacket. I would buy one for each of my girls if they were still available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some nice obscure funk","review":"This CD is definitely a worthwhile purchase. There are some good funk cuts, with and without vocals. The real treats are cuts by artists like the meters, and in particular a song by the band that Bootsy Collins was in before joining the Funkadelic squad. Groovy. Also, length is a plus in that it is over 70 min long. I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"History in the making","review":"This old school is not for everyone, but once you really listen to it you can see where all todays big players get there stuff from.

It is a must read for all believers in Christ! Highly reccomended"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Size Does Not Fit All","review":"There is no question that Dave Roberson enjoys praying. On the other hand, the Bible clearly states that not everybody is given the gift of speaking (or praying!) in tongues. 1 Corinthians 12 clearly identifies speaking in tongues as a supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit, but ALSO states that not everybody will receive this gift. When Brother Roberson starts to reinterpret the scriptures to say what he wants them to say (all people should be able to pray in tongues if they just ask God long enough), instead of just accepting what the Bible does say, for me he crosses the line between prayer warrior and false teacher. All Christians have been promised gifts of the Holy Spirit, but speaking in tongues is just one of them, and it is clearly identified by Paul as not even the best of them. Let's eagerly desire more of God's presence in our lives, and gratefully accept whatever He, in His mercy and wisdom, chooses to give us. (1 Cor. 12:31)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pray in tongues more!!!","review":"This book is very enlightening in the area of praying in the Holy Ghost and why it's so importent. Everytime I read it I just want to stop and pray. There are a few things that may challenge some people's theology in some areas, but I've found it to be mostly right on every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"scripture on tongues","review":"The BEST teaching on the biblical application of tongues in the life of a believer I have ever seen. Most authors inject lots of opinion, and snatch and grab scriptural references that are usually taken out of context with the train of thought in scripture. This book is 100% correct with scripture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely informative and enjoyable","review":"The book has numerous photos in color and black & white and easy to understand text. The author covers a variety of aspects of crop circles such as physical and emotional effects, animals reactions to, hoaxes (and how to tell them from the real thing), mechanical failures, missing time and \\"other dimensional\\" experiences. There are also many eye witness testimonies which lend even more credence to an unusual phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crop Circle Hoax","review":"The VERY FIRST crop circles were made by pranksters with ropes and boards. They have video taped footage of themselves doing it. Did the aliens then pick up on and improve on this method of \\"communicating\\" with pretty circles, or is it all just a big hoax that certain conspiracy addicts refuse to see?Open your eyes. It's a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heavenly movie!","review":"A nice story, a cute dog, a beautiful Jane Seymour and a very funny Chevy Chase. And a VERY good soundtrack"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is unexpected","review":"I first saw this film in 1994 on Sky movies. It's a lovely film, which tells of Chevy Chase as a private investigator who gets killed accidentally one day on an investigation and for some reason returns as a dog called 'Benji'. Later he meets Jane Seymour and tries to be her pet dog, but she can tell there's something more than what she sees. Later she dies solving his case and finding his murderer, but she too gets turn into a lovely cat to be Benji's life time partner. I recommend you buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not heavenly but definitely a dog !!!","review":"Joe Camp should hang his head in shame for making this piece of trash. I assumed it would be good because he has made good clean family films before. This ain't one of them. This film has indecency in it and is not fit for family viewing. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog in name and quality","review":"Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"This light is Junk","review":"This streamlight is a Chinese piece of junk that is not at all like my original streamlight, I've already replaced the bulb with the spare provided, it gets extremely hot, I mean the whole light gets hot not just the bulb part! If you don't have the adjustable lens screwed all the way tight then it keeps dimming and is just annoying and when it is all the way screwed in tight the light is spread out all over so you really can't see long distances. This thing is junk and I wish I never bought it! I do not blame the seller but I do blame streamlight for making junk now and also not honoring the lifetime warranty they use to offer! Chinese Junk like everything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on overall Asian aesthethic","review":"This book digs deep into the theory of how to accomplish incorporating Asian design into you lifestyle.

The music on Chicago 3 is entirely new to me because there are no major hits on this album that laymen know. Their use of horns is as always supreb and having live recordings in the Cd (evident because can hear Terry Kath talking in the backgroud before some of the songs) gives this album a somewhat raw feel while at the same time soundinging the polished finished product. Did i mention that this album has 23 songs on it, much more that many CDs of current day bands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more funky than normal and more like a jam session","review":"This album is not as well thought out as the previous albums, but has some great energy before the band started getting moreinto ballads and pop songs. Not as good as the second album but worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats \\"modern\\" rock everytime","review":"I was at one of their concerts recently and was reminded just how good their music is.

I would listen to this cd first before purchase, if i was a new comer to this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Remastering","review":"I compared the new Rhino Chicago III CD to the original vinyl record. The CD is definitely an improvement over the record. It is substantially clearer and seems to have a somewhat extended range. This was a pleasant surprise to me because the Columbia CD versions of Chicago V and Chicago VI were actually duller that the records as though they were made from copies of copies the master tape. Rhino's Chicago III seems to have come from the original master to me. The music itself made a bit of a sensation when it was released with songs such as \\"Lowdown,\\" \\"Sing a Mean Tune Kid,\\" \\"Free,\\" and some others. There are more Chicago classics here though. \\"What Else Can I Say,\\" and \\"At the Sunrise,\\" are two of the better compositions that received less attention in my opinion. I wasn't one of their best recordings technically, and it contains some unusual material, but it is a great record overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"This great","review":"The 1st 3 cd of Chicago to me are there best work. I have all of them on LP this round of great them on cd. It is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Format disappoints","review":"Why does this DVD give only the version that is \\"formatted to fit your TV screen\\"? What a disappointment!

Watching it over, there so much more to it and the scenery is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with wonderful performances by supporting cast.","review":"I just love this movie; Jessica Lange blows you away with her performance and the supporting cast, including Fredric Forrest, are terrific. I highly recommend this movie, it is part of my vast collection and I watch it frequently. The music/score is just right also."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"This is my favorite Jessica Lange movie. It delves into the conflicted feelings of a daughter who loves her father but is confronted with evidence that is at odds with her image of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this Widescreen film in Full Screen format????","review":"This film contains the best performance of Jessica Lange's auspicious career hands down. This was also American audiences introduction to the wonderful Armin Mueller-Stahl in the role of Lange's father. Thank goodness I saw this film on the big screen, and then later on the Widescreen Laserdisc. I have never seen this film panned and scanned, and i refuse to now, even though it has been released on DVD. So, unless Artisan Home Video intends on re-releasing this outstanding film in the correct 2.35:1 aspect ratio and in the 16x9 format, they are not getting my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT WERE THE DISTRIBUTORS THINKING?","review":"I own this film on Laserdisc. It is in WIDESCREEN 2:35 anamorphic presentation. I once saw a VHS version in full screen. Awful! In a world where widescreen and 16x9 are common even for the most dopiest of films that Hollywood puts out, didn't anyone have the sense to care about its original aspect ratio? Guess not.I did find a region 2 PAL DVD version from Spain that does offer it in WIDESCREEN; runs about $29 with shipping. I ordered it because it's unlikely this film will be redistributed here in widescreen anytime soon. Classic film with great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing film with great performances.","review":"I watch this movie each time it comes on to see the two lead performers work magic. The characters are well-drawn and the actors make you care about them. The story is compelling; it kept me guessing till the end. It's also good as a pseudo history lesson about some of the atrocities of WWII and how it still affects people today. I highly recommend this drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Rocky Rocky","review":"This CD has gotten my wrestling team through some tough workouts.

The whole CD is great and you should check out \\"Vision Quest\\" too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning. Limited orchestration","review":"The first five tracks of this CD are songs by the original artists, and I'm sure any avid Rocky fan would want to have them in their collection. The last FOUR tracks of the album sound like tinny synthesized versions of the wonderful orchestral pieces from the movies. No rich strings, brass or booming timpani...not even close to the versions I hear on DVD. I feel like scammed. Yes, it's the original Soundtrack SONGS from the Rocky movies, but it's nowhere near the original orchestral soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is perhaps the most underrated soundtrack of all time.","review":"I love to workout and listen to music. Therefore, this soundtrack was a nobrainer. If you love music, or simply love to listen to inspiring music, or love the Rocky movies, you'll love this CD. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocky IV Music with Some Imitation Bill Conti Music","review":"While this \\"Anthology\\" of Rocky movie music is mostly satisfying, it falls short of capturing the real heart and soul of what makes Rocky movie music so compelling and distinctive. Presented here are the best vocal tracks from Rocky III and IV, which are worthy additions to any music collection. Also included are two Bill Conti imitation tracks of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", both I might add, clearly inferior to the original.I bought this album thinking I could get the best of the Rocky music without having to buy all the originals. What I found is that the originals are what makes makes Rocky movie music so distinctive. Rather than purchase this album, I'd buy the original Rocky IV and the original Rocky soundtrack; there is more music, and it is all \\"real\\" Rocky music. Another option is to purchase the latest Rocky Anthology, \\"Rocky Balboa\\".Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE SOUNDTRACK - EVER!!!","review":"Well, what can i say.

This collection is like the Rocky IV soundtrack!","review":"The first time I bought \\"The Rocky Story\\" on cassette, I thought this was like the collection from \\"Rocky I to III\\", but I was wrong! The first side contains 5 songs from the \\"Rocky IV\\" soundtrack, in which I don't like. The both tracks \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" on the other side don't sound like the Bill Conti version from the Rocky I CD. If you're into the best Rocky scores, PASS this one and get the CDs from Rocky I, II, and III. Those CDs are from my fave composer Bill Conti. And THAT's the con about the Rocky Story! And darn it, this one doesn't have \\"Take You Back\\", \\"Pushin'\\" from Rocky III, \\"Overture\\" (The beginning suite from Rocky II), \\"Redemption\\" from Rocky II, and a few I can't mention! Like I said, get the Rocky I, II, and III CDs for the REAL Rocky Story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Instrument Liberties","review":"I loved Bill Conti's orginial Rocky scores.

I suggest going back and buying each individually -- the instrumentation is far superior to this collection of electronic junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggg... Why did I buy this??","review":"Okay, here is the straight story on this CD... We all love the Rocky music (and I do too), and this CD has a bunch of music from the various movies BUT some of the tracks sound terrible. Most dissapointing is the GONNA FLY NOW which must have been synthetically reproduced because the horns sound like they are under water. I wish I had just bought a copy of the First Movie sound track for GONNA FLY NOW and a copy of the 4th movie track for Survivor Songs and \\"No way Out.\\" That would be my recomendation for future shoppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye of the Tiger!","review":"When I'm working out at home I have Eye of the Tiger on repeat.

He does this in all of his works, from the Western Civilization pamphlets he wrote in the late 1970's, to the periodic letters he addresses to the University School Community. Papers from the Headmaster once again fits into the mold of Hawley's better piece's, perhaps his best published work so far. His tales of boys who he has come into contact to during his three decade teaching career are amazing, particularly of the tales of Dave Chollet. Although most of these stories Dr. Hawley shares are recylcled from his speaches he gives during morning assembly at University School, they are still elequently crafted and Pulitzer Prize worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your brown shoes somewhere else","review":"This is a wonderful, imaginative, creative take on an old tale. Nicholson is great -- charming, sly, knowing & on top of each character, McFerrin is pure lyric, his vocal skills put to perfect use here, & the whole production is enough to stop you in your tracks. Unless, of course, you have a zombie agenda -- the stubby mustachioed desire to dictate all that happens in the world around you, to re-write history to your preconceptions. Too much whacking? How about you get a real life, load up on the amazing, the unexpected, the delightful, the instantaneous & then try this. Yup, it'll never live up to any PC ideas. It may not be the definitive telling of this story (though I know of no better & don't expect any real soon), but it is a totally charming variation if you are still breathing when you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have already started reading it to my 6 month old grandbaby","review":"The illustrations are lovely and I can't wait until my granddaughter begs for me to read this to her as a bed time story!

We gave our 3 year old daughter the video narrated by Jack Nicholson (music by Bobby McFerrin) for Xmas and she just loved it and begged for the book, which she has now almost completely memorized. It's a delightful story about a curious and independent minded young elephant who follows his imagination and gains tremendously as a result. This book introduced us to the wonderful world of Rudyard Kipling books for children that answer some of their \\"why\\" questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny and delightful story","review":"Spanking or no, this is one of our very favorite books. People who get hung up on the spanking aspect of the book are missing the whole point of the story, and that, in part, is that you can't deny a child their curiosity, or you will pay for it \\"in the end\\". Jack Nicholsen was the perfect choice for narrating this story, too, he really made it come alive, esssspecially the bi-colored, python rock sssnake. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, so-so.","review":"This movie was very informative. I read the story, and thought that it was better than the movie. For me, the movie spoiled the whole story. I did not approve of the way that Jack Nicolson changed \\"insatiable curtiosity\\" to \\"satiable curiosity.\\" I think that since it was Rudyard Kipling's intention that it should be written the way it was, then Nicolson should have kept it the way it was.The animation wasn't really animation but a bunch of pictures that moved around.

Jackie is scary and dangerous one minute and oozing charm the next. He is the highlight of this movie for me but all of the performances are great. The viewer is dragged into the gritty underworld of a UK metropolis and dragged through many sordid episodes. Not for the squeamish but it is a dark study in crime and retribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"Since I work for a police department the whole \\"drug\\" theme of this movie was a little too close to home for me.

They seem to work fine, and they passed Intel's software check for cable quality for Intel add-in gigabit ethernet cards. For whatever that test is worth. The only reason I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 is that the anti-snag cover for the connector clip does not cover the sides of the protruding clip, but only its top - this means that the cover can get pushed off to the side to expose the clip, when you are pulling the cable.

The author does not appear to have published any related work in the last four or five years, and I have not found any pointers to updated software on the Web (probably because the book predates the web).

Talk about childish!! My 10 year old cousin could read these book!!! V.C. could not possibly have had ALL of these books just lying around her home. Whoever decided to write for her should STOP or get some real material. The Orphans series is the best so far, but poor V.C. must be turning over in her grave about these so called \\"books\\".

So Wuthering Heights - in wuthering heights this chick called CATHERINE (a book written 100 years ago by the way) was locked in an attic - okay, the fire in the third book? So very much alike the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre...Yeah, the only revealing truth is that modern 'writers' fail to use this title for talent but instead of sleazy propaganda trash (ie: this novel).

I can't believe I actually thought I was going to like this thing! This is one of those books with sick, twisted, demented characters who do sick things. *Do not read this book* under any circumstances! Here's a brief synopsis. The book starts out with the mother getting pregnant, the main character throwing a hissy fit because she thinks she will lose some attention, then the father dying. I can't and won't explain everything going on in the family at this point, but the kids are brought into three rooms to stay until the grandfather dies. From here, it just goes downhill, and the ending violently hits rock bottom. I just wanted to cry when I realized that I had to stick around for 411 pages. I cannot stress my final point enough: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the stupidest book that I have ever read....","review":"Trust me that is saying a lot I have read many stupid books. How did this author even get published? How did this book spawn sequel after sequel? I DID read the entire book, I was really bored. I just couldn't get past the crappy plot and idiotic dialog (especially from the kids). If you are even thinking of reading this book please don't. Something, anything is better then this book. Something off the Opera book club list is better, or the bible or even the owners manual from the glove box of your car.Overall-This book should be banned as an insult to the intelligence of every single human being on the face of this planet. In fact the only thing on the planet worse then this book is the movie based on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taboo Topic","review":"This book is about incest between a brother and sister.

I read it several times and I can see how it would appeal to younger people. But as an African American, I find the VC Andrews books are so racist, its shocking how so many read it and scary as hell why they dont see it. I mean the author meantions blue eyes and blond hair on every other page! The single black character was not even given an identity! She had no life, no ability to speak...you know, just the typical, 300 pound, fat big black woman that has no life except to take care of dem good ole pretty little white children. Give me a break. The brother and sister are so beautiful and lonely that they fall in love with eachother and screw in the attic...inbreeders!...just like mom and pop!...and the sickest part is that this racist garbage sold millions.

If this book taught me anything it taught me just how in love white people are with themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK!","review":"I'm 14, and I read this book a year ago.

The moment I started reading it, I couldn't put the book down!! Reading the book itself has made me think more maturely. The book may be a fiction but I know that characters in that book exist in the real world. I feel that every character in that book reflects some part of our own lives. We often think we are better than the rest and holier than other people, selfish, arrogant and lust..I guess we are just deceiving ourselves if we say we do not have that sin. In short, this book is just awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is the second of a magnificent series of five books. Never, has a novel haunted me like this one. It will stay with you years after you read it. The story is deeply touching and sad. I have never wanted a villian to pay so much for her actions as much as I did in this book. I find myself rereading these books at night when I cannot sleep and I am once again awed and bewildered by the tale of four children alone in an attic. Many people are turned off by the incest. I find it realistic, sad and intriguing. Books are supposed to explore the dark, complicated, intense desires of humans. If they didn't, the book would lack power and would fall flat on its face. Don't let that aspect turn you off. This book is priceless. I will be lucky to read another story even half as beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"VCA's best ever","review":"This was the first book written by Virginia Cleo Andrews that got published. Alright all the characters are great. Cathy is a very powerful herione,Chris is the intelligent one,Carrie and Corey are imseperable. This book is about survival. After their father dies Corrine(their mother) tells the children that they are to move in with their grandfather who is filthy rich and they will live a wonderful life. However to their horror they are to stay in the attic where there grandfather will never know about them. Because they were born out of sin,incest. They stay in that attic for over 3 years. It deals with starvation,abuse,murder,and incest."},{"rating":"2","title":"KKKK","review":"I haven't read this book, but i have a coomment to the African American person.

Don't read this. It's poisonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LIKED the grandmother!!","review":"It is probably because I read Seeds of Yesterday, first. I totally understand her personality flaws, not of her own doing.I can also understand why she hated her spoiled daughter and her inbred incestious grandchildren. Why did she have to put up with them? They proved her to be right in the latter books, they were selfish, mentally imbalanced and evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick book","review":"One sick book! Tells of brother, sister sex, starving small children, with a disgusting plot. I would suggest a Danielle Steel book as V.C Andrew's books have the same dull thread... dead parents, kids end up with an evil care taker along with some incest to thicken the plot. Very dull read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult classic neo-gothic trash really satisfies.","review":"When I was in High School just about every one of my female classmates read FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC and its sequels. Recently I took the plunge and found out why, it's a great read! With its young, sexually and emotionally frustrated teen heroine held captive by a selfish, emotionally childish and manipulative mother and a stern, hateful grandmother, it is easy to see why this novel resonates so powerfully with female teen readers. The horrorific themes of abuse (both phsycial and mental) and incest are handled well and the book packs a surprising emotional wallop. The writing is very uneven and immature, but whether this is a stylistic choice or simply the author's own bad writing is hard to tell. Just be forewarned, the reader may want to have the sequel Petals on the Wind close at hand. Flowers in the Attic ends on a cliffhanger and you might want to read the next volume ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Awesome book, ive been looking for this forever, and they knew just where to find!!!!thanks sooo much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"This book was great! If your looking for a book that has to do with family then this is the book you want. It's about a girl that's father dies and they have to move in with their mothers mom. It turns out the mom's dad doesn't know the kids exist so they have to hide in the attic for a long time. The brother and sister get really close...maybe even too close.Kinda weird but it was still and awesome,thrilling, interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers in the Attic - a definite 5 star book","review":"My mother picked this book up for me a long time ago, saying that she read it when she was about my age. Thinking that it would be a sappy romance or a self-help book in disguise, I turned to page one. I couldn't put the book down, and I have reread the book many times. It my favorite by V.C. Andrews, and it is up with the ranks of classics like Angela's Ashes, Lord of the Rings, and To Kill a Mockingbird for my favorite book.It is a very sad, tragic, unforgettable book; the children are betrayed time and time again by their mother and grandmother, and face years in a dark and gloomy attic, waiting for their grandfather to die. It is an adult book with adult situations, so if someone is considering purchasing this for a kid, consider his or her maturity level before you buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky!","review":"I really loved this book, but it was totally freaky. I was about 14 when I read it and I just read it again, and now I'm 17. It's just really freaky and sad.

This is a MUST have!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!!!!!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book that will have you trapped right from the first page.It's about four children who are locked away in the attic for four years by there selfish mother and wicked grandmother.

I never wanted their story to end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book - I believe it appeals to people who can identify with sadness and melancholia.It is beautifully written with awesome descriptions - it is as though the author was attempting to make you feel as though you were there.Aside from the great writing style, the story itself is really imaginative and keeps you interested.Also the author shows great insight into behaviour patterns and relates the behaviour of the \\"mother\\" as a narcissistic personality.If you are wondering whether or not to buy this book I think you should go for it because you may enjoy it a lot or even love it.Although some people hate this book with a passion at least they are not indifferent - not many could be indifferent regarding this book... Now THAT sums it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book On The Market","review":"This book was the best book i've ever gotten my hands on. I just couldn't put it down.

All of VC Andrews books are about incest! How can anyone think the relationship between Cathy and Christopher is beautiful...its gross!!! As another reader pointed out, how many normal people would actually sleep with his/her sibling after seeing him/her 24/7. I am ashamed to say I have even read this book! If you want a book that is beautiful and worthwhile to read, don't look at books by VC Andrews...before and after her death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick book.","review":"This was the teenage cultural book of the 80's but unfortunately it is a sick book. I read it when I was about 14 or 15 and did enjoy it at the time. However, much of the book is too influential on teens. I would not recommend this book. Sex is taken too lightly (especially later in the series) and the story is rather grotesque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a good car wreck","review":"This is a terrible book for readers of any age, yet morbid curiosity prompted me to read the whole thing and write a chapter-by-chapter synopsis on my web site (eugene.hopelessloser.com).A very excellent book by the most talented writer of her generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I HAVE To Give It A Star?!","review":"Yes, I mean that. I really hate to have to give this book ANY stars at all! My awesome friend thought that I should read it, and I did, and the whole time I was going through the pages, I kept reminding myself of my vow to finish it. I kept hoping that it would get better on the next page, and then on the next page, and then on the next page, BUT IT NEVER DID. The story was ridiculous, too far out there, and it was very poorly written. And there was even one part that was just downright OFFENSIVE, and anyone who knows me knows that I do NOT offend easily at all. I just... hated. this. book. So much. It took me eight weeks to read (literally), because it was that downright AWFUL. Alright, I'm done ranting now. Just, I highly recommend that no one else ever read this book. You will desperately cry and scream for the last [however long it takes you] of your life back. The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't zero stars an option?","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a co-worker. It did have potentially redeeming shock value, but the story is not even well-enough conceived or plausible enough to be shocking or offensive. It's just unspeakably bad. I can say in great confidence that it's the stupidest, most useless piece of garbage I have ever read, and that anyone who enjoyed it -let alone considers it a \\"modern classic\\", as I was assured it was- should avoid holding political office or any position requiring intelligence and good judgment. In fact, you should just lock yourself in an attic (preferably without relatives) to prevent procreation."},{"rating":"1","title":"ponderous","review":"I picked up this book because I had seen the movie years ago, and it is sick. But the book is ponderous and pretentious and reads like a bad workshop fiction. I had great hopes, but they were dashed like a... you get the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demented.... Disgusting....","review":"What is wrong with American society that people enjoy reading such a sick and twisted novel. It is well-written, I'll admit. Andrews had talent, if only she could have devoted her talent to something worthwhile, rather than cruelty, incest, murder, etc.For those of you who are now so interested you can't wait to get copy and find out WHAT incest, WHAT cruelty.... shame on you.What would Freud have to say about this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different reason for incest","review":"Yeah, ok, so this book was a little far from my tastes. I mean, I am not really into this stuff. Actually, male/on/male stuff is my personal favorite.But this was not bad. Kathy and Chris had no choice really, being locked up like that for years, and teenage boys can get horny and girls can get lonely and there you have it. BOOM! Full blown incest. Being young and gulible can have great consequences but I never thought that it could be this serious.Throuhout the book sometimes you get the feeling that they should get together, even if it's just to spit in the face of their retarded aunt/grandma. Nevermind morality; let's go screw our own relatives. Interesting concept. Doesn't agree with my views, but what the hell? It was food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"Let's see, what do we have?

Miller Place, NY","review":"I highly recommend Flowers in the Attic if you like to read about mystery and adventure. The book Flowers in the Attic was a outstanding book. I enjoyed reading this book because it left you with cliff hangers at almost every chapter that made you want to keep on reading. I also liked the book because the ending was a surprise to me. I never thought that was how the book would turn out. The book also gives you very vivid descriptions of the characters. I felt like I knew the characters personally as I was reading about them. The way the author describes the setting of where they are in the book also painted a vivid picture in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers in the attic...","review":"It was a pretty good book. I'm a big V.C Andrews fan. My mom said that that book gave her nightmares. I thought it was really good.

The story itself is very unique, and I recently bought Petals on the Wind and I am anxious to read it. I was left with a few questions though, like How could the Mother do it?, etc. This book, to me, was so great, you feel like you are with the children and you can feel their grief and pain.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Swan Dive Into The Very Depths of Humanity","review":"V.C.Andrews stooped to repulsion for a moment then brought me back to the overwhelming elation of impending hope. Every emotion I have ever felt was presented to me at the turn of each page. This book is an absolute, \\"Can't put it down\\"! I started reading it at a friends house in one town and had to let someone else drive, while I read in the car on the way back home. I had never read any book in the car before and haven't since. If you only read one book in your lifetime, this is one book you must read............ The series following is good stuff but nothing compares to \\"Flowers In The Attic\\"....

I would just like to say that this book is not racist. They are a white family with blonde hair and blue eyes, and they never go out into the world so that is really all they know.

I think it is ridiculous that race is being dragged into every aspect of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and captivating story!!","review":"Although this is my first V. C. Andrews novel, I found myself caught up in the story from the very beginning. At times, the story seemed difficult to believe, I found myself anxious to read the next chapter. I particularly like the devolpment of the children through a \\"normal\\" lifestyle and watch it transform into a \\"nightmare\\" lifestyle. The children's gullibility is exploited with the reader questioning how these poor kids could be treated this way. I disliked some of the Chapters which seemed to basically fill space serving no real purpose to the overall story(i.e. Holiday's Chapter, etc). Despite my dislike, I have quickly started reading the next book in the series.

I enjoyed reading it because it always kept me on edge. There are many things I liked about this story. One of the many things I enjoyed was the fact that that this could very well happen in real life. It's not one of those stories that has fake characters and activities that could never happen. I really liked this book better than any other fiction story I have ever read.

All of the Andrews writing is a crock, I mean Dawn and Ruby had exactly the same plot except one was staged in Louisiana and the other was in Virginia. I liked Flowers in the Attic when I was thirteen. Then I discovered real writing talent. This has got to be the worst novel ever written.

I didn't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money is the root of all evil...","review":"I read this book when I was 14 & I still remember much of it (though not all) upto these days. The 'Dresden dolls' experience was totally horrific & I couldn't imagine any mother would do that to her children in exchange for her OWN comfort (physical & financial). At age 14, I was fully aware what an incestuous relationship was, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for Chris & Cathy & wished them a happier life.After this book, I became a V.C. Andrews fan & read all sequels to this novel. The subsequent books are not as great as the original but the last, which tells the end of it all, has history repeating itself...it still has the tragic elements of the \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" but it has a peaceful & happy ending for all the surviving characters.Also read the 'prequel' to this story which centers on the grandmother & pretty much explains why she's so sinister in the \\"Flowers in the Attic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and macabre","review":"At the recommendation of many I read this and for the most part enjoyed the odd situation of this strange family. The strange family dynamics here are hard to ignore and engaging throughout most of the story. More believeable than skeptics might think. Interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this!!!","review":"This book was a very good book to read, although you need to be pretty mature to understand the themes in this book- it's still a very good book. The plot in unpredictable, and you have no idea what is going to happen next. The plot develops and interwines and makes it so intresting, once you start reading this book you will never put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD OR NOTHING","review":"TWO SEGMENTS: 1. FICTION & 2. NON~FICTION. *WARNING* YOU DO NOT WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ON VHS. IT IS CENSORED. DURING AN EXPLICIT SEX SCENE A HIDIOUS RED RECTANGLE POPS UP COVERING A VITAL PART OF THE FIRST SEGMENT. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THE SCENE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TONED DOWN IF ANYTHING. BUT COVERED UP...ONE THING ABOUT A GOOD MOVIE IS THAT YOU FORGET YOUR WATCHING A MOVIE AND YOU JUST GET SWEPT UP IN IT. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WHEN IT IS CENSORED. TO BE HONEST I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KIND OF JOKE. SO I URGE YOU TO GET THIS ON DVD AND TAKE IN THE FULL TODD SOLONDZ EXPERIANCE. IT'S WORTHY."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY GYPPED!!","review":"The movie DVD was completely blank. We tried it on 3 different DVD players and it never played. What a waste of money and unfortunately I purchased the DVD for an upcoming film production class project I had registered for so I didn't open the pack and check it right away. A total waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for DVD; 3 for the Movie","review":"I won't bother reviewing much of the actual film other than that i think the 2 halves of the movie never really gel together like they're supposed to (or are they?). Transfer of film to DVD is pretty grainy in some scenes(the nighttime ones). The back of the box claims \\"animated menus\\" but all i saw were standard NON-animated menus. I also found this DVD to be very skimpy in extras. For example, there's no director's commentary. Probably the worst thing is that the deleted scenes are excluded from the disc. The original version of the film was roughly an hour longer and featured another vignette featuring James Van Der Beek. Todd Solondz was apparently upset over the producer's cuts and blamed them for the film's lukewarm response. So where are the scenes that would complete Solondz vision? Apparently, not on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused and pointless...","review":"Todd Solondz creates a bland and rather pointless trip into the heart of suburban life. Two Unmated and drab scenes make up \\"Storytelling\\". Ultimately, both 'Fiction' and 'Nonfiction' prove a troubling path some independent filmmakers have recently embarked upon: Satiring their own dull roots into something it was not - exciting. In ending, it proves nothing more than someone taking a bad script and making it into a horrible movie with no redeeming qualities.I suggest avoiding 'Storytelling'. It's a very bad movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncaring, barely watchable","review":"I rented this b/c Franka Potente had a bit (very bit) part. I did not enjoy it at all. The director seems to be on a downhill trajectory. The characters in this film are unhappy, callow, coy, and unfortunately not engaging. Moreover, the director seems disgusted by both film making and viewing. Unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"This is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly have enjoyed it. I hated everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point","review":"My mate brought this back because of its glowing reputation, and we both sat in stunned silence as we watched this. When it was finished we looked at each other in bafflement, and then passsed a very pleasurable half hour ripping it to shreds.Perhaps it's becuase I'm a Brit, we both are. But for a film that's supposed to be darkly humourous, there isn't a laugh in it. It labours most of it's points so hard you want to get up and club it to death, and most of them you can see coming a mile off. It's just dull, the characters are unsympathetic characatures, and the plot is risable. If you want a wierd and funny college move buy \\"Battle Royal\\" instead, the Japanese do it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I said 1 star!","review":"I was deeply disappointed by this film. I bought DVD copies of Welcome to the Dollhouse and Happiness. I loved those films and I was a big fan of the director up to this point. I admired how he seemed to \\"push the limits\\" in his previous work and I came to feel that he was a good \\"storyteller\\" and had a distinct style. So, when this was first released I was very excited. And the fact that he fought very hard against the censors made me admire him more. But this work was real trash. The movie arrogantly refuses to tell a cohesive story or include worth-remembering dialogue. Dollhouse and Happiness were cynical and irreverent, but this film was just vapid and mean-spirited. Hopefully, Todd Solandz will stay away from this \\"Woody Allen-Oliver Stone bitterness spiral\\" and just try returning to making better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of itself","review":"I'll keep it short: Pointless. Dull. The first story was shaping up as quite interesting, and then it was over. The second was never interesting. In fact, the best thing in the second story was seeing the stoner from the documentary \\"American Movie\\" playing the documentary cameraman! Unfortunately, that was the funniest part of the story.Rent \\"Happiness\\". A MUCH better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a pretty picture, 2 episodes = 2 stars","review":"I found this movie to be quite disturbing in parts without necessarily having to be or adding to the overall effect of the movie, in fact, certain scenes merely showcased the directors need to shock and alienate the audience as he did so well in Happiness yet the difference is , a person can only take so much wretchedness and filth disguised as Art before the disguise itself becomes tiresome and we see this film for what it really is....2 episodes of the Jerry Springer Show cunningly played out by credible actors in an \\"American Beauty\\" like setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible, Terrible Film","review":"Please - I implore you - DO NOT waste your money on this god-awful film!

That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless film.","review":"The acting is good, but it does not help this film from being a complete waste of time. Both stories are about weak, afflicted people inflicting great emotional (and physical) pain on other people. It seems like the exploration into these awful situations are merely for shock value and don't really delve into why these people are so shallow, the only thing that would make you even feel pity for these people.I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I don't have a ton of fancy over-analytical bull for you. This movie sucked. Both seperate mini-movies were hard to watch, painful even. I know other reviewers saw much more into it, but I just couldn't feel it. I love many of the actors that played in it, but just couldn't appreciate whatever sardonic angle the director was aiming towards."},{"rating":"2","title":"...storytelling","review":"Well. Not a film that I would recommend to anyone except serious film buffs who can stomach some pretty rough material. I barely made it through one scene...however, it's tamer than Solondz's previous films.One can sense that Solondz is merely attacking his critics, and is using satire to do so. He pulls no punches, and as usual, remains as cynical as ever. The performances are great all around. The film is split into two parts, \\"Fiction\\" and \\"Non-fiction\\", which seem unrelated at first. It's not until after the film ends, that you can pick up on the subtle connections between the two. Once again, not a film that I would recommend to just anyone, but if you are familiar with Solondz at all, it's worth a shot...however, there are two scenes here that are rough and a bit gratuitous in nature. One could have been edited out all together, as it seemed to exist only for shock value and worked against the context of the film itself. That is my only criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad investment!!!","review":"I read the reviews and it seemed like this knives were worth the $59.99 I paid in August 2002. (Notice the price now!!) Now I regret having bought this set. The block and the knifes look very pretty and even work ok at first. But then even w/o washing them in the dishwasher not even 4 months later I'm noticing rust spots on them. Also they are becoming increasingly dull and the sharpener that comes w/ the set is good for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This is the worst set of knives I've ever owned.

My Farberware knives from Walmart are way better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sharp!","review":"I love that it comes with a sharpener, although the cutlery was certainly sharp enough when delivered. Also, the black block is more in keeping with today's kitchen decors than the older style butcher block.My only question is why there is an extra slot in the block, for which no knife could be found?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have studied Dietrich Bonhoeffer in depth, and this is one of the best sources of information to date that I have seen!

Most exciting was that this game had full two player game play throughout. I bought it the first day it came out and the very next day my wife and I mastered the game on hard. After mastering the game we found out there are \\"secret\\" eggs you can find - So we went through again on hard and found all the eggs. We mastered the game twice in just about 10 hours. Another thing I did not like was the way the camera follows you around and moves which makes it hard to see you character as you fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible","review":"I rented this game, because it had a lot of potential, boy was I wrong. The camera angle is a fixed position, and personally I hate fixed 3rd person style, it's nice occassionally, but to play the whole game in that, well I think I'll pass. The game, was just a really bad rip-off of The Lord of The Rings- The Return of the King. The fighting style was very similar. I personally like the games that are free roam, which this game is definately not a free roam game. If you still think you might like it, I would highly suggest renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guiness Brilliant","review":"The book was absolutely genius in so many ways...my favorite being: Rob G...as usual, he has pulled off the stunning artwork that brings this book together. Pen and ink is a terribly difficult medium to work with, and he makes it look like a walk in the park- It has effortless grace (yes, even in the zombies) and lends a herd-of-zebras chaos to the whole scheme.Hands down, one of my favorite Graphic novels of the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be much better","review":"I have read a lot of graphic novels, am a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns, and Zombie flicks. I'm also a huge fan of the RPG \\"Deadlands.\\" This books has certain similarities to the world of \\"Deadlands\\" but is no where near as detailed and creative. Even the bulls head logo bears a striking similarity to Deadlands. The story is simple, the characters stereotypical, and the plot underwhelming.I feel like the tone is also trying to strike that of the popular \\"Preacher\\" comics. But the humor and bravado are no where near as textured. It just falls flat.The graphics themselves are ok, a little messy at times, but nothing spectacular.I will say however, that the quality of he book itself is top of the line. Nice matte paper and good binding.I feel like this is the start of something really good, but it's just not there yet, and probably not worth more than 10 bucks, tops. It's a quick 1 hour read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"really coo.l VERY WELL DONE, in terms of art and story. very creative and original idea. a tribe of indians-killed by whites, then years later return as zombies to get revenge against a small western town. the tribe is brought back by a ritual preformed by the son of the chief the only surviving indian, who is now grown, and features a clint eastwood type guy (man with no name) who is a bounty hunter, and some really cool artwork . it is in b/w, but is amazing! I have a million zombie comics and this ones definitely one to check out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Effective Product","review":"This is a very effective product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is in need of a digestive solution. I used this at the recommendation of my doctor for digestive health and was very personally surprised to not need any sort of laxative or other such product in conjunction with the Bromelain even while taking an iron supplement. As a daily addition for anyone with a need to have a little bit of an easier time with digestion and a more comfortable bathroom experience this is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps to digest Protein!!!","review":"I normally can only eat 2 eggs per day without passing gas.

Wish I knew about bromelain before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically interesting, but very disappointing","review":"I suppose the book is interesting from a historical point of view - how gay life was portrayed during a certain period, etc. Unfortunately it's a great example of the \\"nothing good comes to you if you're gay\\" type of literature. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of coming-of-age stories, so I may be a bit biased.

The first time I saw that show, my jaw was to the ground. I was so amazed with that show. I'm a dancer, and to watch that show, it was just really cool. One of the main characters was Channing Tatum, (Tyler in the movie). Was before in She's the Man, (also a great show), He was a fabulous soccer player in that show. But in Step Up Channing took it up a notch, and surprised us all with his dance moves. If you haven't seen Step Up, you had better go get if from the movie store because its so worth your time!!!

By the end of the movie, I had already had the urge to buy the dvd of this movie, so that I can watch it again and again. This movie is perfect.

I choose the term video because I, using my own standards for the words, would not call this a movie or a film. The screenplay is sophomoric, and unfortunately the actors aren't up to the script's standards.

The basic idea is a bit contrived, but it works: a no-gooder teenager with a knack for rap is reluctantly coopted by a beautiful dancer in need of a partner. He will of course help her jazz up her act, she will make him a better man, and they will fall in love. Aside from annoying zigzags in Tyler's commitment (one slip is OK, but three?!), the script pulls us in. It is helped by a lot of dancing, not always great but always energetic. Rachel Griffiths is excellent in the minor role of the principal of the art school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Step up is a very okay movie at best. I'm a sucker for dance movies and thought this would be a very good movie to purchase. Over hyped music soundtracks and reviews of the movie clouded my judgment.What you got is a very mediocre story of talented goof meets hot dance girl. The story line is what it is aspected to be but what I brought this for was for the dancing, which was very limited, very unskillful, and very average quality at best. Channing Tatum does a good job as a dancer, but for someone who is suppose to be an elite at hip hop - pop lock dancing as it is protrayed, he still came off as an average dancer to me..If you want an average fill good movie (such even the brother getting shot plot, ended up being very weak in impact) this is a rental..If you want a dance movie with great dancing with a slightly better plot, wait for Stomp the Yard to be out on dvd. That will be a better to own movie by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"So, i had been waiting for awhile to see this movie and went and saw it with my best friend!

Shortly thereafter, a friend called frantically telling me she had just heard on the news that a tornado was on the ground heading directly for our house. The storm hit directly over the house and uprooted and broke many large oak trees and damaged surrounding homes and woods. There was devastation all around but miraclously our house had little damage. My point is that all through the whole experience as well as afterwards, I was incredibly calm. People who saw the area afterwards could not believe I wasn't absolutely terrified, especially since I was home alone at the time. I still look back on that experience and wonder if the wonderful, magical sounds of \\"The Silent Path\\" were responsible for my sense of calm and of feeling so connected to something higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply relaxing and healing.","review":"I was first introduced to Robert's music 5 years ago.

I haven't tried the cinnamon variety but I have heard those are even stronger. These are very \\"tea tree\\" and minty, and are really a great way to freshen your breath when you don't have a chance to brush your teeth. I always kept a pack in my car and a pack in the office and after a meal I would use them as you would use a normal toothpick. Doing so left me with cleaner feeling teeth and fresher breath.Others have recommended these chewing sticks to help cope with smoking cessation but I can not comment on this usage as I don't smoke. If you do smoke and you'd like to stop, it's worth a try! At the very least your breath will be better :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violin Making; A Practial Guide","review":"I bought this book because of the title, expecting full-well to find the measured drawings of both the templets and fixtures nessary for making a violin. What I got doesn't even come close, all I see is a person showing their skills in the art of violin making without so much as telling me how to get there. If I were already making violins and saw this book I wouldn't buy it. So for those who are looking for a place to start, this book is useless.It isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The measurements must be a secret that only those few chosen ones possess.

I had done a little jewelry work in the distant past and wanted to set up my own workshop and do some more advanced work. After much research I picked these two books and think it was the right choice.

There is way too much fluff, way too much shallow psychologizing, too many unfocused anecdotes, etc. The book is full of l---o---n---g paragraphs that ramble and stumble through way too many different thoughts. If bad writing irritates you, this is not the book for you.

I was only able to tolerate a couple of chapters before I gave up. The author tries to jazz it up with somewhat explicit sexual encounters, but it's just not enough. The writing wasn't horrible, but the character building and plot were pretty thin and uneventful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I started this book I thought I'd be able to recommend it as a light, fun read about the goings-on in a small town. It pulls you in and makes you want to find out what will happen to each of the people who have a storyline of their own. But by the end, the light, fun tone gives way to darker truths about each person, often involving explicit, and in some cases, disturbing sex acts. By the time I had finished the book I decided that I wouldn't want to be next-door neighbors with the author, who apparently creates sordid fantasies behind every person that he meets, or at least every person he sees fit to write about. I was disappointed by this book and would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't deliver","review":"I was thrilled to read a novel devoted to one of my favorite parts of the world, but Steve Amick's debut novel was an extreme disappointment.The novel starts off promising, with interesting characters in a quirky tourist town, but it soon derails. At the end it completely falls apart.Amick seems to have taken several separate stories and just stuck them all together. Several of the major story lines have no connection to one another and it seems very disjointed.When I finished the book, I thought had hallucinated. It just...ends.

Many unexpected things happened in the small town where this book is set, but in the end, nothing of impact ever actually occurred. It was obvious at the end of the book that the lives of the characters would more or less continue as they had... possibly this is the point the author is trying to convey?

My favorite person in the book is definitely Roger Drinkwater, a Native American/Vietnam Vet/swim coach/beef jerky maker who has a bit of a problem with jet skis. It was nice to live through him vicariously as he carried out his vendetta in some explosive ways.As you read the book (and you should definitely pick up a copy), get yourself some fudge and surf over to www.steve-amick.com where you can listen to the soundtrack for this book, the Weneshkeen Jukebox.It's a great summer read.

How much more interesting to experience what he does by putting an account down on paper.Worth the read. Kept me going until late in the night until I fell asleep for exhaustion. If I never lived in small towns I'd have found the pace difficult to accept. But I have, and recognize that supposedly sleepy bergs can have a whole lot going on without outsiders [the \\"summer people\\"] ever realizing it. Moreover, the summer people not having a clue about the sophistication of small town residents, for that matter.Well executed.

Anyone who has vacationed in a tranquil setting only to be disturbed by the loud whine of jet skis will certainly relate to the lifelong resident who sees them as damaging the setting of his beloved home. In some ways resembling Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, this book will appeal to both young and old who like reading of eccentric characters who will resonate in the reader long after the last page is turned.

There seems to be no middle ground and few projects for those who like to make quilts that are more traditional looking.

On the way to school one day, Andy meets a real lion who just happens to have a thorn in his paw. Clever Andy takes the thorn out with his handy pliers and makes a friend of the lion. Weeks later when the circus comes to town, a wild lion escapes from the ring. All the people in the audience run for their lives but, of course, it's Andy's own lion friend, and Andy saves the day.This charming tale is delightful in its fantasy; most 6-9 year olds never quite understand that the lion is in Andy's imagination. The yellow and black illustrations are dated, but they are funny. The book is a winner because of its sweet message of friendship. Who wouldn't want to have a real lion for a friend? Kids 6-8 love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful, timeless tale enjoyable to all ages.","review":"Andy and the Lion is a well known tale, simply and effectively told.

They don't stay together at all! There is no hiding the smaller toys within the bigger clams because the clams just come right apart.

Pepper. Comparisons may be invidious, but this album is a tremendous accomplishment. There are songs on the album written by three of the Seekers, Judith Durham, Keith Potger, and Bruce Woodley. My favorite performance on the album is Bruce Woodley's solo in Angeline is Always Friday, a pensive, lyrical song about young love. Years later, Woodley would write a song called Streets of Serenade, commemorating the Seekers's youthful years in their careers. From the songs on this album, you really feel that the Seekers were in love with what they did. The weakest number perhaps is Judith Duham's solo on the Jacques Brel/Rod McKuen number If You Go Away, which was covered by so many artists at the time. Her performance is perfectly good, but her youthfulness acts against the experience of the song's persona. Still, this is a wonderful album by a group that was around for too brief a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish this were a video!","review":"This is an excellent book! The Doctor is prefect and so is the setting. One becomes depressed and feels chills when immersed in the dank, murky atmosphere of Victorian London. We're talking fog enshrouded streets, walks along the banks of the dirty Thames, all fodder for the imagination.The return of Professor Litefoot is delightful and the new and improved Zygons terrific. It was wonderful to have the chance to delve into their society and technology. The poison stickers inside their suckered-palms was a nice addition.When the Doctor realizes he has made a horrible mistake it is a chance to see that he can be failable and that he has not basically changed in all of his regenerations. His childlike wonder of discovery and his love of all life no matter what form it takes is a constant.Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought this book was just great, it was very readable, and fast paced and as far as the action went, I thought it was as near to classic Doctor Who as we'll see. I didn't notice it being overly gory, it wasn't like it was out of context. When a vicious alien race bent on conquering the planet plops down in the middle of town, wouldn't you expect some bloodshed? I enjoyed the characters, I thought they were reasonably believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the Zygons","review":"Another fun book in the Eighth Doctor series of books. This one is a sequel to two different Tom Baker stories, both \\"Terror of the Zygons\\" and \\"Talons of Wen-Chiang\\" and really plays on the atmosphere that those old Baker stories have. All the characters are in good form, the monsters are great and things move along at a good brisk pace (even though it does fall apart a tad at the end)."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was great.","review":"I think this book was great.when I got to the part when the 8th. dr. got poisoned I said \\"aw man.\\" but was happy that he was ok.I also felt sorry that he accidentally got rid of the whole Zygon group."},{"rating":"2","title":"nylon web harness for dogs","review":"i like this dog harness although i think it would be nice to have the option of a loop to hook the leash to on the front where it goes around chest also. i used this while camping to tie my dog out & the loop located on the top made the harness twist to the side from just the weight of a nylon lead. sturdy and easy to put on and adjust though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"This product never worked.

Hormone Therapy is essential to maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system and bone density.

We are in control of our bodies and can ultimately make our own decisions, but only with enough subjective information to go by. Many physicians may not be open to natural hormone replacement, but there are many who are. Women just need to read this book, among others, to become better educated about their choices regarding controlled substances being ingested into the body."},{"rating":"2","title":"The small cost of and limited time required to read this book is well worth it!","review":"Read this book. It will get you long on knowledge you really should know in short order.

This is one of many examples throughtout the book. On page 22 \\"In real numbers, this means that for every 1,000 women using one of these drugs, 300 will eventually develop breast cancer from the HRT itself.\\" This sounds very scary but is flat out wrong. A 30% increase in risk is not a 30% risk as this book implies. In real numbers this means that instead of 100 women out of 1000 developing breast cancer 130 women out of 1000 would develop breast cancer on HRT. Not to mention that a lot of studies do not show such a high increase in risk. How can anyone trust the assertions of this book if in the first 22 pages there are such blatant untruths."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes me wonder daily....","review":"I just couldn't put the book down.

A must read for all of you who love fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adventure","review":"Wisemen the Awakening by Levi Wayne is a suspenseful thriller.The story begins with interesting characters and character developement. The author develops the setting very well. The setting is somewhere anyone might want to live. The characters get more and more interesting as the plot develops. Once Levi sets up the background, it becomes an action packed mystery. It keeps going and you can not put it down. It is fast paced and thrilling at the same time. He magically mixes modern times and historical interests and blends them beautifully.The Wisemen are a thought provoking group and it certainly entertains the imagination, it makes you wonder... and wonder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There are many more worthy books on the Manson case out there then this one.

Rather than launch a lengthy attack on each item #some more or less problematic than others), allow me to provide a prime example: On page 117, the author refers to Robert F. Kennedy being \\"gunned down in Seattle\\" in 1968. I assumed that everyone in this country with an eighth grade education is aware that Sirhan Sirhan murdered RFK in the pantry/kitchen of The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. My point is that, with errors as gross and unfathomable as this, how is the reader to establish any faith in the many far more obscure declarations the writer offers? Not doing his (very basic) homework taints the entire book, and casts doubts on other \\"facts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple set-up.

Yet I find that she openly neglects to undertake any thorough treatment of relevant Biblical texts in her work. I find it subtly dishonest and imbalanced.IMHO, if you already have your mind made up and don't want to be confused by relvant facts, or if you simply want to consider sundry arguements proposed by evangelical feminists for more breadth in relevant discussions, this book is for you.Tim Hayes; www.ableever.net."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Choice for '94 Dodge Ram 5.9L CTD","review":"Rotella-T Synthetic is the only choice which HAS NOT held up well sampling oil for analysis.Amsoil is the way to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A feminist masterpiece","review":"This self-published marvel is a classic of nuttiness.

In the 3 days that I have owned it, it has only guessed a few of my challenges correctly. It starts out by asking if you are thinking of a person, place, thing or unknown? What do you call a group? It seems to ask the same few questions over and over again. If you don't know if the group or person you are thinking of is in the hall of fame, toured in 2005 or had a top 40 hit in the last 5 years, you can't answer the questions correctly. Apparently it likes The Who because that shows up often as a gues for any group I am thinking of.I am not happy with this product at all, it is a total waste of time to continuously answer 20 (or 25) questions and have it be wrong 9 times out of 10. I plan on returning mine as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I'm a fan of 20 questions. The original one, I highly recommend, don't waste your money on this one. If you're guessing a musical instrument, the accuracy is almost 100%. If you're guessing a singer or a band, the miss is almost 100%.

We are fans of the original 20Q, which always amazes us with it's accurate answers but this is no where near as accurate.

I especially liked the chapters on oxidations and reductions. Examples of naturals products syntheses are ample and increase the utility of the book. All the references are clubbed together at the end of the book. All in all, a fascinating book for the serious organic chemistry student.

I was so dissappointed when I bought this back in '82. What happenned to my music gods !! This is nothing but stale, mellow, batchelor pad background music; toothless,overrated and unchallenging for musicians of this magnitude.

Oops!) a ripoff of \\"The Main Thing\\" by Robbie Terrel, same lyrics too.And, call me \\"Wacky\\", but \\"Avalon\\" and \\"India\\" seem a little too reminiscent of \\"Avalon\\" and \\"My India\\" by Fantastic (when real diva Simina sang for them).I'm pretty sure of this stuff anyway.

My favorite cuts are: the title cut \\"Avalon\\", \\"More than This\\", \\"To Turn You On\\",\\"True to Life\\", \\"The Space Between\\", the instrumental pieces \\"India\\" and \\"Tara\\" also go down easy, great music for a quiet dinner with a beautiful, candle light and Corvoisier. They were pioneers of neo classical glam sound, which preceeded great bands such as: Breathe, Ultravox and Spandau Ballet, who had their moments in the spotlight, but Roxy remains an original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roxy's final gift of glory in their waning days","review":"This feels autumnal, which is why I found it dull when I first heard it - there's none of the raw excitement of the early Roxy. Instead the music is soft and atmospheric, with Ferry's synthlines sketching out a moody soundscape of a rare elegance. One of the most gorgeous albums you'll ever hear, with Ferry sounding warmer and more genuinely soulful than he ever has before (or since). This enormously influential album pointed the direction for many of Roxy's '80s proteges, showing the haunting textures and gorgeous melodies that synth-pop could create. \\"More Than This,\\" \\"To Turn You On,\\" \\"Take A Chance With Me,\\" the title track, etc., are sweeter and more emotionally vulnerable (and believable) than their previous work, and Ferry's singing is at his peak. Manzanera and Mackay play an understated, subtle role, rarely adding more than a few spare lines to counterpoint Ferry's synths."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album of All Time","review":"If I was stranded on a deserted island, this is the one album I want with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best \\"intimate\\" album","review":"This was the topper on my list for sultry sessions for a few years - until Morcheeba's \\"Who Can You Trust?\\" came out.

Flesh and Blood remind's me of the best summer i ever had,song's like oh yeah and over you opening my mind to young love.Avalon came out in 82',and was their last outing,a pristine record .heavenly music set to aching and yearning word's,it came from nowhere on this planet,a perfect blend of sadness and joy,this record is timeless check out 'more than this' and 'true to life',sheer beauty,dont miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Hip as Anything","review":"Along with Van Morrison's \\"Moondance,\\" this is the most romantic album in rock. Part of the hipster groove laid down here is thanks to master drummer Andy Newmark. When he slips into position on the intro to \\"More Than This,\\" the magic begins. Every song here is filled with romantic longing, from the obvious hits (\\"Avalon,\\" \\"Take A Chance With Me\\") to the unknown gems (\\"True to Life,\\" \\"To Turn You On\\"). Ferry tried to capture some of this magic on \\"Boys and Girls\\" (and succeeded on \\"Slave to Love\\"), but in music, the whole is almost always greater than the sum of its parts. Still sounds fresh 20 years later, so raise your hip quotient and get this beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Make Out Album of the 80's","review":"It's does not seem like it has been 18 years since I remember a friend telling me in High School that Avalon was the best make out album in the history.

If you like this, you'll like KRS, Dead Prez, and other such conscious rappers.

I watched forty-five minutes, and when what I'd been predicting happened, I went online to read reviews. Another reviewer mentioned that the film becomes sickening to watch. Considering the serial rapist murderer plot, and the exorbitant amount of time spent showing the main character's love of her cats, there were enough ingredients for gruesome visuals, which I am extremely unfond of. There was no point continuing on with an increasingly klutzy film, with nary a thrill to be found - just the unearned dread of something nasty.

Prime members deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"KILLER NEXT DOOR","review":"GOOD NEIGHBORS is an original noirish-style thriller focusing on a quartet of neighbors in a Montreal apartment complex. We meet Louise (Emily Hampshire), a waitress in a Chinese restaurant with a strong attachment to her two cats; Spencer (Scott Speedman), a wheelchair-bound cynic who likes tropical fish; Victor (Jay Baruchel), the nerdy newcomer who develops an attachment to Louise; and Valerie, the foul-mouthed lady who hates Louise's cats and complains about everything.A serial rapist/killer is terrorizing the city and how these characters figure in the mix forms the core of the movie's narrative. To reveal more would spoil the film's clever plot twists. The movie has a slow pace but holds your attention as it reaches its unexected climax. The performances are uniformly very good and there's a sinister eeriness that accentuates the mood of the film. GOOD NEIGHBORS is a refreshing change of pace in an ofen tired genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time","review":"I am a big fan of this series.Not this time. Basically, this book is all about how our main character wants to get engaged to her- now - long term boyfriend. Fine - except that he never asks and this, in turn, just keeps freaking her out.So, instead of either \\"sucking it up\\" and moving on - she keeps expecting him to pop the question - at every turn and I mean at every turn. Basically, the author ends up making our heroine so pathetic that she becomes this complete turnoff.Every page and every paragraph includes the words: \\"I know he is going to ask today\\".... and this becomes so tedious. You want to scream \\"Either ask him or move on\\" just please put us out of our misery.I did not enjoy this book. The main character was wishy-washy and portrayed as a victim (if I don't get engaged I am nobody). There was no fun in reading this book for me and let's not even talk about the total lack of humour here.Pass on this one - please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Crappy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first and second book in this series (especially the first) but this book became a chore to read. In every page we have the main character whining about 'when is he going to propose'? I wanted to scream! It became predictable and thoroughly boring after the first couple of chapters. If Wendy Markham plans on making a 'slightly married' or 'slightly pregnant' I certainly hope she takes all this bad feedback onboard and comes up with a more witty and original novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring","review":"This is my first review & I was afraid everyone else was going to like this book & I was going to wonder about my reading preferences. I am going to look for the first book in the series since others liked it.I never felt like I connected at all with Tracey or Jack. His character was so boring! I kept waiting for something fun or exciting to happen. It never does. I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of the series!","review":"I was hoping to really enjoy this installment in the 'Slightly....' series. Howver, the main character, Tracy Spadolini, has REGRESSED into a neurotic, pathetic, whiney, idiot. WHO in their right mind feels like a failure if not married by age 25? This is 2006, not 1956! I agree with a pervious reader who noted we are 'told' Tracy and Jack are happily in love....but nothing, and I stress nothing is ever shown. A very poor effort on Markham's part; I wasted money. AVOID. Or, check it out from the library if you are especially curious.A side note...we also continue to hear about Will, her awful ex from the previous two books, but the author fails to make any point of his role in the story. He telephones Tracy randomly, and they don't speak about anything of importance. poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda drags, but overall an okay read","review":"I read this book before reading any of her other ones (i.e. Slightly Single, which I believe comes before Slightly Engaged)...and unfortunately it left me questioning if I was going to read any more of them! Sure, when it wasn't dragging and repeating itself it was a good read. It really did have its moments. But boy, did it drag. I feel like every 4th sentence was was some version of \\"Maybe he'll proposed today,\\" and it really dragged at times. Still, if you don't mind skimming every so often, give it a try and a rainy day when you have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Very entertaining and well written.

Over and over again, Tracey thinks Jack is about to propose and then... he doesn't. And she's disappointed. This happens maybe 7-8 times over the course of the book. It's like Markham wrote one scene then copied and pasted it six more times to fill up the rest of the book. It's almost ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Stupid","review":"Tracey Spadolini is an annoying, self-obsessed girl, but she has her charming moments. Or she HAD them in the previous books. Now she's 25 and obsessed with becoming engaged because she's supposedly madly in love with Jack--only she's terrified to even bring up marriage to him after living together for 2 years. How stupid is that? She's so upset about not being engaged herself, she can barely drum up the grace to pretend to be happy for her friends. She's lucky she has friends, considering how weak, whiny, and self-absorbed she is.The writing itself isn't bad, but the story and protagonist are abysmal. If this weren't such a fast read and I hadn't paid for it I wouldn't have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing and annoying","review":"I really liked the first 2 books. But this book kept repeating the same things! I got tired of hearing about her ex Will , her wanting to be engaged to Jack and that thing about not having enough tomatoes in her salad seemed to go on too long. I really had to skim a lot of pages to get thru this. I was also disappointed in the way it ended. Still, I know I will end up reading the next book with hope that Wendy Markham will write it like she did the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee table","review":"Within the first 20 pages I had to put the book down on my coffee table; not because I am a scholar nor am I some book snob, nope I had to put it down because I was bummed that I paid 15 bucks for a book that evoke everything in me but interest. Sorry, but I think it was some of the worst writing I have ever seen published. The abuse of words that very few people, without a M.D., would know there meaning and the slow pace blew it for me. I had my mother, a published author, read it thinking that I was being overly judgmental. Nope she said that it stunk too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR dissapointment","review":"I just want to say I LOVED the first book in this series, Slightly Single, and THAT book I HIGHLY advise anyone to read.The second one was ok and I felt this one was just a complete mess.First of all Tracey is 25 and desperate to get married, and she is ready to leave her boyfriend if he doesnt give her a ring. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. She acts like she is an elderly woman in the book.Second I HATE the character of her friend Kate and I hate that Tracey is so pathetic she cant stand up to her.And third I didnt notice any chem. between Jack and Tracy. I was extremely dissapointed when she ended up with him.I think this book was less then average, but since I liked the first one so much I just keep reading them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Engaged","review":"One more friend getting married begins a spiral of emotion for Tracey. She's been living the Jack for some time now, and he shows no sign of making it legal. Even after she gets a huge tip off from his mama that he might be thinking that way, no ring is forthcoming. Tracey does all she can to give him hints, to make things ideal for the big event, but Jack seems oblivious. Is she on her way to being a Missus, or is her romance just a big miss?** The author gets points for admitting that living together is not the same as marriage, but the fact that she seems to validate Tracey's gay friend marrying his lover is jarring. However, there are funny, real moments throughout the narrative, though not too much characterization beyond Tracey herself. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word: Sublime","review":"Few artists in the new age music genre can soothe the soul in such a gentle, lovely and deeply entrancing way. With each album Robert Haig Coxon continues to astonish and delight with his ability to create what one may call pure sonic \\"brain candy\\".The mix is superb and the album song progression is both logical and evocative in the sense of enabling the ability to flow from one thought/feeling to the next without interruption of the meditative continuum. It is easy to understand why therapists use Coxon's music for body work and other forms of physical therapy.In my practice as a professional hypnotherapist I have found this CD to be incomparable as background music for trance induction and transport into the deepest realm of the unconscious mind. It is a pleasure to recommend this exquisite, refined, soothing and healing music for those who wish to experience the sublime on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"When this product was delivered the sticker that was attached to the scratch guard would not come off and then the protective screen would not even stay on, I think it lasted a whole week and then it was junk.

Mine was a perfect fit for the screen, did not overlap onto the PSP at all. A few strange things though. Mine had a picture of an iphone on it, which had me very angry at first. Then I opened it and it seemed to be perfect for the psp. It did not include the squeegee card so I had to use my credit card, but no biggie there I suppose. It did come with the cleaning cloth which worked great. Overall it seemed to be a perfect fit for the PSP, the only reason it isn't a perfect 5 is because of the advertised squeegee that was not included and the initial scare that it was an iphone screen protector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Screen Protector of high quality.","review":"You get what you pay for. This one doesnt have that fuzz look after you put it on. I think a lot of people generally dont know how to put these on. You have to use a soft wet tissue. I use toilet paper. With one side wet and the other side kind of dry. You will wipe your psp screen till its clean of dust (to your liking of course). After that you measure where you want it position. Then you take off the no.1 label side and just drop it on. It does most of the work by itself. The other way is using the included squeegee and slowing work your way from one end to the other laying the protector on. So easy, and remember key thing you want the after wet effect so it goes on easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality, but it does not fit!","review":"I threw this in with a larger order I made because of the nice price of the protector. When I received the protector, I was pleased with the quality and the wipe it came with. There are not any instructions provided, but the installation seemed pretty straightforward. The screen itself is nice and robust. I wiped the screen, peeled the step one indicator tab, and lined the protector up with the screen. It doesn't fit! It is way too large for the screen. The screen on the PSP is inset slightly. This screen protector does not fit inside and the edges bump up to the outside of the screen making it impossible to fully seal.

Other than that it's good"},{"rating":"2","title":"No-hassle Installation Tip","review":"The foolproof way to install ANY of these protectors is to first coat the GPS screen with a film of ph balanced soap solution (very diluted no-more-tears baby shampoo works fine). The pros do this when installing window film on houses and cars. The soap allows you to center the protector and to squeeze bubbles out easily because it can't stick until the soap dries (it takes overnight to do). Use a clean napkin to collect the excess soap that comes out as you squeeze the bubbles. With this trick, I got mine on the first time without ANY bubbles!

This movie is most definitely NOT about baseball. It's about coming to terms with your emotions. It's about realizing that life is too short to walk around like a mind-numb robot, with no feelings or passion. Laugh if you want, but I cry at movies. I cannot watch the famous \\"catch\\" ending without crying my heart out. I realize that it's just a story. But it touches me on several levels. A \\"feel-good\\" movie? Sure, and what the heck is wrong with that? Do I wanna pay to watch something that makes me feel bad? NO. Baseball inacuracies? SO WHAT! That's not the point!

Salinger-type author) and Burt Lancaster (a class act as always, in one of his final screen roles) that give the movie some real heft.

The movie it self is just magical in every sense of the word. It's a moving story told in a way that might surprise you( you will never look at corn the same way again).

I wish I had told him before he died just much it meant to me as a kid and a teenager to play catch with him in the backyard, field grounders and pop ups. So this movie has a meaning to me it didn't years ago. It is a wonderful film. A place where the greats can come back and play the game again. If you build it, he will come. It isn't until the end that you -- and Ray Kinsella -- realize exactly what that truly means. A film of redemption. A story of it. Long after all of us are gone -- as long as there are people love the game -- this film will still resonate. More than PRIDE OF THE YANKEES or MAJOR LEAGUE, this is truly the one.

A GREAT MOVIE ABOUT AMERICAS PASTTIME; BASEBALL...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even allowing for baseball hyperbole, a wonderful movie","review":"Baseball is great, but you don't have to think that He invented baseball, and that everything good is because of baseball and that everything bad is because of not enough baseball to enjoy this movie. The pacing is perfect, the colors and shots are unrushed and nicely framed, and the actors are perfectly cast. There are many special moments in this film, but two of my favorite always bring a tear to my eye. The first is when Burt Lancaster's character saves Ray's daughter, at great sacrifice to himself. That always gets me. The second, big surprise, is when Ray has his catch at the end of the movie. Man, that was done just right. Could easily have been maudlin, but instead had the sense of relief, thankfulness, and love that was just perfect. This movie is aging well. So a few of the baseball speeches are over the top, it's a minor point for such a warm and good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect","review":"Ray Kinsella hears a voice telling him to build something. He makes a leap of faith, supported by his wife, and builds a baseball field. Lo and behold, none other than Joe Jackson appears and brings some of the other tarnished 1919 \\"black sox\\" with him. Eight in all, to be exact. Ray continues on his trip, following the mysterious voice, trying to figure out what to do. He may lose everything, yet he still continues.Kevin Costner was at his finest in this movie, and the supporting cast is nothing short of astonishing. It is one of the most moving sports stories ever told and one of the most moving father/son movies ever told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"This movie really stands the test of time. I think this is Kevin Costner at his best. Even if you are not a fan of baseball, you will still find this movie enchanting! It may even get you thinking about your own dreams and aspirations and whether you gave up or pursued them with all the passion of your heart! An outstanding family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field of Dreams, a timeless, sports classic.","review":"Field of Dreams is a timeless, sports classic, especially if you love the game of baseball. It's also a very well written story about dreams and pursuing them at all costs. Each character has a dream and we not only get a glimpse, we get to see the reason they have them and in some cases we even get to see them come true. This is a great family movie and one you'll love to own.Field of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I first watched this movie when it came out and enjoyed it from the beginning. Recently, we purchased the DVD and I watched it with my 13 year old daughter who is no fan of baseball. She sat enthralled with the movie which really surprised me. Yes, maybe it is not the most believable story line, but I believe that is what makes this movie so interesting. I am not a Kevin Costner fan, but he did a great job portraying himself as an average guy living in Iowa. The acting overall is great and I loved how the story flowed! Overall, I like that the movie did not spell out for you what happened, particularly the end. It was for each individual in the audience to speculate as to how to story continued. Classic film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One Of Costner's Best!\\"","review":"Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, Ray Liotta and James Earl Jonesstar in this 1989 drama based on the book, \\"Shoeless Joe.\\"An Iowa farmer builds a magic baseball field bringing backpastime legends.

I am not a big Kevin Costner fan, but this movie ranks high in my top 5. Terence Mann's (James Earl Jones) baseball speach will bring a tear to the eye of any baseball purist, and the game of catch between Ray Kinsella and his Dad at the end of the film will bring a tear to the eye of any man that ever tossed a ball with his dad when he was 10 years old. A truly great film with a little bit of history thrown in to boot. This one is destined to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fantasy Picture","review":"I was pleased to hear that the baseball field in Dyersville, Iowa is still there!

Far-fetched? sure, but few movies combine fantasy and emotion as well as this one. The voices and visions continue until Kinsella takes a field trip to team up with a well known author(wonderfully portrayed by James Earl Jones) the skepticism resides and the two take a magical journey that will change their lives forever. I will tell no more, it would be a sin.

This is a good read for someone who enjoys a great fantasy story with some romance. The character and relationship developments are well written, and make you want to know more about everyone in this world. The interaction between Cu and Brighid are odd at times, but those moments do not detract from the overall story and feel of the book.

The dubbed English dialogue is unbearably cheesy, and the film is amazingly full of inaccuracies and anachronisms (cars, hair styles, fashion, city scenery) that really kill the idea that it's supposed to occur in the '60s and early '70s. This movie is mercifully condensed from 50 episodes of a Chinese series, yet still barely watchable. Thank goodness for the fast-forward button.

Her honesty with her heroin addiction is to be admired, along with all she went through physically when restrained to a steel neck cage after an accident. Not only is her life interesting, but the little nuggets of Hollywood inside stories are just as good. Pick up this juicy morsel if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with some technical glitches.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and its style of switching back and forth from the 96 season to historical background and vignettes of the small time racer. A couple of nits to pick. The summary of the CART-Indy 500 dispute was just plain wrong and should have been caught in the editing process. (The problem was not that Indy Speedway wanted to open up qualifying, just the opposite. He guranteed spots to his IRL drivers even if their speeds were slower. )Second, the first part of the season was covered in meticulous detail, but the last half was summarized. It seemed like the author was looking to wind it up. These points aside, this was a very well written and entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got it","review":"I never recieved the item. the company said that i recieved it on a certain date and i didn't. when i wrote them emails, i got responses that led me to a blank page. i'm not sure if theyre bogus or wut but im out $60 and have no dress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff for kids and their grandparents!","review":"I picked up this magazine for my 10 year old grandson in the airport and read it on the plane - wonderful fun! I decided I'd order it for him and came online to find all these 1 star-reviews! My copy is full of information and fun facts - I see only 4 ads in the April issue - all tastefully done and promoting recyling, fruit snacks, books and a new kids' movie. This is a great publication that might encourage kids to read and think as an alternative to video games on the computer. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too young","review":"I bought a subscription to this magazine for my 8 1/2 year old nephew. He received the first issue the other day, and called to let me know the magazine was \\"for babies.\\" My sister explained that it is written for the pre-school set, not really for elementary school kids, and those who are able to read on their own. I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Perfect","review":"The photos in this magazine are amazing! I can't even believe that some of the pictures are real. I think that even if the magazine isn't that good you should get it for the pictures. Every month I put up the pictures in my room. All my friends got the magazine because they love the pictures. The facts are amazing and the magazine is put together sooo nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Geographic for Kids Magazine","review":"I am disappointed that by ordering a product on December 14,2011 that it will not arrive until sometime in March. I am not sure why it would take that long to create a magazine subscription and I hope the child that I sent it to is not too disappointed having to wait that long. I wish they would have informed me of the delay before I payed for the subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an excuse to advertise to children","review":"My children receive this magazine as a gift, and every month it gets worse. The advertising inside is overwhelming, and this month it even came wrapped in an advertising spread. The \\"articles\\" are often just more advertising as well. For example, there was an article about the movie, \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" that compared real vikings to how they were portrayed in the movie, but it was so obviously about the movie and not really historical in any way. This magazine is so bad that I can't believe National Geographic actually has anything to do with it. I would not be surprised to find out they had simply leased their name to another publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst magazine for kids","review":"I am appalled at this magazine! It is full of advertisements, and negative things. I think I will start to \\"lose\\" this magazine when it comes in the mail. There is very little content. Don't waste your money! Get one of the magazines in the Cricket line instead. They are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you want to fill your recycle bin","review":"Mostly ads, I trash it as soon as it arrives and needless-to-say will not be renewing. Truly awful - it has nothing to do with the regular National Geographic Magazine we know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informational and fascinating","review":"This is a junior National Geographic for anyone. It's not really just a wildlife magazine- it has articles on the environment, foreign countries, and current events. I would recommend it for anyone ages 8-13. Still, I think it should have more \\"fillers\\" and reader-involved contests and stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Ad for Nintendo - Trash It","review":"I thought I would be ordered my 4 kids something worth reading, something educational, etc... the whole magazine is one pathetic advertisement for Nintendo - SHAMEFUL, PATHETIC, WASTE OF PAPER."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss National Geographic World","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I read National Geographic World when I was a kid and I was excited to get a subscription to NG Kids for my own kids. What a massive disappointment. More than just the name changed - it is now packed with advertising and, even worse, the articles are largely commercial as well and not about things in our natural world (really, an article about the movie Madagascar 3?). And the other articles are mostly in the Ripley's Believe it or Not style, or things like cats in wigs. Seriously. My kids don't even like it, for which I guess I should be happy. Looking forward to my subscription running out. National Geographic, you should be ashamed to have your name on this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"we get this as a gift from the childrens great grandfather and I dont have the heart to tell him how bad it is. my kids are curious and love animals but we mostly have conversations about what advertisments are looking at this magazine. there are no real articles that are educational. this magazine very quickly goes in the recycling bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids enjoying it","review":"Son can't wait for this to come in the mail. 8yo, good articles for his age group. Informative and interesting. Maybe he'll spend some time reading and quit staring at the Gameboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin","review":"My daughter got a year's subscription of National Geographic For Kids as a gift. Good thing, I would have cancelled it had I paid one red cent for it. It is a thin magazine and honestly barely thicker than a leaflet. It has a heavy ad to articles ratio. The content is average, what there is of it. If you are thinking of subscribing, get it cheap. Under 10 would be worth it but at 15 they are ripping you off."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY 2 YR. OLD GRANDSON LOVES THIS MAGAZINE!","review":"I bought this magazine for my 2 yr. old grandson and he absolutely loves it. Me and Grandpa love reading it too. The pictures are fantastic and it has great articles in it. The reviews I read on this were from years ago so NGK must have improved since then because the magazine isn't full of ads like they complained of. I recommend this magazine for all kids, young and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so disappointed","review":"I, too, like another reader, had the original World magazine when I was a kid and was looking forward to this magazine for my daughter. It has been an awful experience. It was ordered so she would receive the first issue for her birthday in December, but we did not receive the first issue until April. It is NOTHING like the original magazine and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.Not sure why National Geographic went down this path, but it is very much beneath them."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible - full of junk advertising","review":"I am a long term subscriber to National Geographic and expected this to be a great magazine for my two children. What a disappointment! It is loaded with commercial advertisements - and not for educational toys, but junk! The worst children's magazine I have ever seen. I wish I had previewed it before wasting my money, but I took it for granted that National Geographic would be producing a quality product. Save your money and buy something else for your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only to fill the trash - I give it 0 stars!","review":"This is by far the worst children's magazine I've ever seen. It goes straight from our mailbox to the trash. I hate to even be on their mailing list, but it was a gift subscription and I don't want to offend the giver. The magazine is filled with almost nothing but advertisements. The publisher seems to think that you have to mix miniscule amounts of \\"learning\\" in with a whole lot of fluff and nothing in order to appeal to children. The magazine has soured my whole opinion of National Geographic. I believe this publication has only one purpose, which is to sell stuff to children. It's disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed Mom","review":"I thought that National Geographic Kids magazine would be the \\"kid\\" version of the adult one. But it turned out to be a waste of money. The magazine is full of advertisement and the articles are too brief. Too bad I can't get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Georgraphic sells out","review":"My child got this as a gift and it's a real disappointment -- full of ads for video games (including some rated as violent right in the ad) and pseudo-articles about products, such as one on the \\"science\\" behind this season's coolest new electronic gadgets. The first issue we received has articles that are really marketing pitches on both the third Harry Potter movie and the Lord of the Rings films, and a six-page spread on the 20th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. If you want a good kids' magazine about nature, skip this and get Big Backyard (which our child loves) or Ranger Rick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to Pay $$ To Make Your Child a Marketing Target??","review":"I guess this is a good magazine if you want your child up-to-date on tween celebrity happenings and knowledgeable of all of the newest toys, candies, and cereals. I'm really not one to write reviews, but this magazine inspired me. The \\"Geographic\\" content of this magazine is completely obscured by the marketing of kid-related products, Disney characters, and kid-recognizable celebrities. Instead of coming away from this magazine with a heightened knowledge of the world, my child came away with a heightened case of Want-itis. I wish I had read some of the other reviews on this page before I wasted my money on a product I thought would be educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment","review":"I, like so many others, grew up reading the National Geographic magazine.Naturally, I thought that NG Kids could only improve upon the experience for my five-year-old. I was severely disappointed. Not only is most of the material vaccuous, it looks like it's been designed by an advertising reject on uppers.The advertising is shameful and irresponsible. In an age when we are preoccupied by the health of our children, particularly their diet, the latest issue advertises a major fast-food chain right on the cover.I would strongly recommend that you go with something like 'Ranger Rick' or 'Ladybug' which have children as their main focus and are not edited by twenty-somethings still recovering from a late adolescence.On top of that, any half-witted hacker can download their entire subscription base in a few minutes by just entering in subscription numbers - it doesn't even ask for a simple validation step like entering in your zip code."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing so much","review":"I bought this for my kids,each month,I was disappointed.Great pictures,but not too many pages,and tons of advertisement,for this price I wanted more pages,less advertisement.I had to rely on other magazines,to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I have never reviewed any book before in my life, but I'm so appalled by this that I am compelled to. First, the magazine actively discourages reading. My daughter is a reader (though 6 she reads at approximately a 4th grade level.) Usually I cannot stop her from reading, but this magazine, she just flips through aimlessly. There is so much \\"visual candy\\" that it's impossible for her to focus on the story. (And frankly the articles aren't very compelling anyway.) In addition, I echo what others have said: there are huge number of adds, and they are virtually indistinquishable from the content. These are horrible magazines. If you want a good kids magazine go with anything from the cricket family of magazines (cricket, ladybug, spider... there are loads to choose from with varying age levels and content.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Kids' Magazine Ever Created","review":"Once I found myself among a group of parents who were talking about this magazine. One person said that it was the worst magazine he could possibly imagine. Another said that she put it in an envelope and paid to send it back with an angry letter. I thought, \\"What could possibly be so bad?\\" Then we received a subscription as a gift. As other reviewers have noted, the entire magazine is advertisements for things like junk food. The \\"articles\\" in the one I looked at were also like advertisements, being articles about the newest Disney movie or the science of video games. It was terrible. I called immediately to cancel even though I was not paying for it. Did not want that junky thing coming to my house.We subscribe to National Geographic for adults and love it. I never ever would have expected something so bad to have the name National Geographic on it!Do not subscribe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"National Geographic should be embarrassed.","review":"There are interesting articles in this magazine. However, every fun fact is sandwiched between ads for junk food, movies, or video games. This magazine is one long advertisement. I'm surprised that a magazine/organization like National Geographic would want to be associated with content like this. Instead of this, I'd recommend Ranger Rick, American Girl, or any of the long list of publications from Carus (Appleseeds, Cricket, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ads and headlines, but no content","review":"My daughter LOVED the \\"Little Kids\\" version of this magazine. It was great, and advertising-free. So imagine my surprise when we \\"traded up\\" and the quality went abruptly down hill. As stated by others, this magazine is full of advertising, and very light on content. The photography is sometimes impressive, but the text is superficial, sensationalized and poorly written. This version of the magazine lives by \\"Top Ten Lists!\\" and utterly lacks content. National Geographic should not allow its name on this shlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad","review":"When i heard my kids were getting this magazine for Christmas i was excited. Then we got an issue. What junk! There are maybe two decent articles in it and the rest is weird blips of useless information and ads for items my kids will never see. Ranger Rick where are you"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Like My Money Back... and It Was a Gift","review":"It's that bad.My children have always enjoyed the National Wildlife Federation magazines, so I'll stick with those. \\"Your Big Backyard\\" and \\"Ranger Rick\\" are wonderful, with beautiful photography and no advertising. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to say it again","review":"The previous reviews have said it all...but it can't hurt to say it again...this magazine is a waste...it is filled with jokes, ads and animals frequently dressed up in silly outfits. SO SO SO disappointing because I am a huge National Geographic fan. For those who want a good quality magazine for their children, subscribe to ASK Magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"We have been very disappointed with the quality of National Geographic Kids Magazine. It is full of corporate advertising. Even the content is advertising. The last issue had an \\"article\\" on the movie Eragon which is not even rated yet and a second article on another movie with Ben Stiller. The writing is dumbed down to be \\"entertaining\\". Many articles have sections written in IM speak such as \\"how r u\\" and \\"this is 2 cool\\".It is not at all what I expected from National Geographic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - full of the worst kind of ads","review":"This \\"magazine\\" is a thinly veiled excuse to sell ads for the worst possible products for kids -- sugary junk food and cereals, videogames and the latest big budget product-pushing movies.

After seeing two issues full of advertisements pushing things like: junk food, Video Games and Movies and even a review of video games, I am cancelling the subscription. This magazine is very disappointing and not at all up to expectations. All parents should cancel and send a message to the owners of this junk magazine that is doing nothing more than pushing advertising on our kids. Stick to a high quality magazine like National Wildlife's Ranger Rick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited for my son to get a subscription to this magazine for his birthday last year. After the first glance at the magazine I was so disappointed. It was filled with advertisements! We had had a subscription to My Big Backyard and then Ranger Rick, both of which my son couldn't wait to get each month, both of which have no advertisements, so I was appalled that this KIDS magazine from National Geographic would be like this. We will not be renewing our subscription. We will renew Ranger Rick and Discover Kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, I have free trade mags with less ads","review":"The amount of advertising in this kids magazine is crazy. I had a subscription to NG World when I was a kid in the late 70s and it was so great. My wife and I ordered this subscription sight unseen because it was NG (our mistake) and it is useless.

One star for craftiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called National Advertising","review":"National Geographic should be ashamed of themselves. The only thing that any kid perusing this magazine would learn is what toys they do NOT have. Are there any articles related to nature, to different cultures, and to different places? No!!! Please do not waste your money on this magazine. Subscribe to National Geographic for Little Kids which is different from this shameful magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"sneak advertising","review":"My kids were given this magazine as a gift and I HATE it.As others have said, it is very full of advertising, and it advertises the worst kind of stuff -- candy, sugar cereal, video games, TV shows, etc.But the overt advertising is not the worst part. The worst part is the \\"hidden\\" advertising. Half or more of the \\"articles\\" are really product placements and movie or TV show or video game tie-ins.I have taught my kids to read advertising with a skeptical eye, but it is hard to teach them to question even benign looking content.As a comparison, we also subscribe to Sports Illustrated for Kids. Full of advertising, yes, as are all magazines that aren't explicitly ad-free. But at least the content is good and not chock full of paid product placements.As an alternative to this, I would recommend getting the Boy Scouts publication Boys Life.

Fun facts, short stories geared towards kids are throughout this magazine, with few advertisements. I like to read them too, and the photos are always great.Each issue includes 5 to 6 feature articles and the regular departments, plus information about the magazine online.

It is bright and fun looking, but every issue had bits of disjointed information in a sea of commercialism. I did find a few articles were interesting and age appropriate, although they were rather shallow. I remember one issue, our second one, that focused on Star Wars...and although I am a sci-fi fan, I hoping my daughter would be learning about animals and other real-life cultures, not about movies!

He thoroughly enjoyed the glossy, colorful photos and even the reasonably informative science/nature content. I, however, was dismayed by the appalling amount of not just advertising, but blatant product placement. And somehow, the rest of the magazine just wasn't as cool as it used to be (no more posters?)When it came time to re-up, I cancelled the subscription and instead got him \\"Ask\\" magazine--which has significantly better content and NO advertising.

Happily, it did, now renamed National Geographic Kids. I ordered a two-year subscription for my son.I wanted so much to like it. But the damn thing is chock full of advertising for candy, video games and movies, and in a way that makes it hard to separate the selling from the educating.

But be warned: when you order it, you will receive several back issues that you may very well already have purchased. I ordered it and received the new issue plus the old issues that I already have.

As many others have pointed out, it is filled with adds which are not distinct from the articles, promotes pop-culture which I try to avoid (we don't watch commercial TV), and the articles are generally shallow without much in-depth information. I incorrectly assumed that as a National Geographic magazine for kids it would be worthwhile. I've ordered the magazine ASK to replace this and if the reviews are any indication, it will be far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"love ng and looked at kids version. i was disgusted. is it ok to produce high value for adults and garbage for kids? won't renew my ng because i am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Forever to Ship","review":"Plan on about 6 months or more to get your first issue.

They're not there in National Geographic's Little Kids magazine, and if memory serves, there are also no ads in National Geographic itself. So why is it OK to have the magazine for kids chock full of ads for video games, junk food, and movies I would not allow my child to watch? Like the previous reviewer, the first issue we received, the outside cover was a massive ad for a video game system! I'm cancelling our subscription immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sub-standard magazine of \\"National Geographic\\"","review":"It will be a huge disappointment if you are expecting the quality of a National Geographic. The thin content is hardly beneficial to kids.

Now, National Geographic Kids has gone way downhill. These days, the magazine has too much advertising for junk food, video games, and tv shows that are not educational and too many articles that are not educational such as articles on new movies, singers, and video games. I was shocked NGK did an article on Miley Cyrus. That does not belong in a National Geographic magazine. I don't have any kids of my own but I do have a baby nephew and I am not ordering NGK for him when he gets older because NGK sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"In addition to all the advertising, which like others I strongly object to, this magazine has two other problems. First, much of the material is presented in a very small font, making it extremely difficult for an emerging young reader, or even an adult with less than perfect vision, to read. Second, the magazine endorses and role-model pop culture such as texting, in a way I consider inappropriate at any age and completely unacceptable given the young ages the magazine is targeted to. Oddly, I have been very impressed with NG's \\"Little Kids\\" magazine, which is free from all these problems and quite educational. This made me double disappointed and frustrated with NG's \\"Kids\\". Don't waste your money on this magazine, even if it is fairly inexpensive. Get \\"Highlights\\", \\"My Big Backyard,\\" or \\"Click\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth half a star!

There are so many other, better magazines out there for kids aged 4-10, like Click, Ask, Muse and Odyssey, all of which my kids (currently 8 and 6) pounce on when they arrive.I mistakenly assumed NGKids would be similar in content to National Geographic, which I've always loved. It's not -- the amount of each issue that's devoted to advertisements is appalling (the other reviewers who've counted the pages are right). And a lot of the rest is nothing but factoids in garish colors and wildly varying fonts.This magazine is not an antidote to the short attention spans and superficial treatment of interesting topics that pop culture fosters. It's part of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids get attracted to the wrong things in this mag...","review":"I have subscribed to this magzine for a while now, for my kids aged 7 and 4.

I am somewhat disappointed at that.I have read great reviews about the Discover Kids magzine and I am going to try that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from National Geographic","review":"To say I expected more from National Geographic is an understatement. The magazine was a terrible waste of money--unless you want a Build-A-Bear coupon every month. Otherwise, there really is nothing of any value in this magazine, which is unfortunate as National Geographic typically does such an amazing job with their magazines, television programs, etc. We're switching to Ranger Rick and expect a much better product which will actually be a learning tool instead of a bunch of ads and joke pages that have nothing to do with animals.Seriously a disappointing magazine. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to those who are disappointed","review":"I used to love Nat. Geo. World magazine when I was a kid. When I first started teaching, I subscribed to it and it changed over to NG Kids. The amount of advertising and product tie-ins make this magazine unreadable for kids and I stopped my subscription a few years ago. I know they have to have a revenue source, but shouldn't subscriptions cover it? Try Kids Discover, if you want ad free magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad excuse for a magazine","review":"I was so disappointed when my son received this and we looked at it together. Over half the pages are dedicated to advertising for junk food, video games, toys, etc. A good third of the pages are \\"movie reviews\\" which are really more advertising. What's left are so called articles about inane topics that hardly answer any of the deeper questions kids ask about science and the world around us. A squirrel waterskiing may be funny but not really what I am trying to teach our kids. The pictures and little blurbs don't go into any depth about the subject.When we grew up we had National Geograhic World and it was wonderful. This is total garbage. You'd be better off sitting down with the adult National Geographic with your kids and talking about the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magazine is one continuous advertisement!!!","review":"I used to get World as a kid and it was awesome.I bought a one year subscription to NG Kids for my goddaughter hoping that she would enjoy it as much as I did.Wrong!!!

What a disappointment. Shame on National Geographic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"Having just received the Jan 2010 issue, I'm appalled. Apparently National Geographic Kids is Mr. Hyde to the adult's magazine's Dr. Jekyll. None of what NG has worked hard to establish with their flagship magazine is here. When trying to imagine this magazine, don't think \\"National Geographic Kids\\" rather \\"Cosmo Kids\\" gives you a better sense of its content: Cheap pandering to its audiences urges with barely an attempt to redeem itself. For example, I'd love to see NG Kids promote films about wildlife to my kids, like IMAX's Under the Sea or Wild Oceans. Instead the wildlife film promoted is the Chimpmunk Squeakquel, complete with Alvin and his buddies in a toilet. I've seen Rob Schneider movies with more dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, full of CRAP","review":"We have been recieving this magazine for the last year(2009) and it is GARBAGE!!!

I am told that she LOVES it. However, I am not pleased with the number of advertisements. There are more ads than there are articles.

There are jokes and maybe a few puzzles. And a hidden article or two. But, I cannot overemphasize how many ads this has---and they aren't that distinguishable from the main text, either. We deliberately keep her away from Disney channel and shows with commercials, and yet suddenly at dinner she will start discussing a movie or toy we have not even heard of. Where did she get the info.? National Geographic. She ADORES Ranger Rick, and if there were more like it, we'd sign her right up. Too bad NG can't clean up their act. They should be giving this one away free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertising in the form of a magazine","review":"We received our first issue of National Geographic Kids today and promptly cancelled it the same day. I didn't even want my son to see it. Not only is it filled with advertising but the \\"science\\" articles are unsophisticated and tabloid-ish. I wish we had read the reviews before ordering. We assumed that this would be comparable to World Magazine and were terribly wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest of Christian Death releases...","review":"I grew up listening to this band and even had the opportunity to see them live back in 1987 (I think) at the Farm in San Francisco. A friend of mine met Gitane DeMone in the ladies' bathroom! They are one of the greatest Gothic/Deathrock/Alternative (when it meant something) bands or our time. For those who are new to this group they have had two different lead singers. Their original vocalist was Rozz Williams and the work he released with the band is considered by many to be the pinnacle of their work. However, if you're like me, you feel that the second lead vocalist Valor contributed in many ways to defining the bands sound. This album features arguably the best music the band ever produced with Valor as lead vocalist. If you are a first time listener (check out \\"When I Was Bed\\" sample) or a long time fan looking for older releases this is a must have item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rozz & Valor's collaboration at its best","review":"I like both Rozz & Valor's works (some of them very much), but I think 'Ashes' is the result of Christian Death at their best!

The rolled glass rim is too thick -- should be a straight edge with no roll -- and they seem small, but it might be just the lack of stem.

It is the same brand but not the same model. The price, features and service were top rate. I am satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I should have taken the advise of those that did not provide an adequate rating for this item. Moral of the story, you get what you pay for. Flimsy, cheaply made mold. If all you want to do is store your shotgun/rifle in the closet so the firearm doesnt collect dust, its pefect. Aside from that, forget about using it for anything else. It really sucks!! $35 bucks down the tube, I'm having several regrets buying from Amazon and will reconsider buying something sight unseen ever again.

If you want something to protect your firearm while hiking or for long time storage there are other options. The problem is they are expensive options. For the price this does its job and does it well. A little flimsy when open after it is locked down the padding and shell reinforce it well. Nice looking and sturdy for a short trip. The shell it not heavy and the seams need help matching but these are not real issues for what you are using it for.Again if you need a weatherproof hard case and don't mind paying almost 200 then this is not your case. If you need a short term storage and carry case this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good guality for the price.

It's a piano hinge and the interlocking pieces were so deformed, there was no possible way for me to get them to lock together properly. I reboxed the case with the intention of mailing it back to Amazon. Missed the 30-day return window. Now I am putting it out on the curb for recycling.That hinge is critical because when you hold the case by the handle, the hinge is below your gun. If it fails, your gun (and scope) will fall onto the ground. As it was delivered, the hinge was broken and there's no way it would have held my rifle.Lesson learned. When you gamble on cheap products like this, MAIL THEM BACK TO AMAZON ASAP. This case is junk. On the plus side, it can be recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super flimsy. Cheap.","review":"I purchased this case for simple transportation of my hunting rifle between the hunting sight or range and home. I didn't expect much of this case. It arrived and I must say, I am not impressed. They talk about being the most crush resistant, and thick plastic. I can see the crush resistance. The pillars would probably protect the gun from being crushed under certain loads. Other than that, the sides are SUPER thin and flimsy. The whole case flexes easily, even when fully latched. This is not a solid case at all and I'm wary about even moving my rifle from home to the range in it. Its just too thin and cheap and flimsy to be of any real use. The latches are cheap plastic and are weak. I grabbed it by each end and twisted and two latches popped open. I'm not going to store my $1200 hunting rifle in it. Its just not worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!!!!","review":"Very cheap quality. Bottom of the barrel in every way.

As long as you realize your buying a case for under 30 bucks you'll be happy with it. Put your gun in it, throw it on the floor and jump on it, yeah your gonna be upset, but that is not what this case is for. It will however be perfect for keeping your rifle safe from your normal thumps and bangs. The four snap closures securely keep it from popping open (unlike another cheap case I saw in a store). The foam does seam to be a little thin but that is not hard nor expensive to fix. Overall a decent case for the money and I would buy another if the need arises."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a travel case...","review":"I bought two of these cases for a couple of my guns. Both are very cheaply constructed in comparison to another hard case I have. The hassle of sending them back isn't worth it for me. I will use them until they are junk.

I knew this wasn't a $300 rifle case, so didn't expect much, but this thing is worthless! There is no way to describe just how flimsy the plastic is, but the cardboard box it was delivered in had more strength and rigidity. As for the foam, as others have stated, it's totally insufficient. I'm not talking about throwing it around and expecting it not to move, but I put my 10/22 in with scope, closed and latched the case, picked it up, set it back down gently, and the gun had already moved a couple of inches down onto the pillars. I didn't even take a step, didn't shake it, just picked it up. As for the latches, one of them fell off in the first 2 minutes.I thought I'd give it a go and didn't have high expectations, but this thing is completely worthless. I was hoping for a bargain, but I guess, sometimes, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOUR RIFLE IS NOT SAFE HERE!!","review":"Cheap, Flimsy, Loose padding, Inadequate padding.....So here's what i did: I took the padding out of the case, which isn't hard it just falls right out. Then I grabbed some quilt stuffing out of my wife's sewing room and cut it to fit in the top and bottom of the case. Hot glue that in the case and then hot glue the original padding to the quilt stuffing. Its a lot of work that I shouldn't have to do, but now my rifle doesn't move around inside the case. Don't buy this case! Your rifle is not safe in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case for the Money","review":"For the price this is a great case for protecting your gun during transports. I use it with a Mossberg 590A1 and it works exceptionally well. I have other long guns from SIG Sauer that include a case with the purchase of the gun. This case was just as good if not better than the cases provided by SIG Sauer.If you just need a case for transporting your long gun this will work well.

But it's also highly readable, utterly compelling, and wholly eloquent in tackling one of the taboo truths about mothers all over the world and especially in the developed West, where our to-do lists grow by the minute, our media tell us to count our blessings, and medical professionals often fail to address signs and symptoms of depression at an early stage.

Margaret Mortland"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mortland Sisters were not a loveable bunch","review":"My book club read The Sisters Mortland and we failed to find a single character we liked.The book is well-crafted but the story is primarily about mean-spirited individuals or people who are self-focused. The author never made a good case to prove Maisie was a challenged child. In the beginning she seemed the most sane of the lot. Then all at once she was the sister who needed never to be left alone. It is not credible to switch gears so quickly. The one person who has the sole possiblity to be a good guy, Julia's long-suffering spouse, turns out to be one of the major catalysts for the sisters' disasters.

On a second thought, even a third title, in Australia perhaps, would not save this full of plot and airs and rather insignificant and somewhat freakish novel from the oblivion it deserves. Plenty of characters, at least three sisters, some handsome abusive and abused guys, and lots of English countryside mist- all crash into a whole lot of nothing. The three sisters might be as beautiful as they are being described, but it does not turn them into attractive reading material. The men who paint them and fall for them drink and love and hate and suffer as cartoon heroes do. Consequently, a supposedly intricate plot leaves at least one question unanswered: what is it all about - and who really cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I fought my way through this book and have nothing to show for it.

From the beginning I fell in love with Maisie, a child unlike any other. Through her eyes we meet her family and their friends and the descriptions of the abbey are immaculate. Then the story jumps ahead 20 years and Dan the gypsy takes over the narration and the book's mysteries slowly dissolve, well, almost all the mysteries. The tone of the book changes when Dan takes over and there are some dark moments, but the writing is absolutely delicious and the story compelling. Even the minor characters are very well drawn.

Total buzzkill. I cannot figure out what I am misreading in the item description or why no one else has had this issue.Fortunately the local O'Reilly sells one made by Peformance Tool (search google for performance tool W1139) that fits both quart and gallon bottles. The wider thread of the pump fits the wide-mouth liter-sized oil bottles which is what my manual transmission fluid came packaged in. It also pumps 1 ounce (30 cc) per actuation and made short work of the 1.3 L of transmission fluid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little device","review":"Perfect fit on a quart bottle and just the sensitivity needed for topping up, say, motorcycle chaincase oil levels.

Didn't make a mess, but did take a lot of pumps. Overall it made the task very easy and no problems. Hose was long enough, longer wouldn't have helped to keep it in the fill hole. I'd recommend it for jobs like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Great price and does exactly what is advertised. Used it for replacing differential and transmission fluid on an E46 BMW where you cannot use a funnel from above. The pump threads onto both a Mobil 1 and a Royal Purple 1qt bottles. I knew it only pumped small amounts which can be tiring, but at the same time helps you avoid overfilling. My only gripe (very small one) is that the suction hose that goes into the bottle can be too short to reach the bottom and thus forcing you to pour the remains into another container to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Overall this is a very good product, sturdy, and useful.

As some mentioned it doesn't screw on the Redline bottle top but it fits in and unless you were planning to store the bottle with this on it who cares if it screws on. It sucked out all but a couple of tablespoons from the bottom of the bottle. It was able to transfer two quarts in a few minutes. If it only worked once, it would be worth the price, and I have no reason to believe it won't last for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I use this for pumping fluid into the differential of my car. It worked well until the feed tube slipped off the bottom of the pump and fell into the bottle of fluid. I couldn't get it back out without tilting the bottle but fortunately I had some extra tubing lying around. Just bewar when using this pump. Another thing, this took a LOT of pumps to get 2 quarts of fluid into the diff. Would definitely recommend finding something else with a larger capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"It does exactly what it's supposed to. The length of tube is just right too. The only thing to be aware of is that it only pumps 4cc's per pump, so it does take a good number of pumps to empty a quart bottle of fluid. Nothing crazy, but if you're doing a few bottles, it helps to have someone to alternate with."},{"rating":"2","title":"olive oil pump","review":"Use this pump to pump ollive oil from a five gallon can into half gallon bottles.

Yes, not all the songs are great (some seem, in fact, to be little more than filler), but several tracks stand out as among the most brilliant the legendary group have ever recorded. \\"Rhythm of Time\\" is a roiling stomp, all aggressive beats and growled vocals--a quintessential 242 track. And \\"Gripped by Fear\\" is as close as you'll come to an industrial ballad, an almost symphonic piece that manages to be devastating and beautiful at the same time. These songs alone are worth buying the album for, but of course you also get other gems, such as \\"The Untold\\" and \\"Soul Manager.\\" Not a bad deal at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyranny (For You) ~ Front 242","review":"I distinctly remember seeing the tragedy for you video on MTV back in 1991 and I loved it. The beat is grinding, the melody filled with aggresion and the vocals are amazing. Then when the album was released later that year, I was blown away by the sound, beat, well everything about it. I had been waiting impatiently and back in 1991 there was no internet so one simply had to wait and wait for the album to released to hear anything at all.

Every track is carefully crafted and Jean-Luc DeMeyer's lyrical talents and deep Belgian voice are coming into their prime.

You want to be away from this person you love, and then forget about being with him as soon as possible.Then you watch Hollywood portrayals of such people or such families, for example, and know it's blatantly unrealistic and far more palatable than the truth.Watch this movie. Stevie and his family reminds me of all this, and it's impossible to just forget about it. It's starkly real. It's not a big old downer trip, though. You'll enjoy it, and you'll laugh a bit. But it's real, and it's an education. There was a time when we expected that of our documentaries. Wasn't there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most fascinating films I've ever seen","review":"The reviews here are alreay wonderful, so I won't add much. This film shies away from little.

Whereas a lot of people walk away from this film feeling like Steve used Stevie's situation as an opportunity, I felt that the film was more of a reflection of how he feels that he's failed his \\"little brother\\". It would be easier for James to edit himself out of the film, to focus solely on Stevie and to take advantage of his situation, but instead he references himself shouldering some of the blame for the situation. I believe it was the filmmaker's intention to show himself at his most distasteful, it's part of the honestly of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible documentary","review":"I knew nothing of this film when I bought the DVD. I'm a huge fan of documentaries of any ilk, but am particularly interested in those concerning \\"average\\" people. This is a fascinating character study and an indictment of what happens when certain members of our society are ignored, abused, and neglected.The crime that Stevie was ultimately sentenced to prison for is reprehensible in everyone's eyes. But, Steve James did everything he could to at least try and get inside Stevie's head and figure out what may have gone wrong.I'm not going to write a long review, and don't feel it necessary to recount images and instances from the film. Suffice it to say, this is a great film, even for people who may find documentaries \\"boring.\\" I cannot recommend it more highly. I can only say, if you haven't seen it, see it. If it's been a while since you've seen it, see it again.

But, for someone who has done a great deal of reading on the topic and possesses an advanced degree in a relatively unrelated field (clinical psychology), this is a very readable book on Heisenberg's thinking related to quantum physics. For those who know anything about quantum physics, however, it cannot be overemphasized that this is, in fact, only one perspective on quantum physics (though, probably, the most accepted). Heisenberg was one of the originators (along with Wolfgang Pauli and, particulary, Niels Bohr) of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics.

It is remarkable how much history of philosophy Heisenberg knows, however I don't really find a thesis here. Not like the principle of complementarity of Bohr.

We have a year and a half old mini goldendoodle who still makes frequent \\"mistakes\\" near the back door carpet - same general area all the time. She smells her previous pee, that's where she goes - only natural. We used the whole bottle when we got it for the worst parts and while it has helped a lot, you can still smell the pee.

The former tenants apparently locked the kids in the room, so I guess they peed on the carpet.the thing is that the odor was not so bad, we had the carpet cleaned professionally with enzymes, then I cleaned it with a carpet cleaner so the odor was very fain, but I could still smell it when it was warmer and more humid in the room. So I bought this product to get rid of it completely....well, now the odor is back, it sticks of urine in the room. I do not know how that can be possible!I treated the area first, let it air dry, and the result was bad. So I soaked it up with the remaining solution in the bottle.

Guy Pearce is a really interesting actor, as is William Fichtner. Their nuanced performances are the reason for my 4 stars. Somewhere around three quarters of the way through things get a bit formulaic. Also, the women characters in this don't really hold up their end of things. That might partly be a failing of the Director and/or the script. I appreciated the New Mexican locale and the philosophical underpinnings, although this would've been better if the trajectory of the storyline had been allowed to meander into unexpected areas and the dark tone given a respite. Overall this film achieves a lot on a low budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting but mostly disappointing","review":"Although Guy Pearce is a great actor and really pulls through, I still expected more out of this movie. As usual, I tend to base movie on trailers, but I guess maybe I should not always go according to them. This is one of the movies with a really good trailer, but except for a few good scenes, it pretty much stops there. They could have done a lot more with this and it could have been presented differently. Many parts are slow and not enough content to keep it interesting.

All in all, it wasn't totally bad but too many dull long stretches and not enough to keep the momentum."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rise and fall","review":"Ugh! We love Guy's work, and this one starts out for the first 30 minutes or so as a building thriller with a promising premise. Then it goes South, which is what he and we should have done.

You'll Dig it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"No XP Driver","review":"I have owned this scanner for about a year. Its performance was decent but not what I would expect from a PC Mag Editors' Choice. Photos were often disappointing, and negative scanning is mediocre. It doesn't work at all any more. Why? Because Epson hasn't gotten around to supplying an XP driver, and I bought a great new XP computer in November 2001. EVERY device I own (from printer to camera) readily worked with XP except this scanner. The Epson website has promised an XP driver for \\"early 2002\\" since November 2001; it's now February 2002, and there is still no driver, and Epson doesn't answer email. Do yourself a favor: don't buy this scanner if you have XP, and think seriously about buying anything from a company that doesn't support its products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Epson heard of future-proofing","review":"Lots of rave reviews about this by now obsolete item. I have it a couple of years, but still I can't escape the feeling that if you walk into a shop in Ireland and say, 'I'll take that one,' you'll end up with a model that's on the way out everywhere else.Nothing wrong with it as far as it goes: does the job it's asked to do. Just don't buy a new PC with a new OS.I've wasted too much time trying to find a replacement XP driver for this machine, which now effectively has become a piece of junk. Online support is available from Epson provided you get there before 5pm! So, I suppose this is a comment not so much on the product but on the brand, the support and future-proofing or lack thereof. I suppose I could keep my old PC just for Epson's convenience, but I rather think things should be the other way around.None of my other hardware peripherals have caused me grief in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SCANNER I'VE OWNED","review":"I run a photo studio from my garage and I need equipment that I can rely on; Everything I had heard about the 1200 is true, from the fast USB setup to the excellent twain driver. Scans are fast and accurate. The only drawback that I ran across was the scanner not being compatible with my copy of Windows 2000 RC2, I had to go back to Windows 98. When you conbine the Epson Perfection 1200 and a printer like my Epson stylus photo 750, you will no longer need to go back to Eckerds for reprints."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loooooooooooooooooved this book","review":"This is one of my fave books.I feel the need to borrow it fromthe library every six months or so.I have always loved Amberley'sdeliciously absurd sense of humour.I loved Rosalind's character.I also loved Nurse&Broody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase! I use it daily.","review":"I am a student at Colorado Technical University Online and this book has made my classwork and labs a breeze. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just fine...but....","review":"After receiving the Updated version, this one pales in comparison.It still has great info but the newer version is much more colorful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have purchased second-hand medical textbooks on 2 occasions. Both times I was delighted with the purchase. The condition of the books was better than I expected, and certainly better than were advertised, and I received them surprisingly quickly. I will have not hesitate to purchase more via this method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I was looking for an updated all around medical reference. Dorland's stood out for me because of the vastness of information provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Bible\\" of medical dictionaries","review":"As a medical transcriptionist, I have used many different medical dictionaries, but for me, Dorland's has always been regarded as the \\"Bible.\\" I can always count on it to be accurate in listing all variations and extensions of words. To the person who complained about the quality of the paper of the dictionary and all sorts of \\"non-essential\\" things, I can only say look to the essentials of what a dictionary is supposed to be -- accurate, informative, easy to use, and a source you can rely on it -- and Dorland's provides all of those things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorlands Illustrated Medical Dictionary 31st ed.","review":"From the standpoint of a pre med student, this is a fantastic medical resource! I have really appreciated having it- I can very quickly and easily look up any terms, conditions, etc., of which I am unaware and feel I need to know. Beautiful illustrations, easy to assimilate, and, so far, it's had a definition for everything I've queried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a med student I got it for paying club dues for 4 years (a wash). I purchased primarily for the Word spellchecker and PDA dictionary. The former works ok, the latter is just stupid.I'm a former software Product Manager and get the darn thing installed. Customer Service, especially from MobiPocket (whom I will never purchase anything from in the future) is atrocious. I'm going to fork over another $50 for a new dictionary just to escape this time wasting endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorland's is my fave!","review":"I have the current edition (30th) and I absolutely love it! Another plus is you are given a code to be able access their online dictionary as well! It's a great book with great illustrations as well. From what I can see it is very thorough. I haven't run across a medical word yet that wasn't in it! :) I'm a new MT so I don't really have anything to compare Dorlands too, but I know that I'm hooked on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Medical Dictionary","review":"This is the best of both worlds for a medical professional, for this combines the best medical dictionary, i.e. Dorlands, with the electronic world. My hat is off to Dorlands. You will not find a better medical dictionary anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorland's Medical Dictionary, 30th Edition","review":"I have been relying on Dorland's since 1964. This is obviously the best edition to date and it will continue to be one of my most dependable reference sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL NOT UPDATE WORD 2010 !!!","review":"If you have office 2010, don't waste your money on this edition.I called the main office to see if they would atleast send me an updated CD that would update office 2010. so far the answer is no...so much for customer support.Shouldn't matter what version of word or office you have it should still be able to update the spell check...This is the last Dorland I will ever buy!!![...]Just uzip, copy dic file, open word, file, options, proofing, select custom dictionaries, add, paste copied dic file and then selct open, set MTH-MedSpelChek.dic as default and your all set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is the size of my house - spell checker is AWESOME but worthless","review":"I am currently in a nursing student at a local university. This book was part of our forcibly-enforced book package. I've found that the best resource is Taber's Cyclopedic Encyclopedia for the PDA.Dorland's spell checker makes this package almost worth it, provided it didn't CRASH MS Word 2003 incessantly.I really feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I expected more...","review":"...this is the best general medical dictionary out there, but I have to admit I expected deeper and more extensive definitions in some areas. Of course, this would mean adding more pages in the already-2000-paged book, but hey... if the definitions are needed they have to be fully-featured! The illustrations are great..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used this book when I was taking a calculus class. It helped me to understand derivatives, antiderivatives and integrals","review":"Easy to understand. It is worth the money that I paid to download it to the Kindle on my iPad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workbook!","review":"Is exactly as advertised in that is a very good workbook to rejuvenate calculus that I used to know 10 years ago, but need to use again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for learning calculus","review":"I did plenty of calculus in undergrad, but I haven't used it since about 12 years. Now that I am in graduate business school, I needed a refresher on calculus. This book is perfect. Even if you are new to calculus, this book will work for you. I suggest that you do the exercises at the back of each chapter to solidify your understanding. \\"Practice makes perfect\\" is at least true in mathematics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor for a review","review":"Or for anything else for that matters. I sold it nearly as fast as I bought it. It fails to explain limits, fails in giving a proper definition of the derivative. The problem is not in its lack of rigor, that is acceptable for many non-mathematicians who need to just learn or use the calculus as a tool. There are better choices out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you always meant to look into Calculus","review":"I have collected a shelf full of calculus books over the years. I looked for the \\"magic bullet.\\" This book is it. The pre-calculus review at the beginning brings you back to speed. Then each chapter deftly progresses into the heart of the matter. I highly recommend this a book for even rank beginners. The writing is top shelf and the ideas are clear and easily grasped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect review for those who have \\"forgotten calculas\\"","review":"I've been out of college for several years and decided to go back for a masters degree. Unfortunately the degree I went for required me to recall a ton of knowledge that was buried in the deep places of my mind. This book helped me to recall my knowledge fo calculas and even taught me some techniques I wasn't aware of before. I say it's a good review because if someone weren't introduced to calculas before they might be easily intmidated by the subject material eventhough this book does the best job possible to easily convey the material to the reader. Kudos to the authors!! I was able to recall 3 years of calculas in approxiamtely 1.5 months. As a study aid or textbook supplement, I would receommend this for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a very good learning tool: simple language instruction, lots of examples and problems, all with step-by-step explanations.No frustrating 'big jumps'in ether the examples or the problems-the provided answers make absolute sense. Learning never was so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good prep before starting an MBA","review":"The book and very good and is a good prep before you start an MBA. The book expalins the material in a straight forward manner with clear explains and many practice questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much flash, too little substance","review":"I bought three books to help me re-teach myself calculus this fall - two of them,Calculus, 7th Edition, book and CD, andSchaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus (Schaum's 3000), have been very helpful. Not so this book. It seems to favor fluffy, \\"alternative\\" ways to explain things, at the expense of explaining them thoroughly at all. Take a look inside and decide maybe if you are this kind of learner - but I have felt it to be pretty much utterly frustrating and useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not shoot a single, straight stream","review":"The water on this gun only comes out in the double twisted helix. All of my kids and their cousins immediately started fighting to get the old soakers which \\"shot straight\\", which is to say, in a single stream. Still, effective for the little kids, who have more of a challenge hitting their target..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick WinXp Install and Setup, Fast transfer","review":"Very quick and the hardest part was finding my cd drive so I could click the setup.exe of the software. I mean my documents, my pictures, when I finally found it I did a double click, and it set itself up. I should note that I also used an access point to connect my dsl and ethernet lines and the wireless connection was between My Computer, I mean, my computer and the access point. They work together by default. I'm not sure about the security of it all, I need to look into that part of it. But I was able to use my computer in the other room and download streaming pornography without running any cables, to me that makes it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading Even Though Its Almost a Century Old","review":"Its an old book- which is okay.What surprise me is the somewhat casual and humor-injected writing style. I didn't know people were allowed to write like that in 1924.Very informative and would still be a good book by today's standards."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},C={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",W,[(o(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-121f2a9d"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/18.md","filePath":"glossary/18.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/18.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
