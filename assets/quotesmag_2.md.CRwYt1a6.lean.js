I say started because I couldn't get ahold of the last two books for months so I read the Cronicles for DL in between. \\"Homeland\\" the first book in the series was more that just a good book. As you flip through the pages you feel like you are in the book, a small hidden charater who watched everything go on. You picture what each charater looks like in vivid detail. Salvatore does a fantastic job of conveying the whole feel of the underdark. The second and third books were equally as compelling, when I finally got to read them. If you have ever read any fantasy and even slightly liked it and haven't read the Dark Elf Trilogy then you have missed something special, buy this book and read it, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining read!","review":"This was my first novel by R.A. Salvatore and I have to confess that this was a very entertaining read. The author did a great job creating the world in which Drizzt lived and grew up in. It was more convincing than I would have originally thought. In fact, I confess that I bought this more on whim and wasn't sure that I'd enjoy it. Fantasy is not always my bag but this was a nice surprise. I'm going to have to give other novels by the author a try. And since this was 3 novels in one, I did get to enjoy an extended trek with the character. I would definitely recommend this for someone wanting a fantasy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Poorly written, re-hashed \\"high\\" fantasy garbage.

I started to read this book on the train trip to work and after not reading for many years found myself once again immersed in a book and the world created by R.A. Salvatore. Written as a prequel to the Icewind Dale Triogy, it is a very good place to start in the dark and entertaining world of the Dark Elf, However be warned, You too will be become hooked, perhapes even as I have becoming an avid reader again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark elf trilogy","review":"This was the first set of Drizzt books I read, and they are the best.

You save alot of money AND get to read the best Drizzt book on planet Earth.Well anyway, about the books themselves. They're are about a drow (an evil elf) named drizzt do'urdon who doesn't fit in with the rest of the drow. THey talk about rascism, not fitting in, and all thosse other bad things. It lets you understand how people who don't fit in feel. Plus drizzts swords are awesome.BUY THIS BOOK SET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not awesome","review":"This is the first of Salvatore's Drizz't work that I've read, and I found it to be somewhat uneven. Certain parts were quite good, but others weren't very convincing.I think that part of it is what I call Grape Ape syndrome - at times Drizz't is a completely unbeatable, invincible whirlwhind of destruction, yet at others some doofy local yokel bounty hunter gives him a run for his money. After the incredible build-up of his ability in the Underdark, the scenes where he's having trouble don't ring true. It did hold my interest, however, and it is a great choice if you're looking for light reading.(You may remember the age-old Saturday morning Grape Ape cartoon. At times he was taller than skyscrapers, and at others he rode on the top of a van without trouble.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take this too seriously...","review":"This was my first exploration into the whole Forgotten Realms deal. It's very much \\"low fantasy,\\" violent and brutal without many characters to simpathize with. The writing is not good at all, but the story is still interesting, and you still feel for the characters. This is not an equal of the Lord of the Rings at all; imagine Tolkien crossed with a comic book, and this is what you get. The fight scenes do more to conjure up images of playing a role playing game than they do actual fighting; there is not the sense of realism here that there is in other fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!!!","review":"I love the book and it gets better and better as the story goes on!!

This book makes for a nice read. It provides some insight and a nice perspective into drow society from the viewpoint of an outsider and, I believe, serves as a nice backstory for the Drizzt character and how he came to be.All three books in the trilogy come in a single volume, though I would have preferred that they came separate which would make them easier to carry around (I do some reading in the train to/from work). But other than that, I'm quite pleased with the purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent then dismaying !!!","review":"Volume 1 is a delight, everything you wanna know about the drow society, can be used to describe any other dark, underground, highly sophisticated/perverted society.Volumes 2 and 3 are so poor seems like somebody else wrote them, or else the author lost inspiration, or else he needed money fast. Typically D&D; when not handled by an inspired master: no atmosphere, one can hear the dice rolling and the typical HP an XP counting... Characters are so caricatural and one dimensional, likewise with the scenery, as if the author got lost when outside of dungeons. Again typically D&D;: roborative, accounting-like. I read till the end out of respect for the writer, not sure he had respect for his readers when he wrote the last two volumes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant modern fantasy!","review":"Drizzt is the most beloved character ever created in the Forgotten Realms. This trilogy kicks off his underdark adventures. \\"Homeland\\" takes readers to the mysterious and dangerous city of the drow that still haunts me to this day. The other two novels take Drizzt beyond the Drow city through the underdark and to the surface realm to prepare him for larger than life excursions though the Realms!This modern take on traditional themes will stand as a classic within the genre. First reading it, I would have never imagined its popularity. It can be read by all. Bravo to Drizzt for saving the Realms in more ways than one! Mr. Salavatore's titles should be included in all school libraries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent!","review":"Very well... Drizzt isn't perfect hero, but who cares?(but half past is)I think dark elf trilogy is one of bests I\`ve ever read.

If you've read Lord of the Ring and liked it your going to love all and I mean all of the dark elf series. I highly recommend these books and maybe it will inspire some heros out there. Here's a list for easy reference the order I was recommended to read these books. THE DARK ELF TRILOGY, THE ICEWIND DALE TRILOGY, LEGACY OF THE DROW, PATHS OF DARKNESS ALL ARE QUITE ENJOYABLE thank you R. A.

The characters are lovable, but predictable. The plot is pretty much mapped out from the beginning, but I found myself not caring. R.A. Salvatore writes simply, perhaps, but well, and I was entertained by these novels on both read throughs. Drizzt and Guenwyvhar (sp?) are lovable characters, if a little two-dimensional, and I found this to be a light but very fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE HAV E YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!","review":"Forget Tolkien!

Because the antagonist can't kill the main character and the main character can't kill the antagonist. What's the point in reading a book when you know the out come, Drizzt wins.

Wow!How disappointing, then, to find nothing more than the gurglings of a semi-conscious toddler on display here. You can't rush genius, but Jeffie's horrible stage-parents thought nothing of dragging their 18-month-old Boy Wonder into the recording studio for the delight and edification of us all. The result is what you'd expect. Snorts, squeals, giggles, a few simple malformed words (mostly \\"mama,\\" \\"poopy,\\" and \\"cat\\") are sampled over and over to a synthesized drum track.

And....Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) does live up to expectations.A fair mix of rap-funk music and ambient chill-out tracks, expect nothing too similar from Vertigo. The excellent first single showcases GA's deep inclinations with the use of beats and rap-funk-hiphop in their music. There are a few tracks in the same vein (Raising The Stakes, Tuning In).

That's saying alot considering the bands that were around back in '77-'80. This is classic punk. No mowhauks. No trendy clothe. Just crystal pure punk. These guys, along with The Plugz and The Screamers, were teaching us youngsters what music could and should sound like. It's great to see bands like this being discovered by a new generation. They're touring again and I took my two boys (11 and 13) to see them a few months ago. They were blown away. Helium Bar is one of the best punk songs ever written and is worth the cost of the whole cd. If you want real oldschool punk by the guys who invented and defined it, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What went wrong? They should have been huge!","review":"\\"We Got the Neutron Bomb\\" is one of the best songs ever. Too bad it's so dated.

They both receive a VHS tape of their parents, with film shots from a stalker. VHS? Seriously? They both still own a VHS player to play the tape. Maybe their parents didn't commit suicide after all. Angie suspects the creepy neighbor. Or could it be Brian's roommate?

You can guess what happens. That's an indication of the credibility of this low budget yawner. The movie is slow-paced and lit so you can see either spores or gnats in an angelic glow. The acting is mediocre and the killer's identity pretty obvious. Not much to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my grandsons","review":"We are working on having the whole collection a great tool for teaching the goodness of our God. We bought these for our two awesome grandsons, Donovan and Connor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the hype.","review":"This album is a horribly dull experience. The music is run of the mill, not interesting or ground breaking in anyway. The only way anyone would be impressed by it is if they've been living under a rock or listening to boy bands or some [thing] like that. Beth's voice is a total bore. She seems to have, perhaps, a 3 note range. Every song sounds the same. Very little tempo changing or emotion change. Lot's of out of key signing too. Just a complete disappointment overall. Maybe I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"There seems to be a shift in the direction of real country music and the people who sing it--All seem to be playing to the same consummer--younger and more POP oriented--This is a colection of more of the same , sung with a mournful , crying sound and is not a Folk style or a Country style that I would ever buy. Bring back the sound of all the GREAT folk groups and single performers of the 60's and 70's that were a joy to listen to.If I wanted Garth Brooks histronics and fancy sets and hollywood style productions -- there are plenty of music videos around--Lets not forget that a song thats pleasant to hear , with flowing melodys and thought prvoking lyrics are the ones that never go out of style--it seems that everyone is pandering to the \\"children\\" with the music and the video selections that are made avalible--Maybe someone should take a hard look at what is being forgotten and ask why. You might even make a little money selling good instead of following the herd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good music.","review":"I got this CD after hearing Stolen Car on a compilation CD and completely falling in love with it. After getting the CD, Stolen Car is still my favorite song, but it would be a challenge to decide which is my least favorite, since they're all so good. The album has bits and pieces of all different kinds of music. Some songs are very pop-like, while others could almost classify as dance music. These days with teen-pop and rap topping the charts, it's nice to find that good music still exists out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mood Music","review":"I first discovered Beth on \\"The Next Best Thing\\" Soundtrack with \\"Stars All Seem to Weep\\" and then I picked up Central Reservation recently and I really like it. It's good to listen to in the car or at work. It's not obnoxious like most of today's top 40. If you like mild easy listening this is a good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Everything But the Girl Be Wrong?","review":"I guess I am one of the few people that doesn't necessarily love or hate Beth. I find that her music has a definite mood--one that you get without listening to the lyrics per se. I am impressed with her vocals and haven't tired of her voice as I do with other female singers these days. Check out \\"Stars All Seem To Weep\\" and \\"Central Reservation (The Then Again Version)\\" to hear Ben Watt's (of Everything But the Girl) mixes. Sorry Beth, I adore Tracey Thorn, but I'll listen to you after EBTG and Jonatha Brooke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am unimpressed.","review":"Fairly repetitious explicit lesbian lyrics in a folk music format deliver less than could hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM BITES!","review":"I might as well thrown my money in the garbage cause thats where this CD is. Absolutely the worst album I have ever heard. I found her voice irritating -harsh, there was nothing driving her lyrics- no melodical force, just bland tiresome trash. I certainly did not hear what everyone was raving about. If your favorites are among Sarah McLachlan, Tara McLean, Tori Amos, Heather Nova ..etc...do NOT buy this album, you will be greatly dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the F***-Word mean anxthing to you?","review":"This album is one of the worst I ever heard: This is bad-made music, with even worse Lyrics!

It was just really dumb and a waste of twenty dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this cd?","review":"I had high hopes for this cd after reading all the high praise. And it's true -- she has an interesting voice. But she can't hold a tune! And the songs are depressed and depressing. It's like a musical qualuude for the tone-deaf...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you stay awake?","review":"This is slightly better than \\"Daybreaker\\". \\"Stolen car\\" is a amazingly good song and the only reason that I rate this 2 stars instead of 1 star. Too bad Orton other material isn't that good. I can admit that some song here and there is alright, like \\"Devil song\\" but most of the time it's like a sleeping pill - nothing ever happens! If you don't believe me - buy it, put on, fall asleep... And if like this kind of music I won't be surprised if you'll find the awful \\"Sebastopol\\" by Jay Farrer exciting. You don't have to thank me for the tip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around good album","review":"I bought this album based on nothing other than the fact that I had read about Beth Orton's talent, and I enjoy other female artists such as Ani DiFranco, Sarah McLachlan, Indigo Girls, and Bjork. When i first listened to Central Reservation I was a little disappointed, but after listening to it a few more times, I really enjoyed it. Orton is like no other female vocalist I have ever heard, and her voice is refreshing. If you're in the mood for a new sound and a new artist, I would recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal Folk","review":"With a voice that is suitably laconic and soft, emotional and driven, Orton sings quiet (yet not silent) songs of despair, abandon, love lost or introspective. Framed in a traditional folk style that is brought totally up to date thanks to shimmering electronic backing that never intrudes, always adds shading and nuance. Vocally, Orton recalls the best of the Brit folk school: John Martyn, Sandy Denny, Linda Thompson. Yet tossed in are elements of Lucinda Williams and alt.country. In the end, Orton's CENTRAL RESERVATION is an always captivating release with much mood and grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"For all the hype surrounding this album (in the high brow New Yorker even!), I thought this album really quite average. Lyrics were hackneyed and music too dramatic. Am I missing something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept her music like your own destiny....","review":"This was my first Beth Orton's album. All these mid-tempo music are not dynamic, not strong, nor quiet, but consistently resonant with my heart. Her alto-mistic voice makes vague contrast with clear-cut acoustic (some electrical) strings. Although her song title are sometimes eccentric (but at the same time poetic), that's because she is trying to face truth of life. If you are down on your luck, her voice touches your heart gently and let you help to face the reality. This one is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully hard to categorize","review":"This album contains many different genres of music--all of them, however, bear the singular mark of Beth Orton. \\"Stolen Car\\" is folky mtv alternative rock; \\"The Sweetest Decline\\", an absolutely marvelous song, is breathless cabaret music; \\"Stars All Seem To Weep\\" is electronic; \\"Pass in Time,\\" the worst song on the album, is unfocused Van Morrison; \\"Blood Red River\\" is riveting traditional folk. You get the idea. Orton's voice is magnificent--coy, breathy, but not at all weak, and quietly emotional. One criticism: she needs to shrug off the treacly folk sentiments in a couple songs and focus on tighter, more concrete (or looser, more surreal) lyrics. Nonetheless, this is a very rewarding album--one of the best of 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth Leaves the Trailer Park","review":"This is a wonderful record, but it is much different than the one that made everyone from Ecstacy-munching ravers to middle-aged soccer moms fall in love with her. I personally like the departure from the full blown strum-n-bass thing on Trailer Park (and it's not like there's not some of that on Central Resv), but then again, I'm old, and I sit around imagining her singing these songs with Van Morrison. In fact, if the two of them never get together to do Pass In Time, well, the world has truly been diminished. Decidedly more mature in its approach -- much more traditional in its pop/torch/love songs. But its still winter where I'm at, so how can you eschew the warmth of this record?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Beth Orton is a fantastic performer, and Trailer Park was a brilliant debut record. This one is even better. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Central Reservation","review":"I was in the music store sometime back and was browsing. All of a sudden, my attention was drawn to this wonderful, folky voice. I immediately decided I had to have this beautiful music for myself. So I bought it. This is the kind of CD you can play from start to finish, each song better than the last. My most fav is #12, Central Reservation. It is very inspiring to me! I hope that others enjoy it as much as I do!!! I am ready to buy Trailer Park, and if it is anything like Central Reservation I know I've made a good investment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"honestly pretty","review":"hands down, this is one of the best CDs of this year - the year of desperation right before millennium. lucidity never sounded this good. please invest in this, let yourself be indulged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut Version...Stay Away...","review":"Avoid this one by all means!

I believe these are both the things about her voice that make it unique and pretty. I don't want someone with a weak voice or a low voice- that doesn't sound feminine. Graciela is a feminine singer with the type of voice a woman is supposed to have- high. If her voice were low she would sound like a man. So I believe that on this album, her voice is especially high since the songs are from her early years, and that makes it especially beautiful and feminine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too few songs for this voice- the voice is too good","review":"Graciela Beltran should have recorded 50 songs on this cd. 17 weren't enough!

Mariamne is a water witch - her powers come from, use, and share water. But being a witch isn't her goal in life - she simply wants to finish her degree at the university and get a job in her field! But the untimely arrival of Hanson, her Watcher, disrupts her life and her studies. To Mari's dismay, Hanson's arrival also saved her life because her visions are so forceful that she's been blinded to reality at times, almost walking into traffic. Hanson moves into Mari's house to protect her, sleeping on the couch, which her fellow housemates find distinctly uncomfortable. But when earthquakes (or worse!) threaten Mari's city and friends, Mari sits up and takes notice of her gifts and her Watcher - trying to use both to save her life and the lives of those around her. I am enjoying the Watcher series, although I still have to put WORKING FOR THE DEVIL at the top of her list of works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic about Brazilian culture","review":"This is probably the best book about Brazilian culture, from an anthropological perspective.DaMatta is at his best here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightful!","review":"A treat for any Hal Hartley Fan.

Of course we cannot compare J.Suryanarayanamurthy, a Kalakshetra professor, with P.Chebrolu. So why P.Chebrolu's DVD should be 3 times more expensive than J.Suryanarayanamurthy's?Instead of giving too many cultural introduction (we all can read books, and do not need lectures on DVDs!), P.Chebrolu should have given more time to actually show and explain the moves deeper.Anyone who actually tries to learn anything with this DVD will end up with too many unanswered questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged","review":"product came damaged.Blue Ray rejected the disc. i will be returning product.. i have been a loyal customer for years.

I also have Marcy's teaching on guitar, but my hands are too small yet, so Happy Traum told my dad that playing the Ukulele would be a good idea for me, and I really love it.I learned to play chords and some fun songs like On Top of Spagetti, Bingo, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Row Your Boat, and others.

I cannot believe they are not very well known. This CD is a must along with their second release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underrated band in metal","review":"Although I feel that Journey of Souls is superior to this album, Heaven's Gate does not fail to deliver. It still boggles my mind as to why this band has such a small following. It is truly astonishing. Nearly every Keldian song is solid and extremely addictive. They bring a very unique sound to the power metal genre combining 80s vocals with space/futuristic lyrics. Don't be weak, buy the album and support this band. I'm sure they could use the support. They probably have day jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that needs to be read carefully.","review":"This book is mostly about friendship evangelism. In this regard, it is not all that different from other books like it. It does address friendship evangelism in the context of postmodernism which is something that many of the other books avoid.He makes many excellent points about the mistakes that Christians make. One area in particular is that of the language of Christians. Christians need to understand the language of today's people.This book is different in some of its theology. The author seems to reject the concept that conversion occurs at a point in time. He seems to blur justification and sanctification. Another area of concern is that he doesn't seem to know why Jesus had to die.The book is good and easy to read, but it needs to be read carefully and with discernment."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Pharisees Don't Want You to Know","review":"This book says so much that we have needed to hear for so long, and I think it is extremely relevant to christianity today.

It does reflect the level of recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music....just not enough of it!","review":"I really enjoy listening to this CD, and I would gladly give it five stars for the music. My only complaint is that there just isn't enough of it!

Every so often you find a soundtrack that has one or two nice tracks that you have to get your hands on. I knew the moment I saw this movie, haunting and compelling, that I had to have the music. I searched it out immediately and added to my collection. What an amazing score, the deep south lyricals are so unique and almost out of place that they're perfect for the score, and the use of such moving pieces as O Fortuna rounds out this solid hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foolish movie. Great soundtrack. Typical Burwell.","review":"This movie was quite the pile of dung. But the soundtrack, that MUSIC is so solid that it's certainly one of the most ingenious scores in the last decade. Much hype has been ascribed toward the Library of Congress remixes, songs featuring new background beats coupled with pleasant nego-songs (see also Moby's remixes from his Play album for a close comparison). Those songs are the highlight, no question, but Burwell's songs are not to be overlooked.Echoes of Fargo, Hamlet, Barton Fink, and The Man Who Wasn't There are present here, but Burwell isn't a leech when it comes to his music, and he takes a splendind, darker direction with this score than, yes, even Fargo and Hamlet - as dark as those were.Burwell aficionados won't be disappointed here, neither will fans of darker film scores along the lines of David Julyan's Memento, Thomas Newman's Flesh and Bone, and especially Philip Glass' Fog of War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Score","review":"This score is very haunting and just like the movie grips from the very begining and won't let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The General's Daughter (Sound Track)","review":"Awsome CD, all the music and songs are very moving, lots of power and feelings come out in the music.

Henry's voice doesn't convey the bitterness and cynicism of a Steve Earl or for that matter Thom Yorke or Roger Waters, but rather a sort of detached, downtrodden resignation. The result tears you apart. All of the songs are meticulously written, beautifully performed and produced, and get better with each listening. A few soar to greater heights. You won't be the same after you've listened to \\"Want Too Much\\" or \\"Great Lake\\" a few times.Believe me, you listen to this CD on a visceral and emotional level, not as a distraction to your humdrum life.

It provides scriptural support for questions like \\"Why do Catholics have a priesthood if the Bible says that we are all priests?\\" and \\"Do Catholics worship the saints?\\" I think it is very well done and provides lots of Bible references, in addition to the initial explanation of each topic.

It assumes that you are Catholic and trying to prove your beliefs to a non-Catholic, and even there it falls short by only pointing you to a bible verse and not giving any explanation. If I were Catholic I might be able to use this personally, but it won't help you with a non-believer. For anyone seeking answers about the Catholic faith it just brings up more questions.

If you have no wood working skill or knowledge, he walks you through the basics, but that is not the point of this book. If you want to build an electric guitar, you ought to have at least the amount of skill and equipment that he outlines. But at the same time he offers an approach that those with few tools and a less than pro shop can handle.So a woodworking manual it is not, but for those of us who are skilled woodworkers, ( I am a professional cabinetmaker ) he offers a well thought out and methodical list of steps and processes to build a guitar. It is not a book for \\"idiots\\" , which is good, Koch respects his readers, but he also expects a degree of skill and thoughtfulness.

It pleases the attentive listener at many levels. Considered only as a stream of one-liners and clever quips, it delivers all you could ask for.But because it's Wilde, it's also a wild tirade against the mannered (sometimes ill-mannered) gentry. Behind that, it has a good deal to say about tolerance for the flaws of any fallible human - and Wilde could speak on human flaws with rare authority. And, like any truly great work, its examination of honesty (and dis-) reveals a good bit about today's world, a century later.I'm not normally a reader of plays.

I can't explain this last volume though. It sets up some intriguing stuff but gradually loses its momentum and then simply ends in the middle of the story. There's no resolution for the threads that are set up here, and many of the threads from earlier novels remain dangling as well. The much-hyped \\"cliffhanger ending\\" is there alright, but it's never resolved or paid off. To add insult to injury, there *are* follow up pages to this unresolved story, but they tell a totally unrelated short story which reads like a bad fanfic.Very disappointing.

There are many many recordings, but this set is superior to many. The score used for the recording is the newest version which I think is very accurate. If you know the symphonies well, you will find them different. There is a slight shift of the focus of the tone in this version because of the new edition. The overall impression is very fresh and clean. Compared to highly acclaimed Karajan's recordings of the 70's, there seems to be brighter and clean in the sounds in this one. Karajan's recordings have oil-painting like qualities. The sound is very thick and dark. The resulting sound is thoroughly modern. Abbado's recordings have water-colour painting like qualities. This was achieved in part by reducing the size of the orchestra. He is more classical in his approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Race Work Review","review":"Race Work fills a much needed void on the topic of civil rights in the American West.

The worst part is the paper sensor. The sensor is a black plastic thing hanging down on the tray right next to the rollers. Insert the tray at a slightly elevated angle by mistake and snap, the sensor breaks.

But Ringo, you used to be so much fun, but this album is SO serious.

There are simply too many characters to keep track of, many of whom are completely unnecessary to the story line. The most interesting character, Shirley, is not fully explored. Instead, the author details seemingly pointless escapades of characters who were briefly introduced in the first chapter, not to be mentioned again until the end. It is baffling.Also, many times she speaks directly to the reader, eg: \\"Now, I guess you're wondering what happens to so-and-so...\\" It's very irritating.

My 5 year old loves the talking words factory and my 3 year old loves the Letter Factory. My 3 year old even knows all his letters now by sight (upper case) and is starting to sound them out. My five year old is starting to understand what vowels are! The way the information is presented is very visual and silly - a format that kids understand. ie: In \\"Talking Words Factory,\\" the vowels in the \\"factory\\" (shown in big red uppercase letters) go through a car wash - type scenario and become \\"sticky\\" as to show how vowels are the glue that hold words together. In \\"Letter Factory,\\" each letter has funny costumes and voices that emulate its sound (phonics). GREAT DVD set for teaching pre-schoolers and Kindergarteners.Thank you Leap Frog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers!","review":"This set is the best price out there for these movies that I could find.

After he kills Wesley's goon, his girlfriend tells him he's become as bad as Wesley. Is it necessary to use evil means to rid Jasper of evil? Does doing so make Dalton evil? Perhaps Dalton turns out to be as bad as Wesley (smart, enjoys classical music, likes the same kind of women, and is probably as well-read as Dalton.) C'mon, a sequel is the perfect remedy to answer these questions and to resuscitate Swayze's dormant career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad, but somewhat redeemable","review":"Yes, you read that title right. From the moment Road House opens, you know that you are watching not only one of the worst action movies ever made, but one of the most unbelieveable and incredibly mind numbing movies ever made as well. Yet, there's something about it all that makes it a guilty pleasure for those who use the term \\"suspension of disbelief\\" rather loosely. Patrick Swayze (and he wonders why his career went downhill) plays the new bouncer in town who runs a foul of the local crime boss (Ben Gazzara). For the story, that's pretty much it, along with Kelly Lynch in a role where she seems to be the only person who isn't brain dead, and poor Sam Elliot as Swayze's old friend who drops by to help kick some redneck butt. Incredibly unbelieveable in the ultimate sense of the term, Road House is one of those movies that have to be seen to see just how bad it really is, but for pure escapists only, it can be a bit of a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M GOING TO NAME MY SON (OR DAUGHTER) DALTON.","review":"This movie is a constant challenge to Dalton's personal motto, that \\"nobody wins in a fight.\\" As far as I can tell, Dalton is the biggest winner in the history of the entire world. He's just humble, I guess. Very well, moving on. Since time immemorial there have been a few constant trends dominating man's existence: the needs for fire, water, shelter, companionship, and the proper way to show reverence for Dalton. I believe that I have found an appropriate way to show respect and appreciation for Dalton here at Amazon.com. Thank you. I love all of you. Except I hate Brad Wesley. That SOB was mean and ornery, the embodiment of pure evil. Why couldn't he just leave those poor townfolk alone?!!!??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot see this version","review":"I like this movie a lot that is why I thought I will get the Blu-ray version.

An 80's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Action Movie","review":"This is one of the greatest bar fighting movies ever. Dalton comes to town and totally kicks tail. I am surprised this movie didn't start an entire franchise of Road House movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guy Movie, okay dvd","review":"This is a solid 4.5 star movie. But the dvd is only 4 stars due to only dolby 2.0 sound and almost no extras.But it is a guys movie all the way, good fight scenes, explosions and splash of frontal nudity. This excelent movie is in the same sprit as Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, AlienS and Pale Rider.Surprisingly you can also watch this with women since they go gaga remembering DirtyDancing and Ghost which also stared Patrick Swayze.The only complaint I have is about the effort they put in producing this DVD. Happy that IT IS widescreen but upset at the plainess of the DVD almost no options or extras. I would have loved to see a featureette of Swayze being trained by Benny \\"The Jet\\" Urquidez (who also makes a cameo appearance). And what is up with only dolby 2.0...Jeez does no justice to the fine soundtrack created by Jeff Healy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thinking man's action film","review":"This is perhaps the most sophisticated action film ever made. It is a mixture of rugged sensuality and brutal naturalism. Swayze is at the top of his game and Lynch gives a persuasive, dynamic performance. The action, characters, and plot interweave perfectly. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes their action mingled with philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bloody Mary? Some Breakfast?","review":"This is hands down the best movie ever made! The timeless plot, the believable characters, the conflicts both internal and external, etc. make this a true gem of a movie. Although Hannibal Lector or maybe Darth Vadar are considered to be the \\"ultimate screen villains\\" is there any one character in movie history more frightening than Brad Wesley? Ben Gazzara's turn as the kingpin of Jasper, Missouri is remarkable. Perhaps only one or two times in film history has there been a better performance (possibly DeNiro as \\"Jake LaMotta\\" or Pacino as \\"Michael Corleone\\").However, Gazzara brings a scary realness to the role of Brad Wesley that has been long missing from your typical good guy/bad guy Hollywood movies. Don't get me wrong I love Dalton, but Brad Wesley steals the show. I highly recommend \\"Road House.\\" It is an absolute joyride of a movie that is suitable entertainment for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest","review":"When can a movie be the greatest and still get one star? When it's the greatest drive-in movie ever made. People sometimes call entertainingly bad movies car wrecks. Well, this isn't a car wreck; it's more like a monster truck rally. It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, but you can't believe how serious it is.

You have to be afraid when you pick it up, much less ship the darn thing.I am done with blu-rays if this is what they are coming in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly ridiculous","review":"Not a single second of this beefcake exploitation flick rings the slightest bit realistic, from the endless fisticuffs to the bottles breaking over heads to the absurd scenes inside the \\"Double Deuces\\" where the world's baddest bouncer has come to restore order. Moreover, we are expected to believe that an actual medical doctor would fall in love in a second with this overgrown battler and accompany him to this unlikely establishment. Still, it is amusing to watch Sam Elliott in his maturity. Patrick Swayze was riding his prime here, though the acting skills were limited to smoldering looks and faked fights with lots of fake blood. This plays on certain Tv stations about six times a week, for some reason. Watch for the absurdity factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Bad Tape","review":"I'm giving this movie 1 star for the quality of the video on the tape, the movie is excellent (at least 4 stars). This is the only tape I've purchased where my original recording from HBO was better, although it's not that good either.There are many dropped frames and scan lines like you would see from recording at extended play (EP).I bought this tape directly from Amazon, so it's either a bad production or I just got unlucky to purchase a bad tape.

This was made in an era when people wore revolting tight stretch denims and hung out in pool halls and bars. It was also made to capitalise on the popularity of Patrick Swayze who had just appeared in the over-rated 80's teen musical \\"Dirty Dancing\\".A very pointless movie is \\"Roadhouse\\".

I was looking for good information on the best nutrition and it may be there. But the author's ego seems to have gotten in the way. This is the first book that I have ever read where the author frequently quotes HIMSELF.According to Colgan almost everyone in the world is evil including all doctors, employees of pharmaceutical companies, and all government agencies. Fortunately we have the author to save us.Beyond that, the information was difficult to decipher. It seemed that the recommended dosages of vitamins varied from chapter to chapter.I have not read any of his previous books, but I am under the impression that he has run out of new things to say.

The core of the book is good. Episode guides for each episode, and information on the air dates, guest stars, etc. The synopsis are, at times, too succinct, but it's an efficient book.Now, this is where it gets bad: This is a published-on-demand book, and appears to have original been self-published. It's evident in that there are so many typos, inconsistencies in spelling, missing or incorrect punctuation, and layout inconsistencies that it's a very, very, VERY difficult book to sit down and read. Also, the section of the book that deals purely with the storyline inconsistences of the show is woefully lacking.The book could benefit immensely from someone with a good editing pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Underwhelmed","review":"I was under the impression that the volume (an overview of the many seasons of The Golden Girls)would be lavishly illustrated and well-written.

Its aim is not to provide us with a practice to follow, but rather it offers a discreet series of yoga poses that can help with typical and specific body problems. There are eleven poses that are divided into \\"chapters\\", so the viewer can work with any or all of the poses as needed. These can easily be integrated into a regular practice, or can be used to help those new to yoga begin to refine their practice.The main idea here is that \\"yoga shouldn't hurt\\", and the directions and language guides us to go to challenging, but not hurtful places in our practice. I like that she is very clear that many of the benefits of yoga occur over time and indeed, progress takes time. Modifications for most poses are included, making them accessible to just about anyone. A unique and helpful DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice approach.","review":"Yoga to the Rescue, is like a collection of several moves and tips one ...should know.

Her body conveys the instructions in a very clear way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive exploration of writing life","review":"This was the first biography of Burroughs I read; I also have the Ted Morgan biography, but I don't think a direct qualitative comparison is possible. While Morgan goes into enormous biographical detail, Miles puts Burroughs' work in central position, and his analyses are really perceptive and thorough, with demonstrative use of passages from the text as well as references to relevant events in Burroughs' life. It is, as other reviewers have said, really the best existing introduction to Burroughs' work - I don't know if I could have made it through the cut-up trilogy without the preparation of reading this book first.I should also point out that some biographical details are here which are not in Morgan, e.g. the use of real names where Morgan substituted pseudonyms."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIFE LIKES It","review":"I guess it's as good as the other seasons, wife turned it on and did not turn it off until it was done.

This is a classic that I found disturbing and un-put-downable for the first few chapters, and highlly satisfying by the end. Quite a premise: a man loses 3 hours of his life. There are hints that suggest he did something unthinkable during this time frame, so he must now search for what happened during this timeframe. His search takes him on a very memorable journey and what he finds is truly horrifying. This is not a particularly long book--it is said he wrote it on a train-ride from California to New York--but it is very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending made my skin crawl","review":"From the opening scene I knew I was in for something wholly unexpected and I was not disappointed. The main character, a mild mannered professor who spent many months excavating in ancient ruins in faraway lands brings back with him a touch of malaria as well as something unworldly and evil. That evil is his undoing and the cause of him losing 4 hours of his life, and his hat. If he finds his hat, he finds his 4 hours and he will die. Quite a read and definitely a creeping, surreal horror classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good or Bad?","review":"I honestley cannot decide wether this was an incitefull story of a \\"normal\\" man's descent into madness or just a cheesy super- natural thriller that is especially hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is going on here?","review":"This book is like being a child again and fearing the unknown. It's excellent...it gets you thinking and sort of reminds me of (not to give anything away) but the family that inspired the Fuguitive movie and tv show. It has an ending that I cannot say. But if you do read it you will never forget it. In addition there is a small story that is nice at the end"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a classic!","review":"This story kept me on edge.

I have read various Scientology books, and found most of them excellent!I was immediately attracted to FEAR by the author's non-fiction works, and also by a rumor that L. Ron wrote the book in a single weekend. However, I found FEAR to be the biggest piece of garbage I have ever read.The book is about a man who lost four hours of his life, and embarks on a journey to discover what happened during that time. How ironic! I wish that I had MY four hours back, too. What a waste of time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hubbard I ave ever read","review":"A phenomenal read that should be a movie.

Hey, if he thought it was scary, maybe there was something to it.Yea, a couple parts were kind of eerie and shivery, but for the most part -- I had NO idea what was going on. It's like some weird Alice in Wonderland-type story -- and the ending is a surprise.For really scary stuff, stick to King."},{"rating":"1","title":"this man is mentally disturbed, steer clear of this paranoid pamphlet","review":"This fella is the same peron who in the late 90's and early 2000's destroyed dozens of internet canoeing and kayaking news groups with his ramblings and barely coherent mass spamming attacks and bizarre rambling e-mailsThis pamphlet is a collection of his bizzare paranoid ramblings with no actual layout or plan.He rambles on about organizations such as the coast guard and the american canoe association and any one else he claims is in on the plot to keep his product he manufactures from the masses so they can kill as many people as possible.He's a wack job who cant write.The book would make a good coaster or maybe kindling in case you needed to start an emergency fire.whooo hoo- earth to Tim - put the tin foil hat back on now..DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKDont encourage this sad individual by buyinhg his self published pamphlet.nuf said"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only scam is this book","review":"I had to give this book a one star rating because there was no way for me to rate it a zero.As stated in my review title, the only scam going on with canoes and kayaks in America is this book put out by Tim Ingram. To use a relevant cliché, Tim obviously has only one ore in the water. I can clearly understand the Mr. Ingram would like to see not one more person die in a paddling accident, however, I believe his claims and statements are motivated by the lack of industries willingness to integrate his products into their designs.The idea that the government is conspiring with the paddling industry to kill people is absurd.They all laughed at Professor Kaczynski until he started using the Post Office to send his messages, he's now known as the Unabomber. Let's hope Mr. Ingram doesn't start mailing these poor selling, gas-charged tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading title, a sad, sad author","review":"This book, as other reviewers have noted, is a rant by a man who has alienated a lot of people with his over-the-top accusations and distorted statistics.I have paddled kayaks for 41 years and have served on American Canoe Association committees, taught whitewater paddling, coached whitewater racing, and now teach sea kayaking. I believe that sponsons, the solution the author of this book provides for all paddling safety risks, have their place in specific (and uncommon) situations. But Mr. Ingram's irrational claims do nothing to advance the cause of safe paddling. In fact, many instructors find him so annoying that they will dismiss all discussions of sponson use out of hand.This book might be an interesting reading assignment for a psychology class, but paddlers would do better to spend the money for a safety course or a paddling book by a reputable author."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so clever!!","review":"My cats learned to use the Kitty Kitchen in just a few of days.

I believe his versatility is what makes Al so unique, both as an instrumentalist and composer/arranger--he can obviously still rip it better than anybody on pure electric, but the electric/acoustic also featured in this concert creates sonic nuances that need to be seen to be believed. Whatever you think of what Al's been doing the last 15 years, please do yourself a favor and watch this concert--maybe you'll grow as a listener as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories","review":"Cabbage-head and the story of the rabbit... the others, too, really, but this woman has stories...

Though it is slightly different(in terms of techno-rhythm from 'A-Ha's original version), the tempo is just good enough to get A1-converts and non-converts to get their feet to start tapping to the music beat. Ben 's interpretation of the song is unique too. In addition what the CD buyers got value for their money is the inclusion of the music video of the song!! A must buy! A great buy!

Starts with introduction on how these men started it from WWII and walks the reader through the history of how it all got started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Romance and Fiction","review":"This book is, at best, cr@p. Try not to read it. The protagonist, Wisner, and his cronies portray a \\"high society\\" crowd throwing dinner parties in which detailed policy was discussed among the elite, leading to actual policy and / or government action in later years, once they acquire requisite power to act. This is pure B.S., reflecting on past accomplishments through rose colored glasses. I admire the author for trying to take on the subject but please try to come at it from a slightly more objective perspective next time. Keegan's work on the world wars, Halberstam on Vietnam, among others are good examples of authors who spent years researching all possible angles and contributions to historical events. I could have \\"made up\\" a more credible story about the formation of the CIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I realize this was an open-air production of Madama Butterfly.

I found the concept of love being more powerful than time, of someone's proper place being in fact completely outside of everything they had ever known, intriguing. And, as usual with Shayne's books, the characters are endearing and the plot is a page-turner. The perfect reading material for cold winter nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Ending To A Great Story Line","review":"I have all the other books in this series. I was thrilled when it came to my local bookstore. But I was VERY disappointed. All the other books in this series are believeable. I don't know why the author strayed from the formula, and gave her fans something totally off the wall. If I wanted science fiction, I watch the X-Files. The romance part between the heroine and the hero was great. But who would actually believe she came across time from the last century! Save it for Mulner and Scully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, poor quality","review":"Was doing rear brakes and couldn't turn the old drums, so I ordered these. The price for these drums was WAY less than the chain auto parts stores. So I took a chance on them. When I took them out of the box they looked very solid and heavy. Nothing cheap in the appearance. But after installation, I ended up with a pretty bad vibration when braking. Reinstalled old drums and no vibration. So something was out-of-round in one of the new drums. Decided to just use old drums and returned these. I may have just had a bad draw, but who knows. The price may be worth taking a shot, especially since Amazon will pay return shipping if you get a bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EJ at 21 yrs. of age......Holy Smoke!","review":"Another gem is \\"finally\\" released into the Eric Johnson catalog. I had heard about the Magnets for years and had searched high and low for the album without any luck. I happened to find the CD by mistake at a used CD shop. This album is chock full of great compositions, soloing, and jamming, not to mention the phenomenal guitar playing of then 21 year old Eric Johnson. The CD is a window into EJ's past. His playing was much different then than it is now (it's obvious that Jeff Beck and John McLaughin were major influences on young Eric). The coolest thing about the album is to see the beginnings of EJ, Stephen Barber, and Cristopher Cross' careers. These guys have always worked together through the years. Theye are excellent musicians, then and now, and the Electromagnets is testimony to that. If you are an EJ fan or love great guitar playing, you should add this to your CD collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Treat","review":"I was lucky enough to see this band play dozens of times in Austin and they never disappointed. I certainly never anticipated having this music on CD, but man does it still sound great! I'm just blown away that these four kids from Texas created what's now a fusion classic. Each original cut positively sizzles. My only teensy tinsy quibble is with the subpar audio quality of the two live bonus tracks. Sounding like a bad bootleg recorded on a single microphone in the audience, they're not much of a bonus. I guess they provide proof that the Magnets had awesome chops in a live setting as well, but hey, I already knew that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"I first read this book years ago as a teenager.

It was certainly an example of what not to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Ranelle's story of the horrible plane crash and the awful burns she endures are only part of the story. The most amazing part of the tale is the near death experiance she has when she dies. The overlaying message is love is one of the most important things about this life.

Many people already know this but most can do much to improve.......myself included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorey, low-budget horror that really hits the spot","review":"As soon as you start watching this film you know you're in for a treat. Full Moon did a great job combining a gorey film with an occult film, to create Talisman. I thought that Talisman was quite similar to The Dunwitch Horror, although Dunwitch only gets 2 stars from me, as it wasn't scary at all. I definatley reccomend it to anybody that likes a good horror flick, but definatley wouldn't reccomend it to little kids or the FAINT HARTED*! *You'll only get the joke once you've watched the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid,","review":"This is really aimed at the reader who wishes to work on the transformation of whole organisations.

I am a senior in college and have had a 4.0 the entire time and all of a sudden get stuck with having to read this book in one of my business classes. Firstly, this book is extremely confusing to the point where it makes your mind spin and when you get done reading a page you forget everything you read because you were sitting there trying to comprehend what the author was saying. Like several other people have reviewed, it seems as though the author loathes in seeing how confusing he can make sentences, ideas, and theories to the reader instead of making the points clear and understandable. I have read the first two chapters and do not remember hardly anything because of me having to reread some sentences up to ten times; I think I am going to use this book as toilet paper because it is not worth a plug nickel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott - This CD installs virus on your computer that makes other viruses attack","review":"If this screws up your machine do you think Sony will pay to fix it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!!","review":"This cd contains a virus on it!

This relatively new product, adult strength liquid Tylenol, really met our needs.The only complaint i have is that the cost is high: for us, at 0.5 ounce per dose, the ($4.99) 8 oz. bottle will only last for 16 doses, at a cost of $0.31 per dose.

Her sentence structure was and \\"A\\" but I didn't buy a book to see how well the writing was but how good the story was. I don't usually put much into posting here but this story stunk so bad I had to.

This volume is a helpful guide in trying to do just that. The authors provide two ways of learning the vocabulary: by frequency and by similar roots. Both arrangements certainly make it easier to tackle the sheer number of words one must learn to master the Hebrew OT. While nothing can replace regular study and interaction with the Hebrew text, this volume is sure to be a dependable guide in that process. Much smaller than any standard Hebrew lexicon, it is much more accessible than, say, BDB and the aforementioned layout makes location of words very easy.

All of the southern rock band's most popular hits are here (Free Bird, Sweet Home Alabama, ect.), but I'm sure that the record company could have squeezed a least a few more tracks on this album.

I've wanted one for years and they have finally got to a reasonable price in my opinion. The instuructions are needed to get you started and after a few times... you'll have it down. The controls are very small... but they work well! The presentation of the coffee brewing is just enjoyable to watch (my boys just love it!) The temperature of the coffee is good and hot... But here is why i sent the Bodum back... weak coffee. I could not believe it. Ive tried many things to get a strong cup from this bodum... but when I put 14 scoops of medium/fine ground coffee in the machine and the coffee is still mild... i realized i would be spending a lot more on coffee than i wanted in a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything's not in order!","review":"This is the only Prima book that I have that is unhelpful.

Its not extremely difficult, so if you miss a certain thing or object, you are not screwed permentently, but it is not an easy breeze. Their will be puzzles that test your mind, startegy, and just game-skills.The strategy follows the game beautifully, with nice maps, and pics, and a great help.

That is the plateau of what could have been a great strategy guide. Then, it just lists a bunch of information, some relating to what you have to do, some not. I do not think that the author wanted to bother organizing any of the information in order. To find out what to do next, you are constantly flipping the pages. I would not recommend this book under any circumstances. I would try the guide by brady games. The reason I did not give this guide a 1-star rating is because its packed full of information.

I mean, I have vivid memories of several of the episodes. It took a very long time to come out on DVD, but I'm thrilled it has! The hair and clothes are all very dated, and the acting is over-the-top melodramatic. Feels more like you're watching a play that someone videotaped rather than a TV show, but it is still fun.

They don't break when they crash (unless you tangle them in a tree). This one flys, but it needs a strong wind to do so since the line is heavy compared to the lifting power of this kite. It was fun to fly with my niece, but also frustrating since it was difficult to keep in the air without strong winds.This is far from the worst small kite I've seen, it does fly, but I think going with a slightly larger parafoil might be better (or maybe lighter kite line?).It has pretty nice tails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use kite...","review":"This kite is very easy to unpack, fly and pack again.

As it should be. Ford wants to be an Orthodox Jew (probably because in the religion he finds reinforcement for his misogyny and bigotry)and the religious code he embraces forbids this. Where's the drama in that? It's not as if Ford is challenging the religious code. He simply wants to have it both ways, like a petulant child.If Ford were half the writer/journalist he thinks he is he could easily have turned his back on porn gossip and started writing on any number of subjects and the rabbis would have smiled upon him. But he found a niche for his monosyllabic style of writing on the Internet, where the demand for stylized, intelligent writing is very low indeed.This is the story of a stubborn, untalented, vainglorious man and it's a self-published book to boot.

There have been very few of her works that my wife has been disappointed (such as Family Album). As for the movies, Now and Forever is the one movie she absolutely does not want (along with Family Album). I have watched it with her and have to agree with her. The movie is way too intense for one of Danielle Steel's typical movies. I am not sure if it is rated 'R', but it definitely should be. The sex scene may not have any nudity, but the intenseness of the intercourse deserves the 'R' rating. The acting throughout the movie is subpar at best. Cheryl Ladd could not rescue this movie and should have never agreed to do it in the first place. Collect the other Danielle Steel movies, but I would recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Danielle Steel Fan Rates Film a FLOP!!","review":"I am a Danielle Steel fan from way back.

I prefer something a little thicker and this didn't feel like it stayed on my skin long enough to do a very good job. While it might have helped with acne a little, it definitely does not live up to its name.I also felt that it made my skin more oily and I quickly stopped using it to switch to a different product. Over the course of the day, my skin would become uncomfortably oily. Where is the continuous control in that?Clean & Clear's Continuous Control Acne cleanser sat in my shower for quite some time before I finally picked it up again, a sure sign that this product was no doing its job adequately.There are definitely other acne products, some even from Clean & clear, that I prefer of the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful -- don't waste your money!","review":"This product is awful!!

It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric.

Kristin Chenoweth is brilliant in \\"My New Philosophy,\\" \\"Beethoven Day\\" is a great upbeat addition, and \\"Suppertime\\" is a showstopper even on a CD. Even the bow music is fun.

The numbers are incredibly catchy (I sing them non-stop!) and are quite funny in the good old Peanuts fashion. However, some of the characters are hard to identify with the Peanuts gang such as those who play Linus, Schroeder and Lucy, but they gave great performances! A real credit to the CD is the actress who plays Sally (sorry, I'm really bad with names!) and her song, My New Philosophy is one you wish was included in the original cast recording! Overall a great album and enjoyable in its own right. But if you get this one, be sure and pick up the original cast album as you'll love that one just as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome, Fun Recording!","review":"After hearing my friends copy of this CD, I was certain that I must have it! All the songs are lively and fun, and bring the Peanuts characters to life. Anthony Rapp is a more than PERFECT Charlie Brown! Kristin Chenoweth fits the part of Sally extremely well and really deserved her Tony! Every line of every song she sings is delightful, and brings the comedy of her character to life. The music is fun and exciting, and has a real happy childlike feeling to it. If you are a Broadway or music fan, I would recommend that you give this CD a try.

I would like a copy of the Original cast. If it is released again let me know. If this were not already a classic, maybe the irritating changes would not have been so disappointing. It is hard to enjoy the humor within 'Little Known Facts' when the singer is intentionally trying to sound irritating. (That used to be one of my favorite songs on the CD.) Listen to that song or 'Shroeder' before buying the CD. If you find it too irritating, do not bother buying the CD unless you plan on cutting an edited version. It may have been cute in the play, but not on a CD to be played repeated. I do not fault the 'singer' but the one in charge of the production who let her do it that way. It can ruin it for the rest of the casts. Too bad she is also heard throughout many of the songs. Fran Drescher had a softer, gentler voice on the Nanny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disappointment from the original recording","review":"I listened to this recording in hopes that it would be similar to the original, and in some cases it is. One of my favorite tracks on the original album was Suppertime. So, naturally when I got my copy of the new 1999 version that was one of the first tracks I played. I dont know who decided to slow it down about 2 or 3 time signatures, but it has been absolutely massacred. Also, one of my favorites, the Red Baron, has been omitted all together. I have played this 'new' version several times now and I am starting to take a liking to it. Thankfully, I still have the original version on cassette...would someone please find the master tapes and re-release it on CD, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original, but still some flaws","review":"I couldn't quite get into the original cast when I bought that album so many years ago. This update seems to fix some of the datedness of the original that helped me enjoy the show more. I do regret the loss of Peppermint Patty in the update, however. And I definitely regret the choice B.D. Wong made to lisp his way through every song. Annoying. I'm also not sure why, in the opening number, the short dialogue bits each character says to Charlie Brown are spoken OVER one another, so that you can't make any of them out. They're funny, so why can't they be spoken consecutively so we can enjoy them? Unfortunately, until there's a revival of this revival that correct some of these deficiencies, I don't think we can yet say that the definitive version of this show has been recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched","review":"The item, a CD, had a scratch close to the center of the disc.

While this guide gives detailed historical/background knowledge it severely lacks in the essentials, notably transport prices and detailed maps.@There were just too many times when this book became a more of a frustration than a help. This book is best read before you go and left at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"Do your research on line before going to any of the hotels suggested in this guide. Some of them are real dumps. Also, the guide does little to show you how to get around the country. I'm spoiled by Rick Steves guides that basically take you step by step on how to get out of the airport and to the sights, restaurants, hotels, etc. There are no prices and maps of Bangkok do not even show where the airport is at. It doesn't do what a guide is supposed to do, guide you. It gives a general overview of each city and gives a history lesson, but not much else. I have to wonder if the people who wrote the book actually went to Thailand or just read about it. Waste of money if you ask me. Something to read while on the toilet, otherwise I'm doing all me research on line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother with the Lonely Planet guides!!!!","review":"This is about the tenth Rough Guide I've used, and as usual it has been an excellent source of most importantly accurate information. All Rough Guides have evidently been well researched and give step-by-step procedures of what to do on arrival, finding accommodation and local transport etc. I've never understood why so many travellers use 'Lonely Planet' guides. The title may very well sound ethereal and full of the romatic allusion (illusion?) of travelling, but I have found them at best very mediochre. I can think their popularity lies more in the fact of their reputation. If you're a 'serious' traveller you only ever get the Lonely Planet. Well don't bother, get a Rough Guide which you will almost certainly find more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Shiva Rea","review":"I purchased this DVD after attending Shiva Rea's yoga instructor training at Kripalu. It includes backbends to open up the heart center (anahata chakra) through the practice of a heart salutation (Hridya Namaskar). Although short (only 35 minutes) in length, I love this DVD. Its not quite like having Shiva teach the Hridya Namaskar in person, but pleasant in its effects. After the practice, I feel that on a physical level, my chest and intercostal muscles have opened up; mentally I feel open to the idea that I can remain open in the face of adversity; and emotionally I feel open to the gentle, graceful and compassionate nature of my heart. I would not recommend this DVD for beginning yogi's as proper understanding of alignment is assumed. Without this awareness, one may do more harm than good. So, if you are an intermediate or advanced yogi looking to open up your heart - by all means enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This DVD is a waste of money, you can't see the how she does the exercise well kind of dark when it stared and they keep the camera to far way. If you need something that you can be visual like me this is not the right DVD. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Short Practice","review":"Shiva Rea is my favorite yoga teacher and I like all of her DVD's , though this is her least exciting one in my opinion , the main 20 min practice (Heart salutation) is a nice relaxing series of side stretches and backbends like camel and bow. Like other reviewer have mentioned the other 2 segments are short and a little bit \\"parve\\" though I liked the 3 min. moving meditation at the end. There's also 2 bonus segments that you can add to your practice from Fluid Power (Jala Namaskar) and Yoga Trance Dance (Twisting Kriya) though \\"Jala Namaskar\\" was also on Trance Dance with a different setting. On the whole , it's a nice short practice that you can add to other workouts as a stretch or do it on its own if you don't feel like doing much. Also take a look at her live DVD from Yoga Journal, a new practice cd \\"Yoga Wave\\" coming in february and a new DVD \\"Surf Yoga Soul\\" next year , can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva Rea Radiant Heart Yoga","review":"This is a very good Yoga DVD for all levels of people who enjoy a Yoga workout using a DVD.

Until about three years ago, I was very pleased with gold-toe. However, in the past few years I have found that the socks stretch out of shape after only a few washings. To claim to make a sock that fits sizes 6-12 shoe is patently impossible. Oh, at first it may. But I wear size 7 1/2 shoe and guess what? You got it! After a while it is at least an inch too long and the heal comes up on the Achilles-tendon.

Reading what was written about limitations of these hybrids really dampened my enthusiasm. But I decided to take the leap with the SONY Cybershot DSC-M2 and couldn't be happier. It takes crisp, gorgeous shots in automatic mode, and although it doesn't have many manual controls, it has enough to keep the average snapshooter happy. The movie mode surpassed my expectations. My little home films look like the ones my dad made with his expensive camcorder. It has a big, beautiful LCD screen which makes others envious.

I've seen better acting on an episode of Sesame Street.The main characters are two high school seniors, I think. They both look about thirty. At first glance, I was hoping this would be one of those underground gems that simply didn't get much publicity like \\"Ginger Snaps\\".Yeah, don't buy this. Don't even rent it.

She's just average. Her sister takes the spotlight away from her when they're in a scene together. It's like... what's the point? Oh, and the ending is like so abrupt and stupid.

While none of the novels have blown me away with their greatness, this one was far below par. The book feels like a D&D adventure that I played when I was [...]. Their seems to be no real point, just one dangerous and seemingly random situation after another. To be honest I could not even finish the book so perhaps there is some redemption at the end, but I just couldn't keep reading.

The characterization is at best laughable, and almost pitiable at times. The dialog is almost painful to read, as character after character give lines that sound anything but conversational. The characters never develop a voice of their own throughout the story making it very hard to follow exactly what they are saying Mr. Cole tries to paint some interesting action sequences, but scale and scope are lost in poor prose and a very weak command of pacing.The Eberron setting is an incredible world, ripe with ideas for excellent fiction, however the Crimson Talisman really doesn't live up to the world's potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this meant to be Eberron?","review":"The idea behind the novel may not be too bad, but honestly I'm about half-way through and am not sure if I will finish. I wish I had known that the War Torn series books are stand alones, I would surely have gotten the James Wyatt book instead.There are so many errors (beyond the typos) that I'm not sure if the author even so much as knew what Eberron is. Someone mentioned the half-elf with the Orien mark already, but he can't even get the basic physics right. The fugitives travel on foot from Voorkesh to Taeris Mordel in one day, which is fine until you look at the book's own map and see that it is about a 300 mile journey (and through mountains yet!).

Her interpretation is refreshing and energetic, and draws comparisons to Nigel Kennedy. Also featuring on the album is 'the Devil's Trill', which includes a vibrant techno version. It becomes apparent that Vanessa-Mae is influenced by various musical influences, and this should provide anticipation for future albums.

The Rebel Angels and What's Bred In The Bone are splendid comedies, intelligent, moving, surprising, and well-plotted. Then The Lyre Of Orpheus comes along and ruins everything.I wonder if Davies wasn't conned into writing the third book by some editor, who told him that trilogies sell so much better than mere single novels.

It is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"But is it art?","review":"Davies's Cornish trilogy should be read by anyone with an interest in the philosophy of art -- questions of attribution, forgery and fakery, and authenticity pervade all three novels, which deal with literature, painting and music respectively. Art in general, and art objects in particular, take on a shadowy, slippery aspect in spite of the very palpable (and almost erotically desirable) qualities they have for Davies's characters. Aesthetic and spiritual experience are intertwined. But the style, while elevated, is never dry or preachy -- the characters are rounded and often delightfully vulgar and even the most intellectual threads of the story are brimming with life and humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet jazzy voice...","review":"For some reason she reminds me of Julie Andrews without an english accent.

Much ot the rest of the CD is filler - this is the band that did the mid-west circuit, primarily Southern Ontario and Southern Michigan, back in the early mid 70's. Kim Mitchell's fingerprints are all over the material - while Kim went on to more fame a decade later as a solo artist doing more commercial offerings, his very Zappa'esque guitar style was developed on the Max Webster tunes throwing out tasty legato lead lines that rivaled the speed and style of the big names back in the day. This is a must have for Max fans as the remix/remaster really brings out the drums/bass and gives them a lot more definition and funk - solid CD for anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiesto Strikes Again!","review":"Releasing his second Artist Album, Tiesto comes out strong with a wide new selection of tracks that are sure to be crowd pleasers. Forever Today opens up with a full orchestra, producing a very emotionally filled opening, and then slowly takes the track full circle into with his own soul pounding mixing. Love Comes Again is definitely a catchy tune which has lots of promise. It grew on me after several listens. BT's vocals add much more to this track than I think people give it credit for. Classics that put Tiesto on the map are also on this cd, such as Nyana (My personal favorite) and Traffic. He closes with his personal rendition of Adagio for Strings, which was his grand opening to \\"Tiesto In Concert\\" last year. Bravo Tiesto, keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking compared to past releases","review":"I imported the European copy of Tiesto's \\"Just Be\\" several months ago.

It's derivative, redundant and flat out cheesy. Look into his other mixes such as isos or the magik mixes (6 & 7 are top notch) or of course Nyana (the last good thing this guy put out).

Tiesto is close, but manages to produce an album that still remains trance. I have to say I fully enjoyed it and even the very mainstream sounding songs were done very well. There aren't really any tracks that are weak. I would give it 5 stars, but as much I as enjoy vocals on some songs I didn't expect or wanted to hear so many. With that said it is still an excellent album.Tiesto manages to succeed with the vocals and somewhat untrance like moments on the album where PVD fails on his latest attempt \\"Reflections\\".As someone mentioned, this is an album where Tiesto is emerging as an artist versus being just a DJ. So there are no reasons, why a hardcore trance fan or just a passerby shouldn't enjoy \\"just be\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Artist Album","review":"Most times, artist albums by dj's who are known for mixing and remixing are not very good; Tiesto's 1st artist album \\"In My Memory\\" is proof of that. I think Tiesto learned from the mistakes of that album when creating music for this one. Most of the tracks are good, with the already released singles \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Love Comes Again\\" being very good. This disc cannot be compared to Tiesto's mix cd's because that would be like comparing apples and oranges. Overall, this cd is worth listening to and very good both musically and lyrically. I am just hoping that his next release will be In Search of Sunrise Volume 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the album","review":"Don't have or heard any of Tiesto's muisc, so this is new to me.

As a former Tiesto freak ( I used to love the guy) I am sad to say this DJ couldnt resist it anymore and finally sold out. I saw it coming since the release of Nyana.

The only artistic point in the whole cd is the beginning of track 1, the classical bit, and the rest of it so unoriginal that you cant tell it from techno that was played at raves 10 years ago. Its very basic cymbols and bass lines that get changed up with turning one knob on a synthsizer.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiesto proving why he's #1.. 2 years running","review":"Tiesto is the #1 Trance DJ in the world 2 years running, chosen by the people who truly love trance. This album is not a mix cd as his past albums have been but is equally as good. Bang these tunes of a huge sound system and they're that much more powerful. I saw Tiesto blow the roof off of Club Nation in Washington D.C. on June 25th and he played most of this album live and the crowd simply loved it. Their reaction proved it. They went insane.He's #1 and he deserves to be #1. Get this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tiesto does a PVD","review":"Initially i was extremely dissapointed when i bought this album. Initially expecting thumping melodic trance i was some what suprised by what was on the album and it took a while to get around the fact that this was like nothing else i had heard from Tiesto before. Once i got over the initial shock though i began to understand what the album was about. Like PvD with his last album 'Reflections', Tiesto is now doing what he wants to do instead of what the masses want. Tiesto is no longer a producer, but more of a composer, especially when it comes to such tracks as 'Forever today' with its soaring orchestral opening which is just brilliant in my opinion. If you are someone who enjoys and appreciates a wide range in music you will enjoy this album, but if you want to listen to the type of music that Tiesto plays in the clubs then this isn't for you, instead try one of his DJ mix CD's such as 'Nyana' which is another brilliant CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiesto has lost his marbles","review":"A huge Tiesto fan of the past, I have to say I was incredibly dissapointed. A few nice vocals but thats it. Anyone who rates this highly hasn't been listening to trance much. This is just not the tiesto we use to know. Success has definitely gone to his head. He has sold out to the mainstream crowd. His trance sounds more like pop now. Also it seems he is trying to incorporate some new style or something with his choice of some of the sounds and it sounds incredibly annoying.

The release of Big Black Square is a 40-minute-plus improvisation that makes the listening experience tedious. Tarentel have a vague idea of where they want to go, they just don't have a compass, and nothing proves this more than the aforementioned track. Ambient noises and feedback play out for 15 minutes before the drumbeat comes in, going for another 15 minutes over feedback before finally fading away into more ambient noises. Paper White is somewhat of the same approach, yet the songs are much shorter, with softening touches of acoustic guitar and piano leaving one pleasantly confused.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought two copies, one for me and one for my daughter, who writes poetry.

I don't usually do \\"high impact\\" but Leslie's power surges only last 1 or 2 mins so it didnt kill me.I LOVED this dvd b/c I like Leslie's workouts but I've been wanting more of a workout to get my heart rate up, and the power surges were the perfect thing!! I've lost 55 pounds so far, mainly doing Leslie Sansone workouts since last fall.This dvd includes the new, younger girls from her other newer 2012 release, along with couple others.I would not consider this a beginner workout because of the power surges.

If you've been working out with Leslie for awhile, this is a nice way to ramp things up. The moves are the same as her other DVD's, but there are a few new ones thrown in like jump ropes, modified jumping jacks, and twists.Normally I quite like Leslie, but in a couple of the miles she does this fist-pump move that is very cheesy.

What choice do you have. It's amazing to me that they don't have more written on this guy. For such a major figure in public imagination to have only this short biography on him is shameful. The four stars are given simply because of the subject of the book. The book itself isn't bad at all, but it's not exactly a masterpiece. I would love to see an expanded version of this book, one that went into more detail, but I don't imagine that will happen. The writing style is basic, but not too much so, and the information is tightly packed in. Only the first 80 pages are an actual biography. The rest of the book deals with how Brutus has been perceived throughout history. As might be imagined Brutus' Republican ideals didn't mean as much in the Middle Ages as his betrayal of his close friend. That said the second part is interesting reading too. I only wish there was more of it to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best break dance instructional video","review":"I thought this video was very helpful and awsome.

The live power of \\"Like a radio\\" (including a gorgeous guitar solo) and the beauty of the simple \\"Mary's waltz\\" shine brightly here as does the great slow-burner \\"I will remember\\". \\"Moth\\" and \\"Anyway\\" are also great tracks, the latter being my favorite on the disc because of the wonderful guitar solo in the middle. Check it out. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Rhine rocks...","review":"I've been a fan of Over the Rhine for many many years, and i'm just soo glad that they're getting out there and that more people are hearing them.

Sad and embarrassed to admit that I hadn't heard of Michael Powers until his Onyx Root CD came up on an Amazon link. I bought it and listened to it all this weekend. From the first guitar chord to the moment you first hear his voice you know he's an enormously talented and soulful musician and singer. There are so few young blues players who possess both superior singing AND instrumental chops; Mr. Powers is certainly one of them. You should pick this one up immediately. Wonderfully gifted, he's one of the best singers and players around. IT'S MY OWN FAULT I've been missing him so long.

The remastering on this set is great. It is especially valuable since much of their material is not available at the present time. I would actually rate this 4.5 stars. My only gripe was the omission of some of the better tunes like \\"Save The Land\\", \\"No Lies\\", \\"TNUC\\", \\"The Railroad\\" and \\"In Need\\". These songs were omitted in favor of songs on the third disc from their weaker albums. However, it was great to have the unissued songs on this set. Maybe if this set sells well Capitol will get the idea to release the individual albums domestically on cd. If you listened to the radio during the seventies this set will bring back memories. Tunes like \\"We're An American Band\\", \\"I'm Your Captain\\", \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\", \\"The Loco Motion, \\"Bad Time\\" etc... It is great to have them all here remastered with some of my favorite cover tunes and album cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"God music","review":"This is a very good collection of Grand Funk music.

Excellent mastering job by Evren Goknar, and a great production job by David Tedds. The songs are so killer that the 3-CD set seems short. The new songs are good; however, I wish Ron Nevison would have mixed the songs with more bottom.

I am familiar with all the songs on the first two discs, with not a bad song on them. Most of the third disc rocks, but the band turns more to a pop sound with their music.With digital sound, I realized that Mel's bass playing was more intense and Don was really a great drummer. For a three-piece rock band, there was a lot of energy produce from GFR's rocking sound.My little complaint would be that they left \\"T.N.U.C\\" off this compilation instead of adding on the newer unreleased cuts at the end of the third disc. Oh well, I can buy the \\"Live Album\\" in CD format now. This is a must-own CD set for Grand Funk lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GFR is a fantastic band","review":"After years of hearing them, I am delighted with this set, eventhough I have all their records.Inside looking out is fantastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Funk's Staying Power","review":"Granted, I liked this collection when it wad first released, but as is the case with all of Grand Funk's material, there does seem to be an aging process before it's true greatness is realized. It has become a standard for the GFR catalog. With a bounty of budget sized best of collections, the anthology stands tall as the best representation of the band I'm its prime, and in a time where FM radio is proving to be a general wasteland of pop music cast offs, re-discovering this funky, groovy, power pop group is more than refreshing. Boasting crisp production and crisp remasteted sound, this is a perfect collection for the past, present, and future."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't know Funk, then you need to know Funk !","review":"As I sit here and type this, I am listening to the We're An American Band CD, and still sit in awe of the musicianship and the mammoth power that these guys put out.

My first impression of both was very positive. But I've now returned them. On this lock, the casing around the end that inserts into the lock cracked after some sun exposure. It's mostly cosmetic, but when it falls off entirely (as it is sure to do), it will leave an exposed metal crimp to mar whatever you're locking. That's the smaller problem. There's a much bigger one. The lock stopped working. Luckily, that happened with the lock open. It simply wouldn't lock and the key wouldn't turn. So, it went back. Meanwhile, the lock on the shorter one I also got (the 5037) started to get fussy too, so I returned it as well. I'm not satisfied at the overall quality of these locks.

I learned that Los Angeles is the cardboard box capitol of the world. The boxes are everywhere in this film. I learned why L.A. has problems with drought and has to get its water from northern California.....the water system there is built out of wooden pallets!! WHen the \\"actors\\" venture into the sewers to kill the foam rubber dinosaurs the sewers are built of wooden pallets. It probably leaks all the drinking water right back into the ground!

Who cares? This movie was so bad I almost had an aneurysm. Please by no circumstances ever even think about watching this \\"movie\\". Unless it's on MST3K then, of course, it's hilarious. This movie is so bad I found myself adding in riffs that Mike and the \`bots missed.

The first time I saw it, when it came out in stores, I watched it 5 times that weekend. I came home from school every day that week and watched it and eventually the tape was hidden from me since that was all I would do after school.It has now been about 8 years and I still watch it all the time. I don't need to watch it closely but I enjoy having it on. I know the whole movie by heart so when they came out with this fan edition, it was so good to see new scenes! The new scenes add a lot more to the story and explain some things better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A soundtrack without a movie.","review":"Ironically, I was working in a music store when this film's soundtrack was released. The funny thing was the soundtrack was not released in conjunction with film. As a matter of fact, I do not believe this movie was ever released in theaters. Why? Was the movie so bad that the studio had no faith in it for a theatrical release? My store got stuck with alot of soundtracks for a movie no one was able to see. It seems that the studio had more confidence in the soundtrack than the movie.I saw it on cable a year or two later, and it was essentially a movie built around a soundtrack. A shallow story revovling around an allegedly hip soundtrack. It was not as wretchedly awful as I had feared, but still it was just a mild piece of teenage angst fluff with actors who looked like they stepped out of a Noxema ad."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE!!","review":"This is THE BEST MOVIE!

All my friends and I were obsessed with it when it first came out, I mean who hasn't dreamed of working in a record store? I mean all of our parents don't buy us Jeeps. This movie rocks, it has heart and all of the characters arn't either perfect or dogs, they are teens, or actors showing how it was when they were teens. A great ensemble teenage film that you can't be cynical about, and if you are then you are just upset that this movie is just too cool for you. So the plot happens in a day, who cares that is the point! This movie rocks, and will change your expectations. I wish there had been more nineties teen movies like this, this is great and so is the music (esp. sugarhigh, a party fave.) Get it, turn it up and just enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAY NOMORE THIS MOVIES A BORE","review":"ok, so its entertaining, I'll give it that but the movie lacks in several categories. The brain dead plot really sticks to your teeth like peanut butter. Annoying Liv was annoying and a lot of the other \\"generation-x\\" kids are just a bunch of try-hard losers."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"this is the best movie ever. if you are going to buy it you need to know that there are two versions, the blue (fan edition) and white (origional). i would recommend the origional but the blue version is good too. either version, it is the best movie you will ever see. real life problems and lovable characters. theres a lot to relate to. GREAT MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodrama Abounds","review":"This was much better off as a fond memory; digging it out of the archives for a modern viewing just made me question my younger self's judgment. A storeful of vapid, self-absorbed caricatures come together to hawk records, listen to radio-friendly '90s mush and reveal just how shallow they truly are as a collective. Very young Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger show some skin and look good doing it, but that's pretty much the only highlight. Whoever chose the soundtrack for this needs to be deafened for the good of all mankind - for a store that's supposed to be all about the anti-establishment, it's got very bland, mainstream tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a MUST see!","review":"I can't beleive I hadn't seen this movie untill yesterday. Itsa hularious movie about a group of teens that work in a music storeand how they have to save it. It has a little bit of romance, serious life incounters/problems, and a LOT of laughs. I recommend it for anyone that is ina good mood for a fantastic comedy and atleast 13 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick a**!!!","review":"I can totally relate to this movie. Especially to Ethan Embry's (who was then Ethan Randall) part who was full of spastic energy and who was strangly unique kind of like me.I thought it had a great cast and a funny but slightly pointless (in a good way) plot that kept me laughing the whole time (unless there were sad parts). People who do not like this movie merely don't understand it. They think that it is just supposed to be a script written by old people trying to make it sound like teenagers but they are wrong, it is written to sound like creative teenagers with problems and it does just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!!","review":"This movie rocks. It's funny and there's good music. It is my absolute favorite movie. I could not believe that Coyote Shivers actually was Berko and he actually sang Sugarhigh at the end. The song seems weak to me now that I've bought the CD and listened to the \\"real\\" version, but that has little to do with the movie. The movie is creative and funny and I could watch it every day for the rest of my life and never ever get tired of it. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic teen agnst film at its best!!!","review":"Wow... what can I possibly say about this film that would truely describe its impact? Those whom have seen it would know excatly what I'm talking about. Empire Records might not have done well in theaters but its sure proved well amoung the teenagers of today! It describes our lives and everything we are facing to a tee! Everything the actors felt, said and portrayed in the film is what us teens go through every minute of the day. The acting was great and the quick witty lines added punch to this oh so funny movie. I recommend this movie to teenagers and adults. Although I feel the adults would benefit more from this film because maybe for once they would come to understand us!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen-Age Slackers, It Describes Us ALL","review":"I got this movie because I liked the cover, and I thank myself very much for juding the movie by the cover. I love movies about OUR kind, teenagers who...don't do much. I have one thing to say, I WISH I worked there, it looks sooo cool, and the performance by Rory C. was FABULOUS!

Just to corny and boring for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Zero","review":"This movie made me lose faith in humanity. Truly a waste of time for both creator and audience. I found it profoundly distrubing the film was brought from conception in the first place. It's so bad on so many levels...I have trouble just finding words to describe it after much reflection. Please....just avoid it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie was so boring and slow moving that we turned it off after 45 minutes. Not recommended as it was too boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Empire has fallen","review":"Give me a break. I cannot understand how anyone could sit through this movie and actully think it is funny. Between the lip-syncing rock videos the actors perform every five minutes, and the inept dialog, I began to ponder who the target audience is supposed to be. Even the Teenie-boppers who are supposed to relate to these exaggerated characters are still wondering why they wasted thier time on this movie. At first glance, I thought this movie would be along the lines of Mallrats, but to my dismay it has more in common with \\"From Justin to Kelly.\\"Avoid it even if your genitals are being burned off and the only way to put out the fire is with this dvd case.--IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware this movie has NOTHING in common to the classic \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" contrary to other reviewers opionons!!!!*****UPDATE*****There is one redeeming quality about this DVD edition. Upon further investigation of the Special Features I discovered there are 2 GWAR videos for your true enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Addicted to this Flick","review":"It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. The first time I saw I instantly fell in love with the cast, story, and music (above all else). It really plays to a lot of different ages, styles and personalities. I recommend it to the viewer who watches movies for the movie's sake - a critic would find something wrong with it. \\"Afterall, today is Rex Manning Day!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh until your tummy hurts","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. It's a light-weight comedy about teenagers who work in a record store. And it's Rex Manning day and everyone is excited for the has-been! This movie is hilarious and great one to watch with a group of friends. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Rex Manning Day!!!","review":"A phone rings in a crowded record store. \\"Empire records, open till midnight. This is Mark..... Midnight!\\" Mark looks at phone receiver with disdain before hanging up to return to the group demanding customers at the register. A classic music movie full of great lines, jokes that start at the beginning and run the entire movie, and a fun cast. Of course the soundtrack is good - duh! Sure it's a happy ending, so what! Getting there is worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY, ENJOYABLE,SAY NO MORE MON AMOUR","review":"I really like this film, and it's helped me when I've gone through some hard times. Good performances and the story's funny. I love Liv Tyler, there's always something honest about her performance.By Justine Ryan"},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe not oscar material, but still...","review":"I kind of get the feeling that Tom Keogh (the official Amazon reviewer) didn't actually see the movie, because Liv Tyler isn't a lovestruck teen in this film at all. but anyway. true, it may not be the greatest movie ever, and yes, it does consist of a lot of emotional teenagers who fall apart and then put them selves together in five minutes again. but so what? it's got a great soundtrack and six years later, still feels as new and fresh as it was in the beginning. i think its underappreciated by a lot of adults but for teenagers who aren't into the whole teeny bopper thing, it's great! i would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a genuinely good, if not great, movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I have a friend who loved this movie, she even had her screen name symbolizing the movie. I never heard of it. I watched for the first time 1 week ago, from today. I fell in love. I insisted that my parents see it with me. I watched it about 8 times, throughout a period of 5 days, before my mother told me to shut it off and go outside. It is just fabulous, there is no way to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak no matter how many times you watch it","review":"This movie is very weak. It had to be one of those throw together jobs where they pick a plot, some characters, some music, some actors, and a soundstage and see what they get. Well they didn't get much. They must have blown their entire budget on songs for the soundtrack because they sure didn't pay a writer for anything.I recently watched \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Almost Famous\\", \\"Varsity Blues\\" and \\"Road Trip\\". All of which put \\"Empire Records\\" to shame. Check any of these out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Behold the Freakish Movie Born without a Point or Plot!\\"","review":"I only looked this up out of curiosity, mainly to see if there were people out there who actually liked this thing. Now I know that the title \\"worst movie of all time\\" is usually just an exaggerated cliche, but this one is truly a contender. This one goes beyond the just dumb but fun kind of bad(like any Patrick Swayze movie) into the \\"Plan 9\\" inept kind of bad. It is rare to see a movie so pointless, so devoid of any semblance of plot. To be fair though, I get the feeling this thing was hacked to pieces by an editor to prepare it for it's straight to video death. Apparently, the makers of Empire Records were trying to cash in on the \\"gen x-alternative nation\\" fad of the mid- 90's and failed miserably and tried to recoup their losses. \\"Empire Records\\" along with the band Silverchair, the MTV vj Kennedy, and all other terrifying remnants of 1995 should be locked away in a timebox somewhere safe out of the reach of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A pretty terrible movie in which ludicrously unrealistic characters go through the motions of learning about themselves, Empire Records is only worth watching if you want a slice of mid-90s nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me feel physically sick","review":"Just what we all needed, an angst ridden story of a bunch of ever-so-misunderstood American teens, after all that's never been done before. So disgusted was I that I wanted to vomit bile all over the screen. Particularly when the blonde girl started singing on top of the record shop. Save me, save me from this horrible horrible film. Not funny Not clever Not good in the slightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire Records is an Empire TURKEY!","review":"It's very rare that a movie nausiates me as much as this one.I tried very eagerly to find a plot in this \\"epic\\", but all I found was a group of whiney losers (who can't act their way out of a box) who complain about their terrrrrible lives.I should've known that it was horrible from the back of the case:\\"A Killer Soundtrack\\". What about a storyline? It takes place over about a 3 hour period (except for the first scene) and nothing really happens except a manic depressant cuts her hair, the store gets \\"robbed\\" and some guy loses money.Big whoop!Oh, it also has Liv Tyler in it...need I say more? It wouldn't let me leave the rating at 0 stars...but believe me...1 star is a travesty to the way I would REALLY rate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelivable and stupid!","review":"Why did so many people like this film? I thought it was incredibly bad! why do we need to glorify kids who work in record stores, when that is where you usually get the worst customer service? Really stupid situations here...like when they all have a fake funeral for a depressed girl..and i mean they ALL do, so who is minding the store? The dumbest part was when a middle aged women UPS worker dances her way out of the store to alternative rock (something not right here)..and then we see some ballet dancer doing her thing at the listening station... i guess we are supposed to howl with laughter when we see two old ladies in their nightgowns and curlers in their hair show up to chug beer!! (COME ON!!) Oh yeah...everybody loves record store employees..they are the coolest people in the world! (online record stores are fine:-) )"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this film so much.","review":"This film actually makes me sick, it was so obviously a cash-in on 90s alternative slacker subculture written by some one who knew nothing about it trying to be trendy.

It had a good amont of laughs and very cool music. My favorite part of the movie was when Joe started playing the guitars to If You Want Blood (You Got It). That is, like, the coolest song by AC/DC ever. Even though I'm 13, I appeciate AC/DC music. I recommend this movie to anyone who is even SANE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my fave movie!","review":"Empire Records has been my favorite movie since the first time I saw it 4 and a half years ago. It has a wonderful cast of characters, all of whom basically started their film career with this movie. It's so funny, it's hard to pick who got the best lines. Almost everything is quotable. So sit back, relax, and laugh out loud with this crazy flick. It's a blast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excelent Movie","review":"This is a very twisted movie, it is played though the minds of several teenagers trying to save their beloved record store. In the midst of it all, something big is happening in each persons life. One is in love, one is in a crisis, and it weaves a tapestry of wonderess and a hilarias plot. This is an excelent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best tell your teenager you liked it","review":"If you are a parent, you may find that your kids enjoying a hormone charged, somewhat slacker prone group of teenagers navigate life to be a bit distressing.

This version is absolutly horrible! There are very unnessicary voice overs, for instance, when \\"Warren\\" came back to the store and said to stop calling him Warren, when they showed Eddie, Cory, Berko, and Mark, this scene shows a PERFECT example of not only an unnessicary voice over, but very poorly made voice over. They didn't even re-shoot that scene, they just voiced it over. I was VERY dissappointed with this version and I recomend the first version."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE FILM YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT YOU LIKED","review":"It was good fun.

I found it a good example of corporate suits cashing in on a sub-culture, but then it's not too far off the mark sometimes, you gotta admit......the soundtrack was obviously chosen by the kids of all the writers......pretty damn diverse. The one part I loved was the subtly-placed conversation between mark & eddie at the end ( primus vs. the pixies?!?!). how cool-schmool can you get!! a good one for drinking games ( drink every time someone whines/changes the music/makes a youth culture reference), & ethan randall/embry dressed as an indie rock kid is worth the rental charges, if just for perve factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"great memories","review":"everything should use this. wonderful, always in play in on form or another in my home....ok yes buy may I go?"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheesy and good","review":"Good entertainment and great music.

I feel it can really help those who are trying to be more devotional and who may be 'stuck in the mind'. Padre Pio explains the reasons for each prayer and, then, a short prayer is said at the end of each page. I feel these prayers can really open the heart and Eileen Bertanzetti has done a wonderful job putting this together in a very user friendly format. These are words from a man who had a great amount of wisdom and compassion....following his prayers, with trust and patience, can lead you to inner peace and allow you to have a more positive effect on those around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"book i was looking for","review":"with only part-time job and facing financial problems, this book tells you to trust in God. so relaxed now. good book and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughtful meditations","review":"Padre Pio has good insights for some common themes that we all deal with in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Microwave!","review":"We've had this unit for several months now, and I see why people talk about the user friendliness of Sharp Microwaves.

Called up Sharp USA and they said that without the extended warranty, they will only cover the replacement parts cost of the magnetron tube. Even with that, the labor charge etc will add up to $70. I might as well buy a new one. I also enquired with a local sharp authorized repair shop and he said that they charge $25 for evaluating the problem and another $45 minimum for labor cost plus any other parts cost.I ended up throwing out the R-308KW and buying a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticker on front of door","review":"I purchased this just yesterday and I am not sure how it will perform or last, however I have a warning for anyone who should decide to purchase this item. The door of this microwave is plastic and they put a sticker on the door and when you remove this sticker it leaves 4 glue spots on the door that I finally removed with a magic eraser however it looks like glue is smeared all over the door or the magic eraser scratched the door. I called Sharp and seems this is a running problem that they refuse to fix. Well I guess I bought it and am stuck but cannot recommend until Sharp addresses this problem, I asked the man I talked to if people complained why did they keep doing that and he said he wondered that himself. So I would avoid this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The cover of the book looks like there are many wonderful ideas and activities.

You can use it for your highschool and college classes, and also for standardized test like the SATS. More memory is helpful because you can store more custom made applications.

I see her poring over the board/rug and considering her next move while clearly seeing the entire area of play.The size also makes it easier for other family members (brother and mommy) to sit around and see what's happening while they wait for their turn.The rug and pieces are rugged and will likely last for years.

It was sad not in a tearful way, but it was sad to see what Andy Garcia's character thought he had to do to make money to support his family and to have to go through the inevitable consequenses. Mick Jagger was surprisingly good in this and so was James Coburn (I think it was either his last or one of his last roles). It's not a movie that I'd watch over and over and over again, but it's still enjoyable and worth looking at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written","review":"It is ironic that this movie should pertain to the subject of writing, as it is very poorly written.A MICROCOSM of this can be seen at the end, where the author reads his supposedly \\"breakthrough\\" novel: anybody over an amateur level readily recognizes what he is reading as extremely poor, extremely amateurish writing. It is also interesting that John Grisham is referred to once in the movie as a paragon of good writing--as though \\"fast food\\" writing ever qualified as very good intellectual reading meat.The stupidity of the protagonist in not procuring a contract for his services strains credulity.The likelihood that a well-known author would acquiesce to co-author his last book strains credulity.The very stilted dialogue of this movie strains credulity.Mick Jagger did a great job acting, but it's not enough to save this stinker.The guy who wrote this movie neither understands good writing nor was capable of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmm","review":"I saw this in the theater and thought, aside from the great acting turns by James Coburn and Mick, it was rather poor. The main plot conceit is that poor one-trick novelist Garcia has to turn to being a male escort because he cant sell his latest novel. Meanwhile, the guy keeps an OFFICE in an office building to write... something even most successful writers cant afford to do, and B) they TEACH! It never occurs to this guy to try teaching, when that's what EVERY other writer in the world does to make ends meet. THat it said, it wouldn't be so bad if Garcia, in his typical stylye, didn't once again insist on draining every ounce of frivilous fun from the proceedings, as if his acting would lose its dignity otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRITERS BLOCK","review":"Novelist with one major book under his belt has trouble selling his next. The plot then gets bizarre in a minimal high drama sort of way as he embarks on a hunt to find any means of income to support his family. Upon hearing a job prospect is a male escort the naive and gullible writer played by Andy Garcia says something to the effect of, \\"You mean like standing on a street corner in a big white cowboy hat?\\" If only. No, he is to embark on a literary metaphysical journey caused by the frustration and insecurity of writing amd make love to a beautiful woman under the watchful eye of the image of Ernest Hemingway whose writing credits he will share. In the shadows wait a sleazy barfly man from Elysian Fields looking like a scrawny weathered Hugh Hefner after sand is kicked in his face. Somebody somewhere ought to get back on their anti-psychotics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Sleepers","review":"I like almost anything that Garcia does, but I found this film to be more strangely and delightfully compelling than expected. While the story in itself is somewhat simple, it grabs you from the beginning and won't let go You'll hardly recognize Mick Jagger is at his best and a complete surprise in his role as Luther (Jumpin' Jack Flash becomes sophisticated. I believe this was James Coburn's last film and as always a superb performance, although I think that some of the pain and anguish displayed was far more real than acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****","review":"I went to see this movie as a Mick Jagger fan, not expecting much (I'd seen FREEJACK), but everything about it was wonderful, all the performances and the writing and directing and cinematography. I've now seen it more than once, which I don't often do with movies. The second time I watched it with my father on DVD, and after it was over he said, \\"That was good.\\" He then said, \\"When you were about to see it during its theatrical run, and you told me you were going to see a film about a male escort service, I thought, \`Why are you wasting your time on a film like that?' But now that I've seen it myself, I see it's very good.\\" Incidentally, even though I've walked along on it multiple times, I only recently learned that Paris's most famous avenue, the Champs-Élysées, means \\"Elysian Fields\\" in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"The view of Elysian Fields from Texas","review":"A surprising but wonderful job by Mick Jagger.

That's the project of ex-American Girls singer-songwriter Mike Johnson, who was the force behind the really good songs on \\"In The Whiskey Ya-Ya's\\". He was also the one who gave this band any sort of personality. The rest of the band kicked him out because apparently they felt he was impeding their progress towards becoming huge rock stars, mostly by writing good songs that wouldn't fit into the rotation at one of those \\"alt.rock\\" stations. Anyway, \\"In the Whiskey Ya-Ya's\\" is worth checking out, and Reclinerland is really quite excellent. I've heard a promo copy of the American Girls forthcoming \\"Like the Movies, Only Slower\\", their first album without the only guy in the band who had talent. The new album is HORRIBLE, but it'll probably sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for an earlier album...","review":"I think this album lacks the texture and soul of their earlier recordings. They used to care more about the music and less about the production in the earlier years. I also miss the other vocalist (whatever became of him?) and the poppier drumming. Lovesick Porch all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan","review":"We set up this slide and had every kid in the neighborhood was at our place.

However, I had a birthday party for my 6 year old and I had 13 kids playing on this slide for about 3 hours. There ages ranged from 2 to 12 years old. There were no issues. You need to supervise the kids somewhat or they will do things it was not made for. It takes quite a bit of time to dry out. It was definitely worth the $$ and I highly recommend it. I'm 6' and 190 lbs and had a blast going down it several times. I don't recommend someone my size sliding down on a regular basis but it held up just fine. You will need to buy a container to store it, I bought a 55 gallon bin from Walmart and it barely fits, cover won't close. I recommend a larger container. Hope this helps someone who is undecided. If something bad happens I will report it but so far this slide is a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you speak in church","review":"I think this is a very good book.

Like 311, they have a penchant for hooks and a talent for mixing mellow tracks with big beats! Tracks like \\"One Summer\\", \\"Who Wants This\\", and \\"I Can't Hear You\\" are energetic and infectious. On the other hand \\"Inside My Room\\" is chill, melodic and something you can just sorta lay down and groove to. For the most part, this album is on par with Volumizer and Super! Mercado - maybe even better, depending on which aspect of the J's you like. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The One I Bought Fell Apart","review":"Not much information in this non-book (actually a bunch of flash cards).

Since I knew it was their last album together, I figured, this one is probably as good as it gets. I might've been wrong.If you listen to the thirty second samples of each of these songs, what's great about them might escape you. And like most of my favorite CD's, this takes a few listens to really appreciate it. But then sure enough, one day, after getting accustomed to all the songs, I was like, \\"I get it!\\" And now I think I like this album more than Mic City Sons.Actually they're both great albums (I've yet to still purchase Dead Air). But they're both greatin their own respects. But what I love about Cop and Speeder is how solid these rock songs are. They're catchy tunes, and it's excellent music for rolling down your windows and playing it really loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"elliot smith = pop genius","review":"hey if you like elliot smith but hankered for something a little more rockin', this is the CD for you. Great rhythyms, great lyrics, and good energy. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the record lacks the searing originality of his solo work. But definetely worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm","review":"if you are new to Heatmiser then you are forgiven, at least you are looking at their albums. Why they never made it bigger or more people new about them is beyond me. but anyway......This album has lots of good ideas and they are held together really well with the guitar work of Nel gust and elliot smith. One thing that might make this inferior to the previous mic city sons album is the change in direction and vocals.Much more of the songs on here have elliot singing in a style which doesnt show off his great voice, they are still good songs though. Also the music is heavier when compared to the Mic city sons outing. I think thats due to Sam Coombes drumming and lending a more chilled and trippy rhythm than J.J. on here.They are all good musicians and use their ideas wisely. This CD should sell itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film about unemployment","review":"A powerful, poignant drama set in depression-era England, \\"Love on the Dole\\" examines the crushing effects of unemployment and poverty on a working class family that sinks into despair and degradation as one after another of them lose their jobs and their hopes for a better future.The script is bleak and bitter, with a distinctly Socialist air. The entire cast is superb, with top honors going to a young Deborah Kerr, in one of her earliest screen roles. The only drawback to the film, at least for American audiences, is that it is somewhat difficult to follow the dialogue early on due to the thick accents of the actors. But this problem disappears as the film progresses and the viewer gets used to the accents.There are no happy endings here. The film is gritty and realistic. It is also very timely given the economic state of the world today. Highly recommended for those who like intelligent, meaningful films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth A Look","review":"The title sounds like this might be a romantic comedy about a newly married couple trying to make ends meet on a tight budget, but instead it is a gritty little film about life in a Manchester, England coal-mining town during the depression. The accents are sometimes difficult to follow, but it's worth giving ths small film a chance. Deborah Kerr, in one of her earliest films, is probably the only familiar name or face, especially to an American audience, and she does very well, especially towards the end of the film when she has to face the reality of her situation and that of her family. Definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"The Richard Boone movie is third rate. It seems that at the end of his career, Boone took on some badly scripted and plotted movies. \\"Crooked Sky\\" is one of them. Another is \\"Madron\\".The documentary \\"Indian Wars\\" was poorly done. The audio documentary does not jive with the video, which were mostly taken from stock footage of old cavalry movies.Lon Chaney Jr. in \\"Battles of Chief Pontiac\\" is not the typical B western fare. Not only is it bad, its worse. The print however is much better than the others available in public domain products.The color and sound in the Dale Robertson's movie, \\"Sitting Bull\\" with J. Caroll Naish in the title role are atrocious. It's typical 50's western fare. It was filmed in cinemascope and a restored or a better preserved version would have been enjoyable to watch.

Sims 2 ran sooooo slow..and my computer often froze during the game.The game itself has great potential and can be quite entertaining if you like detailed architecture and like interior design. However, the Mac Mini just doesn't have the speed to support the game to it's full potential.I would recommend getting the game for a PS2 or an Imac G5.I spent 50 dollars on this game, and it's pretty much useless, unless I buy a faster Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I got hooked to it!

And if I don't get that computer, then I'll just get this on May 30th. Oh, lucky me.Well, anyway, I've always liked building the houses, and now I can make so many changes (especially when I do the cheat -- hee hee!)All my friends like The Sims, especially me. So I root the sequel on!-- Nina S."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Sim games","review":"Be certain that your Mac is fast enough to handle the full game. It is definitely created to run on the newer macs. If you are planning to allow younger children to play this game, be aware that you may find some of the activities available to the Sims to be objectionable for younger children so you need to read the reviews and be age appropriate. The Sims change clothes, and get undressed for baths, but it is always screened, so there is no real nudity. Sims can also go for a role under the covers and children can result. Fortunately for younger children, children also can result from kissing or adoption, so for parents, be prudent. My teens enjoy building houses, customizing the characters. I enjoy building shops and playing God with the characters. My brother, likes to lock them in a room with no doors and try to make they go nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"so upset ):","review":"I RECEIVED A PC VERSION NOT THE MAC! SO UPSET.

The only things that are slow are load times and every once in awhile the screen slows down so it takes a little while to scroll.I did a little searching before purchasing this game, just to see if anyone else was having the same problems as listed here and I found that most people I asked could work the game. It was a little slow for some people, but for the most part it worked.Just make sure that if you buy this game you have above whats listed as a requirement, like space and speed. As long as you have that you should be able to play the sims 2 with no problems.And of course its an awesome game when it works, much better than the original.

Unfortunately it is buggy as hell, to the point of corrupting files so that some families won't even load anymore (especially, of course, the ones you have worked on the hardest). I am running the game on an iMac G5 with 768 MB of RAM, so it definitely meets the requirements.When you start seeing characters with hair or parts of their bodies missing, watch out -- your are headed for crashes and/or corrupt files. I was never able to correctly create a Sim from scratch either -- parts always turned up \\"missing\\" in the character photo and it is a bit disconcerting to see, for example, a hairdo walking around all by itself.This game is in dire need of a patch, but so far none is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspyr Sucks!","review":"Ok, well, I wanted to order The Sims 2 for my iMac, but no...I found out it won't even work! Is this some kind of scam, do they have some evil pact with Macintosh to make this game so overhyped that everyone wants it more than anything just to find out even on newer Macs it will not work so you're forced to buy a brand new computer? I think so. Anyway, I really hope they will do something to fix this. A new version or some patches, something! I have been waiting impatiently since I first found out about The Sims 2 to have it and spend countless hours playing, just to find out my less than 2 year old Mac is not good enough for it!

What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm. A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.

For instance, on page 6/18 (3rd edition) the book directs you to purchase one of their other publications to get information on how to operate your LLC. I could accept this if the cover of the book said \\"volume 1\\" or \\"companion volume to...\\" but it says \\"All you need...\\" For a fairly scant $30 paperback to promise all, then direct me to buy another $30 paperback, is IMHO, a broken promise and a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic and repetitive","review":"I had high hopes for this book but it did not meet my expectations. The book does a decent job explaining the difference between an LLC and other entities like C corp, S corp, general partnerships, etc. However, it does not get to the point about (1) steps needed to file an LLC and the common paradigm of filing in Nevada / Delaware and then registering in your home state, (2) choosing where to file for LLC, or (3) ongoing legal and financial care and feeding of the LLC so you do not \\"pierce the corporate veil.\\" Basically, the book is very light on specifics and does not justify its price.

I often refer to my Nolo library to answer general questions my clients ask me.This book is a little different than what I have previously read.

The information is well organized, allowing the reader to quickly access the information needed.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent guide from Nolo","review":"Nolo does a very good job of demystifying the legal process. This book on the Limited Liability Corporation is no exception. It does a very good job of telling you exactly what the steps are that you need to follow. It tells you everything you need to know to set up your new corporation.If you are thinking of setting up your own company and you think that an LLC is what you need, this book will give you all of the information you need whether you go through the steps yourself or you hire a lawyer to help you. Even if you are certain that you need a lawyer, I would recommend reading this book to help you understand the process and also to help you confirm to yourself that the LLC is the way to go.Very good book and a must have if you are considering an LLC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"This book is very informative and easy to read and comprehend for anyone interested in starting an LLC or to see if an LLC is for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Deceptive Product Description","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this product listing is for a single piece of Code 83 Super-Flex track yet the description contains \\"(100)\\" in the description which might lead you to believe you are getting 100 pieces (not realistic for this price).

Much has been said about the ska group Madness' influence on No Doubt, but I would not be surprised to hear Gwen Stefani admit being influenced by Martha Davis; I think the similarities are obvous to anyone familiar with both groups.

The Subwoofer contains the amp so all the speaker wires are attached to the back of the Sub and a heavy duty cable attaches the Sub to the DVD. What this means is that the Sub must be placed beside the television. I cannot hide it next to a chair or sofa. Panasonic support told me to go to Radio Shack to see if I could get a longer cable or an extension as Panasonic did not make one.

It doesn't pretend to be more than it is.A much better choice for a second book would be \\"Huck Adventures\\" by Michiko Kuge with easy to follow instructions, more interesting designs and mouth watering colors. These designs show how far from boring a rather limited technique can be! Another good choice for a second book would be \\"Plain and Fancy Huck Embroidery\\" by Bonnie Datta. This is a slim booklet but has more interesting and original material in it than all four of the Tams/Duffin books combined. The graphs are also very easy to follow. The only drawback is that it may be difficult to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't sing Classical!","review":"Aretha you are no doubt the Queen of pop and R&B. But you have totally destroyed the beautiful Nessun Dorma. Classical musicians, especially classically trained singers cringed when you sang for Pavarotti. I am a classically trained voice teacher with a Masters Degree, and all of us hate how you have destroyed this song. This ranks up there with Barbara Streisands attempt at a Classical Music Album. It is Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, Aretha darlin Please don't sing classical!","review":"Here we go again, is a really sweet track.Funky it kinda reminds me of Chain of fools.It's soulful, really gritty (in my opinion the way soul should be) and danceable, not adult contemporary, which is nice to hear from a verteran artist.Beautiful vocal performance.Sure other verterans are doing danceable music,but they have to be computer modified. Many don't have the vocal stamina to sing belters like this one. Now \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is one of my favorite arias.My sister is an Opera singer. On more than one occassions she sang this song.I aggree with 2 previous reviewers, Aretha is a soul singer and the Best Soul Sister out there.I think she should stick to pop/R&B.She does not have the voice for classical, just like a classical singer does not have the voice for Soul.Technique and style in singing are just as important as learning how to SPELL. ARETHA I love you, and I love your Gospel, R&B, Rock, Jazz and Gospel stuff but steer clear of Classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is great with great emotion","review":"For those who ask her not to sing classical, all I can say is they lack the sence of music, they know nothing, they realize nothing, cause Aretha here is great. She transfers so much electricity singing this Aria. She reveals us her soul on plate with her glorious sentimental voice. Thank U Aretha for all we get every time we listen to this unforgetable singing of yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Heard this on the radio. Never knew Aretha to sing classical. One either likes it or not. I had to purchase a used CD. It should be a collectors item. I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless masterpiece","review":"In all of my years of introducing friends to the first 2 Poi Dog Pondering records, never has their been anyone who didn't think it was one of the most amazing records that they had ever heard. Your punk rock girlfriend will love it, your hippie sister will love it, your Simon and Garfunkel listenin' parents will love it, your 10 year old little brother will love it... Poi Dog Pondering fuses together many folk and roots styles and ties them together with the catchy yet offbeat lyrics of lead singer Frank Orrall. The music is infectious and delightful. Do yourself a favor and add this cd to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"if They Might Be Giants & the Barenaked Ladies were fused...","review":"... in a genetic experiement, they might end up sounding like Poi Dog Pondering. Fun catchy songs, whimsical lyrics, fun-sounding instruments. Even the drawings and the way the lyrics are written in the booklet are whimsical. I got this CD solely for the single I heard on the radio, \\"Living With the Dreaming Body\\" and I was pleased to find out all the songs had the same whimsical flavor and had upbeat melodies. This is a fun CD and great for parties and road trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE READ ME!","review":"I (like most other Judith McNaught) fans fell in love with her books after Whitney, My Love. And have loved all her books. But I am disappointed to read about the ones with negative comments on this book. Comments on how Sloan wasn't changed by love or pieces wrong or missing. Sloan wasn't changed because her goal in life was clear, were as Noah's wasn't and his life/attitude changed with the love from Sloan. And if you found pieces missing from this book, I feel sorry for you because you missed a moving tale. I engross myself in these books and always leave with a tear, laugh, and smile. Please read parts of it again for it is well worth it. Or if you are a first time fan, read Whitney, My Love. Although this one was not near as emotional as Judiths other's it definately deserves applause, not condems. Keep them coming Ms. McNaught."},{"rating":"1","title":"What \\"Night Whispers?\\"","review":"After Whitney, My Love, Judith McNaught became my favorite author. When I saw that her most recent novel had finally made it to paperback, I grabbed it and ran to buy it. I was practically salivating by the time I sat down and almost reverently open the book to read.Yuck. What happened to the Judith McNaught who created characters and situations that made you cry? The plot had potential. This novel didn't even touch that potential.What \\"Night Whispers?\\" Did I miss something?Shame on you, Judith. Please don't disappoint your loyal fans again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still Good","review":"I really enjoyed Night Whispers. It started off a bit slow, but then I got really into it. It is very different from the usual Judith McNaught novels, but I thought it still had the same quality as her others. I am looking forward to the Water's Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several mistakes...","review":"I have just finished this book and found myself left unsatisfied. There were several mistakes where names were different to who was actually having the conversation. For example a conversation with just Noah and Sloan but it said Paul in the next paragraph. This led me to think that the author chopped and changed the story while halfway through. After coming across this sort of mistake a few times I lost interest but perserved to the end. Since beginning the book I felt that the romance between the main chars wasn't really as indepth as other books have been which is why I probably felt unsatisfied because I couldn't get into the story. The sub-plot of Sara and Jess wasn't dealt with by the end either. I agree with the reader who said it wasn't a romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises, promises...","review":"Loved it. Loved the characters even though she was too perfect(a bad habit here or there would of been nice) and I would of liked toknow more about Noah. I couldn't wait to read the ending, I was anticipating a big explosion of some sort. A big Kaboom! And I got a pouf. I wish McNaught would've spent more time on the last 100 pages and elaborated less on pages 150-350!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simplistic","review":"The writing style of this book was geared to a 13 or 14 year old girl. I stuck with it hoping things would evolve. They never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"get it from the library like I did","review":"This was definately not one of her best. What is up lately with her writing?I have not seen this mentioned but I was thrown at first when the love interest was Noah. I was reading along and wondering when things would happen with Paul, then, BAM, here the girl is in love with Noah. I actually went back a few pages to make sure I had things right.Usually Judith McNaught is such a wonderful writer. I loved her historicals and most of the contemorary titles. I just hope her next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like all her contemporaries, it was awful.","review":"I'm probably going to commit blasphemy with all the McNaught fans out there, but I don't think the woman can write a contemporary romance to save her life. This includes Paradise, Perfect, etc., etc. The plots are SO unbelievable and SO far removed from reality. Don't get me wrong, romance novels are intended to be entertainment but when I read a contemporary romance that has some outlandish plotting in it, I usually end up throwing it against the wall. McNaught's contemporaries UNIFORMLY have this plotting problem!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're a diehard J.M. fan...","review":"If you're not than chose one of her others all of which I have enjoyed. I wouldn't give any of her other books less than 4 1/2. This book however was such a disappointment, particularly for such a best selling author! The only adjective for it is Lukewarm. Though she uses her usual base plot line, the main characters had zero chemistry and the subplot of a potential romance between two other characters peters out about halfway into the book going absolutely nowhere. The book just stops mentioning them and quite frankly I was relieved. Those long pauses between the action were even more boring than the rest of the book. There is also some information given about the suspense that is set up to be important at the time however is never mentioned again... The plot drags, the suspense is sketchy, the passion droops, and the characters lack anything charismatic enough to make them come alive. All in all a poorly woven book."},{"rating":"1","title":"night whispers...","review":"ok what happened here? this book was impossible to follow, and it was one of the few i just could not finish. i think i stopped a chapter or two after Sloan and her father's reunion. it was just not believable at all. i skimmed thru the last, oh, two-thirds or half of the book, and i just could not find out how, or why, Sloan and Noah got together. there was no chemistry, no romance, no nothing!!! at first i thought she would be paired with Jess, then with Paul, anybody but Noah!!! Even his father would have been better! He was BORING. and what was with all the plots left hanging? mainly the one involving Sara and Jess. i believe the last we hear of them is when she slams the door in his face, then nothing. i have to admit, i think i'd have rather read their story than Sloan's. the only reason i gave this book 2 stars was because of the beginning, before Sloan left to meet her father and sister. that part i honestly enjoyed, but after that, i just could not continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I have read almost all of Judith McNaught's books (my favorites are Once and Always, Paradise, and Almost Heaven), and after reading Night Whispers I have to wonder what has happened to my favorite romance writer. I don't know if you'd even call this book a romance novel. The relationship between Noah and Sloan (as soon as I saw that name I had a bad feeling) was extremely under developed. This book seemed to concentrate more on discovering who the killer was than their relationship. Compared with her other books, the emotional quality of this one was very lacking. It was like, \\"Hey, let's go have meaningless sex even though we don't care about eachother!\\" I think that Judith McNaught should stay out of the romance/mystery genre and revert to her earlier style of writing. This book was disappointing to say the least, and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Judith McNaught Read","review":"I received this book as a gift, and after reading the synopsis couldn't wait to get started. Once I did, I just couldn't stop. I had never read any of JM's work before, and now I am hooked. I read through the reviews listed for this book, and was a bit disappointed to see how many did not think this was up to JM's best.For someone who has never read any of her work before, this book will absolutely have you hooked. I've lent it to two other friends, and they feel the same way. I'm searching the reviews now to choose my next title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre work from a magnificent author","review":"I love Judith McNaught and all of her books, so I was very disappointed in this story. She did a good job of developing a suspense thriller but her development of characters and their relationships was weak. I kept waiting for another Matt Farrell and Meredith Bancroft. I felt that there were many loose strings left in this novel, especially many unanswered questions about Noah Maitland. I hope Ms. McNaught takes her time with the next novel and combines a suspenseful story with real character development and intercharacter relationships. I know she can because she is only one of two romance authors that I read and she is superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointing...","review":"After reading this book, i felt that it should have been more of a suspense or action story that was just riddled with elements attraction between the protagonists. i was very disappointed with this because there's not enough romance between Noah and Sloan. i suppose ms. mcnaught thought that venturing a bit into the action/thriller genre could prove just as rewarding as writing exclusively on romance. but personally, i really disliked the outcome of this story. the deep and heart-wrenching emotion that is ms. mcnaught's signature writing is simply lacking here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge departure and disappoint compared to her other work.","review":"Ms McNaught pushed this book through without her usual wonderful character development, attention to unique and stirring vocabulary and without her usual enthralling dialogue. Each of her other books are keepers to be read over and over. This effort is an apparent attempt to enter into a new area of literature, ie, murder/suspense. By page one hundred the reader is still wondering who he/she reading about and waiting to be caught up in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great outline-now where is the book?","review":"What a disapointment! As an outline it is great but where is all of the wonderful detail for which this author is known? Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I have read every one of J. McNaughts books and was disappointed with Night Whispers. The story line was good, but it was rushed. It was as though she was in a hurry to finish it. I was especially let down at the end where Sloan apologizes to Noah - she pours her heart out to him and all he does is pull the covers on the bed down and unbuttons his shirt! What's up with that? I wanted to see Noah accept Sloans apology, more dialogue was needed at this point. Hopefully, McNaught will not do this to her devoted readers again! I like a scene to end, not just fade out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad!","review":"I am a big Judith McNaught fan so I was disappointed when I bought and read this book. I really didn't buy the characters' love for each other. When and how did it happen and why?Don't let this discourage you from buying other Judith McNaught books. Some of her other novels are absolutely breathtaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"This book was not up to Judith McNaught's typical standards. There was little to no character development, and by the end of the book, you really just didn't care what happened to the people involved. This book would have been ok as a mystery, but as a romance, it fell short. The romance between Sloan and Noah plodded along, and you never really began care whether or not they can overcome the obsticles in their way. In the end I walked away from this book very disappointed. If you haven't read Judith McNaught, don't start with this one, go read Perfect or Until You to see how amazingly Ms. McNaught can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a complete disappointment","review":"Judith McNaught is my favorite romance novel writer but she really disappointed me with Night Whispers. I was expecting it to be as good as Perfect and Paradise and I was shocked when the hero and heroine made no impact on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it a 0 Star.","review":"Midnight Whispers fails to meet up to the standards of her other books. I was quite disappointed with this novel. The characters were not detailed and developed as well. By the end of the novel, I didn't understand her characters at all or the situations she placed them in. It left an sense of dissatisfaction. It is not a romance nor is it a mystery story. It is an injustice to Paul who deserves better for his unself efforts in Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Flop ! =(","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. It cost a lot and then I was just frustrated at the end. It doesnt have the same magic and wonderful creativity as the past books of Ms Mc Naught. the likes of Something Wonderful, Whitney my Love, Paradise, Perfect, Almost Heaven are the best but this Night Whispers ? I wont recommend it.... **Sigh**"},{"rating":"1","title":"my GOD!","review":"i thought i was out of my mind when i have finished THIS book.thi book is totally out of her normal standard.the night whispers n remember whed are terrible .the story does not focus on romance at all.it is totally different from her previous books.whitney,my love n once n always are great.thumbs up for judith!i hope you can improve your story in the near future. thank you n good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Judith Mcnaught's best.","review":"I was looking forward to this book, until I read it. Judith McNaught is one of my favorite writers, but I was very disappointed in her most recent effort. This book seemed to be more like a debut novel instead of one from a well written author. The story line and plot were good, but the developement of characters was slow and never really brought forth. It was no where in the line with Paradise, my favorite contempory novel by her, or Whitney My Love, McNaught's best historical novel. I only hope McNaught doesn't try to go the same route as Sandra Brown and try to write mystery. Brown bombed at it. I hope McNaught has better judgement, and realizes what a great romance novelist she is. They should both stick to what they know. I almost didn't finish this book, which is something I've never done. Anything I start, I always finish. I still wait with high anticipation for McNaught's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith McNaught's Best Contemporary Yet","review":"Night Whispers is fantastic! I first became a fan of Ms. McNaught's work through her historical romances. Until this book, I believed that her historical romances were better than her contemporary ones. Night Whispers kept me guessing about the motivations and loyalties of most of the characters until the final chapters of the book. Night Whispers is also the rare romantic suspense novel where the intrigue and the romance are deftly balanced. A great read, well worth purchasing in hardcover. Now to find a man for Courtney..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith McNaught's Night Whispers is D-I-V-I-N-E","review":"This book was absolutely a great read. It was very suspenseful, but the suspense didn't ever take away from the romance between Sloan and Noah. Noah, in a departure from JM's usual style of hero, comes from an absolutely fabulous family, and you really come to love them. Sloan shares a wonderful friendship with a woman named Sara - i felt as if we were revisiting Lisa and Meredith in some ways. You who love JM solely for the fabulous fashions found in her novels shan't be disappointed... And you who love JM solely for sex scenes might... but you who love JM for her humor will find that here in abundance. All in all - you won't be disappointed... There isn't pages and pages of sappy stuff, the way I might have liked, but I liked the hero and heroine so much I didn't notice"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!","review":"this is thefirst novel of judith mcnaught that i have read and i just couldn't put it down! for me this book was a real page turner. i only get to read fo an hour a day while i'm on my lunch break at work, and with this book i kept making time in my hectic day to read it. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable plot, flat characters","review":"I was quite disappointed with McNaught's latest effort. The plot was an attempt at high crime and drama but felt scripted and predictable. The characters were static and stereotyped. And while we all expect happy endings in romance novels, this one was just too much. Everyone got married and lived happily ever after. The sugar-coated resolution of emotional family issues was also difficult to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"just like dozens of other mystery romance books","review":"Judith McNaught has written another uninteresting book similar to Remember When. She should go back to her earlier books (that's where her fans came from) and try to remember what made her books special. I have all of her books but I am finally fed up. I will not buy her new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SUMMER READING :)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I enjoyed it very much. In fact I'm looking for more books that have been writen by her right now. Great summer reading :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different, but just as good!","review":"Helllloooo...check the book binding, it says \\"Fiction\\", not \\"Romance\\". This was very entertaining and well written. The characters have a lot of substance, and the minor players could each easily have their own stories written. It was not a run-of-the-mill romance, but has mystery and suspense, as well as a poignant romance. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't quite the book \\"Paradise\\" is, but I liked it more than \\"Perfect\\" and it certainly had more to chew on than \\"Remember When\\" (although I think I liked \\"Remember When\\" more than most readers!). Keep writing Judith, and I'll keep reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!","review":"Rarely do I find a book that I cannot bear to put down, but Night Whispers was one of them! Not since Paradise, has Ms. McNaught written such an exciting story about two complex and interesting people. I thought Noah was the perfect hero - brooding, arrogant, cynical with alot of bad history behind him. But Sloan was his savior and she was written so beautifully.I've been a fan for many years, and unlike alot of the Big Time romance authors, Ms. McNaught keeps getting better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this the outline ??? where is the rest of the story","review":"if you really love jm which i do you will still buy this book. but save you money for the paperback"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"As well as many others who have taken time to submit a review of this book, I was extremely disappointed with it. I have absolutely loved each and every one of Judith McNaught's other books, particularly Perfect. This book lacked her normally wonderful characters and storylines. I was confused throughout much of this book, and baffled by how quickly relationships were formed and unformed. Some relationships were started and never followed through, and I can't for the life of me figure out how Paul and Paris fell in love since they never spent any time together. Finally, what does \\"Night Whispers\\" have to do with ANYTHING in the story? My guess is that the title and cover were more about attracting a different group of readers than anything to do with the actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING DRUDGERY","review":"I have read every single Judith Mcnaught book to date and have to say that I am a little dissapointed in her last 2 novels. I miss the love, romance and spirit of her previous novels. I am not sure if this new writing style is a fluke, or if she is attempting to following a Sandra Brown, mystery-action-romance trend. I love her work and presently have found no other romantic writer who can compare to her previous style and class in works such as \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\", \\"Paradise\\" and \\"Whitney My Love\\". I urge Judith to continue to write these historical romances that readers have proven to love. I hope that she ceases this new trendy style that thus far her faithful readers have proven to dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the Library, don't buy it.","review":"Judith McNaught has written some wonderful books, this is not one of them. Paul, the manipulative FBI agent in Perfect, is back and as obnoxious as ever. It's a pity someone did not shot him in his sit upon. He ended up with Paris, who was too good for him, and he certainly did not do enought to end up with a wonderful girl. I hope to meet Jess & Sara in another book; sorry she didn't see fit to do more with them. Noah Maitland came off with too many shades of unexplained gray and black to end up as the good guy. After leaving Sloan Reynolds in jail, she should have written him off as a lost cause. She loved him enough to forgive him, but he did not love her enough to even listen. This is what she wanted to build a life on? Give women some credit for having brains. His father and sister were more likable. This story line needes alot more work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no 0 stars for the choices?","review":"Judith should have just used her time rewriting Miracles instead of this book and the even worse Remember When.

I love the way she organized everything to come out so perfect. I absolutely see nothing wrong with this book and I hope that someday there will be a sequel to this beautiful story and believe me I will read it.

Good Job Judy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith is wonderful","review":"I was prepared to not like this book because of a few bad reviews and the cover artwork looked \\"evil\\". But, it was in fact very good and I am so happy that I read it. Judith has a way of making you really like the characters and making you feel that they could be your friends. There was just enough suspense to make it a page-turner to blend with the romance. I look forward to the next book she writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"McNaught has just about lost me.","review":"I do like much of McNaught's older work, and her contemporaries can be very good. But this is so implausible you just can't get past the set-up.Are we actually to believe that her rich father (involved in illegal activity no less) wouldn't have his estranged daughter thoroughly checked out before he invites her to spend time in his home? He wouldn't have any idea that she's a cop? Even after calling her on the job? The story just can't make it past that enormous hiccup.I consider that a kind of laziness. There may be deadlines, but when something makes no sense, a writer must take a hard look at it and figure a way to make it work. I'm certain many of McNaught's loyal readers could have come up with a scenario where a rich, shady character could have his estranged daughter in his home without knowing she's a police officer and have it be sustainable in the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK","review":"Boy, was I disappointed in this one. I should have waited for the paperback!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Twist for Judith McNaught","review":"I have read all of Judith McNaught's books, and I appreciated this one because it combines elements of a romance with a suspenseful mystery novel.

Definitely better than Remember When, although not as good as Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"Just finished reading 'Night Whispers'..thoroughly enjoyed it, but not as much as 'Paradise'. The characters were wonderful in this book, especially Sloan & Paris and,of course, Noah & Paul. I must say though, I felt a sense of 'dejavu' when Noah hung up on Sloan when she called from jail and near the end of the book when she says goodbye to Noah on the boat. Noah's actions were very similar to Clayton's in 'Whitney My Love' and Sloan's actions (when she was saying goodbye to Noah on the boat) were very similar to Whitney when she confronted Clayton by the fireplace in his mother's home. Correct?? Of course, as Whitney My Love is my FAVORITE book...this was ok with me. This is worth reading year after year!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment...","review":"I am a fan of Ms. McNaught and have read most if not all of her novels.

It purports to be a romantic mystery, but the mystery is insipid at best.

Please, Judith, go back to your old style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I love Judith McNaught but as compared to her earlier works, Night Whispers doesn't even rate. Her main charater, Sloan is poorly built. Yeah, we all know that she's a police officer but... what else? What are her interests, etcetera? Noah wasn't built up well. We all know he's a billionaire but so...? McNaught's style is terribly lacking. At the start, Noah was cynical and arrogant... so how was he able to be kind-hearted and a lvoesick party only after one date? I think this novel is rushed and lacks the proper depth.Judith McNaught, I miss your past works!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I only read ONCE!!!!","review":"I read all of Ms Mcnaught's writing repeatedly but this book.

I applaud her latest work. I don't think some of the other people that have reviewed this book are ready to expand their horizans. There are several well developed characters that maintain your interest in more than just the heroine that is the focus of the story.

The overall storyline was good, the main character Sloan was developed very well. However, I did not feel the love interest of Sloan, Noah was developed as well. The reader did not have an opportunity to really bond with Noah. Therefore, the romance in the novel simply wasn't as strong as in other novels. The book spent more time on the subplots of the story than it did on the actual romance element between Noah and Sloan. I found myself wondering if I was reading a true romance novel or a suspense thriller with a little romance thrown in to spice things up. To make matters worse the story ends in a rushed manner that leaves the reader frustrated and dissatisfied. This novel does not deserve to be compared to former novels written by the same author such as Paradise and Perfect. The development of these two stories were far superior to Night Whispers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was between bad and ok!","review":"Night Whispers did not have any zing or how do I describe it, powerful emotions maybe? When I read Something Wonderful and Whitney, My Love, I was crying at some parts and the books made me feel like I was there! Night Whispers did not do that. It had a somewhat interesting plot line, but it did not have the stuff from Judith McNaught's previous books. Just borrow it from the library if you want to read it, that is what I did. I recommend reading her previous books. They were what romance novels(historical and contemporary) should be like. I really want Judith McNaught to write more historicals though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a great coaster","review":"I bought this book to read on a plane trip. One hundred and fifty pages into the book, I put it down and read the airline magazine instead - the later was more entertaining. If the manuscript for this book had been submitted by a first time author it would have been turned down flat. If you must read this book - borrow it from the library. It definitely isen't a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I was very disappionted after reading Night Whispers. I am an avid Mcnaught and have read all her other books at least twice; this is definitely her worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Well, like everyone, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book and even treated myself to the hardback. What a mistake. With all due respect, Ms. McNaught really didn't take her time with this one. I agree with all the other reviewers who said Night Whispers is just not up to her usual standards and that the characters were so rushed. We never really get to know them or feel their passion. A couple of kisses and a hurried lovemaking left me feeling like an unwanted reader. Her best love scenes usually last several pages. Most of her books leave me actually missing the characters and sneaking peeks at them again while I'm in between books. All of the characters needed more detail, especially Courtney who was a riot. All of her books should be at least 500 pages. Paradise didn't even seem as long as it was because it was so good! Oh well, in the meantime, I'll just reread my favorites! But I won't be rereading this one. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment for this loyal fan","review":"I have read every Judith McNaught book published, and unfortunately, this is similar to Remember When and not to her earlier novels. Her detailed characterizations used to be outstanding, and now they are only mediocre. Her last few novels have seemed so superficial. The relationship between Sloan and Noah doesn't seem to be based on anything significant at all, and there were many loose ends at the end of the novel. I should have waited for the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not up to standard","review":"I was looking forward to JM's new book and when I finished it I was very disappointed. Her characters lacked dimension and I really didn't care much about them. I recommend you borrow it from a friend or library to save money. I hope that Water's Edge is an improvement, you can give me the old historical romances any day...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment to say the least","review":"Since my junior year in high school, I have been an avid fan of Ms. McNaught's. She was the one author who could make one trully believe in the power of love and I couldn't wait to devour her novels but this one, this one (and Remember When) left much lacking. I was highly disappointed. I simply couldn't believe that this was a McNaught novel. It felt like a bright flame had burned out. She skipped the courtship and went strait to the bedroom. There was no growth in the relationship between Sloan and Noah. THis story, as far as romance is concerned, was \\"Wam Bam, Thank you, Ma'am.\\" It was so bad and so unlike McNaught, it made me want to cry. I do have hope for her though, and I wait anxiously for another great rendition from the woman who lovingly crafted out stories like \\"Perfect\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"Whitney, My Love,\\", and \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\". I only hope that she will write another historical and that it will be just as grand if not even more so then its predecessors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, but definitely up to Ms McNaught's standards","review":"If you're a first time reader of Judith McNaught's work you probably will enjoy this book. If you are a fan of her previous works, then you will be disappointed. Like \\"Remember When\\", I did not feel this book lived up to her usually standards. The characters lack their usually depth, although they are not as stale as in \\"Remember When.\\" What I have always enjoyed is the attention to character interaction that Ms McNaught gives her stories. In her last two books I've felt they've have been rushed, and that she has not given them her usual attention to detail. I hope her new book shows a return to her older style of writing. If you are looking for a fantastic contemporary romance I suggest either \\"Paradise\\" or \\"Perfect.\\" My favorites have always been the historical romances, and for that I suggest \\"Almost Heaven\\" or \\"Something Wonderful\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced...","review":"I'm the type of reader who has to be hooked from the beginning or I'll dump the book right away. This one got me hooked and reading until the very end which is a rare find these days. I'm not sure why the other readers were disappointed. I guess you just can't please everybody. But take it from me, if you have to have a fast-paced, exciting story to keep those pages turning, this is a great book to get. Perfect for the beach or those long plane rides..."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's lost me","review":"I thought Judith McNaught was a great romance wiriter. I still think she has the potential to be great. Perfect and Paradise are two of my favorite books of all time. These books made you care about the charachters and the pairings were spectacular. In comparison \\"Remember When\\" and \\"Night Whispers\\" feel like bad blind dates. Couples are only together to service the half-baked plot. No chemistry, no genuine emotion. Why bother? Unfortunatly her new relase looks like much of the same. I'll be skipping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Whispers....","review":"Judith McNaught has long been one of my favorite authors of romance, and I truly love her books. However, I must agree that the story does not seem to have had enough time to fully develop. Sloan's story is well-developed, however, Noah's history needs more exploration. Despite that, it was a wonderful wonderful read that I finished in one reading because I just could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would make a great movie!","review":"This is the first book I have read by Judith McNaught. And if this is not as good as her usual, than I am truly excited to read more! I found myself in complete suspense, practically to the end. Of course, I did not read any intro's to the book, therefore I was really in for a surprise! This read like an hour thriller-movie would play. Yes, the author leaves out a lot, ie: more details on Noah, and Paul and Paris. Even Sara and Jessup. But, I usually scim through excess details anyway. I chuckled a few times, held my breath during danger, and sighed with the mushy. A very, very fast and fun read! If you want all those extra details, do not read this book, you will be dissappointed. If you want a break from lengthy....it's a great filler upper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly dissapointed but still a good read","review":"I must agree with the other reviews. This book is not as good as she usually writes. Her characters are nor as well developed as Zack and Julie in PERFECT and matt and Merrideth in PARADISE. She needed to her characters more. Even though it wasn't up to her usual standard it is still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wasn't impressed. I expected somthing similar to the cover, but that is not what you get. A few of the chapters are ok but nothing spectacular. Most of the chapters are of rather ugly boring dark fish filmed in front of a artificial background, and the fluttering light from the filter pump above is somtimes distracting. I wanted a HD DVD to showcase my HD tv with, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor photography really spoils this","review":"This video was clearly filmed at a public aquarium during regular hours of operation. Frequently, viewers can readily see tourists' reflections in the tank glass, or tourists looking through windows on the other side of the tank.

However, the \\"remastered\\" tracks seem produced a little careless compared to the original recording. At least in the copy I got there are two rumbles in \\"Eyes Without A Face\\" - it sounds like somebody touched the vinyl-player during transmitting to cd. That's why I only give 4 stars for this special release.

From the Sinatra-like stylings of \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" to the funky duet with Boyz II Men on \\"Comin' Home Baby\\"; this cd is one delight after another. My personal favorite is \\"I've Got The World On A String\\" where Bublé and band swing it hard. The recording is a delight and rounds out any Bublé, Rat Pack or swing collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Irresponsible / Michael Buble","review":"I am a big fan and this CD is sloppy. The recordings sound unrehearsed and MB mumbles so badly in several that the only way I know what he's singing is because I already know the lyrics from previous recordings. This is his poorest CD and I am very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing music!","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. Michael Buble has a sound reminescent of Frank Sinatra with a blend of Harry Connick Jr but adds his own style to make the songs his own. I could've done without the lisping in \\"I've Got The World On A String\\". I don't know if he was trying to be cute but it didn't work for me. But over all this is a really good CD and well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Irresponsible","review":"I purchased \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" because I wanted the song \\"IT HAD BETTER BE TONIGHT\\" from the movie The Pink Panther. Michael Buble is probably the only young vocalist I am aware of that has the talent to sing these old standards and do them justice. Most of the songs on this CD, except for a few, are old classics and as with any classic, new interpretations give them new life. Great listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this album","review":"This album is awesome. I love every song on it. It is a little old school with a updated sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espectacular!!!","review":"Estoy haciendo mi colección de Michael Bublé y este disco me ha robado el aliento.

Lo recomeindo 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"My main girl loves this guy. So she was happy with the CD. Me, I prefer the original MAN (Sinatra)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little indulgent","review":"I am a musician and a Buble fan for sure, and appreciate the resurgence of my favorite kind of music. But this CD for me lacks the polish, the layers and the richness that I look for in truly exceptional recordings. It's good of course, because he's so talented. But I find him indulging himself a little bit too much. I want artists to be true to the composer and the essence of the music, not preoccupied with their own vocal ability, and that's the sense I got. Sure that lick or that phrase sounded nice, but is it the best you could come up with if you tried it a few different ways? Did it communicate that thought/feeling the best it could? He could use a few lessons with a diction coach as well. Ha! Miss Picky. Still, 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average CD","review":"I really enjoy Michael Buble's music alot, but this is by far his worst CD to date. I like maybe 3 songs and the rest is not really worth listening to.

Poorly recorded"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hear a lisp in his singing","review":"I enjoy MB when I have heard him on the radio, and I really enjoyed his singing \\"Call Me Irrespondible\\" when I saw him on American Idol. Therefore, I was so looking forward to buying this album. I purchased it and started to play it in my car immediately. However, what did I hear in the first line of the 1st song.....a terrible distracting lisp!!! It got worst thru' next few songs on the CD. I loved the \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" arrangement but that awful distracting lisp kept rearing its ugly head. Did I get a defective CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but funny lisp...","review":"Michael Buble is an INCREDIBLE singer. He has the pipes of a legend and he is still quite young. I am a performer myself, and I noticed that he has a bit of a funny lisp going on with his \\"TS\\" consonants. I wonder if that was a stylistic choice, or if he does in fact have a speech impediment. If anyone knows, please post back. Overall, the CD is EXCELLENT, and the single Everything is one of the most romantic and catchy tunes out there now.KEEP RECORDING MICHAEL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy listening of old favorites","review":"Michael Buble reminds me very much of Frank Sinatra.

I wish he would do more of his own stuff. Love the voice. Hated his version of \\"Always on my mind\\" though. Bores me and makes me want to fast-forward each time. Everything has got to be the best song I have heard in years though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Mediocre!","review":"\\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is, in the simplest terms, boring. The excitement and intensity seen on Michael Buble's previous albums, is completely absent here. Mr. Buble has taken that sharp edge that created \\"It's Time\\" and replaced it with muddled love sick slop. There are very few entertaining moments on this album and absolutely no surprises. While \\"That's Life\\" and \\"World On A String\\" are solid renditions they just aren't enough to save this truly mediocre album."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did again","review":"Michael said once that he wanted to change the world with his music and at that time i really did not believed that he could but i understand what he said!the first time i heard Michael i had 16 years old and i liked a lot his voice and style and especially his way to make the songs sound new and fresh!it's amazing that he's making young people like me listening this kind of music and not only the crap on the radioi love his own material, makes u wish that one day he will make a cd only with this kind of music\\"Everything\\" is probably one the best songs of the year and good as \\"Home\\"with Michael is only hit and no miss"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble-Tastic","review":"So of all Michaels albums...this is By FAR the best! It has all the best of older songs with a vibrant new twist with michaels voice. I dont know how most music survived before him...his talent and artist voice has carried tunes that go as far back as 1932. He brings a taste of the past with a brand new future. I freaked out when I watched the new movie \\"Evening\\" and all of a sudden heard the bouncy beat to 'I've got the world on a string' Its nice to hear a modern song in a period piece. This album is a most have for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again!","review":"Better than \\"It's Time\\", not quite as good as his first, I loved this CD and find myself singing along to the songs with more enthusiasm than the people in the cars next to me understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is better than I even thought","review":"Even though many of Michael's songs are oldies, his arrangements make them feel new again. I purchased this CD for the new songs he has but I have fallen for every single song on this CD. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Buble's \\"Call me Irresponsible\\"","review":"I am a rock music fan, but I thought I'd give this Michael Buble cd a chance. I enjoyed \\"Everything\\" and \\"Lost\\", two songs which were not covers. His cover of Eric Clapton's, \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" was not my cup of tea. If I could give Michael Buble a piece of advice, it would be for him to release of cd of his own original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call It Irresistible","review":"Mr. Bublé's latest record has once again proved to be another album full of quality and quantity. \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" is one of the best cuts from the album. Although his voice is stellar, some of the arrangements could have been rethought. \\"Dream\\" is an example of this, Nevertheless, Michael Bublé continues to be the one voice you never tire of. He also seems to be one of a select few on the music scene who have any real talent. It's also great to see an album and an artist produced in 2007 that does not have to lower itself to the level of filth and vugalarity. It's about time someone brought back some decent music. I heard him sing \\"This Guy's In Love With You\\" in concert once. I do hope there is the possibility of that song making it onto an album or single in the near future. A must for any fan of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Irresponsible","review":"Michael Buble' is amazing. He has personality, charisma and a stage presence like Sinatra. He takes each song and makes it his own. I first saw him on PBS and was amazed by him. He has talent which is rare today. This cd is great. Every song is artistically well done. I have all his music and I have seen him in concert. His show was superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Irresponsible","review":"It was a pleasure relaxing to the music of Call Me Irresponsible. My wife said buy it and I did, thinking that hopefully she would play it when I was not home. She played in the car when on a trip. I suggested that she play it again on the way home. I'm glad we bought the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd known","review":"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I assumed the album would include all 21 tracks from the Tour edition (as the amazon.ca site seems to indicate). It wasn't until I opened the album that I realized it only had 13. Unfortunately, the one track I wanted to get (Stuck in the Middle With You) is one of the eight that were left out. Now I'm stuck with the album, and it doesn't have the one track I wanted. Boo-urns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble is Fab","review":"This CD pales in comparison to his last CD. I was hoping for more of his own material but this isn't the CD - at least not yet. Otherwise, it's all Michael and if you're a fan, you'll still enjoy his sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks a lil punch, not as rythmic as previous albums but his voice is still one of the purests out there!","review":"I am a big Michael Buble fan and I honestly could not wait for this album to be released. Unfortunately, to me, this album isn't as good as the previous ones. I do not love jazz but Buble made me love it with his previous albums by giving songs a modern twist, and by using great musical arrangements and picking songs that are rythmic. This album is definitely more slow. It lacks a little punch, but at the same time, Michael Buble's voice is just so pure and crystaline that it still carries you miles away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Buble's best album yet","review":"The same wonderful Michael Buble - the best of old and new with a swing sensibility, and he sells a song as well as Old Blue Eyes ever did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble Scores Again!","review":"Had fun listening to this new release by singer Michael Buble. His versions of \\"The Best is Yet to Come\\" and \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" are a real treat...but the best in the lot in my opinion, is the seldom heard Mancini gem....\\"It Had Better Be Tonight.\\" Totally enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buble Magic","review":"Michael Buble's charm is that he can take a previously recorded song and make it his own. Combined with the tracks written by Michael and his interpretation of such classics like Me & Mrs Jones this is a very smooth production and highly enjoyable to listen to over and over or as many times as you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Releasing this CD was Irresponsible","review":"Okay Michael, your irresponsible, that was to easy and this CD is sooooo bad, nothing new here or to hear. Me and Misses Jones, oh plezzzz, It Had Better Be Tonight was better in A Shot in the Dark. Such a great singer singing trite, boring, and weird material."},{"rating":"1","title":"why not listen to the originals???","review":"What a weak remake of Billy Paul's classic \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" as well as the Sinatra and other covers.

Just thankful I've never had to purchase one of his CD's. Much prefer Harry Connick Jr and even at times, Sinatra over MB's voice. His so-called charm doesn't appear charmful to me. I've tried to enjoy his music, but I'm afraid with every CD friend has insisted I listen to, just makes me wonder why there seems to be no change in type of songs sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me Boring","review":"Stick to the originals, Everything I've heard of his is boring and bland. Try some REAL sinatra, or The REAL drifters, or the REAL Clapton. It seems that the only reason people buy this is because their friends do, not be cause they like music. Pop Standards covers are always boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Frank Sinatra","review":"Had a chance to listen to this CD by Michael Buble. Very disappointing . . . he is just a Sinatra imitator! He is NOT Frank Sinatra and never will be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this dude popular","review":"There are better singers that sing standards out there now that have a better voice then him. I guess middle age house wife's like it. I laugh at the people that call this jazz. Just becasue it has horns does not make it Jazz. Jazz is Billie Holiday, Miles Davis not some dude who sings old stardards just because he is too dam cheap to get songs that are more current to sing. Did you see him on American Idol a month ago he gave a very bad performance Sanjaya could have showed a thing or two.

The Speck band was bulky and the velcro was itchy. The white material got dirty pretty quick and the fabric did not breathe at all. Spend the extra money on the Nike arm band."},{"rating":"2","title":"If we could really learn from history it might start here","review":"Rather than a look at wars in themselves, this is a select history of the events leading up to four particular conflicts, and to one, the Cuban missle crisis, than did not result in direct aggression. The events leading to the disastrous Peloponesian War between Athens and Sparta, and the Second Punic War between Carthage and Rome are drawn from ancient history. The origins of 1st and 2nd World Wars serve as the modern counterpoint, as does, in a different fashion, the Cuban episdode during the Cold War.Kagan ultimately finds Thucydides' ancient and eloquent appraisal to be relevant to moderns. That the author elects to not rely on examples from other times or places does not really hamper the thesis. The broader message that Kagan develops concerns the inclinations of large states in relation to one another. That this remains a major feature of the geopolitical landscape makes this book (regretably) relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight into the Causes of War","review":"There are a lot of books that focus on battles in virtually all of the wars, but very few that actually focus on how wars came about. Usually, a book on the war spends a few pages discussing the origins in passing, then quickly moves on to the war itself. This book is very different, and focuses on how wars come about. The writing is terrific and the author's insights are very insightful. The sections of this book explaining the origins of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis are especially good. In addition to history readers, I would recommend this book to those looking for books on leadership and crisis management, because the author focuses on the decisions made by leaders on both sides of various conflicts and explains how those decisions, in light of the existing circumstances, led to an often unintended outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I'd gone to Yale","review":"I wish I went to Yale undergrad because this fine book is based on a course Kagan teaches in New Haven. I was amused by the previous review citing \\"ideological bias.\\" I suspect that's because the reviewer disagrees with Kagan's conclusions on the Cuban Missile Crisis...Do yourself a favor: If you (like me) were fed the \\"13 days\\" RFK/Schlesinger/McNamara/Sorensen version of the CMC in High School or College, please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideological Bias","review":"If current readers want some sense of how academic writing can serve the interests of those who have and want to hold onto power, they should read this book. They can take it as a fine example of how government and their intellectuals produce stories to support their own positions and find in them the words and language they need to justify and 'explain' their actions. Kagan's enormous attack on John Kennedy (nicely refuted in recent writings on JFK) aims to shatter the idea that there are other ways of dealing with power than those recommended by the chicken-hawklets in the Bush administration. Also, there are other things to say about Thucydides than those Kagan chooses as essential to understanding war and the preparation to 'deter' it. Surely readers notice how often Kagan offers accounts of 'pre-emptive' wars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I expected a book with underlined and highlighted pagesbut this one was much cleaner than what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I was interested in this book because I am Honduran. But I found that the author did not give an accurate picture of the country. She was completely unprepared to make the trip, didn't know any Spanish, and was constantly on edge. Her goal was to adopt a child and go back to the United States and live happily ever after. She wrote the book as if going to Honduras was a horror story, and her style of writing was painstakingly bad. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to visit Honduras or is interested in adopting a child from Honduras because you will get a really ignorant picture of how the country is. Don't waste your time or money on this book, it's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"Not sure why anyone would rate this book less than five stars just because its beyond their capability. I actually own the book and it is truly one of the best gunsmithing books in my library. Even if the project is beyond your capabilities, you will learn something by reading it. If nothing else, the author's cautions may prevent someone from attempting to build something that is unsafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly prophetic satire","review":"Written well before the recent pedophilia scandal rocked the Roman Catholic chirch in Amercia, Divine Lunacy satirizes a miserably horrendous subject, preistly pedophilia.Written in the same vein as \\"A Modest Proposal\\" by Jonathon Swift, Gallagher lashes out at the Catholic church's refusal to confront the horrendous truth, that openly homosexual and pedophilic preists operate freely under the protection of the Vatican. It's a bizzare story but underneath all the craziness there is a sense of purpose, to confront the evil that is sanctioned by the Catholic church.Don't read this book if you are easily offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This DVD is a waste of money, and after you watch it you'll wish you could get the time back too. I could have made a better version of this using the video camera on my cell phone and a few disney movie CDs.

I would reccommend instead, something written by a CPA or lawyer.

But it's actually fairly well-done and starts from a realistic premise.Sean Astin does a good job portraying the typical American father, bonding with the little girl that he and his wife have just adopted. Brendan Fehr is good as an ominous counterpoint, a dark figure intent on reclaiming the child that social services took from him.The film has some surprising plot elements. These no doubt take flight from the \\"true story\\" that this material is supposed to be based on. But that doesn't matter.

We play a few times a week.Start off with the basic game and then add the expansions once you get the hang of it. Our favorite expansion is definitely Barbarians and Traders. Once you're hooked on the card game, it's really hard to transition to the board game. I find the card game to be much more intricate and dynamic.If you're looking for a 2-player game, then LOOK NO FURTHER. Catan is simply the best game we've ever played. Nothing else comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I thought it was... I wouldn't recommend it unless you like 2 player games","review":"I thought this was going to make the card game 3-4 players, but it did not.

I am going to return this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"I found this CD in the bargain bin last week and bought in on the strength of Mic City Sons (a great CD) and my overall love of Elliot Smith. Unfortunately, this CD was a big let down. Nowhere are the haunting/catchy melodies or memorable lyrics so common in Smith's other work. The songs on the CD all sound alike, and like they come from the same one bad idea. If you haven't heard any Elliot Smith or Heatmiser, don't start here - my recommendation is to go pick-up \\"Figure 8\\" and work your way back through Smith's catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide on Craps","review":"I must give this guy a \\"5 STAR\\" review! This book is a tremendous insight to keeping the house advantage to a minimum. I intend to bring this book with me the next time i'm gambling so I am able to perfect his technique. The book is easy to read (I finished it on a lazy Sunday afternoon) and makes you excited to try out the strategies. It is my opinion that Mr. Favero should follow up this book with a sequel, if possible. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very appropiate for specific situations","review":"This book is very good if addressing a similar situation as the one described in it; a father getting divorced and moving in with his male lover. It is well written for young kids, and it could serve as a first eye opener. It does not have all the answers, and I think it was not intended to. There are other books that provide more in depth explanations, but this one serves its purpose very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the author thinking????","review":"Like my title said, WHAT WAS THIS AUTHOR THINKING??? I have no problem with gays and lesbians but teaching CHILDREN that it's okay to be like that, i have to disagree. I think it's completely wrong to have a book about this for children. You would have to absolutly insane to let a child read this. I'm sorry if i offend anyone with what im fixing to say. God made Adam and Eve, Adam being a man and Eve being a woman.

The story and illustrations are very stereotypical. The illustrations are low quality and simplistic. The story would be useful for young kids with gay parents, but not for introducing this topic to other students. I did like the description of being gay as \\"just another form of love,\\" but it still doesn't really touch the issue. And what's up with the guys sleeping together, is that necessary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just sent a copy to Wasilla Public Library","review":"Apparently they (she) didn't manage to ban this book, but it seems that activists are taking out the book on loan and defacing it.

The CD sweeps you off the ground with its smooth and bumpity rhythms. It's more vocal which makes it great for getting loose, hooking up, or just chillin out. The tracks are excellently mixed and songs like Found A Cure will definitely stick in your head. Women Beat Their Men and In Da Jungle are harder and more tribal...however everything has a finished more refined groove. Make no mistake about it, its no rave CD so if that's what you want check out something else, however the songs are very addicting and catchy and will surely get your \\"mojo\\" ready to party."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!!!","review":"This bedding set looks so nice in the picture, so I ordered the entire collection...When i opened the package i was so disappointed!

This book includes selections from the great symphonies, operas, piano concertos, and the best of the sonatas (my favorite being Rondo Alla Turca!). The pieces range from intermediate to really advanced. These piece's complexity (along with Easy Classics for Moderns by Denes Agay) will surely heighten any pianist's skills at the keyboard. The best of the classical era is presented in this introductory book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Feature Packed","review":"The Panasonic TG5777BP is a great value and packed with features. This phone has features normally found in expensive cell phones; color LCD display, speaker phone, custom ring-tones and wallpaper, phonebook, vocal caller ID, voice-mail notification... just to name a few. The phones are well designed and don't have that cheap look and feel that is all to common with today's electronics. This product is one of the best values I've found recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicious waste of money","review":"I should earn an award for having the tenacity to finish this book. The thing is full of cliches and at times loses its focus in a most painful way. The only redeeming moments come when Christy, the main character, piles on the self-deprecating humor, which is just enough to get you to turn the pages.But Hampton-Jones takes the characters too far to the extreme. The mother is too evangelistic and the father is too aloof and too much a loser. It is rare that I hate every character in a story but apparently there is a first for everything. This story could have been captivating. The truth is it is crushed by plain bad writing. It's that simple.I am actually going to try and return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame the editor","review":"I was temporarily drawn in by the plot - despite the cheesy cover. After a few pages I felt I could go the distance with Vicious Spring. But ultimately I just couldn't handle the lack of substance. One of two things happened here, either the author has no idea how to write and develop characters and theme, or the book was over-edited. From some passages that set the reader up to go further only to quickly dump you, I'm assuming the editor got carried away. The book, at 180 pages or so, seems light from the start and is confirmed by the time you reach the end - IF you reach the end. I did and boy am I sorry. Just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't accomplish what it wishes it could","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is supposed to be a look at the sex industry in Nashville, but fails to create interesting characters or situations and falls for cliche after cliche. If we cared about the protaganist the story might mean something, but since we don't, the story ends up being hollow and shallow. Save yourself the effort and don't read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Machine Runs Out of Gas","review":"This movie is neither unique or good. In fact, what makes this flick so memorable is the lovely and sexed-up Joan Van Ark. Van Ark plays a radio psychologist whose parents were murdered when she was a young child. Now it seems the killer is after her. In order to protect herself and her young daughter, Van Ark turns to a cop, and the two have one of the steamiest love scenes in recent memory. Credit the director Nathanial Gutman for not sullying the scene with corny music . Instead, the scene is silent, with the exception of panting and moaning (Van Ark even grits her teeth at one point! ) This scene does make the movie wothwhile, but the hackneyed ending- complete with a did-you-see-it-coming? would-be plot twist, destroys all credibility whatsoever. Kudos to Van Ark, though. Forget Pam or Carmen or Jenny- for two hours, she's the sexiest woman on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Darkman Calls","review":"Joan Van Ark stars as radio psychologist, Julie Kaiser (originally Jean Kaiser in the novel), whose parents were killed when she was but ten years old. Now, the man she got put away because she believed he did it, is out after 25 years, and is now after her. However, Julie is beginning to believe that she may have accused the wrong man, and that the \\"right man,\\" if you will, is after her now!I think that this film has got some great cinematography, good performances from Joan Van Ark, and a few scary moments. The music score is very cool. I just found something was missing from this movie. I haven't read the book, but I soon will. I do like this movie, even though alot of people don't. It just has a certain quality I like. An above-average TV thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Joan","review":"I love Joan Van Ark as I love all of the former Knots Landing ladies, but this film was really awful and unworthy of her talents. The story becomes increasingly implausible as it progresses to its stupid finale. I hate suspense films that revolve around female protagonists being stupid, and this sadly is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Addition to My Library","review":"I read a lot of books, and as a result I'm forced to try new authors. Many are disappointing, but Lee Charles Kelley is a wonderful find. The characters are vibrant, the dog facts enlightening, and the mysteries entertaining. I can't get enough of this delightful series."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amusement park, front to cover","review":"Nice pacing, memorable characters. Kelley creates a real world of mystery, excitement, and humor. That's good and clever writing defined. Introducing the world of dogs and dog training refreshes the mystery novel in an absorbing way. Kelley knows writing and Kelley knows dogs. He's brought the two together here very successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read the book, but","review":"This is to balance out the 5 star rating that the author gives his own book. Has he gotten his relatives to give it 5 stars, too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging Story, Annoying Primary Character","review":"Like other reviewers, I thought the dog training tips were interesting...but thought there were just too many inserted at times that didn't really further the plot.The main character, Jack Field, was a bit too annoying for me to give the book more than two stars. Just my opinion, but he seemed too smug and too clever for his own good. He had an answer for everything, and there seemed to be no limit to his abilities. Frankly, it was difficult to relate to or care about the character.Hopefully later installments in the series will have toned that smug perfection down a bit. I am truly on the fence (bad dog!) about whether to try any other books, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hormonal","review":"I enjoyed the dog training angle, even though I'm not sure I agree with his theories. I just find it hard to believe they would work in the real world with real dogs.What I didn't like was his apparent need to prove that he (the narrator) has a love life by describing it in detail. Maybe he thought it helped to create the tough-guy detective persona. To me it just came across as adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send to the Goodwill or Trash?","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I have read and wasted money on in a long time. I found the story to be dull and juvenile in it's writing style.I find it hard to believe that this person claims to be a dog trainer.Now, my quandary is should it go to the Goodwill or the trash? I think the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Wise","review":"Emily's transitions from reality to dreams are an art form. I enjoyed her delightful sense of humor and her idealism coupled with a practical streak (e.g., a good night's sleep is more important than most of her dreams). She is funny and down to earth. This book contains a lot of wisdom. It's because I'm still an idealist that Emily's book speaks to me. I am also impressed with her views about marriage. Her book is very clever, very intelligent; one can almost imagine what the author is like . . . Her frankness and sensitivity are unusual . . . I treasure Emily's book. (Comments by Frances G.

IF you like the country blues this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful piece of history","review":"The original Skip James recordings from 1930 are simply among the great recordings of all time...scratchy sound and all. To criticize this collection because it doesn't compare to the earlier recordings is just wrong. Nothing compares to the originals but these are a must have for fans. Let's just say that you should own both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic swan song of a has-been Bluesman","review":"Don't be fooled by the reviews of Skip James' later work - it is but a terrible and pale imitation of his 1931 78's, and even those, while some are outstanding, contain a share of duds. His 60's recordings are universally mediocre-to-awful; though this collection has the best of a bad lot, it's still not worth having. His guitar playing is languid and sloppy, and for the piano pieces, forget it. It's a sad rip-off by a sleazy label, cashing in on an inflated reputation.

They told MTV to f*** off a long time ago. And I have never heard bottles to the ground on the radio, either. Also, if you read the inside of Pump Up The Valuum, there's a long message from Fat Mike that says that the band hasn't sold out. Anyway, as for the CD, you should get it if you're a NOFX fan. They're one of my favorite punk groups. The song lower is awesome, and it's worth the $6. As for My Name Is Bud, it's OK, it's not the greatest song I've ever heard, but it's OK. It's only 1:30 long. I won't review Bottles to the Ground or Dinosaurs Will Die, since both songs are on Pump Up The Valuum, and I like both of those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOFX are not sell outs","review":"i think that this is not to show NOFX went sell out. read the inside cover of pump up the valuum and you can see that there message is that they hate all the pulicity. i think that they were just trying to show more people that they are good with these four great songs. fat mike always says that he hates publicity and thats why he doesnt do interveiws, radio, or tv stuff. no doubt this is a great single"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the cd where nofx finally admits they are sell outs","review":"This is the sell-out cd single of all time.

Project Starwars was shut down because the Geneva Convention made it illegal to weaponize space. It was never officially tested. Look it up, it's declassified.4. Blowing up a Nuclear reactor does not create a nuclear explosion. There is not enough U235 isotope to react with an explosive. Nuclear bomb=100% U235, Nuclear Reactor 2% U235.

Most athlete diet books break down nutritional suggestions by sport. I compete in Muay Thai Boxing so I was really turned off by the constant references to endurance athlete. So be aware, this book is really aimed towards endurance sports.Also the fact that it's not a true Paleo diet. There are recommendations to include sports drinks/gel, rice or potatoes for its glucose content which will aid recovery after training. As far as I know some tubers & grains are highly debated among Paleo dieters because of newly found research. But that's a whole other issue. There are also recommendations for whey protein (which is a byproduct of cheese) but Loren does suggest egg white protein as a substitute.Here's what I found usefu out of this book.+ Some good info on nutrition timing.

The show hooked me on the first episode and I fell in love with it. Long story short, highschool detevtive Kudo Shinichi or Jimmy Kudo turns into a seven year-old again by two men in black after witnessing a drug deal. He then takes on the name of Conan Edogawa and solves cases through Mouri Kogoro or Richard Moore.***The story line is a good one and the voice actors did a good job with the dub. However, if you're not thrilled with the dub, there's always the japanese dub with the english subtitles. Hopefully Funimation will dub more in the future. Like in the next two or three years. You can also pick up the other four seasons and 6 movies that have been released so far.After all, it's as Conan says in the anime,\\"Only one truth prevails!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Anime.","review":"I absolutely love this show.

Cannonball Adderly, although a marvelous alto jazz musician was a young boy when the song was written by Johnny Green and Eddie Heyman, (Johnny Green who also wrote \\"Body and Soul.\\") The song, written in 1933 was recorded that year alone by the likes of Annette Hanshaw, Connie Boswell and Louis Armstrong, A year or two later the Ink Sports had a rather large hit on \\"I Cover the Waterfront.\\" Most jazz artiest of the thirties through the eighties also offered takes on this classic, standard of The Great American Song Book.As for Mr. Miller's books, I remember growing up in San Diego in the fifties and that my father loved the books and must surely have read them all.

The 16 books on it are almost all always by celebrities, about celebrities, people or events in today's headlines, books that come and go in a flash. Books like Gardening in Eden by Arthur Vanderbilt will never make it onto the List. They don't stand a chance. And that's a shame, for in this small book I got for Christmas (its just 189 pages long) is so much quiet wisdom, such humor, such lyrical beauty and fine writing that I wish more people knew about it. In the simple setting of a garden the author finds the world and shares that exuberant joy on every page. I would highly recommend this book. My guess is that when today's current crop of bestsellers are forgotten, Gardening in Eden will still be a perennial classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem of a Book for the Gardener in Everyone!","review":"As an amateur gardener myself, Mr. Vanderbilt's book hit home with me. From going to the local nursery to the smell of freshly mowed grass to the lonliness of winter this book expresses the multitude of emotions gardeners experience throughout the year. A very delightful book! This is one book that will be reread by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated writing and an unsatisfying book","review":"This book was somewhat interesting, but it was too full of fluff for my taste, and I felt about 20 years too young to connect with the author's point of view. His observations meandered through his (very dated) memories of gardens past, with no conclusions drawn, no linkages to culture, no gardening advice, and so on. While some of the stories were amusing enough, it left me unsatisfied, like eating cotton candy when you are really hungry: a sweet taste but no substance. Unfortunately I can't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Index","review":"If you are using this book for study or research, the lack of an index makes a quick find difficult. Unless you are going to read the book cover to cover (more power to you) you may miss key points you are looking for.The book is a compilation of essays so the content can be found almost anywhere in one form or another.

Windows problem not Hauppauge. The computer is used when we travel in our RV. On a recent trip I programmed the local cable channels and it took the guesswork out of finding the programs I wanted to watch. It made the computer into a additional TV and VCR as well. I have bought several Hauppauge products and this is the hi quality I expected from them. The only negative is that it doesn't include digital channels. I had to buy a HVR 950 for the HDTV channels.

You need to go through some simple steps in Media Center to get your local guide. Even after going through all the steps some channels were mysteriously missing, but can be easily added manually.My one complaint and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of it's tendency to lock up. When this happens the tuner shows up as an unkown USB device and Media Center says there are no tuners installed. The only remedy is to cycle the power on the tuner. After that all is well, but it is an annoying step nonetheless.When it happens it is always when the laptop is coming out of sleep mode.

I did not know that these came in different sizes. These were much smaller then the size in my local store so they were not as good of a deal as expected. Of course I should have looked closer at the size, the packing looked the same, so it is harder to tell then on something like a box of cereal. I love apricots. I was excited to try this flavor. It was not as fruity when I first ate it and the after tatse was kind of soapy. I have enjoyed the strawberry amd rasberry flavors so Im not sure it is just a bad batch.

There is not much else that I can say except for if you like Antony Santos' bachata this album is another nice one for your \\"bachatu collection\\". I tend to focus on the bachatas only and rest assured they are all terrific. The only downfall of the cd is the sound quality. The recording sound seems unusually low.

However, I found it boring and predictable and far too long. While a noble tale, I felt as far as entertainment goes, it was lacking. Roberts was her usual loud, obnoxious self, even though I found her acting better than usual. This film could have been engaging if it weren't for so many needless scenes which shamelessly detailed and emphasized Brockovich's struggles to maintain the family, the bills, the boyfriend, and the job (why did we need to watch her over and over again rooting thru the files at the water plant?).

I would watch this movie over and over again if there were enough hours in the day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and Amazing","review":"Erin Brockovich (R)- You can ask anyone around me and they will tell you that I am not a Julia Roberts fan. I don't vehemently hate her but she has to work hard for me to enjoy her. Well in this movie she works hard and pulls out the best performance of her career. This film is a milestone for many reasons. Hiring Indy favourite Stephen Soderburgh to film what easily could have been a Lifetime (television for woman) weepie gave this script the spark it needed to make a huge and likable hit. The look is independent, the script is Hollywood and the result is a feminist fairy tale that flies high enough to lift the spirits and low enough for guys to laugh too. Hiring the perennially British Albert Finney as a down home American Lawyer seemed like disaster but ended up as perfection. When people say they don't make movies like they used to, they probably haven't seen this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"less enjoyable than could be","review":"Erin Brocovich made me cry i'll addmit it. But There was so much language and revieling clothing it made it less enjoyable then could be. Wile it presented talented acting and some good morals on the whole it was about a woman who used her body (cleavage mostley) to get were she got in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleavage and A Story Line: What more could you want?","review":"When i first saw this movie i went into the cinema with the word chick flick resting on my frontal lobe. I expected a pathetic excuse for Julia Roberts to cry but ended up with a good movie. The movie has the David and Goliath theme to it with Roberts battling the big bad company, while managing to show an impressive amount of cleavage while doing so. Add some funny one liners and good acting all around and you get a movie that you dont mind having your girl friend drag you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"Erin Brockovich is an amazing person. She has the confidence to wear what she wants and say what she wants without caring what anyone else thinks. She never lets anyone push her around but cares a lot for people. So when she gets a job at a law office and finds something suspecious happening with a major company. She pounces on the case. When she finds out that PG&E is causing people cancer and even death she's willing to put her whole life on hold to stop it. But will she survive.THis was an amazing movie about a strong woman who dosen't let just anyone push her around. I liked a Civil action and I think this was even better. I would really like to meet the real Erin Brockovich, I consider her to be a real positive role model (minus the swearing of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!","review":"Based on a true story of Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three who was barely making it by when she got into a car accident and then starting working for her lawyer.

Julia captivates the audience by portraying the insatiable human spirit of Erin Brockovich. She proved that regardless of skill, with enough determination and drive that anyone can make a difference.Albert Finney (last seen in Delivering Milo and Breakfast of Champions) plays an excellent role of Attorney Ed Masry. Finney should win an award for best supporting Actor of the year for his work in this film.Erin Brockovich is a true, rags to riches story, that is powerful and moving. Julia will have you compelled to see what happens next.Bottomline... this movie is one of Julia Roberts' best movies to date, and well worth a purchase. Buy this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Erin Brockovich is a slow, boring, and contrived film. Julia Roberts didn't deserved that Best Actress Oscar, that honor should've been given to Ellen Burstyn for Requiem for a Dream.

Pretty Woman was good as was Pelican Brief.Erin Brockovich is something else. I had read the good reviews of it beforehand so I took the chance of going to see it and I was surprised to see that the reviewers were right.This is Julia Roberts best role to date. She widened her acting range in this film and displayed a multitude of emotions. The fact that she had her cleavage on display for most of the film was only a distraction for the first 40 minutes or so. As the story developed I began to watch her character, not her breasts.I have ordered the DVD and will be interested to see a little background to the real life story and how the film was brought to the screen.I will now pay more attention to any film with Julia Roberts any it just as long as she keeps up this standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie-Must see!","review":"Everyone must see this movie!

Keep in mind Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors (\\"The Limey\\" is destined to be a classic, I believe) and yes, the film is well shot and edited, but I find the subject matter... well, boring and predictable. I'm told by female friends that Erin is a \\"hero\\" to them. Hm? Single mom dresses and talks like a prostitute, has an uncontrollable temper, and takes everything personally, and wonders why people won't give her a break. Ok.... Single mom can't pay the phone bills but seems to have an endless supply of cash for spiked-heeled shoes. Am I leaving anything out? Oh, right: Once the class action suit is in place, the participants are more comfortable with her than the trained lawyers. Very nice, people skills are important in the legal profession.

I mean, i'm not really sure how documentaries work, but why did they decided to make a documentary about JULIA ROBERTS? they couldn't have known what she was going to discover. anyway, i'm really really glad that they did because it was really amazing and touching.

Yes, that she did, albiet poorly. I am a Julia Roberts fan, However if you want to see her shine buy Notting Hill, if you want dramatics see \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\". This movie offers nothing more than a few profanity laced diatribes, Roberts in clothes that are so tight you almost wonder if the director is poking fun at the real woman being portrayed. She has no chemistry whatever with her biker boyfriend, her best chemical reactions are with Mr.Finney, a man several decades her senior. That chemistry is what offers a thread of saving grace, as Mr.Finney and Ms.Roberts are wonderful together.

The more I followed it, the more intrigued I was with the workings of the big unethical corporation. What I did not care for was Julia Roberts as Erin Brokovich. Was Ms Brokovich really that much of a b****? I felt no compassion for her. But then, I guess Erin Brokovich doesn't want anyone's compassion. I'm the first to admit that I'm jealous of Julia Roberts' success as an actress. But when she plays aggressive, obnoxious characters and then gets Oscars, magazine covers with that big, grinning face, and praise as a result, I get irritated. I look forward to the next embarrassing National Inquirer cover with her on it. She has almost as much attitude as Shaft."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"This movie was the best of the five nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. It has everything you want in a film. It stays with you long after you've seen it the first time, and it holds up after repeated watching. Julia is superb!

Have you got more stars I can give it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...","review":"Erin Brockovich was not one of Julia Roberts best movies. She does better in emotional and more romantic movies.

Other than that, it's lightweight and predictable, sort of a feel-good alternative to SILKWOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you all lost your minds?","review":"Nothing against Ms Roberts, even if she does despise a political party that represents the views of half of all Americans. But this film was boring, didactic, pretentious, condescending, long winded, predictable, cartoonish and stereotyped. Name one character, just one, that you haven't seen in another movie. Sheesh. Let Ms Roberts win an Oscar for something good, like Notting Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"Hello all- This movie is well worth the investment. By no means is it one of those movies you watch over and over again in a short period of time. It is however, a fun movie to watch when there is nothing else on tv. The middle part of the movie does get a little slow, but overall it is a good movie. Julia Roberts does a great job in this film and she has a strong attitude as well as passion from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"energizing...","review":"This video is a classic, and worth reviewing to note the methodology by which Erin Brockovich took on the struggles of a town to legally challenge PG&E;'s dumping of hexavalent chromium into the water supply. The exposure of PG&E;'s attempts to buy off the innocent victims who were dying of all kinds of various chronic lethal diseases provides a compelling view of the dark side of human nature. This slice of California history serves as a universal eternal morality tale. The story of Erin, compassionate leader of the victims, is truly inspirational and empowering for anyone cowed by corporations, the system, or any of life's challenging situations.Please note: the audio does not quite turn up to high volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"What More Can You Say","review":"An absolutely brilliant movie. Julia is definitely the hottest star in Hollywood and this movie really shows all her acting skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!","review":"I intially had high hopes for this movie even though i hate Julie Roberts. The movie starts off nicely for the first 25 minutes as it establishes its trash talking heroine. Then it goes way down hill into boredom. The direction is great of course but that cant always save a bad movie with a bad actress. The fact that she won an Oscar has almost destroyed my faith in the academy. Any other of the nominees did better then she did. I cant believe Sodeberg actually wanted to do this movie. I think he did it just to have a hit so he can do more independent projects. BUt i forgive him for this as he earlier did \\"The Limey\\" and redeemed himself by doing Traffic in the fall of that year. Julia should stick to Romantic Comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Julia Roberts does a knock out performance in this movie as real life Erin Brokovich.

Kept my interest and was very compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"High heel crusader","review":"Julia gives a 5 star performance as earthy Erin Brockovich, a woman committed to improving her life and those of her local community against the corruption of big business. It's a familiar theme but well handled by director Steven Soderberg, underplaying the obvious self- consciousness of Julia's transition from glamour queen to dramatic actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOPS SHE DID IT AGAIN","review":"I've been a fan of Julia's for as long as she has been making movies. She has truly grown up and is definitely one the hottest hollywood actresses of all time.In this movie she starts out looking for work, with no luck. Of course her woodrobe left a little to be desired (after all she was basing her roll on a true story). Then the accident, the lawyer promises she'll win (sound familiar?) but doesn't. She really fights to get any type of work, and forces her lawyer (the same one who promised she'd win) to give her job. If I tell much more about this movie you wouldn't want to see it because I have spoiled the ending.This is a definite must see movie. This is definitely an Oscar worthy performance for Julia and I look forward to her at the Oscar's as a nominee.I look forward to her next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and decent but it's missing something...","review":"I liked Erin Brockovich. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney gave excellent performances and Steven Soderbough did a terrific job directing. the script was excellent. i just don't know what it was about the movie. there's something missing to it. it's the something in a script that makes a best picture winner-a best picture winner. if u read some of the other reviews you will see the same thing. As for the film itself? It was enjoyable. Julia Roberts will be walking home with an academy award NOMINATION for her dazzling performance as Erin Brockovich, the bad mouthed and trashy clothed mom who desperately goes for a job at a law firm. while there she seeks information on a case involving water contamination. Which soon leads to a series of events until the verdict finally comes in... for the parents: Rated: R for language and sex-related dialogue (appropriate ages 12-13 and up)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Value of an Academy Award...Sell Now!","review":"I didn't have much of an opinion after watching this movie. It followed a cookie cutter formula of good v. bad and of good going through tough times but triumphing....that is until Roberts got the Academy Award.I've developed an unsophisticated,unscientific and frankly childish opinion: This movie ... Again, I am rating this against the background of extradinorary elite recipients of oscars. Giving Roberts a best actress award is akin to a booger on your Picasso.Perhaps its just been a long winter here, and I'm in a mean mood.

Let's face it, she is a hack actress. But she is a \\"star\\" and she puts butts in the seats. Only 30 plus women admire her and buy tickets. Let's see, an Oscar for being another one of her usual on screen loud bombastic characters? Given that her character was one of today's PCims's most popular--the struggling single mother, I can see why she won. That isn't merit!More disappointing was the brilliant director Steven Soderbrugh. What cinematic genius when he made stuff like \\"Kafka\\" \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\\" to name a few. I am a fan. But now he has become a Hollywood sell out.

Starting the disc off with \\"O Holy Night\\" was a perfect beginning to the light jazz voyage through Christmas with the Diva herself.She glides through the more traditional songs almost precisely. Only drifting off the melody path to engrage her individuality in the songs, therefore making them hers.Along with the previously mentioned song, you can find traditionals such as; Away in a Manger, Joy to the World, and many others. I would definitely recommend this for anyone trying to create a family sentiment at Christmas time.

Margaret returns to her family home to escape a failing marriage and emptiness after her daughter's death. However, instead of a haven, she finds that she must come face to face with her sister's mysterious death twenty-five years before. Her estranged family of aunts, uncles, and cousins all seem to be keeping secrets from her, as do the retarded man and his crazy mother who live next door. On top of this, Margaret also comes across a one-hundred-year-old legend that includes a curse on her house and a ghost who walks the beach at night. Before Margaret can find her peace, she must find her answers. Did her sister die accidentally, as she had been lead to believe? Is her house cursed? Who has been watching her and why? Did God desert her when her daughter died? Hall is excellent at writing multilayered mysteries, and Margaret's Peace is no exception. I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Secular For Me","review":"I started reading books by this author as an alternative to secular fiction. This is the fourth I've read and I've decided against reading any more (I'm a little slow). While Hall's writing style is interesting and easy to read, I was disappointed to find incest, murder, premarital sex etc. in Christian literature. There was mention of church and some characters grappled with spiritual issues, but these themes were minor in my opinion. Perhaps I need to leave the mystery genre to find more wholesome topics.Other Linda Hall books I've read: Sadie's Song, Katheryn's Secret, Island of Refuge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold my Craftsman wrench well at all.","review":"The wrenches do not fit tight enough to carry them around easily.

It was a very sad story all the way around and I think that's the part that haunts me. However, that said, I would recommend reading this. The story pulled me in and made me want to keep picking up the book to see what happens next. You're never sure what's going to happen next and that's what makes you want to keep reading. The biggest thing I took away from this book is to always seek God's wisdom and not to rely on my own understanding of things. I think that's a clear message from this book.I highly recommend this book. It's a great read for these winter days when you're inside snuggled inside and want to curl up with a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I received this book for the value fiction blog tour from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers. The premise of this book sounded very interesting. It seemed like a story that I had never heard before, and that the journey would keep me reading. Unfortunately, this book just wasn't for me. I did my best, gave it my 100 page try, but I couldn't make it through this book.The writing is very, very detailed. We read almost every thought and feeling the characters have, and everything they're doing at any given moment. I know there are a lot of readers that enjoy this type of writing, but I have a hard time getting into stories like this.It may be that I just wasn't in the mood for this one at this time. I have a feeling that regular readers of Christian romance would love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this","review":"This was (for some reason) in the mystery section of my library so I did not realize it was a bible-thumping romantic novel. I can't recommend anything about this book -- it was boring at times, parts don't make sense (what is the larger purpose of relaying the spanking argument?), and the protagonist is apparently always in tears. The book was a waste of time, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Read -- Not Recommended","review":"I feel as if I've been clubbed over the head by the author of this book. She had a spiritual message she wanted to convey. Rather than working it gently into my heart, she's driven it in like a stake. I don't recommend the experience.Please don't read this book if you like happy endings. There isn't one. Don't read it if you have a tender heart because it will surely break. Don't read it if you hate injustice.If, on the other hand, you love in your face gritty reality, you'll love this book. If you'd enjoy reading a fictionalized version of much that goes on in our world these days - heartbreak, tragedy, loneliness, pain, deceit - you'll enjoy the book. If you like your spiritual message plastered on so thickly you can barely breathe, get the book shipped immediately.As for me ... never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiveness and Hope","review":"The book illustrates very well how situations that seem to have no possible solutions can be resolved through a loving and just God. It shows that God can work even when we don't trust Him and go on our own path.

Yes I know the history and know all about Savoy Brown etc. I had Energized, Rock and ROll Outlaws, Night Shift, Fool for The City, Live, Boogie Motel and loved all the radio hits. BUT, this cd was just so so. It was dark, too dark, the 1 or 2 cameras were far away, and whats up with that huge fat guitarist? Jeeez, I have a problem with that too. I need to have a great light show for a live concert. I really didnt hear any \\"Jams,\\" it was just the songs but with a live crowd. Why didnt they work the crowd? It seemed like they were tired and just wanted to finish the set. I was extremely upset because I know it could have been better. Well, at least the Joe Satriani Live from San Fran was %100 pure 'My Style.' Sorry Foghat but this dvd could have been better.

He illustrates these with example code in Java. A choice of language. Standard Java comes with classes like HashSet, Hashtable, Vector, List etc that implement these structures. It saves the reader from having to write those from scratch.From the book, you should get an appreciation of how to use the structures in your code. Plus maybe a bias towards using Java, since it comes with these very convenient classes. Unlike lower level languages like C or Basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing look into the past","review":"John Digweed has been playing electronic music for years. Over time, he's weathered the changes that have come about for electronic music. This collection is a small taste of what he considers his favorites. These aren't just tracks he's played, but tracks that have influenced him and his style over his long career. To call this album trash, or say it's not worth the money is not only ignorant, it's flat out wrong. This album is worth every penny for those that truly care about electronic music.The variety of stlyes and sounds on this album is great. Everything from recent songs he's played to a few songs from the early 1980's. Although this album is basically a compilation of songs and not a mix, he does make an attempt at mixing a few transitions. The result isn't what you would normally expect from someone as well known as he is for flawlessly mixing tracks, but it's understandable given the songs he's selected.If you're a true EDM fan, this album is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"This review is intended for those who prefer theirhouse/tribal/trance music to be vocal-free.What makes many of Digweed's CD's fantastic are thesignificant number of dark tracks which are vocal-free,especially on the Global Underground CD's \\"Hong Kong\\" and\\"Los Angeles.\\"So if you're considering buying this \\"Choice\\" package, youhave to ask yourself: Are there enough vocal-free tracksto justify buying this?The answer is a resounding NO.

It's a lot more faithful to the book than the Greer Garson Hollywood version, and I also found it superior to the late 70's PBS production (although the PBS version had better casting in certain roles --- their Jane and Elizabeth were more attractive, I thought). Still, this latest production was excellent, worth watching repeatedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed! A truly wonderful movie!","review":"This version of P&P is the best adaption of any book to a movie.

Instead of butchering the novel as many tv series have done, A & E remains faithful to the plot and writing, and the result is ready wit and dialogue that entertains and stimulates the mind. I have seen this movie multiple times and have yet to tire of it. The characters are superbly portrayed, and the male and female leads, including Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, lend a brilliance and energy to the screen that reaffirms our faith in true love and the union of minds as well as bodies in marriage. This movie is a beautifully done interpretation of a novel that wins on both the literary and film levels. When reading the book, the movie set makes a wonderful, insightful companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A&E Collector's Set","review":"This DVD set was excellent.

I'm not sure how faithful it was to the author's intent. The story has a good pace and the cast does a fine job. I watched this after seeing the newer movie version and the only real difference seems to be budget. The scenes are the same (basically) and Knightly copies the actress in this version as much as possible. This is a better version for people who want a bit more length and plot.The tension between the two leads is drawn out so much more in this version.

Highy recommend to any serious Jane Austin fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly done, over acted and longer isn't better","review":"This production was truly not worthy of the BBC, the whole story was obviously dumbed down for the consumption of the masses, because you know they won't take it straight, but isn't that the whole idea. People cannot truly grow when given sugary sweet versions like this, People need meat, something to chew upon and perhaps get stuck in their teeth. Even the lean Hollywood version was meatier, this version was just long and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaving Bosoms","review":"Worst production of Pride and Prejudice ever. The screenplay was obviously written by a man, and one who did not comprehend the source material. Sexed up for American TV, it loses all the charm of the manners and morals play of the novel. Almost a pastiche, all the characters are caricatures. Eahles face pulling and continuous eyebrow raising are a distraction from the story as well as her overblown sighing and bosom heaving. Don't bother with this version of the movie. Reread the novel or go for the '70s version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actors all wrong","review":"Jennifer Ehle is too fat.

People these days walk on eggshells to avoid offending blacks and gays and Jews and femminists who will have a tempoer tantrum over even accidental offenses against them, but they think nothing of offending God by misusing his name. The use of Blasphemy in this movie is anachronistic, and even if the people making this movie don't believe in God, they don't seem to care that they are offending the people who do believe in God with that kind of language. I bought it because 19th century life was clean, and I am deeply dissapointed because it is another example of what i call \\"Cafeteria Bigotry,\\" whereby one preaches tolerance and respect for other's opinion, while in actuality they are hypocritically selecting which groups they mind offending, and which groups they don't mind offending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"Every scene captured as I had imagine when reading this book.All actors perfectly portray all heros from the book.Beautiful english scenery.

I liked this one.Jacque"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five-star adaptation with two-star audio","review":"I agree that this is an outstanding adaptation that you will someday want to own and watch repeatedly, but maybe not in its current transfer to DVD, for the audio mix is topsy turvy. Which is to say, the background music is mixed up too high in some of the scenes (especially at the balls), making the dialogue a little bit hard to understand for those of us who may have attended one too many Rolling Stones concerts.The bad mix wouldn't be an issue except that there are no subtitles provided with this edition. I'm surprised to discover that A&E and the English media companies aren't sensible enough to routinely supply subtitles for their cache of chickflic gems (Brideshead Revisited doesn't have them either) so that those of us in the Estados Unidos can make sense of that special brand of the King's English spoken on the emerald isle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austen's Greatest! This is the best!","review":"I first saw this about 2 and 1/2 years ago and I was hooked, as well as the rest of my family. The casting and the setting and the music are the strongest points. Allison Steadman was incredibly magnificent as Mrs Bennet. She stole the show for me. I laughed through this whole movie. I just got the soundtrack and if you don't have it, get that, too. I'm sad that the added scenes (ex. Jane and Lizzy's bedroom conversations) weren't in the book. Jane Austen would be thrilled with this. This is my favorite movie ever. All the characters were acted magnificently. Charaterization with the actors was perfect. It does not get any better. See the Kate Beckinsale version of Emma and the Emma Thompson Sense and Sensibility. You'll love those, too. -Christiane"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate lovestory","review":"About 30 years ago I watched Pride and Prejudice - on black and white TV - and afterwards I got hold of the book - and the Darcy of the film was very alive in my mind.

The chemistry between Lizzie, Darcy, Jane, and Bingley was rather dull and unbelievable.The casting was off: Jane and Lizzie were too mature...I found Darcy absolutely unapproachable...Mrs. Bennet was odiously played...Mr. Bennet lacked that sarcastic wit and timing.

I watched it in 1996 and I don't recommend it the anyone. I am and was and will only in love with the BBC 1980 Edition starring Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. They are the best because they really look like \\"Elizabeth & Mr Darcy\\". The 1995 Edition produced a dark scene for everyone and only \\"Charlotte\\" was given the right pick. There is no else perform best than the 1980 Edition. I can't believe people who like the 1995 rather than the 1980s' will have their sense on reading the Jane Austen Best Novel very well. If you read it through and carefully watch the 1980 \\"Pride and Prejudices\\", you will understanding why I've been in love with this Edition.

If you have read the book, perhaps more than once as I have, then you will love this version because this film captures the characters, the rules of society, the style of living, as they were described in the book. There are a few minor liberties but they add to the story. The acting was superb. The characters in the book lived in a very polite, very reserved society and these actors were able to convey so much with a glance, a gesture, a stiffening of the shoulders. I will admit that I was already a fan but never more so than after viewing the new, and dreadful version. If you are going to buy a DVD of Pride and Prejudice this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with DVD","review":"It's a beautiful miniseries.

So, when I saw it on A&E as a remastered DVD edition, I decided to buy it from Amazon.And I love this movie! I have only had it for a little over a week and have watched it twice already! The dialogue, the actors, the costumes, the settings, everything is wonderful. The only reason I give it four stars is that I hoped they would add more extras to the DVD menu.I found nothing wrong with the color or sound as some reviewers mentioned. In fact, I could hear a clock ticking in the background (not my clock, one in the movie) in a few scenes. I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of movies based on Jane Austen's wonderful stories. You'll love it!

I watch this movie several times a year. It transports me to a time and place I love and the way Colin and Jennifer interact with each other is so believable that you honestly feel the tranformation of their affections. His facial expressions of frustration, pain, pleasure and adoration of being in her company need no dialogue and her responses are equally passionate and honest. Every one of the supporting actors are perfectly cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"This is an amzaing film.

Our is \\"just\\" a 2 dvd boxed set, and that's all it needs to be.The costumes and sets are wonderful as are the actors. Colin Firth stands out as the supreme definition of Mr. Darcy. Once upon a time, Dorothy Parker described Kathryn Hepburn of \\"having all the emotions from A to B\\". Watching Firth's Darcy is seeing that there are 27 different emotions between A and B! Although he barely smiles (at the very end), the change is pronounced in tiny mouth and facial motions.Jennifer Ehle is also wonderful as are the entire supporting cast, and the wonderful interplay between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.This is a must-have for all you romance lovers and the 4-5 hour length is just about the right time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"I have watched this mini-series three times now, and I can't get over how proper and reserved society was in 19th century England. How absolutely magnificent the countryside scenes are, and the period costumes are so gorgeous. The transformation in Darcy is fantastic, and to think of what a grande mistress Elizabeth will be of his estate. I fell in love with Darcy too, but he was indeed insufferable at the beginning! How could they allow the spoiled Lydia to get away with such a conceited attitude! I wonder how jealous she felt after finding out about Jane's and Elizabeth's nuptials!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film, bad DVD adaptation","review":"This mini-series captivated me the first time I saw it on A&E. It has much of the original Austin dialog and great visual scope that adds to the drama and understanding of society in 1813. It is masterfully done and captures me and everyone I have shown it to over the last few years. Unfortunately the DVD is not well done. It does provide a nice \\"making of\\" segment and the wide-screen format is also quite nice. However, as I watched my new DVD I couldn't figure out why everyone looked so washed out. The dresses, faces, and walls all seemed to be the same color. The outdoor scenes have lost much of their brilliance. Thinking I imagined the original I played the VHS and DVD side-by-side and was amazed at the poor quality of the DVD picture. Other reviewers have confirmed this poor medium. Given the choice, buy the video tapes and copy them onto your own DVD when DVD-RAM recorders get cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable...","review":"What can I say but 'simply adorable and memorable'? :) I've always wanted to buy this production on DVD format since I first saw it being broadcasted on a cable TV channel in Brazil called 'People and Arts'. It was love at first sight, that's for sure. That was also the precise occasion when I had the inestimable privilege to know such remarkable actors: Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. And it all happened back in 1997/8, and now I've finally got this extremely well-made movie at home to watch and share with friends, relatives and students whenever I feel like.Thank you BBC for having produced such a masterpiece, and thank you Amazon for proving me with the possibility of buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful miniseries","review":"As others have noted, this is superb. I have watched it many times and it never grows old. I find this far superior to the newer, cinematic version."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I had hoped!","review":"This is a fine collection - after all these years I have finally read the book, chased up the film - and loved it for the most part although I thought Elizabeth a bit 'modern' for my tastes. So I had to get the much talked about BBC production. At first I thought Firth (Darcy) almost too remote - but oddly, by the end, was quite moved by the reconciliation of the two main protagonists. An elegant production. Some fine work by the cast, excepting Mrs Bennett who irritated me in a way that wasn't quite as Austen intended. The 'extras' (bios etc) were a little thin on the ground but the whole presentation couldn't be faulted. An excellent buy and well worth having in one's possession. And far from expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brighter colors and a more intimate, immediate presence","review":"I purchased the initial full screen release of the A&E; Adaptation about four years ago and have been extremely happy with it. Recently, it was released wide-screen. I purchased it, and was fortunate enough to be able to return it for the following reasons: the wide-screen version seems to present a washed-out image, colors tend to fade and the performances, especially those of the two stars, do not have the same impact as the original release because the wide-screen creates a distance. I wonder how the production was initially shot. Was it full-screen or wide?I feel very grateful to possess this release and will cherish it for years to come. I do hope that they do not discontinue it.By the way, when will \\"Reckless,\\" another British production, be released DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous! Buy This Title Now!!!!","review":"I rented this movie after watching 'Bridget Jones' time upon time. After seeing Helen Fielding's comments on Mark Darcy being directly based upon Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, I had to give it a viewing. While many of the period pieces I have watched over the years were dry and overacted, this one is a true gem. Upon renting it, I stayed up until 4 a.m. because I could not tear myself away. I have watched it five more times since and currently have the DVD on order so I can magically zap myself to my favorite scenes. Oustanding.All of the characters are beautifully portrayed and the cinematography brilliant. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle take my breath away. I feel like one of the Bennet sisters now. You really MUST buy this movie. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride Without Prejudice in the A-1 production","review":"The two disk (Parts One and Two ) DVD version I have obtained is a full screen version (1.33.1) distributed by Lambrakis Group Publishing in Athens. It is with Greek sub-titles than can be removed but without any supplementary material. I have not had the problem related by other reviewers with the color or the sound , which are superb. I don't think this kind of made-for-TV movie would benefit from a widescreen version in any case. In the best BBC tradition this version of Pride and Prejudice is excellent both as regards to the quality of production and the careful casting. The props, period costumes, and settings are outstanding. Colin Firth has the same sulky look as in his role as a cuckolded fiancée in Shakespeare in Love. It is a pleasure to view a product of this high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production quality mars great film","review":"What a disappointment to see this DVD after viewing the VHS version. Though presented as an upgraded version from the video, the colors are awful, the contrast is terrible, subtle light colors go to white and anything vaguely dark goes to black--all the beautiful details of the original VHS are lost for some reason. I wrote to A&E asking about it and they did not respond. And it's not isolated to my DVD or TV (I checked). What a sad way to treat an otherwise great piece of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD version disappointing","review":"If you own the VHS version, save your money instead of \\"downgrading\\" to this DVD. I agree with the other reviewers who point out that the DVD version is inferior. On my television, the picture is stretched so that everything looks taller and thinner; bed curtains hardly show up at all! I was hoping for lots of interesting extras on the DVD; what's included is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the DVD","review":"I must second the other reviewer who noted how terribly washed out the color is on the DVD. Very disappointing! Stick with the VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie ruined by terrible transfer","review":"I was so pleased to learn of the re-release of P&P in a widescreen (Special Edition) version. I once owned the laser disc boxed set, and sold that when the full screen version became available on DVD. I have just watched the latest version on DVD and was so disappointed by its transfer, I was prompted to do a scene-for-scene comparison with the earlier DVD release. Opening titles are OK, but after that, the difference is astonishing. Some scenes have a green cast, otherwise the colours are generally washed out, with loss or degradation of flesh tones. There is also a general loss of detail. The aspect ratio appears to be 1.85, not 2.35, as stated on the cover. I hope the studio will do something about this and recall the product ASAP. Such a shame because this version of P&P was an outstanding production, deserving to be collected and frequently enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice (Not So) Special Edition DVD","review":"This so-called Special Edition DVD was a great disappointment. The contrast is way off and the colors completely washed out. There was also a disturbing tendency for the image to wobble when the camera angle changed. A much-rented tape copy that I had seen was better in quality than this. Anyone seeking a good copy in full screen is now out of luck, since all the VHS and the previous DVD are full-screen presentations. The direction and performances are as wonderful as any you might expect to see. This is a great screen version of the story (High praise if you love the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version as much as I do), but not worth seeing in this re-production. One can only hope that the cinematographer never has to see what they have done to his beautiful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digitally Remastered? Really?","review":"I love this adaptation, but this \\"restored edition\\" gets 1 star for false advertising. I wish I read the bad reviews before buying.I was excited when I saw this for sale at such a low price and \\"digitally remastered\\" too, but when I watched it, I hardly noticed any difference from the blurry washed out version of an earlier DVD set.Digitally remastered?

Well-cast and entertaining the hours will fly by and you won't want to stop the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colin Firth, why doest thou not smile?","review":"This is one of Jane Austin's very best novels. The movie is wonderful and as usual she makes us wait until the very end to know if the true love of all characters will work out right.Collin Firth is so handsome, even if he never smiles. He plays the chacture of Mr. Darcy so well. The plot of the movie is as wonderful as all of Jane Austin's books. The movie will not leave you disappointed and the price cannot be beat.

I wish I could say the same for the quality of the DVD. This DVD's video is the poorest of any I have in my collection! The VHS copy that I have access to is actually visually clearer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Rendition of Pride & Prejudice","review":"The acting in this version of P&P is EXCELLENT. Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth has her sass and cheek. She shows Elizabeth's gradual love for Darcy perfectly. The actress who plays Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingly are very well done. The mother and younger sisters are played almost too well. (The screaching of the mother gets tiresome after a while.) The stand out performance of this movie is by far Colin Firth. I did not know who he was, typical of Americans I'm sure, but I do now. He can speak clearly with his eyes. It is rare for an actor to have such a gift. An example of what I'm talking about is the scene where Darcy watches Elizabeth play the piano with his sister. Breathtaking!! I have, also, just had the pleasure to watch Mr. Firth in \\"Bridget Jones Diary.\\" As far as I concerned, Hollywood needs to snatch him up with joy. You have made a new American fan, Mr. Firth. However, simply put, this is an excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite!!","review":"I absolutely love this version of \\"Pride & Prejudice!\\" I can't even say how many times I have watched this over & over; all 6 hours worth.

We love that edition and have watched it on numerous occasions. However, the difference between watching the Blu-ray version and the regular DVD is like the difference between real life and a grainy photograph. The only thing I found a little cumbersome was when watching the whole series in one sitting, rather than having a brief pause between each episode (as the Special Edition DVD set has it) we are required to either watch or fast-forward through the introduction of each episode (theme music, credits, etc...). But even with all that, it's still well worth it.As for the version starring Keira Knightley, I've watched it, but I can't stomach watching it again. Ms. Knightley is no Miss Elizabeth Bennett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst looking Blu-ray I own","review":"This is an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice, and we really enjoyed the DVD version. This Blu-ray edition is a real stinker though, video quality-wise. There's so much buzzing swirling movement in peoples skin and in the sky shots that it's completely distracting, and that's on a 40\\" HDTV. Yuck. I sure hope the studio takes the time for a do-over.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely romantic - and best version","review":"I adored the latest \\"Keira Knightley\\" version of Pride & Prejudice and was inspired to rent the A&E; version with Colin Firth. Well, although the A&E; series is quite long, it is definitely the very best version. I've even seen the old version with Sir Laurence Olivier and neither can compare to the A&E; version despite their merit. Simply the most romantic and beautiful series I've ever seen!The acting and direction in this version is outstanding - both Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle can't be beat in both their portrayals of the characters and general good looks. The screen play was most like the book and the scenes contained beautiful scenery and lovely music. When I read the book, I could only imagine Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.I did not purchase this DVD but rented it at my local video store, therefore I can't judge the sound or visual quality of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is one of the best classic English movies I've ever seen.

But I must admit I was deeply captivated by this mini-series, it succeeded with me where others may have failed. The witty, cultured dialogue was very enjoyable to listen to, yet accessible. I understood everything. I loved the story, especially the relationship between the pretty and likeable Elizabeth and the handsome, proud Mr. Darcy kept me guessing all the time if his good qualities would shine through after he started falling for her and if she would soften up to him or not as I was hoping they would end up together after all. I was not disappointed.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent version of the book","review":"It would still be nice to see a P&P flick that was true to the book, but this does do it more justice than the other versions that I have seen.

If you haven't read the book, be sure to do so, to experience the nuances not strongly played in the film.

I appreciate the care they took in following the book so carefully.What I wished as I watched it was that Matthew Macfadyen was the Mr. Darcy.

There is too much contrast in the color, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The hue of the color is also waashed out, a little too bleak to enjoy Ms. Bennett's rosy cheeks or Mr. D'Arcy's walk from the pond...The widescreen aspect is great; it does add a bit of grandeur to the scenes, but the freaky color has us put off.

The image looked squished also, and the people were abnormally long and skinny, it was torture to look at. Not only that, but every 5-10 minutes the action would freeze, then jump ahead. I did notice, in the bonus video, that the interviews were normal color, but the segments of the movie shown were still washed out.

I had to fiddle with the brightness and color controls on my TV to even get a passable color rendition. How, how, did this travesty get released? I feel so stung by this experience that I think a \\"technical quality\\" rating of sound and video should be part of any DVD review, particularly transcriptions from VHS.

It was mainly talking by the producer and writer about the pre-production (which you can read about in the book). I felt there should have been a lot more than what I got.The colour also looks a bit...strange - washed out and the like, unlike the video version which had much stronger period colours. The sound is a bit muffled and not as good as the video version as well which was disappointing.Having written that, the quality is good for the series. Colin Firth is dreamy as Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is great as Elizabeth. I recommend this no question, you will never get sick of watching it :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all times!","review":"This movie is the most wonderful movie...every role is perfectly casted, especially my absolute favorites \\"Miss E. Bennett and Mr. Darcy\\". I purchased this movie and now am totally addicted to it. I watch it almost every weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best filmed version of an Austen novel","review":"Together with Emma Thompson's wonderful \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", this is the best film version of an Austen novel. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are absolutely perfect in every way as Elizabeth Bennett and Mark Darcy. This is six hours long, but so addictive that Austen fans will be grateful for every second. Don't bother with other versions. Hollywood's 1940 version is ghastly, just like nails on a chalkboard to Austen fans, although the Mr. Bennett isn't too bad in that. The 1980's PBS version isn't good, but, fortunately, very forgettable. The only strong point of that version is the depiction of Mrs. Bennett, presenting her in a kindly and realistic light. But this Ehle-Firth version is a must for Austen fans, or any fan of romantic movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Loved it!","review":"A faithful interpretation of the events, characters and dialogue written so beautifully by Jane Austin. This film transports you into another time and place where pride about the family fortune or prejudice about the inferiority of one's connections could keep people well suited to one another apart. Fantastic casting and direction truly make the characters come to life! Everyone from Darcy, Bingley, and Wickam to the entire Bennet family shines and comes to life. Elizabeth truly does have fine eyes. You will enjoy it, especially if you love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and Definitely Worth the Money!","review":"I love how this 6-part mini series presents Jane Austen's novel. There is no \\"Hollywood twist\\" or \\"poetic license\\". If you read the book you will see that the producers used it like a script. The BBC are famous for presenting novels accurately which makes us purists happy! I love Colin Firth's portrayal as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Crispin Bonham-Carter as Mr. Bingley is charming as well. Actually all the actors were well suited to their roles. You might gasp when you see the price of the videos, but believe me, but they are worth the money. Each video is approx. 50 min. in length, so watch them at a time when you have 5 hours to spare, as they are hard to stop watching! If you have more discipline (LOL) they are nice to watch in installments, \\"one\\" per night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a production that makes Darcy 3D","review":"You can always trust BBC in excellence in costume drama, both the 1975 and this version are the most authentic adoptation I've seen.What I particularly liked about this production is that unlike the 1975 production, the '96 Mr. Darcy is no longer just Elizabeth's beau - but a character with substance, commending its own place in the story.......and to the skeptical men readin this review, I AM preferring to the famous Colin-Firth-walks-out-of-the-lake scene..............Before Elizabeth's visit to Pemberly, Mr. Darcy was just one of her suitors, created to give Austin a chance to show off Elizabeth's quick wit and acid tonge. Pemberly is the real entrance for Mr. Darcy. From here on, the author began to concentrate on him, giving him life, voice and presence.So what's wrong with emphasising this grand entrance by making a bit of splash?! ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I was disappoint in the color of the movie, it was washed out. I have the video and the color was excellant, just like when I watched it on A&E years ago. I just watched it on PBS and the color was fine. I would not recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation of Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have long thought that this A&E;/BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is by far the best. It follows the original text as closely as can be expected, allowing for a few necessary changes to make the story work as a screenplay. In fact, it is so similar to the book that you could almost follow along, which is certainly rare. Jennifer Ehle gives an excellent portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy is exceptional. True fans of Jane Austen's writing will not be disappointed!I have previously seen this miniseries on VHS and DVD; I can say that this Blu-Ray version is definitely of superior quality. The picture is significantly sharper, so much so that I sold my DVD version and now only watch this one. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The blue ray format provided such a lively and wonderfull expirience The serie simply captures you complettly , the Amazon service was great since ii purchased it from abroad the US .I highly recomend the product and the Amazon service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Hollywood movie!","review":"The BBC series is more complete and truly presents the story according to the book. The acting is good & you'll also laugh a lot! The restored editon looks better and the extra features of the DVDs are very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great package","review":"This package of the movie itself, coupled with the DVD extras, the biography of Jane Austin, and the book that is included was a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice - The Speciat Edition (A&E, 1996)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. With all the violence, sex and inappropriate language that is so prevalent in most movies today, I found this movie very refreshing. The movie was long, but to the viewer's advantage. It was easier to follow what was happening and why; and the viewer can can get a better grasp on the personalities of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This movie is fantastic. This movie is the closest to the actual book that I have seen so far. Both Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth play their roles superbly. I recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Favorite","review":"As the only female in a family of four, getting the chance to watch this series wasn't easy. When I finally convinced \\"the guys\\", they figured it would be sappy and sentimental and not something they would enjoy. Well, lo and behold, they all loved it! I'm talking Dad, a 17 year old and a 12 year old here! Seriously, this is a great adaptation of Jane Austen's wonderful novel and is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best romance ever told","review":"There can never have been a better rendition of this timeless story. Colin Firth is the perfect Darcy and Jennifer Ehle a completely convincing Lizzy. I can never watch this too many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Pride & Prejudice version EVER!!!","review":"The actors, the scenery, the script writing, the detail -- ALL of it is as rich as Austen's novels themselves. No other versions compare. I have two copies of the set (purchased and a gift) and have gifted this set more than a dozen times to friends who are serious J.A. fans. It's just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A very enjoyable BBC version of this Jane Austen classic. Length of the movie is very long--it was created as mini series--but on DVD it is a pleasure to watch. Colin Firth is a great Mr. Darcy for Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love this version. The actors are awesome. The scenes are great in this movie and so is the costumes. Love this DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this product.","review":"I am very pleased with this purchase. It has great picture and sound, came fast in shipping and I would say it is a very good purchase for anyone to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the best version of Pride and Prejudice I have seen. Colin Firth makes the best Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best production of Pride & Prejudice Available","review":"Compared to other available reproductions of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, the dialog is very accurate - which makes this a long film, but a must have for any Jane Austen lover, or for any admirer of Mr. Darcy, whom Colin Firth portrays excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stylish adaptation","review":"I have yet to see an adaptation that is entirely to the letter, but this one comes very close. Well done all around, a production that was clearly done with care and affection for the source material. The mini series format allowed the film makers to present the novel fully, as Austen wrote it (unlike the disasterous Northanger Abbey film, which is riddled with crippling cuts).The widescreen presentation is quite welcome. The only quibble I have is that the picture quality is somewhat less than spectacular - the film is from 1995, but the grain makes it look as if it was from 1965. Mind you, it is tolerable, but notiecable even on a small television. This quite surprised me - hopefully a special edition that is actually special will be released that addresses this problem. Hence my four star rating of a five star film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible transfer in the Special Edition","review":"One of the best adaptations of Jane Austin's work has been marred by a horrible transfer to DVD. The color saturation extremely poor and I find it unwatchable. I have the previous version of the DVDs as well and although grainy and of relatively poor quality, it is much more watchable than the Special Edition. The best quality I've found is on the VHS versions of the miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray version a must!","review":"The color and image quality on the Blu Ray remastered version is a huge improvement over the prior DVD edition. This was originally shot on 16mm and you'll see some scenes where Lizzy was slightly over exposed and she's a little grainy but everyone has skin color now! Throw your old version away and get this - it's a different film."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISK2 CAME CRACKED AT CENTER AND CANNOT PLAY IT","review":"I HAVE THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND THIS NEW ONE IS JUST AS ENJOYABLE UNTIL...I CAME TO DISK2 WHICH CAME CRACKED. I CANNOT RETURN IT AS I LIVE OVERSEAS AND HAVE ORDERS SENT TO A MAILBOX IN MIAMI. IT WOULD COST ME MORE TO SEND IT BACK THAN PURCHASE A NEW ONE. SO I WILL REMAIN WITH MY OLD VERSION. I NORMALLY BUY SEVERAL EDITIONS OF ONE TITLE. FOR THIS TITLE: I HAVE THE 1940 OLIVIER-GARSON ONE; THE BBC VIDEO EDITION AND THE LATEST KEIRA KNIGHTLY & MATHEW MACFADYEN. I LIKE TO COMPARE THEM WITH REGARD TO COSTUMES, HOUSES AND ACTORS PLAYING THE SAME ROLES. I LOVE SEEING COLIN FIRTH WITH JENNIFER EHLE HERE AND IN THE KING'S SPEECH: TWO DIFFERENT TIMES AND ROLES."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LOVE THIS VERSION OF P&P, DON'T BUY THE DVD","review":"This dramatization with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is my favorite of all the dramatizations of Pride and Prejudice, but the DVD is a huge disappointment. They cut out major portions (how can they do that without letting you know it's abridged?), and the the color and sound are absolutely awful. Stick with the VHS version. It's much better. What a huge waste of money this was. I am very disappointed. I wish I had read the other reviews of the DVD before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restored? Not so much","review":"DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!! If I could rate it less than one star, I would.I bought this version of Pride & Prejudice because it SAYS digitally restored. It was a HUGE mistake, as Amazon only allows replacement of the same item as far as refunds/returns go. The \\"restored\\" version is grainy, segmented by episode, and the only evidence of any digital restoration is in the special features clips. A friend of mine has the P&P; Special Edition and it's picture quality is leaps and bounds better, and the episodes are separated by a fade to black, not the complete credits! I am still kicking myself for wasting the money on this version, since Amazon won't let me exchange it and pay for a better copy of the movie.Remember, do not buy this \\"RESTORED\\" Edition. Pay a little extra for the Special Edition or the Anniversary Edition. That, you won't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"[...]. However, I assume they all come from the same warehouses, so I'm posting my comment here. My version is missing the vital scene describing Mr. Wickham's dealings with Darcy's sister! I love this show, and have watched it many many times, and I can tell you that this was NOT the scene to edit out! I also concur with others about the poor quality of the color and sound. Interestingly, the featurette at the end has the original excellent color and sound. Quite a contrast to the rest of the DVD! Needless to say, this DVD is going back to PBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This is an okay version of Pride and Prejudice, but not the most superior one. It strays from the book quite a bit (I don't recall Darcy jumping in swamps nor even fencing) The acting is bland exept for Julia Sawalha, who is most melodramatic and Jennifer Ehle's smirking gets old quickly. The scenery is beautiful, however and so are the costumes.The 1979 BBC version, with a screenplay by Fay Weldon, is a far superior version. The movie is bang on with the book and the acting is fantastic--the actress portraying Lydia is a little histrionic and melodramatic, but the rest are pure perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"2010 \\"restored\\" edition is missing Episode 4","review":"Beware, the 2010 \\"restored\\" edition is incomplete. It's missing Episode 4.Disc 1 contains Episodes 1-3Disc 2 contains Episodes 5-6"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I saw parts of it on tv then never got to see the end. So, I saw it on Amazon and bought it. Looking forward to watching the rest of the show...thanks Amazon for not leaving me in suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Bought this movie fro my wife (Christmas list item). She loves it. I don't know if I'll watch it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one.","review":"My wife and I are huge fans of A&E's Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. We were exited by the prospect of a 10th anniversary edition of the film, expecially the interviews and retrospectives promised by this edition. The DVD special interview were very disappointing and primarily feature the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet and Mr. Wickham. While their interview were interesting, the main characters are conspicuously absent. I will likely sell my copy on eBay and wait for a more in-depth special edition that has video interviews with all the cast--especially the main characters. Also, the behind the scenes clips are very limited. While the booklet is okay, it would have been nice if the producers had invested more time and attention to this edition's special features. If they had, I would have been willing to double for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4+ Still the best adaptation out there","review":"This version succeeds despite a few problems, such as Mrs. Bennet's shrill voice which I don't recommend when you have a headache or are stressed. She is a little over the top for me, though if there were less of her voice, it would be okay. I always either turn down or mute those parts or fast forward through them now. Other versions have a far more pleasing interpretation of Mrs. Bennet while still conveying her character as Austen wrote it. The dramatic change from one Darcy to another is a little hard to believe. One wonders how his change, which seems so sincere, could have been so dramatic. However, the changed Darcy here is utterly charming and I am always willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. This should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving recreation of Jane Austin's masterpiece","review":"The producer and director set out to recreate Jane Austin's world and her people, and they succeeded. The loving detail of place, form, color, music, dance and acting in this glorious production brilliantly projects the viewer into the early 19th Century world of the landed gentry - a dreamland of beauty and wit.The acting, (with the unfortunate exception of Allison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett who overacts shamelessly, and sounds like a rusty saw scraping on metal), is so superior to anything an American could see on television, that it is like entering a new plane of existence. Best are Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, although the actors who played Ms. Lucas and Mr. Bingly were also terrific.Great extra features, too, although I would have LOVED an interview with Colin Firth, who is to die for!If you haven't seen it, you are a deprived person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"Excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Austen fans will want to watch this again and again. Anyone who liked Bridget Jones' Diary should watch this and see how it all began."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the earlier BBC version instead","review":"Thoroughly unsatisfying, despite the presence of the always spectacularly sexy Colin Firth. The major flaw here is the horribly miscast Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth. She looks right, but is way too humorless, heavy, and grim in personality--all wrong for a character who wins the love lottery largely because of her sprightly wit and sweetness.In addition, Jane Austen's delicious dialogue is dumbed-down unforgivably in key moments. And the many minor characters who are supposed to offer piquant commentary on the money and love problems in this story are horribly mishandled. The actors are both weak and wrong, their scenes curtailed and stripped of meaning. This is Jane Austen done by people with NO FEELING for Jane Austen.The earlier BBC version with Elizabeth Garvey was superior in every way. And even without Colin Firth, ten times as romantic-- which is, after all, the whole point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favour and read the book instead","review":"They covered all the basic plot points but I think the movie lost something in so doing. Trying to cram everything into two hours left me scratching my head. I'd have to say if you don't read the book and you watched this movie you might not understand everything that was happening. All in all i wouldn't buy this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Match for the Original","review":"Really boring. Stick with the marvelous, original 1940 classic. How can A&E's wimpy cast possibly compete with Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier, Edna May Oliver, Ann Rutherford, Edmund Gwenn, et al? Answer: they can't. The 1940 original will be on DVD sooner or later, but in the meantime a decent VHS of this great old movie will at least keep you awake, which is more than I can say for this dreary DVD issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't have to be an action movie to be great!","review":"On my wife's suggestion we rented this from the video store last year despite the fact that these kind of movies were not my cup of tea, but I sat through it. Imagine my surprise when it actually grabbed my attention and I began to enjoy it. I bought the A&E six video set for her birthday, and each time I watched it, I liked it more and more. We just finished it again the other day.As a drama-suspense-action movie buff, I'm almost embarrassed to say that this has become one of my favorite movies! The characters are excellently played. I particularily like Mr.Bennett! I have never read the book, but I am trying to convince my wife to teach it in her English classes so that the students get a chance to watch this excellent movie. It almost makes you wish that it was longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT PRODUCTION - HORRIBLE DVD!","review":"A&E's production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a 5 star masterpiece; however, the DVD recording of it is just awful! The colors are either too dark or washed out, the sound is weak, and get this: the lips aren't in sync with the words being spoken!! Until they make a better DVD, stick with the Video set, where none of these problems are present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD, colors are terrible","review":"This has to be a mistake/a defective DVD. The colors are very messed-up. They are so washed out, faces appear to be white, very white, not flesh colored at all. I want my money back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and true adaptation of an amazing novel.","review":"I saw this when it first came out on the BBC. (I lived in England) I have to say it is one of those dramas that I will watch and watch and watch again. I love the characters and I think that the casting is one of the best. Jane Austen of course must be given the credit of a great story. But I commend the adaptation and staying true to the book. I read the novel after watching the film and was amazed by how well it stuck to the story. I love the settings and the views but I am an English country girl at heart so I would. But it is a true love story that can bring hope that we can all find our own Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"THis is such a great story and so beautifully produced. I watched the original broadcast on A&E and am delighted to have my own DVD copy to enjoy again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Austen Adaptation","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers in that this is the best screen adaptation of a book I've ever seen. The cast is perfect to play the roles, and the acting is solid. The characters on screen look as I picture them while reading the book. I had to shell out a lot of cash to get my hands on this back when it was a special order vhs box set years ago. Very glad to have it on DVD. If you're an Austen fan or someone who enjoys period pieces, you have to check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because of picture quality","review":"I've received this DVD for Christmas almost 2 years ago and I was so disappointed with the picture quality. Mine is all dark and the details of the costumes and furniture doesn't show.Before, I kept rending the DVD from Netflix and their disks were so nice (it wasn't the special edition though but the regular DVD which they have stoped selling by now). So I was used to seeing the nice detials, colors.Today, I've broke down and purchased a used copy of this older-version DVD from Amazon marketplace. I hope and pray that copy will have a nice picture quality because the movie is 5 stars otherwise and have watched it countless times!Good luck with your copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"It arrived on time or even before it was due.

Quite good quality, although the colour tones were a bit unnatural. Overall, good value and a very enjoyable watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can A Film Be Better Than The Book?","review":"The answer to that question is definitely yes! This film brings the settings and characters from Jane Austin's wonderful story right into your home. The story line is followed to perfection. The period comes to life. The scenery is exquisite. All of the wonderful actors fill their rolls perfectly. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth become Elizabeth and Darcy, just as Austin described them. I recommend this film to all Austin fans and anyone that enjoys history or romance. It is one to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware! Don't buy the New Edition!","review":"I just received my copy of this new edition and it was a great disappointment. Very poor quality. The other DVD version may not be perfect, but it's certainly better than this one. Colors are washed out and in some cases almost nonexistent and contrast is too dark! Terrible conversion. I'm returning mine for a refund! This wonderful production deserves the best remastering, not a mediocre one like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles","review":"I love Jane Austen, but am not buying this version of P & P because it offers no \\"subtitles\\".

Now I'm attempting to return it using the \\"easy return policy\\" but I can't return it because it has been opened. What would you suggest I do to get the omitted portion of the movie. Also, how about a return of the overcharge, I paid $28.49 for a partial movie that you are now selling for $19.49.Review of what I saw of the movie, excellent.Review of Amazon.com unethical customer service. You know what you have to do to clear your reputation with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love P&P, hate the CD technology","review":"I'm torn in this review. The CD/video is undoubtedly the best interpretation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The actors, screenplay, and overall excellence of the production are unparalled. However, I am asked to rate this item. I had the full video set which I watched many times (comfort time). When I got my first DVD I was very unhappy with the reproduction. The colors, which were vivid on the video, were washed out, reds being pale, etc. I thought that that was one mistake so I ordered another and then another, all the same. I can hardly watch the CD's. The story remains wonderful, but the CD is miserable, and I have watched the original enough to hate watching the CD. Order at your own risk--the production is A class, the reproduction stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't Understand, So I watched it again","review":"I first watched the movie on PBS. I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie so that I could watch it again. I now understand what was going on. I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. How did we get from there to here? Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper. Lizzie is so stubborn. But her mother got to me the most. I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends. Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel. And most of all I did get that warm and tinglely feeling at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned movie twice","review":"I bought this movie, was disappointed with the quality and exchanged it for another one. The second one was worse and I returned it for a refund. I then ordered it from Costco, which turned out to be cheaper and a much better quality. This is a great classic movie and worth it to find a copy of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" version of P&P","review":"I can't remember ever enjoying a mini-series as much as I enjoyed this one. It is a flawless production with a brilliant cast that you will grow to love every time you watch it. Jennifer Ehle is marvelous as Lizzie as is the rest of the cast. I was excessively diverted."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is something horribly wrong with this DVD!","review":"Our family wore out our VHS tapes of this outstanding miniseries. We have also really enjoyed the earlier DVD release that we checked out from the local library. With huge enthusiasm we looked forward to this new version. DRAT! It turned out to be virtually unwatchable. Not only was the color completely washed out, but the movements were jerky and not always syncronized with the sound. Thinking we just somehow had been sent a faulty disk we returned it and tried again but the replacement was no better. Perhaps there was just a bad batch of DVDs manufactured, but we are hesitant to try again. (I see that many others have had the same problem.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD version","review":"I decided to go to a local seller and after discussing the matter with a manager, bought a copy to try out, knowing I could return it if I was unhappy with the quality. The colours are far to bright and washed out, characters are literally glowing white so that you cannot even make out their features and none of the lovely rich tapestry colours in the video came across on this DVD. It is a pity, too, because A&E's Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful film and deserves to be presented with class, not failure. The sound was wonderful, but because of the washed-out colour I returned it to the store and received a full refund. (...)It is faulty (...). Hopefully A&E will fix this error soon and put out a new edition, once more!! In the meantime, do not hesitate to buy their DVD's of Victoria and Albert, Emma, Jane Eyre, Lorna Doone and Wives& Daughters. I have those and they came out fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of the movie?","review":"I ordered this 2 DVD set and sat down to watch it. The 2nd DVD ended in the middle of the story.Nowhere on the cover does it say it is just a partial movie. Which DVD set completes the movie?I was so dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying!","review":"Although I have seen other movie versions of P&P, this one is far and away the best. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are wonderful as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Also especially noteworthy are Julia Sawalha as Lydia (she is awesome!), Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourghe, and Anna Chancellor as Caroline Bingley (Mr. Bingley's sister). She is a formidable presence and does a great job! One of the funniest sequences in this production is a silent scene (played under a voice-over) in which Darcy and both of Bingley's intimidating sisters are talking sternly to Bingley and we see them from Mr. Bingley's POV (they were looking down at the camera). You might have to see the scene to understand what I mean, but trust me, it's fantastic - just like the rest of the production. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful dvd quality ruins wonderful adaptation","review":"I cannot agree more with previous reviews- this is the best adaptation of Pride & Prejudice yet, but the DVD is beyond sucking. I have the VHS tape set as well, which is perfect. The DVD in contrast is poorly formatted, comes across as a cheap copy with washed out bluish colors and muted sound. I have been through 2 DVDs thinking the first one was a fluke. DEFINATELY don't buy this until A&E re-releases it. The VHS tapes are wonderful, IF you still own a VHS recorder..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Adaptation of a novel i have ever seen","review":"If you are like me and HATE seeing your favourite books get massacred onscreen, then you will, hopefully, find this adaptation flawless.

It had great character development based upon the Jane Austin series, and the length of the film was broken up into different \\"Acts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, excellent character development, no problems with DVD","review":"This is one of our favorite movies. It's nice to have it divided into the 6 hour-ish segments so that it can be enjoyed over a few evenings, or not, as desired. (You can choose to play it straight through). The character development is exceptional. The DVD itself we have no complaints about. Good color, no skipping, no problems so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING on Blu-ray","review":"Much has been written in praise of this P&P; production so I won't elaborate other than to agree. Repeat viewings of this film yield an increased appreciation of its excellence.What I will say is this film is a complete and sufficient reason to buy a Blu-ray player. It is a stunning restoration, adding another layer to this incredible production. I can think of perhaps 10 movies worth having in Blu-ray, and this has to be number 1 on that list. I also have an older DVD (non Blu-ray) versions of this P&P;, and the Blu-ray looks MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)","review":"Love the story. The picture is clear, sound great. I would have liked to know that it is shown as a Mini-series and not just a straight movie. I really don't like the ending/beginning of the segments of the show, but that is the only thing I don't care for."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"All I have to say is WOW...The mini series follows the book very well. Didn't like having to fast forward through each episodes credits....but it was worth it for the attention to the book. I always liked to movie version, but this has become my new favorite. Colin Firth played an amazing Mr. Darcy. While reading the book I imagined the Bennett girls to be prettier, but I thought Lizzie was spot on. Well worth it to see...just have the remote ready to fast forward through the credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is perhaps the best translation to film for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It was origianlly a miniseries, which works to give the movie more time to develop the story. It is also one of the very few film versions that carries Jane Austin's spirit. The actors all were able to capture the characters wonderfully. Colin Firth shines as Mr. Darcy. Although the movie is far from perfect (a few scenes are done a bit slowly), I completly recommend this version to any Austin fan or lovers of romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the book adaption!","review":"It is always a joy to find a classic book marvelously acted out true to the book. Pride and Prejudice is a family favorite that even (amazingly) my dad enjoys! From hilarious Mrs. Bennett and her \\"poor nerves\\" to Darcy and his \\"cold manner\\", this movie is a wonderful production. Starring beautiful Jennifer Ehle and handsome Colin Firth, it is a must see for everyone! Very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray reviews only please","review":"If Amazon people are reading this, I wish they only put the Blu-ray version reviews here. Why does Amazon always carry the DVD reviews to the Blu-ray version? I am sure most people already knew that this is a fantastic adaption, and they just want to know what's on the Blu-ray version.The same thing for other Blu-ray releases too. Amszon, only Blu-ray reviews for the Blu-ray version please. Because I don't care how the DVD version is. I am sure all the other poeple who try to check out the Blu-ray version feel the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"I just purchased this DVD and was greatly disappointed with the DVD production. I agree with the reviewer \\"A viewer.\\" The digital remastering has changed the color tone of the film. The film color is washed out compared to the VHS version. The sound is tinny. Both of these issues makes the film uncomfortable to watch.I would highly recommend NOT buying this DVD. Rather, hope that one day the film production company will make another DVD returning the beautiful color and sound one can find in the original release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer VHS and 200th Ann. version over the Special Edition","review":"The BBC production of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is one of my favorites.I am sadly disappointed in the re-mastered wide-screen Special Edition version (released 2001) of this wonderful production. Everything is greenish, as if it had been shot through a green filter. The images look like a second or third generation video tape copy. I cannot recommend it.In comparison, I was very pleased with the quality of both the VHS version (released 1998) of this production, and the 200th Anniversary version on DVD in a full-screen format (released 1998).The content of the BBC production is wonderful -- acting, story, characters, costumes, scenery, music, etc. -- and I wish the quality of the wide-screen DVD version was as good as the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful colors on this Special Edition DVD","review":"We enjoyed very much of this outstanding miniseries on the VHS tapes. So, we bought this Special Edition DVD for Christmas - repeated playing would wear out the VHS tapes.BAD thing about this DVD:Like many reviewers here had said already. Awful awful colors, especially on the disk one. There is way too much contrast, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The outdoor scenes hurt my eyes! Everyone looks ill; and it's hard to tell where darkness end and hair starts on most characters. The furnitures have no detail, they just disappear into the darkness.GOOD things about this DVD:1) Widescreen, although I doubt that I missed anything on the VHS format.2) The removal of episodes end credits.3) It has the closed captioning (subtitle) in English. It let me see what they are saying.Let the buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Special Edition is an eSPECIALly Big Disappointment","review":"Let this be very clear: the ONE star is in very specific reference to the DVD Special Edition being a \\"DOWNGRADE\\" (as another reviewer called it) from the original VHS version. The picture and audio are not super terrible, it is just that it was a lot better on the VHS! Why did they mess it up like this?! The program itself is fantastic and I highly recommend it. My wife and I watch the whole series at least once or twice a year (not in one sitting, mind you!). For details on exactly what is wrong, please see the review from \\"A viewer (Sandpoint, ID USA).\\" I completely agree with them and would only add that darks and shadows tend to be completely black and devoid of any light and detail whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition","review":"The movie itself is great.What I was disappointed in was the picture quality. In different scenes throughtout the movie, the whiteness of the background was so bright you could hardly see the people's faces. The copy I got was a brand new still in the shrink wrap copy, so it was not the seller's fault - it was in the reproduction of the movie from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing product.","review":"I have this same product on VHS tape. I purchased the DVD version to avoid having to switch tapes while viewing and to save shelf space. The VHS tapes have warner colors and are overall more pleasing to watch. The remastered digital product is washed out in appearance and destroyed the warmth. I would not recommend the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made","review":"This is the best version of Pride and Prejudice ever made. The acting is superb, the diologe wonderful and the ambiance perfect. Jennifer Ehel and Colin Firth make a perfect pair and the rest of the cast is well suited to their parts. Overall, it is a delight to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the greatest ever and I appreciated it at a great price. The character development is so much better in this longer version than in the shorter (theater) version that came out a few years back.

I first saw it with a friend and had to get a copy for myself. I have since watched it several times. The scenery is beautiful and casting is wonderful. Some of the actors are so ingrained in my minds as the Bennetts that I would have trouble watching them in anything else. I would highly recommend this version to anyone who likes Jane Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful wonderful Wonderful","review":"I can not do the film justice with my explanation. Just view it ... six hours will fly by quicker than you can ever imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This five-hour masterpiece is the perfect realization of Jane Austen's classic novel, Pride & Prejudice. The casting is amazing--Lizzy is dead-on, and her relationship with Darcy finally makes sense with Colin Firth cast to play him. The gorgeous British countryside, costumes, and social scenes bring the novel to life. This series is perfect rainy day viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"This version of Pride & Prejudice is my all time favorite! Acting is superb and scenery breathtaking. In my humble opinion, it beats the version with Kiera Knightly by a LONG shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get lost for a couple hours!","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. It's a fascinating look into how oppressive life would have been in the early 1800s in England (as a woman). Austen's work is marvelously adapted on the screen by some amazing acting. Colin Firth is superb, but you already knew that, right? Jennifer Ehle is rarely praised in these blurbs and I feel the need to acknowledge her skill as an actress. She is spunky and vivacious just as Miss Bennett should be. This is one of the few movies worth owning on video/DVD, you WILL watch it again, and again, and dare I say again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best pride and Prejudice version EVER!!","review":"Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice is lovingly portrayed in this 6 hour mini-series brought to you by BBC.Each actor portray's his or her characters flawlessly. Other movies made are good but making this a lenglthy series lets us dig deeper into the lives of the Bennets. A must for anyone who enjoy's Jane Austin.And PS.. Colind Firth as Mr. Darcy .. enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"Follows the book almost exactly. Liked it a lot, but would think of trying to make my husband sit through any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reproduction horrible","review":"I will forever love the story of Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett, but, sad to say, the poor quality of this film made it distracting. I have a beautiful bedside Toshiba television set. The color is superb, yet this film was so colorless. No tone, depth, downright pale. I didn't even bother watching the second disc. It was the price that lured me. If you don't mind colorless, and you just want to hear and vaguely see the story, then by all means ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Triumphs All","review":"This is a magnificent adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I first saw it on A&E; when it debuted and I loved it and never forgot it. When I saw it was on DVD, I had to have it.I watched the whole story one weekend and I fell in love with Colin Firth all over again. He is the ultimate Mr. Darcy. The scenery is beautiful and the acting is wonderful in this most engaging adaptation of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent conversion for Austen-avoiders!","review":"I was an Austen hater until I saw this A&E interpretation. I watched it twice in six days! I am now absolutely in love with Austen. I wouldn't consider myself a romantic but this is one of the best, most romantic stories I have ever seen. The book is so much easier to read afterward. All the actors are so handsome, especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. I recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is my favorite of all time!","review":"I have seen it lots and lots of times and I never tire of it. I have read the book and was thrilled to find it so true to the written story. True, it is a long movie, but never has anyone I have recommended it to called it boring or slow. It's not just a chic flic. My boyfriend and father have watched and enjoyed it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com! Now I don't have to rent it from my library anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic...","review":"However...I read a review that neither Colin Firth nor Jennifer Ehle is a featured cast member in the retrospective documentary. The other actors were very good but it's strange that in the 10 anniversary edition we don't get to hear from at least one of the two leads. Does anyone know why??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best funny, romantic drama i've ever seen","review":"This movie is funny and very romantic. I recomen it to anyone who has 5hrs to spare whether it be at the same time or not it doesn't really matter. But if you are into romance, I suggest you see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptionally great","review":"This is the first time I saw the movie. It immediately hooked me on and I kept on watching again and again for the whole week. Then I read the book. My 6 year old son loves the \\"argument\\" scene between Lizzy and Lady de Bourgh. I have to admit the picture in the VHS version is more beautiful than on the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!!","review":"I have watched this miniseries so many times I can recite the entire 6 hours of dialogue! The acting is superb and every last detail fits perfectly. My only complaint is that Jennifer Ehle should be listed as the star, not only Colin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply delightful film, full of memorable characters.","review":"Jane Austin's classic tale is marvelously retold in, what I consider, one of the best adaptaions of a classical work. The portrayal and development of the characters is superb.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite of her books. Colin Firth makes every woman wish she had aMr. D'Arcy in her life. All of the other actors were also outstanding in their portrayals."},{"rating":"2","title":"No adaptation of a classic has been better!","review":"I checked this series out at my local library because I was taking an American Literature class. I compared this adaption with the actual novel and to my surprise this is the BEST adaptation I have seen of a classic in the entire time that I have been studying American and British literature. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who loves this particular genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic story!","review":"My daughter and I were anxious to watch this together, because we love period films. I gave this to her for a Christmas gift, and we watched it over two nights. The story was wonderful, but I agree with a previous reviewer about the quality of the dvd being poor, the sound was not great and the picture looked grainy in parts. All this being said, it WAS worth purchasing and we enjoyed it a lot. Colin Firth was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD print","review":"Awesome DVD print..No editing..n the Restored the magic of Mr Darcy (oh how i love him) And Ms Bennett's ( I love her too) journey of love..Grt Buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny for the Bluray version!","review":"I have always been a fan of this cherished mini series. I bought the 2 disc special edition on dvd years back. My friend is hearing impaired and so I have developed a preference for captioning while watching movies. With British films it is extremely handy to glance down and read a phrase. The original set I bought didn't offer captioning so when I saw that this does I bought it. What I got was a remastered film that is so much better than the first set! I couldn't believe the improvement! There are some flaws but it didn't deter me. The special features has a segment about the process of \\"cleaning up\\" the film that was very interesting to watch also. I'm very pleased that I purchased this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy's perspective","review":"I love war movies and action movies. Staw Wars, Lord of the Rings, and the like.I kicked and screamed the first time my wife (then my fiancé) made me watch Pride and Prejudice right up through the third or fourth episode.I love this miniseries now! My wife will invite all of her girlfriends over to watch it and I find myself defying all reason and watching it with them. The chemistry between Darsy and Elizabeth is incredible. Lydia and Mrs. Bennett are just plain annoying, which is half the fun and Mr. Bennett's wit is so entertaining. If your husband/boyfriend will consent to sitting though five hours of Pride and Prejudice, I think there's a good chance that he will enjoy it (you may have to offer something pretty hefty in return. I made my wife watch the entire Star Wars trilogy with me). And you ladies out there that haven't committed yet, what are you waiting for?Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Ray is Magnificent!!!!!","review":"The blue-ray version is MAGNIFICENTLY restored!

A wonderful interpretation of Jane Austen by talented actors. Romantic and funny. Well done. Colin firth is brilliant and jennifer ehle as well as julia sawalha :) i love the dresses. If you love periode pieces this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Restoration on Blu-Ray","review":"By now I hope everyone with even the most mild interest in period drama or Jane Austen has seen the BBC Pride and Prejudice production. I'll not re-hash what has been said in nearly 2000 positive reviews on Amazon other than to say this is easily the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice available today. Now, with the restored version available on DVD and the Blu-ray versions available the picture quality is much improved over the original broadcast in 1995. The sound quality is also good, many of the scenes have music playing in the background which is clear, while not interfering with the dialogue.It's really an excellent deal, if you haven't seen it before then you really need to. If you haven't seen it since 1995 as was the case for me, you won't believe how much work has gone into updating the picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"How can you pass up Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth. Man I love this movie, it is such a classic. I watch this at least once a month, its something you will never get sick of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, especially for the purist! :)","review":"This movie is wonderful. They follow the book very well and do a remarkable job with such a great story.If you are a Jane Austen fan and like the story to stick to the book, you will love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have classic","review":"This is a classic. I decided my old million vhs tape set was ready to be let go, it is so nice to have it in two disks! The newer (keira knightly) version has more heat. The younger generation who has only seen that one may not warm to this version as quickley, but I love it. More details! And this one makes it much more clear at the end how bad what Lydia has done is, a concept that seems a little lost in the movie theatre version. My husband doesen't get it. But I know the rest of you Jane Austin fans do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"An Incisive Eye that Penetrates to the Very Heart of the Human Condition\\"","review":"As per a description on the Ignatius Press web site,Pride and Prejudice (Ignatius Critical Editions)is \\"An undoubted classic of world literature, [but] its profound Christian morality is all too often missed or wilfully overlooked by today's (post)modern critics.

We'd give it 10 stars if we could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment for the WHOLE family--even Dads.","review":"I have to admit that I did not want to watch this movie when my wife and two daughters first suggested it. The thought of having to sit through 40 or more hours (slight time exaggeration) of a period piece seemed like pure dread to me. I finally agreed to watch the movie (over several nights) and I can honestly say that it is a terrific story!! The acting is suberb and the lessons revealed throughout the picture are a must see for any family (especially if the Dad is outnumbered, gender-wise). I recommend this movie for all to see--even Dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece... Incredible... One of a Kind...","review":"this is truly the best movie from a classic novel I have ever seen.

I was blown away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie.","review":"I have seen this movie several times. It is very close to the book and the language and the landscape are just wonderful. It is a strange world were all that matters are just the social interactions and standings with other noble people, no work to do etc. But it is nice to get lost in this world, especially if it's done in such beauty and wonderful acting, customs, landscapes etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. It is kind of long, but worth every minute of watching. I wouldn't delete any part of it. I must admit, the very first time I watched it, I was a little confused as to who was who (I had not read the book or watched any other version before this). But I soon figured everyone out, and have watched it numerous times since. Good thing they have DVD now, because I think I've worn out my VHS tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Film honoring the written word","review":"This collection is the perfect embodiment of Jane Austen's novel. I love the old Hollywood version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier but it is chocolate box compared to this literate film adaptation. I think all the cast members are well-chosen for their roles and perform with great sensitivity. Lovingly filmed with an eye to being absolutely true to the period in costume and interiors, without it becoming a costume epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen would be proud!","review":"This classic story of love and marriage has captivated people for years. The beautiful English countryside, the costumes and the wonderful actors bring this story to life. At the center of the story is Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Will they or won't they get together? I've seen Sense and Sensibility, Emma and Persuasion. This movie is Jane Austen in the very best of circumstances. Also my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen!","review":"My mom received this movie for Christmas, and I thought it would be a really boring movie . . . but one boring afternoon I decided to try it out. I was immediately hooked. I stayed up until 2 in the morning just to finish it. It is the best movie I've ever seen, and it prompted my to read the novel. The acting was superb, and the music is wonderful. I ordered the soundtrack and the book \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice.\\" I recommend this movie to anyone. The six hours will just fly by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"to be cultured or not to be , that is always the question? pride, prides it's self on choosing superb actors to play the honored roles in the show. so make haste in rent or buy this work of film mastery, the film co-exists along the story of the same name. so i petition or urge you to see it. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful entertainment","review":"I think it's safe to say that this BBC/A&E mini-series is probably the best film adaptation of the classic novel ever made. Unlike other versions, this one has the luxury of several hours of available story time. Great location shots give you the feel of early 19th century England. The whole cast is excellent, but Colin Firth deserves special praise for his absolutely perfect portrayal of Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acting At Its Best","review":"Very few adaptations of novels become such a pleasure to watch as BBC's Pride & Prejudice. The acting in the mini series in little less than remarkable. All the actors have well and truly captured the essence that was England in the 18th century. Colin Firth as Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet give a truly memorable performance. Both of the chracters imbed themselves into the veiwers minds and in a way transports the veiwer back in time. In fact all the actors give a superb performance. Overall it is a mini series that still holds its charm no matter how many times you see it. It is truly a masterpiece and a worthy contender to be the jewel in any ones video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice updated version of this classic production","review":"A well done and much needed update to the previous DVD edition. The Blu-ray version is visually impressive. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Outstanding","review":"I watched this Blue Ray version in awe. It was so clearly an advance over the DVD program that I had it was like watching a new movie. You are able to see and somehow understand the expressions of the actors which you were unaware of in the previous editions. I am sure that I have seen the original DVD about 10 times(and the VHS version several times before that).All these previous viewings did not prepare me for the outstanding BLUE RAY version. The sound was also just perfect and added immensly to the overall program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful reproduction quality very disappointing","review":"After viewing the video version, what a disappointment to see the DVD! All the rich, beautiful colors and details of the video are either washed out to white or lost in dark shadow on the DVD. How A&E can claim this is 'remastered' is amazing when it looks like a bad bootlegged version. I've written to A&E--no response. They are probably tired of the complaints from fans of the original. But I would not purchase any other items related to A&E because of the poor quality and poor customer service. There are some snippets of scenes in the 'behind the scenes' portion of the DVD that have the original high-quality color. Too bad it was lost in the 'remastering'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice Restored Version","review":"I eagerly anticipated the restored version of Pride and Prejudice, as my older version had gotten worn. However, I could not tell the difference in picture quality at all. Also, the restored version inserted the lead-in and credits before and after every episode, while the version I had only did at the beginning and end of each DVD (2 each total). The new version has 6 lead-ins and 6 credits for a total of 12! Extremely annoying and unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine","review":"This has to be one of the best movies ever made. It is the flawless version of a beloved classic. Readers who love the book will love this movie because it remains faithful to not only the plot of but the mood of the story. Also, the acting is excellant. There is really no weak character.Many people are turned off by how long it is, but it is not so bad. Whenever I watch it, it seems that only a couple of hours have passed. The time will fly by, it is that good.Colin FIrth is the best part of the film. He's never looked better in any movie and he is really a great actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strictly by the book","review":"This is the absolute best version of Jane Austin's classic that has ever been filmed. It follows the book, right on down to the dialog. The casting is impecible, I cannot imagine anyone better to play any of the roles. Colin Firth is appropriately brooding, and his expressions speak volumes. We have watched the five-tape set over and over again, and it is as enjoyable the 20th time as it was the first. Highly recommended! See it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb! Excellent! I loved every minute of it!","review":"First I read the novel, then I saw the movie, and finally I've purchased the video tapes. The movie was magnificent! I couldn't ask for anything better. The movie exceeded my imagination which I had while I was reading Austen's novel. I'm planning to purchase all of her books and movies! Great job BBC and crew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Beautifully Done\\"","review":"Don't let the fact that there are six video tapes in this set intimidate you. I found myself watching all six in one evening (even though I planned to watch only one). Jane Austen's talent for romantic comedy are brought vividly to life. The costumes, the scenery, and the talented actors, take us to that place we thought we would only find in the pages of Austen's novels. Like the book, we cannot wait to see what happens next! My whole family enjoyed this movie and I recommend it highly. You will watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"All characters in this movie meshed with each other.

Colin Firth is superb and he has truely done justice to Darcy's part. Darcy's character is very intense and serious in the beginning , but as the story proceeds , the goodness of his character reveals and along with Elizabeth ,we too fall in love with him.well...i am sure that any girl who has seen this movie , hopes that she too in time would meet with her Mr Darcy...and i am no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the definitive version of Pride and Prejudice.","review":"Having read the book in college, I was also exposed to this BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. Hands down, this is the best version of this book to hit the screen. It is the most true to Austen's vision (If I had to guess). The subtlties in the acting, the chemistry between the actors, and the famous BBC eye for detail and quality makes this mini-series truly enjoyable--and I'm a guy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I rated it one star because the last disc in the set did not work.

It's not too fancy, and yes, as otheres have said the quality of the film is not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Oh how I love this series. The book, on the otherhand, I did not enjoy so much. However, this is a great adaptation and is a lot more exciting. Darcy (Colin Firth) is wonderful of course and so is Elizabeth. The costumes are nice and the acting is great. The DVD doesn't have great features though and it's not very exciting. But, to just own this series on DVD is really nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky DVD Transfer","review":"I'll limit my comments to the technical quality of the DVD transfer, which is, in a word, terrible. I do realize that material created for broadcast won't look as good as material created for theatrical projection. That said, DVD should easily carry studio-quality video, and this DVD is nowhere near that. It is gritty, squirmy, and unsharp. The BBC and A&E can and should go back to the ?16 mm? film sources to create a new transfer that does justice to an otherwise-excellent production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aussies - don't buy this DVD","review":"I am a big fan of this mini-series, which I have viewed many times on video. I therefore went to the expense (almost $A100) of buying the DVD for my new state-of-the-art home theatre. The quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen and is much worse than watching the video through the home theatre system. I am surprised that the BBC allowed its release. Of course I cannot return the DVD now that it has been opened but it is a complete waste of money because it is virtually unwatchable. If I had purchased the item here in Australia, I would be protected by law from having to accept it because it is not \\"of merchantable quality\\". However, buying on the net carries certain risks. Let the buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing","review":"This mini-series is my favorite of all time.

I have to tell you that the picture quality, compared to one I bought in the UK 2 years ago,is simply ATROCIOUS!

All the way around the characters are depicted in true form to Austin's novel. Putting aside the obvious main characters (Firth & Ehle), Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennett, and Bingly's sister were exceptionally well cast. Their exaggerations are down right funny, greasy, overbearing like Austin wanted to portray. Makes one want to wrinkle their nose disghust and shame but yet bellow with laughter at the same time. The cast chosen for this piece was perfectly done. I flatter myself; as Collins would say; to recommend this video series to anyone with social graces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition","review":"I would order again form this seller.

I'm sorry to say that previous reviewers are right. The \\"Special Edition\\" is--quite literally--a washout. While the sound is good (and widescreen Colin Firth can never be a bad thing), the transfer is terrible. The colors, contrast and shading apparent in the video or original dvd versions are almost non existent in this \\"special\\" version. If you're a widescreen purist (or just want double the Colin) go ahead and invest--otherwise, your other version is probably just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality","review":"I must agree with the other reviewer who complained of the picture quality.The packaging claims this version has been digitally remastered -- I can only conclude it has been remastered to make it look cr*p.The picture is very washed out indeed -- it seems to improve slightly on the second disc (or maybe my brain was adjusting.) To add insult to injury -- \\"the special\\" featurette contains footage from the unremastered version and you realize how lush the colors should be.Even jiggling with the color/contrast/brightness does not restore the detail you know should be in the picture.The picture quality is so disappointing that I even wondered if I had purchased a bootleg copy by mistake.

Not for me!Give me the Keira Knightley version anyday.The Camera work is brilliant and the soundtrack , original I might add, is beautiful! Sounds like Chopin.Oh, and the actresses are all WAY too OLD!They all appear to be in their thirties where the girls in the Keira Knightly version appear to be just that, GIRLS! Silly behavior from a Kitty who IS 14 years old is infinately more palatable that the same behavior from a 30 year old! And I really got tired of the matronly looking Lizzie pursing her lips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Viewer","review":"I greatly anticipated the arrival of my Pride and Prejudice tape set. I set aside the perfect moment and the perfect time so that I could indulge in all six volumes back to back. I had recently read the book and was quite excited to see it acted out. Much to my dismay the movie was a bit dull and in some instances hard to follow. Had I not read the book, I would not have had a clear understanding of some of the scenes. Overall, the movie contained many many elements of the book, but perhaps my expectations were simply too high. I did not find Jennifer Ehle particularly convincing as Elizabeth Darcy. She made annoying faces and appeared considerably older than her implicit age of around 20. It's worth watching, but it's not as intriguing as I had hoped. Maybe I will find another version of the book more to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooding on P&P","review":"It's all very well for reviewers to rave about Colin Firth's brooding Darcy. He does well enough, given that he has no-one to play against. The smirking, complacent Jennifer Ehle is so badly miscast as Elizabeth that the entire production is undermined. The shrill overacting of Alison Steadman and the (again) miscasting of Jane do not help. The book is far more subtle, with nuances completely ignored by the scriptwriter who prefer to have Elizabeth constantly striking pert poses as a substitute for the actress having to display any emotion. This is like watching Gone With The Wind without Vivien Leigh. If the two leads are mismatched the entire point is lost, no matter how elaborate the production values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hefty price=not worth it","review":"Don't even consider shelling out one hundred something dollars for this movie, its wonderful yes, but for the price of one you can buy this movie with Emma, Ivanhoe, The scarlet Pimpernel, The new Adventures of Horatio Hornblower, Jane Eyre, Lorna Doone, and Victoria and Albert off the A&E website, Amazon even sells this pack for less then this individual movie. Just search for the A&E Literary Classics - The Romance Collection Megaset.

My wife & I own the VHS tape set, and have watched them over & over, so I was very excited to get the DVD version in hopes that it would be even prettier & more lush than the tapes. But the lovely settings, rich costumes & etc are obliterated by the extreme over-exposed whitewash that the \\"digital remastering\\" has created. The characters all look like ghosts!

This is a superior high-definition transfer. The old VHS was absolutely terrible, and I suspect the reviewer may be clueless insofar as to what constutes cinema-like transfer quality. The VHS box was so lousy that it was the very reason I hesitated to buy this new Blu-ray.I needn't have worried, as every frame of this transfer is perfect--sharp and delicately balanced. You MUST set your HDTV to the proper color temperature of course, usually the \\"film\\" or \\"movie\\" setting.

I agree with the other viewers on the script, acting--this version is simply wonderful. However, the remastered version is awful. The colors are so overly bright that they are almost washed out. This DVD is almost painful to watch. I called A&E customer service and spoke to Vickie who had heard about the problem but had not seen the DVD. She didn't seem overly concerned and suggested the fault might be my DVD player. I am hoping that A&E gets a lot of complaints and then maybe they will do something about this problem. As for now, my advice would be not to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colin Firth...need I say more? Great Movie Colin Firth aside","review":"This movie is so amazing I've watched it so many times and I never get tired of it. I thought this was by far the best film adaptation of the novel. Colin Firth portrayed Mr. Darcy exactly as I pictured him in my mind. I loved all the characters and felt like the actors/actresses lived up the their characters in the novel. While the picture quality may not be that great (read several comments about it) it didnt bother me one bit. The locations they filmed were simply beautiful, the story and characters entralling, and the costumes and scenes eye catching....I didnt even notice the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third best \\"movie\\" of all time.","review":"Shocking to me when first I realized it, the A&E production of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is number three on my personal list of favorite movies of all time. Every character is perfectly cast and played, from Mr. Darcy to Mr. Wickham and from Miss Elizabeth Bennet to Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Not to mention Mr. Collins, a supremely entertaining character at whom the viewer will laugh with pleasure. If you enjoy watching \\"Emma\\", you will find \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" more richly rewarding for its greater story line and character dimensions and its happy ending. My wife and I have watched \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" at least once a year since it first aired. Next to \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"The Godfather Part II\\", I think that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most entertaining movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"The DVD set was just what I was hoping for. The quality was awesome and Colin Firth is now in my home 24/7, life is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie!","review":"This British mini-series is one of the best I have seen. The acting and character development was superb! This romance was well done and not only I, but my husband thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The scenery, wardrobe and choice of actors/actresses made this movie very enjoyable. I would highly recommend owning this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rework of Jane Austen Classic","review":"I am a typical \\"Dirty Dozen\\", John Wayne, \\"Open Range\\" kind of guy. But a number of years ago I was forced by my wife to watch the A & E production of Pride and Prejudice on VHS. Years later, the story works on me like comfort food. I have given the original DVD set, as a gift many times. This Blu-ray version has been remastered. The audio has been reworked and the soundtrack enhanced. I should complain about the film grain that now appears because of the clarity of the Blu-ray media, or that there are some artifacts visible in some scenes, but this is simply modern media surpassing the film and mastering that the original film was produced on in 1995. The audio clarity is much better, meaning the dialogue is easier to understand; and the remixing of the music bed has a positive effect on the emotion of the story.Enough of this sappiness. I'm going to go watch Tora, Tora, Tora."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession","review":"Having found the book, Pride and Prejudice, somewhat late in life, I was surprised at what a treasure it surely is. Having completed it once, I immediately began it again. And then in wishing so fervently for these new best loved characters to come to life, I searched Amazon for what might be available. This BBC/A&E miniseries is as much a treasure as the book itself. The cast is superb and the production is something of which I think Jane Austen herself would be proud. I have watched it as many as 4 times now, and I am still mesmerized by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice revisited","review":"The show itself is worth five stars. The DVD is not. I bought this for my wife's Christmas present. We love the show, had watched the VHS version over and over, and thought that the wide-screen DVD would be a good addition. The wide-screen and improved sound quality is really neat. However, the picture quality is so bright as to be washed out...compared either with broadcast or the older VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Edition DVD is Horrible","review":"My wife and I own the VHS version of this masterpiece and absolutley love it. The story is fantastic and the cinematography wonderful....however, the special edition DVD is horrible. The colors are washed out with dark objects looking like blobs. I'm attempting to return the terrible DVD at this very moment. Stick with the VHS if you have a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"Though the new \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Keira Knightly is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is beautiful, this version in my opinion is the best ever.

It sure made my flight go fast, as I loved every minute.I don't remember the last time I read a book from cover to cover so quickly and so enjoyably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the weak of conscience","review":"Galapagos is a no-holds-barred attack against our tendencies towards aggression and destruction, where the only hope for mankind is to start over from scratch. Of course, though this novel is by no means subtle on that account, if you're a Vonnegut fan, you should be used to this by now. Just think of it as a second Noah's Arc.Depressing as this sounds, Vonnegut's wit keeps a smile constantly on your face. As radical as his writing style generally is, this book pushes it even beyond his normal limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"This book was very funny. It has a lot of very interesting points of view that make me feel not quite so bad when I lack a little depth of opinion at times on things that just aren't that important. It was however, very repetitive. The basic one liner of the book is that Big Brains are useless... if you must read the whole book to get that through your head, go for it. You won't regret it I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Man 's Got Vision!","review":"As I read some reviews about this work, I do have to concede that this work is not perfect. Yes. You can see a lot of stylistic problems. Yes. Some of his characters are caricatures. However, his ideas are so creative that I am willing to forgive him all his faults and give him 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Untypically boring of Vonnegut","review":"Compared to the other 10 Vonnegut novels I've read, I found this one to be rather slow-moving. To further make it uninteresting, he repeatedly tells you what's going to happen looong before it does, which leaves you with \\"well it's about time that happened. no big surprise.\\" The characters never get fully developed either, which leaves you not really caring what happens to them. This is the lowest rating I've ever given Vonnegut."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"Having read all of Vonnegut's novels, I can say without a doubt this is the worst. The characters were boring and the premise was absurd. Give this novel a few billion years, and maybe, just maybe, it will evolve into something readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at his best","review":"Galapagos! What a disaster that was. To tell the truth this is my least favorite Kurt Vonecut book. It just isn't like his normal witty self. The book is almost serious. Although the story is gripping and addictive, the story drags too much on simple things. It is as far from \\"The Sirens of Titan\\" or \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" as possible. Definately not one of his best. My advice is: Put down Galapogos and go but \\"The Sirens of Titan\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites from Vonnegut","review":"I didn't find this book insightful, interesting, or very entertaining. It moves very slowly and doesn't really go anywhere which probably inhibits Vonnegut from really conveying his messages. I recently read Cat's Cradle, Jailbird, and Bluebeard and all were much better. Maybe I've overdosed on Vonnegut over the past few weeks, but I really shouldn't have to try hard to enjoy a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"The item is perfect.

He LOVES IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Galapagos: A Novel","review":"Another delicious bite from Kurt Vonnegut's imagination which I am delighted to at last own, instead of having to return it to the library. Received in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best book","review":"Galapagos is an interesting book delving into the genre of utopia prediction as only the cynical Kurt Vonegut can. His view of the future of the world is bleak and poignant, but this book, written in 1985, is no where near as funny as some of his previous works. Galapagos seems a bit drawn out and laborious, rehashing old themes that even in the 80's were probably not as pertinent as they could have been. It kept my interest because of the frequent references to the wildlife of the Galapagos islands, and not becuase of the supberb writing I have come to expect from Vonegut. If this is your first Vonegut book to read, then I pity you. Perhaps you would do better to read Slaughter House Five or Breakfast of Champions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish","review":"This is the only Vonnegut book I did not finish reading. I have read Slaughter house 5, cat's cradle, player piano, sirens of titan, and breakfast of champions and I thought they were all excellent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and no discernable value","review":"This was certainly a book that took longer to read than it should have. I got about as much out of it as reading the Jabberwocky.

I am certainly not going to get any more of this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover","review":"I'm sure anyone picking up this book will agree that it has a great cover: green and black, with a pinch of yellow for good measure, and a few words to top it all off. I really like how he decided to have his name on it, too. I wouldn't have known it was a Vonnegut novel if it hadn't.That Vonnegut is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say pointless?","review":"This book was just plain bad. Vonnegut spent two thirds of the book wandering about aimlessly. In the final third it's like he got sick of the book and just wanted to finish it, so it suddenly feels rushed. He makes a few minor points along the way, but I never quite caught what he was getting at. Also, while the lack of respect for time is an interesting concept, do not foreshadow when you already tell me what happens. It is ineffective. Style does not a good book make. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a pretty good book.","review":"This isn't exactly primer Vonnegut, but for fans, it's one of his best (best meaning ALL of them). At first glance, it makes no sense that humans would evolve into what is depicted, but by the time you finish it, you'll be throughly convinced. This somehow manages to be a optimistic portrayl of the future, while at the same time, being tragic in what has to be lost for a true human Utopia. Worth the money to read and re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Placed Jab at Humanity in Light of Evolutionary Theory","review":"I am a newcomer to Vonnegut, and this is the first of his books I had the pleasure to read. Vonnegut takes a satirical look at modern day humanity as he places a handful of (un?)lucky castaways in the role of the future of humanity. They alone turn out to be responsible for repopulating the entire planet as the rest of humanity has fallen victim to an infertility plague in the midst of economic turmoil. Who would have guessed that future generations would speak only a single language - let alone that of a little-known cannibal tribe. This and a variety of other strange quirks of the few survivors is all that future generations will inherit and have to look back at their past. Not that they would be interested anyways, that sort of thing only intrigues the big-brains of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite","review":"It was a challenge to stay interested. the first two thirds of the book were all over the place. one chapter he would build on characters/plot and the next he would talk about something completely irrelevant to the story. i've read many of his other books and they all were amazing. this one didn't feel like a story to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book!!","review":"When my Biology teacher told our class we had to read this book, I was really mad. The book stars out kind of slow but it is very fast reading from then on. The longest chapter is about 5 pages which makes it very quick to read. The story line is very interesting because it doesn't really follow the concept of time. It sort of switches off between the future the present and the past without any warning. I really enjoyed it! It also has alot of symbolism. It's a great book! Vonnegut is speaking at our school next month!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Vonnegut","review":"Big brains are our problem! Given the mess the world is in today, Vonnegut's message is more on target than when he wrote the book. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This is my second reading of Vonnegut, my first being his play \\"Happy Birthday, Wanda June\\" Anyway, I picked up Galapagos at the book store because the back looked interesting, and I finished it in three days (I only paused because the day in the middle was my birthday) Anyway, I really liked the book, it made me laugh and go out and get more Vonnegut books to read. Basically, it's about the end of the world, and how people survive it and how they adapt. I didn't find anything dark or depressing about it, and the lead character is Mary Hepburn (I guess Mary is symbolic. Maybe not, I don't know) Anyway, it's a good book. There were a few parts where I got bored, but at the very least it's a book I read over the summer, so if anything, it's something to do to pass your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our brains are too big","review":"1,000,000 years in the future our brains will evolve down to a size where they will actually be helpful to our survival.Human's brains are currently far too big to help us in survival. This is the main theme throughout this very funny book. Vonnegut addresses, in his typical style, how counterproductive the workings of our 'huge' brains are; how they trick us and make our lives much more difficult than they actually need to be.I was surprised to see all of the poor reviews for this book since I loved it so much.Thought provoking and funny. Right in line with his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterpiece","review":"\\"Galapagos\\" has to be one of the most brilliant books of the modern era.

I found Vonnegut's work to be an incredibly difficult read. He pays little attention to speed and character development, and his metaphors (I will bring up the \\"when the rocket that french kissed the radar dish\\" one) did not provide a clear image in my head as to what he had intended. I did think that his ideas were largely valid and that he had interesting points, yet he seemed so antagonistic toward humans and made all of his characters unlikeable, with features that became exaggerated to the point of being unreal. If you like abstract work of an unorthodox writing style, this book may not bother you, but otherwise I would not recommend it. I ended the book feeling like I had wasted a great deal of time and learned nothing, on top of being frustrated with Vonnegut's writing style and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly his best work...","review":"Galapagos is an O.K. book, but perhaps the worst of Vonnegut's books I've read. For beginners, I found it a bit difficult to get into the book due to its non-linear storyline. Sometimes this method works, like in Slaughterhouse 5, but sometimes it doesn't, which I feel applies to Hocus Pocus as well as this book. While the idea behind this book is interesting (showing the humoristic elements of evolution, and, I suppose, analogously showing the absurdity of other forms of progression such as tradition), the novel just seemed to be too long for such a single idea. While I liked the humorous elements typical of every Vonnegut novel, their comedic impact was increasingly outweighed by the monotony of the novel's exposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS","review":"I thought I was ordering a dvd to replace the vhs tape I allready had. So I was dissappointed. The condition seemed to be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"A relentlessly predictable, unfunny comedy","review":"I absolutely hated it! Not one chuckle could be heard out of me while painfully viewing this idiotic, cliche-ridden, and predictable exploitation picture. A blind man and a deaf man meet in a drug store, a murder occurs which the deaf of course doesn't hear, the bumbling duo is accussed of the murder and from then on you can see every single joke coming (the blind man driving a car, the deaf man not hearing some important details in the case, typically low-grade violence and clues to the murder which the team don't really understand since, needless to repeat, they are handicapped). Plus it carries its one joke for a ridiculous near two hours. Blind and deaf people are nothing like the idiots portrayed here. They are smart and important in their own way. I know if any person with these disabilties saw this junk, they'd be downright offended. At least the blind would be at an advantage since they wouldn't be able to see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dynamic Duo","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It walks the line between clever and juvenile as far as humor goes, but what a flick! Pryor and Wilder's chemistry is fantastic, as usual. These two have got to be the best comedy duo ever. They're both hilarious on their own. Sure, it might be a little un-pc to get laughs from handicapped characters, but I really don't think the film exploits that angle all too much. Most of the humor basically comes from alot of incidents of miscommunication. Richard Pryor's performance of the blind man is scarily realistic and well done. Wilder's once again the sarcastic wise guy he does so well. Most people have seen this before, but if you haven't, you shouldn't wait another minute. If you have seen it, see it again. Why not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious look at being handicapped","review":"Has there ever been a greater pair than Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder? This may be their best movie ever! Anybody watching this movie can remember having a conversation like the one where Pryor and Wilder are pushing the polic car into the Arthur Kills (\\"you swear a lot\\" - Wilder \\"F--ing A I swear a lot\\" - Pryor) This lighthearted comedy will make you laugh until you need to change your drawers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Know Why Everybody Hates This Movie","review":"Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are a scream! They bounce off of each other well, and are hilarious while doing it. In addition, Joan Severance positively steams up the screen, and displays exposive chemistry with Wilder.

Look for Kevin Spacey as the hitman, many may have forgotten his performance in this. For interest to Joan Severance fans: She appears topless in a hilarious scene. The catch is there are two versions: The one I rented doesent show her completely but I saw a version on Encore which showed everything. Besides that, this is a cant miss for Pryor/Wilder fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spokane viewer couldn't have said it better!","review":"This film is truly hysterical and why the critics hated it, I'll never know. Great performances by Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, and Kevin Spacey is a hoot with that mustache and accent. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic comedy","review":"Before '89 we already knew that Richard Prior was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived. And then in '89 he teamed up with Gene Wilder in 'See no Evil, Hear No Evil'. This movie is about two guys, one deaf, one blind, who are framed for a murder they didn't even commit. The acting is amazing, I mean what would you expect from Prior or Wilder, they even act like foreign doctors in one part! If I said anymore I would reveal many spoilers to you, so just get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamma Mia!","review":"Look no further than Sam Butera to hear how Louis Prima put the cool in songs like \\"Jump Jive An'Wail\\" and \\"Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\\". Butera's solo stuff is just as much fun thanks to great, wild saxophones, thumping drums and fun-time lyrics. This set covers that side of him and the slow, romantic, candle-light & wine ballads as well. If you've got Louis Prima's Capitol Collectors Series set, then you'll know how important Butera was. It's great to see this anthology: it serves up great music that's been absent from store shelves for decades! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not expecting this one","review":"When I think of Alec Empire....I think Digital Hardcore.

My work shift begins at 4am as I work full time and am also a full time student, so getting to sleep early is a requirement for me to be successful. Some nights I go to sleep before the sun sets. I don't know how I'd manage those nights without this sleep mask. It's very comfortable, does not obstruct your blinking at all, and doesn't get \\"hot\\" -- the material remains cool. There is a small area near the bridge of the nose where light can be seen if your eyes are open, but closed, you don't even notice it, unlike with some other products I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams are made of this","review":"I recently learned about \\"lunaception\\" and the concept of sleeping in the dark to create more melatonin fascinated me. I didn't really think I'd be able to sleep with a zorro mask on, but this little mask is actually very comfortable. I have had the deepest sleep since using it - normally I wake up all night long as our neighbor has a lovely and irritating sensor light on his porch. Not with this on... although I am sure I look like batman or a bug, husband tries hard not to goof on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niiiiiice","review":"Light weight and cool to wear. Seals out the light better than most, and its good if having something right up against your eyelids bothers you - you can even blink unobstructedly if ya want. Still, my eye sockets are very hard to seal and its not as good as my tempurpedic which molds better to my steep socket/nose curves. Tempurpedic however is very bulky, which not only makes travel less convenient but also makes it less comfortable when pressure from pillow. I use this one for travel and tempurpedic at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for travel","review":"This sleep mask was everything it said on the item description. The soft but molded shape easily conforms to the nose so that NO LIGHT peeps in. I slept like a baby on an overseas flight, despite lots of cabin light and movement. The case is a nice touch and keeps everything clean and easy to find. I highly recommend this sleep mask!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I bought this for my husband who just started shift work and who is very sensitive to light! He loves it.

It does resemble his mask and that is why it works wonderfully. It fits over the bridge of your nose blocking out all light. It fits comfortably and securely and I do not hesitate to recommend it. Wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mask","review":"This is my first sleeping mask, and I am pretty happy with it. I lived in an apartment where my room had no real curtains. So I had to be up when the sun was up, or tie a shirt around my head. However, I decided to get a silly looking sleeping mask. I'm glad I did.These are countered so that they stay off your eyelids. They do a pretty good job of that. They are comfortable and seemed to stay put. I have a large nose and they let in a tiny amount of light around the bridge of my nose, but this was only slightly noticeable when my eyes are closed.I haven't used this mask lately since my new place has wooden shades (yes!), but it is handy to have around if my wife is ready to go to bed and I still have the lights on. Plus, it is a great price. I'd definitely recommend this mask. After all, on the odd chance that it doesn't work well, you are only out a few bucks.Hope this was helpful. Sweet dreams. Let me know if you have any questions by leaving a comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got used to them","review":"I didn't like these at first. My previous mask had two straps to go above and below the ear. This mask only has a single, heavier strap. If you go either above or below your ear, the mask tends to slip out of position. If you go across the top of your ears, it stays in place, but it took me some time to adjust to the feeling of having my ears strapped down.Some reviewers complained that the nose contour tickles and lets in light. I found that to be true, but the light gets in only if I'm in a bright room. Wearing the mask upside down, so the nose is up at my forehead stopped the tickling and lets in about the same amount of light. As long as you don't mind looking like a teapot, this works well.On the plus side, the material is very light and breathable and 100% opaque. I like the contours over the eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessed","review":"I love this mask because I can still open my eyes and blink without being blinded by the light. It's total blackness.

I love love love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritated My Skin","review":"I initially liked this mask. I loved the price.

But the first night I tried and it seemed a failure. It's nice to have eye movement & it does it every well. Very dark inside too. Except the light that comes at bottom and chokes the nose.

Unfortunately, it is not as nice as I expected it to be. First, the space available for your nose is incredibly small. Only young children would have a nose that fits in there. As a result, light seeps in from underneath my eyes. Only when I press down on the bottom part of the mask does the light stop coming in. Also, the sides of the mask, where the strap is attached, are pretty hard. Sometimes they hurt the side of my face so I feel forced to take it off. All in all, I would not recommend this mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nose spoils it","review":"This is a well made sleep mask, and the materials are quite comfortable. The thing that spoils it for me is the contoured nose. I'm a 5'6\\" guy and I have an average sized nose, what I found is the contoured nose part lifted the bottom of the mask so it wasn't flush with my face, letting light in. It also restricted breathing through my nose, which was the real problem. Because of that I can't use it at all.I'm going to try cutting the nose piece out to see if it works better, which would make it much like the excellent performing but not well made Bucky 40 Blinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"After trying 4, WE love these! Seriously good stuff.","review":"My wife and I have tried several different masks (because I am too lazy to get dark curtains). I don't know what it is about these but they really work amazingly well. The nose contours make it so the nose doesn't get too much pressure (which makes light leak in for other masks). And the cup over the eyes keeps your eyelashes from hitting. And the velcro on the back, never had any problems with it coming off.

The molded nose area lets in light and because the mask is so large, the contoured eye areas aren't centered directly above my eyes. The material that the mask is made out of isn't especially soft. Microfiber masks feel much nicer. This mask's achilles heel, however, is the fact that it WILL NOT stay on at all while I sleep.

I've bought so many sleep mask but none of them were quite right. Either the material didn't block out the light or they didn't fit close enough and stay in place well enough to keep the light out. Until now, I'm thankful to say. The Sweet Dreams Sleep Mask fits perfectly without being confining. It's comfortable, light weight and cool and it's even contoured so that you can open your eyes unabstructed which allows for better REM sleep I'm told. I love it and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time reveals a flaw...","review":"I bought this almost six months ago and was very happy with it for about three months. It blocks the light almost completely (a little creeps in on each side of my nose as I have a rather sharp nose -- if yours is not quite so sharp this mask will likely block the light completely), doesn't impede your eyelids/lashes during REM sleep, and is soft and lightweight. I would have easily given this product five stars if I would have rated it within the first three months of use.However, the bottom edge, particularly near the nose, has frayed revealing two layers of fabric surrounding one of foam. Also, the band has lost most of its elasticity and no longer holds the mask tightly enough against my face.It doesn't look like it's going to last much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money if you have a small face/nose!","review":"I have been buying the really cheap satin eye masks from the local drug store that just have the elastic to hold them in place. I should have stuck to those, because this mask is just not the right fit for my face. I think it could be good for someone with a larger face and/or nose. On me, though, if I pulled it down far enough to keep most of the light out, the elastic band would be over my ears, which was very uncomfortable. Plus, it was way far down on my nose, which kept causing me to wake up and push it up. It didn't stay in place well at all, and I gave up after three nights of trying to wear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams is wonderful","review":"I have used a sleep mask for over ten years. This is by far, the best ever. I bought 3 and gave two away to friends. The contour nose keeps all light out of the mask. It is totally black if you open your eyes. Also the contour eye area keeps my lids from getting smashed as with other masks. The wide back piece is easily adjustable and so much better than the elastic that gets destroyed with hair spray. I recommend this highly as do the two friends I gave them to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blocks out most of the light","review":"I, like many other people who are buying these, work nights and sleep during the day. This sleep mask blocks out most of the light, but some does get through near your nose. I ended up pairing this up with a \\"Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask\\" and combined absolutely no light gets through.I use the dream essentials sleep mask underneath the sleep master and couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIGHT COMES IN","review":"This item looks good from the pictures but when I recieved and tried it out thats another story.Light gets in around the nose area because the mask has no support.When you don this mask light appears at the bottum of mask around the nose and lower eyes.They need to design a way so that the lower portion of mask will remain against your face.Right now there is no support so there is always a gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleep mask","review":"lite-weight and comfortable when you first go to sleep. It does allow some light to intrude round the nose area when you turn on your side.

Other than that, it's comfortable and dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible experience","review":"This is the worst sleep mask I've ever seen. I am wondering why the review was not that bad which seduced me to buy it. But I certainly regret for my decision. It worked OK at the beginning but soon degraded when the inner cloth detached and the string became loose.Now it is completely unusable and it is only 3 month.

The mask itself works very well to block out even very bright lights and it's nice that the areas around each eye are convex to allow for little to no pressure directly over the eye socket. The problem I have recently seen develop is the soft inside layer of the mask peeling away from the major part of the mask. This has been very frustrating as I like the functionality of the mask but the quality seems to be lacking...have bought $1 masks that lasted longer than this mask did."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality sleep mask but a bit heavy","review":"overall, the mask fits comfortably and blocks out light. It doesn't sit or put pressure on the eyes like flat masks do. The only problem is that it's quite heavy, so unless you bind it very tightly (uncomfortable), when you turn on your side, the mask doesn't stay in place or pushes away, which is both uncomfortable and lets light in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe just me....","review":"I honestly wasn't satisfied with this product and don't even use it anymore. The strap that goes around you're head is extremely uncomfortable at where it meets at the back of you're head. Also light easily comes in where you're nose goes, and I have an average size nose....so I was unhappy with that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blindfold Design","review":"This is a very comfortable mask that fits my face nicely.

It completely blocks out the light. I also like how there's space for your eyes to comfortably engage in REM sleep. The earplugs are a bonus as I also have problems with noise and they're made to fit anyone's ears. The only problems I have is I wish there was a better way to secure these other than using velcro straps. They get stuck on things. Also, the mask can get kinda hot when you're wearing it, but other than that I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life-span","review":"I was thrilled when I got this eye mask, it had everything I was looking for. It was molded, so it was super comfortable, and very light on your face. And it kept out absolutely all light. However, after only two weeks of wearing the mask every night, the fabric all started peeling away. It continued until the fabric on either side of the mask was completely unconnected from the foam. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacing the Mask My Wife Took!","review":"When I fly, I need total sensory deprivation: I already suffer from anxiety, and the increasingly stressful experience of flying on commercial airlines does little to relax me. Among other techniques, one way I stay calm while flying is to try to sleep through the flight, and sleep mask does wonders with helping me do that. After trying others, I eventually discovered this particular sleep mask, which I used for years until my wife decided to give it a try on a recent flight. Since she has decided to keep it, I am now ordering another.What's so great about this sleep mask? It all has to do with the convex eye covers. When you are wearing it, there is no pressure on your eyes, and you feel much more like you are in a dark room, rather than having a blindfold on. Of course, it blocks all the light, and the straps are easy to use and keep the mask secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"several problems","review":"At first I was optimistic about this sleep mask. It seemed soft and comfortable enough. Once wearing it, it wasn't big enough for my head. The velcro in the back had to be at its lowest possible setting in order to be loose enough to be comfortable.The nose indention did not fit my face at all.Light went through because of this.After wearing it for the first 2 nights I had to return it. It wasn't working right. It came up off my face several times in the night, and I don't roll around or move in my sleep. It was uncomfortable around the ears.Didn't need the earplugs, was just a bonus which was nice, but the mask was just so bad that it didn't make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection.","review":"I have owned many sleep masks, but they all pale in comparison to this one. The contour is as close as one could possibly hope to get to the face, which blocks out more light than anything else I've used. Yes, if it is broad daylight with the shades pulled open and I open my eyes and look toward my nose, I can see light. It's not as good as actual total darkness. But it's the next best thing. No light ever bothers me, even when I lay on my side (when my pillow touches the mask). The amount of light leakage is minimal no matter the circumstance. And I never realized what a difference it makes to NOT have fabric pressing down on my eyes. I sleep so much better, and as an added bonus, this doesn't destroy my eyelashes. I'm sure this will eventually need to be replaced, and I fully intend to get another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, except for Velcro.","review":"I hate to give this less than 5 stars, because it's totally become my blankey for daytime sleeping, but the Velcro in the back does catch my hair. Also, if you have very long eyelashes, they do bump up against the inside of the eye cups - not enough to be very annoying, but enough so you notice. Doesn't seem to interfere with R.E.M. sleep, though. I've never had deeper or more restful day sleep than I have with this mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"This was initially one of the most comfortable and effective sleep masks I had used, but when it began to fall apart (outer fabric and inner padding started to separate completely), I threw it out. With the outer fabric separated from the inner padding, the mask was no longer comfortable, and there was no way I could really either fix it myself or deal with it. It ended up in the trash after about 5 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good eye mask for traveling","review":"I recently used this eye mask and ear plugs on flight to Tokyo. They worked excellently. And the travel pouch helped me keep these items together and handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sleep mask.","review":"This us the most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. The contoured eye area prevents the mask from touching the eyes, which is always bothersome in other masks, and the adjustable band with velcro, permits a perfect fit around the head, in contrast to others that always feel too snug. Though a tiny sliver of light appears at the bottom, this is absolutely no problem. The darkness in the morning, when my room is otherwisevery light, is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - missing ear plug","review":"This item marketed with 2 free ear plugs - arrived with one. This is extremely annoying - especially when coupled with the fact that the mask is clearly of very inferior quality and workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mask is not 'breathable'","review":"The concept is good. Room around the eyes so its not pressing against the eyelids. The problem with this mask is the material. It was sold as breathable fabric. This is a lie. It is polyester or some sort of synthetic material. I broke out with acne after one wearing and I do not have acne or suffer from breakouts I am in my 30's and have not had acne on my face since being a teenager )."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect sleep mask (for the price)","review":"I think this is a great facemask, it is really cushion-y and since the mask has pockets for your eyes, you can blink even while you are wearing it. The only complaint I had is that a tiny bit of light gets in through the bottom of it. But my nose is big, so that explains it. I didn't like the earplugs, because they did not fit me (bummer). Overall, for the value, it's great, you can't see any light through the mask itself. I would recommend it to a friend. I think it is actually a pretty sturdy mask, if you take care of it, it will last you, those people complaining about poor quality don't take care of it (or they got a different mask. Mine was awsome). Don't Hesitate, click that add to cart button and get this mask!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"My first disappointment with the mask was with the fit; there is a gap around the nose. But given that my nose is narrow. and it was only a small amount of light getting in, I was willing to overlook that. Of course that would may have been more of an issue if I was trying to sleep in a brighter environment but I was using mainly to keep the morning light from waking me up.However after only a few weeks of use, the inner layer of fabric separated from the outer. I may be able to repair with some fabric glue but I will most likely just look for a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well designed and highly effective","review":"I used this product for a short duration when I was forced to sleep in a very noisy, bright environment. The comfort level is outstanding and 99% blackout. The key things they did were: a) Use very soft material b) use elastic with just the right amount of tension so you weren't squeezed and hair wasn't pulled c) there is a depression where your eyes go so your eyelashes don't touch the mask. This last point is surprisingly important for comfort. I can't speak to long term durability, but for my limited use the experience was exceptional. Oh yeah, the earplugs were rated to block a high decibel level. Bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best eye mask out there!","review":"I've purchased several of these eye masks, not because the quality is poor, or it falls apart quickly like another review stated, but because I take a mask everywhere, and I end up leaving it behind.I have a street lamp outside my bedroom window, and this mask blocks it out perfectly! It also blocks the light that comes from my husband watching TV, and the lights in my bedroom.The mask fits more comfortably than any I have tried, and I have tried quite a few. It's very light and the material it's made from is smooth.I suffer from migraines which make me very sensitive to light and touch - this mask it perfect. It doesn't feel to heavy on my face and it does a great job of blocking out 99% of light. I do find that the mask moves a bit as I move when I sleep, and sometime I wake up and there's a bit of light slipping through at the nose area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sleep mask, OK quality","review":"Bought this mask to replace the crappy ones that hotels give away, which fall apart after a few weeks.I really like the design, and the ear plugs they send you some of the most comfortable I've ever used. The domed eye covers are another huge benefit.My complaints are with the quality. There is a thick foam center section and two slightly thinner fabric pieces over either side. The side touching my face separated from the center foam within a couple months. Normal skin oil / sweat may be to blame for that though. A couple months later, the outer fabric is starting to separate too.It doesn't really seem to affect the functionality of the mask though, the foam is only marginally less comfortable than the fabric. The strap is really strong still too, so I'm happy with it, would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar","review":"Pros: light-weight, the nose contour helps cut-down on light entering from belowCons:1. the strap is too short, and the velcro is overlapped in the back, which for me is an uncomfortable lump on the back of my head (even with pillow), and gives me a headache sometimes2. the too-stiff molded item shifts a bit when I sleep on my side, resulting in light coming in3. the nose portion is too small, and I have a normal-size nose; hence, light comes in at bottomHey manufacturer: let the strap go around the head and put the velcro on the mask itself, and make the item thinner around nose and reinforce it with a wire that the user can bend to custom fit the mask around the nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"First off, it might be OK if you sleep like a mummy - always on your back, and never moving.

Before I slept with the mask on, I ran a test with the lights on, first off this mask is an absolute blackout with one exception. I was able to find a slight light leak around the nose piece which was so insignificant that I literally had to look down to notice it.

Most sleep masks have a small elastic band that stretches out quickly, making it worthless, or lets light in around the nasal area because they don't fit correctly. This sleep mask is perfect in many ways. It has a wide, sturdy elastic band with a velcro fastener that allows for comfort, fit, and longevity. It also has a nose hood to prevent light from disturbing your sleep and even has convex pockets so the mask doesn't touch your eyes or lashes while you sleep. On top of all that, it's made of a soft, durable material that is a pleasure to the skin. I've used my sleep mask for awhile now and I can find nothing negative to say about it. In fact, I can't sleep without it! Whoever designed it really knew what they were doing, and I heartily recommend it. It's a great product, worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a sleep mask that works","review":"I actually bought the pink \\"women's\\" version of this sold at WalMart before finding out that Amazon had it in black - and cheaper too!

We were tent camping and the sun doesn't really set at all during the second half of June in much of Alaska so I wanted something that would keep the light out. I have never been someone who could wear a mask when I sleep because they always touch my eyes and I can feel them and it keeps me awake. These, though, have no such problem! They are as soft and light as can be and the eye areas are cupped so they do not touch your face at all! Yet they blocked out 99% of the light and allowed me to sleep even in the land of the midnight sun. My daughter also used them and loved them. They are adjustable and even come with ear plugs (though we did not use them) and a little drawstring case.

It works well, very well in fact. There is NO light going through the material and it is very soft. However, it is formed foam and as such it does not adhere to your face, there is some space where light comes in by the nose but to clarify this is NOT A CUSTOM MASK!!! It is also too small for my head, where i have about a half inch of velcro keeping it together.It does the job. Are there better products?

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired man","review":"The mask worked sort of well at first. But the whole product is pointless since it doesn't fit correctly. Light is peeking in too much. It only works if it sits on your face perfectly, and it simply will not do this. The elastic strap also wears very easily and quickly. Once this happens it becomes pretty loose.

If I adjust so the mask does not rub it slides off very easily. It also is slightly too small around and is tight. I have an average sized head so anyone with a larger head should not buy this product. It also allows light in at the nose. I cannot even use this. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited about this. I'd had a contoured sleeping mask once before and wore it until it wore out, so I was glad to be getting another one. The one I'd owned before came from a different source and a different manufacturer. I finally received this one and, when I went to bed I put it on. It squeezed my nose. Really. The shape of the nose near the bottom caused it to partially pinch my nose closed. I am a woman with an average nose. If it squeezes my nose, it would be worse for anyone with a large or wide nose. Anyone with any sort of sleeping problem probably knows that your nose needs to be as open as possible in order to sleep well. I already have stuffy nose problems, and this mask only adds to that. Because of the nose squeeze and pinch, I can't wear the mask. It causes breathing problems. I have to breathe out of my mouth. I will be returning the mask to the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this sleep mask!","review":"over the years, i've owned quite a few sleep masks. one of the worst ones was the pillow type that pushes against my eye lids and lashes. this one, however, doesn't touch the eyes so i don't feel any pressure. it really does block out all the light and the strap is comfortable, too. i love this mask so much that i almost don't care how long it lasts but will be happy to purchase again to have 1 or 2 on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"The sleep mask seems to be working fine, though I haven't used it much yet.

There were only 2 sizes available at my time of purchase: medium and XS.. They should allow more flexibility with the sizing. Also, there is a bit of light let in with this mask at the bottom.

I have a normal sized head with poofy curly hair and there was a marginal piece of velcro left to stick when wrapped around my head.It is oddly shaped. To center the eye pockets makes the nose area crush your nostrils closed, so I have to place it higher on my face, which defeats the purpose of the eye pockets.

I had used one before that had just a little separation around the nose after several months, so I decided to buy a new one. Unfortunately, the new one started to fall apart after less than a month of daily use, and now two months in it's half separated. It still works, but it's quite annoying that it's fallen apart. It's not like it's being warped and twisted into coming apart, but just being worn for a few hours a day. I don't really expect high quality at this price, but I think it's not unreasonable to have a product that at least lasts for more than one month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but doesn't last forever","review":"I just bought my second one of these masks. I can't sleep without one because of the plethora of light in my apt in mornings. I've used it every night and its definitely the best mask I've purchased. I love the contours for the eyes so its not pushed up against your eyelids. It also really blocks out the light, nothing can get in, when its still new.I bought my first one a year ago and about 4 months ago I noticed it really became to stretched out to stay on my head anymore and I noticed the shape of the mask began to flatten. I received my replacement yesterday and comparing them saw how stretched out it had become but hey for the price and for the amount I've used it. Definitely worth it.I don't have use for the carrying case and the earplugs are standard ones that I wouldn't use more than once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Dream Sleep","review":"I'm not wearing my new sleep mask. Firstly the shape doesn't seem to fit that well. The contour actually makes it uncomfortable as it presses against my nose especially if I want to turn my head. Secondly, the velcrose fastener gets stuck to my hair. If you sleep only on your back and don't move it is probably fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap is uncomfortable","review":"I am very sensitive to light when I sleep. Until now, I have been relying on cheap eye covers handed out on long international flights. After discovering this product and reading the reviews, I was very excited. The product looks like a small bra. The material is similar to a bra with padding. It is comfortable and provides excellent light protection. However, the back strap that goes behind the head is uncomfortable. It has a velcro joint to adjust the size of the strap, and this lands right behind my head. So, when I sleep on my back, I can feel it pressing against my head and it is uncomfortable. Bad design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"I returned this mask after 1 night of use. It did not work for me at all. Light was still considerably let in, it tickled my face if I moved slightly, and most importantly, even with the contouring my eyelids still touched the mask, which is a deal breaker for me. I returned it for the Bucky's 40 Blinks mask, and that works much better. I found there to be no need to cover the nose, which the Bucky's does not. This might work for some, but not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sleep mask,","review":"This is the best sleep mask I've found, it's comfortable. fits well with the Velcro strap, and best of all it keeps the early morning light out so I can sleep.

But my fiancee had an issue with the nose fit -- he has a fairly wide, puggy nose -- and ultimately we're returning it so we can find something less fitted.Basically, just determine if your nose looks like the shape of the one in the picture.

I just can't sleep when it's so bright! I've tried hiding under covers or under pillow, but the light seems to find it's way in somehow. This mask works wonders! I'm not use to wearing masks while sleeping so I figured it would take some getting use to having something on my face while sleeping. But, once you get past that, all you see is total darkness. I especially like the eye bubbles so you don't feel anything pressing against your eyes. If you like sleeping on your side, your pillow may force the mask in a way that light enters. I've been able to situate myself so this doesn't happen. Good Mask for you day-dreamers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Better!","review":"I love these. These are the best I've ever had.

I was concerned about the outdents for your eyes, but it worked well. The bottom line is, they are cheap.

I'd spring for something a little more expensive if you actually want a product that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, short lasting.","review":"I need a sleeping mask regularly because I live in a dorm with roommates who wake up and turn lights on before I'm ready to start my day. This worked really well, for a while. I'm sensitive to anything pressing against my eyes, and I'm sensitive to getting headaches if the strap is too tight and hurts my ears. This has an adjustable velcro strap to prevent ear pain and the contoured eyes keep the pressure away.Problem is, I've been using this for about half a semester and the lining came undone, so the nylon layer that touches the face has completely fallen off. It got me through for a short while, but not nearly long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"The concept behind this mask is quite good. Allowing you to open your eyes under the mask separates this from most other sleep masks. However, they are very poorly made. The mask pieces are somehow glued together and the mask I have had for all of about two monts is falling apart as the \\"layers\\" of material used to make the mask are separating. Instead of stiching the parts together, the manufacturer cut corners and glued them. I do not want to have to buy a new sleep mask every few months. I will look elsewhere for a better made mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"First of all this product is identical to the \\"Lights Out Contoured Sleeping Mask\\" by Spacific Essentials, except that this mask costs less. I ordered both, and they are identical.Second, the Velcro closure on the back of the head-strap forms an uncomfortable 'bump' on the back of my head that makes it almost impossible to sleep with this mask on.Third, the mask does leak some light in around the nose.I am still looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Dreams Indeed","review":"Planning a trip to the UK, I researched many different sleep masks to use on my flights. I liked what I read about Sweet Dreams Sleep Mask and gave it a try. Boy, I was not disappointed! It is really soft and it blocked out the light COMPLETELY. Sleeping on a plane is never an easy task, but I slept very well since I was completely in the dark. Upon arriving at my destination I had absolutely no jet lag and I believe it was purely because by using Sweet Dreams Sleep Mask I was able to sleep and get on the right time zone. One complaint is the band going around your head to hold it in place is a bit long for a small head. Since it has velcro I was able to make it work though. While it is excellent for travel, I wouldn't recommend it for home use if you are a side sleeper because it doesn't stay in place very well then. If your in the market for one definately give this a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last a year","review":"Mask is very comfortable and did the job for the first 6 months or so but then slowly started coming apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and soft","review":"This eye mask is soft and comfortable.

The thing that's good is that it keeps your eyeballs from having pressure applied to them but again it looks to all passengers around you like you are sleeping with a bra on your face.

I re-read a lot of the opinions about attractions, meals, shows (once I returned from DW)and agreed with all of them.

A must-have for a DW trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of this Book!","review":"This is an incredible book for the Disney World Traveler. It contains vast amounts of information about all aspects of Disney World. However, it needs to be clear that the book is written for two different interest groups: those looking for irreverent but pertinent and relatively unbiased information and the aggresive, compulsive, Disney maniac, owning a good pair of track shoes who would consider his life a failure if he saw less than everything at WDW and got more than four hours sleep at night. It is apparent, regarding the bias issue, however that the authors while not starry eyed, are very much Disneyphiles. Most people can have a wonderful time by arriving to the parks later in the day and just wondering around. The book helps in separating out some things you miight want to skip, selecting hotels, and picking restaurants. The book has a ton of info, and maybe the pocket version would be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ 'EM ALL....BEST ONE GOING","review":"Written by those who know Disney.

Best of all, with Disney's constantly changing policies, programs, etc., this book offers the ability to constantly check for up-dates to it's already expansive information throughout the entire year!

He genetically engineers them and places them in a park. But after he invites a special team to sample the park something goes bad. This movie has great effects and music.

The island should've been full of life, but you didn't get that feeling. It's almost like Spielberg's making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters; giving them suspense but no release. -Or a dino movie with no dinos. Neat. If they were so proud of their CGI effects, why didn't they show us more ?. -Ray Harryhausen at least gave you monster value for your money, with superb stop motion animation for all to SEE.

The movie continues its rollercoaster thrills as the story winds down to a thrilling raptor battle in the kitchen.

A lot of the scenes are amazing, especially the cup of water rippling, and the raptor looking in the kitchen window. The best scenes are the T-Rex chase and the velociraptors in the building. Although the scientific believability of the movie is iffy, I really don't think that the story is that bad. It's not too in-depth, but enough to keep you interested. The movie draws you in and you feel scared with the characters, and relieved when they finally get off the island. Arguably the best in the series, I really hope they don't kill Jurassic Park with the release of the 4th movie next year. The 3rd movie lacked, and I hope the 4th is better.

Even the book, by Michael Crichton, was written after the first movie in order to have the storyline for this follow up. The story is a little weak but the special effects are almost as good as in Jurassic Park (due to, I think, the much less time they had to prepare this, compared to the first).

Richard Attenborough is a rich man who creates an island theme park full of cloned dinosaurs, and is one of the first films to deal with the serious issue of cloning. He invites a team of scientists to sign off on the island, which includes Sam Neill and Laura Dern as paleontologists as well as a mathamatician, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Attenboroughs 2 grandkids. Of course, the park breaks down, and the dinosaurs run amok, creating some of the best scenes in movie history.

Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept on an island with plans of making them an attraction. They get loose. The velociraptors are fierce. T Rex goes on a rampage. I felt that not enough species were represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurus? duckbills and ankylosaurs?

They are all valid, and they all have some worth.However, I do believe that in essence, the movie is well intentioned. The idea was to utilise computer generation graphics to bring us dinosaurs - which it has achieved. The plot is sturdy enough to support this original premise, and the action enables us to watch the slick work without, on occasions, even realising the non-existance of the creatures.If you can accept that original premise, and realise that you are not going to get 100% accurate dinosaur behaviour (as if we could tell...) then this movie is definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark in Sportswriting","review":"I was moved to tears by S.L.

A disturbed character as a result of childhood trauma (injured in a fire), he recorded this album in the mid-1960s whilst still young. It's beautifully played, well sung and most of the songs are good and very mature for someone of his age. Particularly good are 'Carnival', 'Blues Run the Game' and (especially) 'Here Come the Blues'. There are five extra tracks from the mid-1970s, presumably at a point when he was not too ill, as he went through a long period of mental stress and illness soon after putting out this album. He died a few years ago.Had his illness been properly diagnosed and treated, would he have been able fully to fulfil his potential? It's too late to know now, but this album shows his great talent.If you like thoughtful solo singing and guitar-playing, this is definitely one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Americana","review":"MacDowell was highly regarded in his day, but now is known for a few piano pieces and his second piano conerto, which occasionally turns up. Andre Watts and Van Cliburn among others have championed it.MacDowell was a very accomplished composer in a post-Lisztian/pre-Impressionistic vein. These compositions lack only melodic memorability to make them staples of the repertory.These are old recordings from the 1960's made fresh as new by great restoration. Karl Krueger provides strong advocacy ably backed by the great Royal Philharmonic of London in its heyday. Well worth a hearing.Bravo Bridge for rescuing them from the attic."},{"rating":"2","title":"bah and add a half star","review":"I dont see what the problem is besides maybe the lyrics of dont cry wolf and who got the production credit .

I loved this tour origionally, and when I saw this tape for sale felt it was a good way to capture some of the energy during that time period.If you want to see three highly talented musicians perform their classical inspired works with a full orchestra, then buy this tape. The sound is good, the songs fresh, a glimpse of 1977 by the style of turtle necks worn by the conductor,but the time goes fast watching it, the music and sound is very good, and the tape is enjoyable.

My mindset has changed from thinking that it's just a good idea to thinking that it is essential to help my child reach her full potential. There are a lot of statistics in this book that can get a little dry at times, but there are also a lot of great inspirational stories of how reading has truly changed and improved people's lives.

I buy this for all my friends and relatives who are new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read-Aloud Handbook, 2001 edition","review":"I have read three of Jim Trelease's Read Aloud Handbooks. Every one is excellent and has fresh insight and stories to tell. The need to read aloud to children of all ages cannot be oversold. Every time I read a new edition, it remotivates me to keep reading with my children and my students. When people say they don't have time, it's because they are busy watching television or the kids are spending time on video games and computer, or running to and fro to soccer and dance. Kids won't pick up books voluntarily if they see it as a drudge, or are not exposed to books. This new edition is a fresh look at a continuing problem. If you have read the others, you need to read this one as well. Mr. Trelease brings in new relevant trends that have brought about changes in reading to the population as a whole, and trends that discourage reading. His list of read-alouds is also updated to include wonderful new books that are capturing children's hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much chit-chat","review":"All I could think about during this video was \\"Is he ever going to be quiet and why does he repeat everything he says twice?\\" Verbal instruction is good, but at times Baron sounded corny and very \\"fitness\\" motivated. If you are just looking for a workout, then I guess this wouldn't be bad, but if you are searching for a video that goes beyond a workout then don't look here. Don't get me wrong, I admire Baron's attempts to bring yoga to the mainstream, but this video doesn't stand out and doesn't offer anything different than the other \\"Power Yoga\\" videos out there. In fact, during the middle of the video I began to wonder if I was in a Bikram class! The balancing sequence was exactly the same, pose for pose. So in the end, if you asked me if I would recommend this video the answer would be no. But what do I know?

My weaknesses are the standing balancing poses and I was very glad to see a segement on this. Yes, I would much rather watch him doing it rather than the students, but I did find his talking actually helped me with proper form and to maintain the form. Just like they do in a real class.

It was a staple of his childhood, and somehow I managed to miss the boat during mine. It could have something to do with the six year age difference (doubtful), or the fact that he grew up in California and I in Maine; who knows. Doesn't change the fact that my first experience was of pure joy and wonder. It is a tradition for us to watch this every Christmas, so this year I surprised him with the DVD...

Once I saw the new cover art on this title, I mistakenly assumed that it must be a revised version of this classic TV special with the \\"Kermit\\" scenes restored. What it turned out to be is a case of misleading packaging. Yes, there is new cover art, but it's only on the cardboard slipcase over the DVD. Once you remove it, you find that the artwork on the actual DVD box underneath is from the 2005 release. In fact, that's what this disc actually is; it is EXACTLY the same as the 2005 edition, no more no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically fun for all ages!!!","review":"Awe the Muppets!

There is a major drawback though, the sound quality isn't the greatest. Yes, it's better than both of Bolin's 1976 concerts(Live @ Ebbet's and Under The Northern Lights), but not by much. The performance itself blows the above 2 shows away, Tommy jamming away at mostly blues and fusion classics. There aren't that many Bolin penned songs to begin with, I think the only one is Hok-A-Hoy. There may be one other too. It's a real treat hearing some earlier works like Whiskey Headed Woman, Lady Luck, Dreamer and Boogie Chillin' a few years before they became studio cuts and searing live staples. In all, a must own for dedicated Bolin fans only you have to bear with the fair to poor sound quality. LONG LIVE TOMMY BOLIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curd Duca - Switched-On Wagner","review":"A fascinating album -- taking the basic notes from various Richard Wagner compositions, Curd Duca reprocesses them into an electronic format. The resulting album, Switched-On Wagner, has those wonderful Teutonic melodies that made Wagner famous redone entirely in machine music. It's intriguing to hear a classic tune, such as the majestic and operatic Ride of the Valkyrie (from the original Ring cycle) morphed into \\"Nervous,\\" a mechanical music-box sequence. Tannhauser and Siegfried receive the same treatment, their complex scores reduced to single tones. It's an interesting experiment, though your patience with it will depend on how highly you regard Wagner to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VERY EARLY DUKE","review":"I don't know how many films Wayne did for Lone Star Productions but I do know that these Platinum Discs are worth their weight in gold. For my taste these early westerns had a certain real ambience about them that are missing even in the films of the 1940s. These early films are just one step ahead of the silent films, and at times you have stretches of music to cover the action. It's just great.If you want to see John Wayne, when he was still becoming John Wayne, you gotta watch these old classics. I got on to them through Encore Westerns several years back and then later bought these Platinum discs.Another note, the later LEGENDS OF THE WEST (5 volumes) by Platinum also collects all these older movies. No matter which sets you have they are mighty interesting, on some of the Lone Star series of films George 'Gabby' Hayes, 'George Hayes' as he was then known, shows up as Wayne's co-star. Great stuff.Semper Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving and contradictory","review":"I read this book in an attempt to understand the other side of the animal rights issue and came away frustrated by the lack of documentation and the completely contradictory nature of this book.

If you are looking for first person tales of experiences as a flying cadet during World War II, look elsewhere. The book should more accurately be titled \\"Flying Cadets of the 1930's and Other Aviation Miscellany.\\" It consists of biographies of Billy Mitchell, Hap Arnold, Tooey Spaatz, and other military aviation pioneers, some minimal recounting of the careers of some cadets of the 1930's, and a brief overview of WW II. This book is rife with typos, egregious misspellings, and both technical and factual errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed and disgruntled","review":"all i can say is that i bought this cd based on what i heard on medicated and like all the rest of cd's ive bought lately, this one too has taken a dump. its starts out ok, but doesnt get any better. im a fan of a constant rhythm not random noises thrown out to take up cd space. better short and sweet then long and trying. all in all it doesnt compare to roadrunner's usual line up and its not even worth whatever u pay for it, trust me it ... that bad. it seems like it was hurried and it could have been better, bottomline............potential they have, but i wouldnt give them another chance...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 years too late","review":"Yeah, another bunch of moody white suburban/middle class mooks who scream, whine, and constantly try to act macho like there's no tomorrow. Sorry guys, but if you had come out 2 years earlier, you would have been the rage at Ozzfest and had your faces on the covers of Hit Parader and Circus Magazine. Nu-Metal is dead, and your 5 minutes of recognition is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that orginial, not that impressive","review":"I definitely disagree with the other reviewer that claimed that this album is too heavy for nu-metal fans. I would consider it a nu-metal album, not hardcore or death metal and I don't knock all nu-metal, but this album left something to be desired. At least the vocalist doesn't try to rap (If you're into that check out E-town Concrete or Candiria) and there are some decent, if uninspired, riffs on the album. There is some industrial/electronic influence on the album which I like, but the lyrics to most of the songs are pretty cheesy. The band sounds similar to Chimaira and American Head Charge in music and vocal style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those Cubes are never coming out","review":"We are huge water bottle people and bought 2 of these thinking we would love ice that could go in the bottle. Well, it makes ice that is the right size but there is literally no way to get the ice out of the tray. The cubes are a few inches long and you have no leverage to loosen them. Twist all you want, you aren't getting them out. You can put hot water and melt them down about halfway and get them out but then it defeats the whole purpose. Don't waste your time or $$$ Just put half full bottles in the freezer instead and use those when you want cold water."},{"rating":"1","title":"enormous waste of $$$","review":"you can't get the ice out of the tray!! to loosen the ice you have to run hot water over the plastic. a) this wastes an extraordinary amount of water b) the ice then falls out & down the drain or you still have to use a fork or something to punch the ice out. this product is completely useless. run, run far far away, don't look back and warn all your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch your fingers with this one!","review":"I gave this 1 star because it does indead make tube shaped ice cubes that fit in a bottle, but to get them out is horrible. You are supposed to run hot water over the tubes to loosen the ice and then remove the bottom cover to push the ice through. I have yet to take that thing off with seriously pinching at least one finger. Huge waste of running water and time. I wish had a fireplace so I could burn it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about Style","review":"I have the 3rd Edition of this book, and it is a fantastic reference for all things furniture. The number of photos and drawings is amazing. Much of what you'll find is English, French and Italian, but there is ample information on many other styles as well. This is also a definition book, so if you're looking for a certain term or explanation of a component, style or entire style era, then it's all here in one spot. The Modern Furniture section is adequate, and gives a basic outline of its history and features.My book is black and white, and I'm not sure if the new edition is in color at all. I would suggest having another reference available, such as Miller's \\"Furniture\\" to get a better idea of the colors, materials and workmanship of the various styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"WRIGLEY TIME MACHINE","review":"I BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD LOOK AT HOW IT WAS AT WRIGLEY FIELD, THE FANS, AND THE HISTORY OF THE CUBS.

THE BOOK IS HUMOROUS, WELL TOLD, INTERESTING, NOSTALGIC AND DOWN RIGHT ENTERTAINING. I REALLY ENJOYED THE GREAT NOSTALGIA THIS BROUGHT BACK TO MANY CUBS FANS INCLUDING MYSELF.

I could understand if it was connecting one generation to another. However, Sandberg and Grace were contemporaries, while Banks preceded them by well over a decade.

I thought she was one of the hottest girls in all of show business, not just rock and roll. Her jet black hair, her intense angry eyes, those sneering red lips, that raspy voice. She had such a raw sexuality about her along with a passion and drive that made her seem remote and unattainable.Music was everything to her.I was thrilled that this DVD was produced--I think any fan of her will love it--but I'm taking a star off for an entirely non-musical reason: I miss her black hair. That butch blonde crew cut doesn't work for me.It may sound completely superficial of me but I want my Joan with that black hair. What would Elvis have been without his black hair and sideburns? (At least there's one video of \\"I Hate Myself for Loving You\\" included in the extras from a 1985 MTV New Year's Party of the Joan I remember).I still love you, Joanie, just bring back your hair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Performance, Poor Movie","review":"I've been a fan of Joan Jett since I first heard her in 1980. My low rating is not a rating of her performance. This video is poorly directed and poorly cut. It's difficult to watch, and there even seem to be either some unintentional drop-outs or deliberate bleeps at a couple of points. As far as I know, it's the only recorded live performance of JJ available, so if you're a fan, you'll get it and probably enjoy it. Just don't expect a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live DVD!","review":"Joan Jett is an amazing musician, but she really shines live! There is this unexplainable energy that accompanies her when you see her live! She's more rough and edgy than on her CDs! It's great, and this DVD gives you a hint of this energy! I have seen her live, talked with her and even hugged her, so this is a great memorabilia for me! She sings most of her greatest hits in this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Child Rocks On","review":"I Love Rock n Roll, especially when you have a rock icon like Joan Jett to watch. This DVD is a definitive buy!Within this DVD you can see and watch Joan and her band perform all the classics that have put her in a place where female musicians should be proud of. She has paved the way for many new and upcoming rockers. But I sometimes wonder where they all are?Joan has never given up on the punk rock music she loves, so get out your credit card, and make this purchase. You will see what a real female icon is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best female rocker","review":"I think this dvd is the best and only Joan Jett live concert available so far and is really her great performance with all our favourite songs. I do not understand why she did not get more popularity being the best female rock star in history and I predict she will be very very great and much more well known in the years to come. She deserve as much attention as Micheal Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable for all kids!","review":"I love this product! I bought it as a gift for my niece who is one. She may seem a bit young for this, but my 2-year old son & nephew (much to their fathers' chagrin) both love this toy at Grandma's house. I think because of all of the colors, and the fact that they can empty and refill the large teapot with all of the pieces. They love to organize:) This teapot has an adorable sparkly lid and each piece has great detail that differentiate this tea set from the other disney tea sets I've seen. Only complaint is that some of the stickers appeared to be peeling off of the pieces (but this is likely due to the cold weather conditions it was shipped in). Overall--adorable & fun item."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that's where fairies come from!","review":"My granddaughter just LOVES Tinkerbell! She really enjoys this one.

Not as good as I would expect from disney. Cute but didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Tinker Bell expected.","review":"Tinker Bell had a more developed personality when she didn't speak in Peter Pan. She had a lot more spunk and was overall a better character. It wasn't so much the voice, as the writing. Also had issues with one of the unintended themes of this movie that was also seen in A Bug's Life, dealing with the fairy caste system and that new ideas are not acceptable unless everyone gets into a bind. Just do the job you were assigned.The animation was done really well and the voice talent was fine.My 2.5yr old daughter loves Disney's Peter Pan and didn't want to finish this movie. She probably would've accepted the movie if it didn't include Tinker Bell. Borrowed this movie from a friend; so glad we didn't purchase or rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"English language ONLY!!!","review":"I was extremely disappointed to see that this Blu-ray is only in English.

Someone took the \`bad girl' out of Tinkerbell! Who is this perfect little angel type thing because she sure ain't the nasty little Stinkerbell that collaborated against Wendy and caused a whole ton of trouble for Peter Pan in the original story. I used to love Tink, even considered having her in Ink but not this version, no way. What happened to the naughty, devious, mischievous, conniving sprite I knew and loved as a child. Glad we got this on PPV because I would NEVER (see all caps?) buy this for Baby L, no way. Don't mess with the classics, Disney, you don't have to sanitize everything and make it PC- there's room for the imperfect. I say God bless the flawed, no one is perfect. And for Hanukah this year, my \`God Child' will be getting Tink, the Original (unless Disney's got it back in their \`vault'!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie for family","review":"It's hard to find a good family movie but this one is the best I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 2 Year Old Daughter Cannot Get Enough","review":"Our 2 1/2 year old daughter just loves Tinkerbell and has already watched it 5 or 6 times.

They should include those Pixes previews. My niece and nephew love them but... that means we have to watch them online as long as we could??? Come on. I hope you include them on next Tinkerbell movie. You better.Also odd part was when Tinkebell returned that music dancer to window... that where Wendy was... That makes me wonder where Peter Pan came in???

Thank you for make this a special Christmas for me and my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute meaning-just isn't Tink","review":"The meaning behind the movie (be yourself) is great, I just can't get passed Tink's voice- it was the wrong choice. My Husband and I came up with scenarios (I use his account) 1. Tink loses her voice eventually when She meets Peter 2. A Fairies voice is so tiny that to humans it hears like bells. I know they are making more than one movie-but why? unless they plan on showing how she finds Peter as a baby and takes him to Neverland. Wendy was also in the movie at the end (thats who the music box belongs to) Tink doesn't like Wendy... I dunno, it just seems sorta off. Still my 16 month old daughter loves it and wants to watch it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly dissapointed","review":"My 4 year old daughter was looking forward to this since she saw the first commercials.

If you were merely disappointed at the lack of artistry in today's \\"physics-based\\" 3d animation, it would be another. If stripping out the best of western lit's essential messages is somewhat troublesome, it would be another. But pitching the classics as teenage mall characters with sexy clothes that would never be permitted in a high school is a part of the sorry ruination of culture and morality that truly illustrates the central mission of this greedy corporation. Better read your kids Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" if you want to see the end of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"To be honest, I thought this movie would be lame. But just a few minutes into it I changed my mind. The story is old, but with some new twists, and the characters are good. There are memorable moments as well: Tink gently convincing a mouse that together they can accomplish a monumental task; the coming of Spring to London, courtesy of the fairies (some clever stuff here, and beautiful music as well); and my favorite, Tinker Bell trying to teach a baby bird to fly. The expressions on the bird's face had me literally howling with laughter. Excellent animation, beautiful colors, gorgeous backgrounds, fine music, and the story is well handled, often amusing, and sometimes quite touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"It seems like my daughters have been waiting for this movie to come out for years!

Having been a fan of Tink since I was a child in the 60's it does not do the forever young fairy justice. It's too 21'st century teenage crap, should have stayed true to fairydom and not put the human teen twist into it. The illustration is nice and well done, but not to the true likeness of Tinker Bell.

This book gathers under one cover most of the major philosophical systems of the Hellenistc Greeks-- the Epicureans, Stoics and the Skeptics (always valuable to read as an antidote to dogmatism). Neo-Platonists (from whom the Christians copped their theology) are also represented--i.e., Philo and Plotinus. There is also a section on early Chrisitan \\"thought\\"-- \\"With our faith, we desire no further belief\\"-- Tertullian ( of 'credo quia absurdum' fame). Having all this variety of philosophy and anti-philosophy in one book will give you a good mental workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Joke !","review":"Seriously, I still can't figure out how this book made it to printing: flat clichés, poor development, useless references to God / religion, and 70 pages which could have fit in just 1 sentence, and even so it would have been a lame one ...\\"Be good, do you work, and make good choices in life\\" ...No Kidding!!!As the book says, your greatest power is your power to chose, and since there are many many other self-help books which are far far better than this one, so apply your Greatest Power and chose to skip this sad joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bran Van 30000 Drinking in L.A.","review":"I am satisfied by this article, by the service, delivery and description of the same one.

Turquoise Moon is my favorite, but the whole album is great to me. I also have \\"From the Redwood to the Rockies\\" which is also a treat. I will say, I was never a big fan of guitar music until I listened to Craig. I will invest in his previous albums to have a better understanding from the other perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is much better than this!","review":"Generic smooth jazz from an artist who can deliver so much more and should be allowed to do so. The few glimpses of individuality on this Cd are buried under layers of smooth jazz cliches: that same drum track that shows up on everything Paul Brown touches, unobtrusive sax solos, and string synths. This is a pleasant unobtrusive listening experience, presumably for background music at upscale social events and corporate offices..his others have been full of bright moments and inspiration and provided a soundtrack for the parts of my life that were not spent in a cubicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Craig heading with this?","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers - I was hoping for more of the 'raw Chaquico' eclectic guitar as he presented in Acoustic Highway and Acoustic Planet...don't get me wrong, this music is beautiful. But there was definitely an ethereal quality to those albums that is missing now. Will somebody please tell Craig to do some more music like that, PLEASE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychonavigation 2 - Namlook/Laswell","review":"This is probably the deepest, darkest ambient I've heard. The album continues the theme from Psychonaviagtion 1 of 'psychic communication with deep space entities', but the opening track ('Under Heaven') lulls you into a false sense of security with its blissful, beatfree floatiness. Then we're into dark territory. The rest of the album has a incredible atmosphere - pensive, desolate, sometimes terrifying. Melodies are minimal - there's a lot of bassy fx whirling around, and track 3 ('The Fate of Energy') is the only track with beats, which suddenly kick in with Laswells weird bass. A staggering feat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for Everyone- Good for Body and Spirit","review":"I bought this yoga video because it didn't look all new-agey and I got an even better surprise when I did the work out. It was awesome! Baron is a great motivator and makes yoga easy,even for an uncoordinated guy like me. I've always thought yoga was hard but this video has changed my mind. Now I look forward to the workouts. Glad he has level 2 & 3 out already as well. Check them out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Different Tape","review":"I formerly had the video \\"Total Yoga\\" by Tracy Rich, which was a fantastic yoga video (I accidentaly misplaced it). I decided to try a new one when the time came to purchase one. To be frank, I HATED this video. With all the other partipants in the room, the yoga seems almost cultish (very different than Total Yoga). Baptiste does not do any exercises, and his bandana (?!?) and lack of muscle tone are very unmotivating. He also neglects to teach the proper 3-part breathing technique which is crucial for proper yoga exercise development. Do yourself a favor, and buy a better video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it was instructional","review":"I borrowed this DVD from a friend who didn't like it because she found the host annoying. The host indeed, was annoying.

The first six bands are ho-hum, something to skip through just to get to the seventh band which begins selections from Carmen. So half of the CD is enjoyable, too bad it isn't the first half!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate title","review":"I thought this film had everything before getting it: National Lampoon humor, Vanessa Angel (see 'Kingpin' available on Amazon--she's the hottest female ever born...), and the fact it was filmed 2 miles from my home in Ventura.In the event(as the Brits say), it was dreadful. Not funny, no surfing footage to speak of, no Vanessa Angel that I could discern, it was unfunny, unsexy, and uninteresting.If you want surfing, get 'Endless Summer'. If you want National Lampoon humour, get 'Christmas Vacation'; if you want Vanessa Angel, get the aforementioned 'Kingpin', all available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap","review":"This was by far one of the worst movies I've sat through in quite a while. I can only wish I had the hour and a half of torture I endured back. It's a story set in 1984 after high school graduation. The main character has his custom made surf board stolen and he and his friends set out to find it. Joan Jett is listed on everything but has only 3 scenes for a total of about 5 minutes of face time. Lucky her! I'd be embarrassed to have anymore than that in the film. The beach scenery is the best part of the movie. Do yourself a favor and pass on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT-DATED METAL!","review":"This CD would have been great if it were released in the 80's. I gave it 2 stars-one for the cool cover and one for effort! The majority of my METAL collection is from the 80's but i'm really picky when it comes to adding somethng to it. The sound is just too unrefined and the production is a bit weak. I hope that their next release will be much better than this one. If you like bands like EARLY \\"Judas Priest\\", \\"Forbidden\\", \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Y&T\\" or just the RAW 70's & 80's sound, you'll probably like this. Don't expect any fancy or intricate arrangements. You won't find it here. I wouldn't consider them Power or Progressive Metal. They're more Hard Rock than anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Start snapping your fingers!

I burned this book lest it would fall into the wrong hands. The author's english composition skills are among the worst I have ever seen. The book reads like a very bad translation from another language. It has absolutely no logical structure, in fact, the author seems to have only superficial knowledge of his subject. The section on backup/disaster recovery is absolutely horrifying. It you wish to waste your precious study time then please by all means buy this book. The author apologizes to his family in the introduction for all the time spent on the book while he should be apologizing to the reader. For an example of how an MCSE book should be written you should check out the TCP/IP book from Prentice Hall in the same series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great No Frills Workout","review":"I liked the workout. The DVD is not packed with special features or an aesthetically pleasing set (if you want that, check out Power Yoga with Rodney Yee), but I got a great workout that left me centered but also made me sweat.More importantly, even though I've used several yoga dvds before (Rodney Yee, Crunch Yoga (one of my all-time favorites), Bender Birch (difficult, I've only tried it once)), I actually felt like I was learning a new approach to the practice. The moves, taken by themselves, are not new. But his cueing and instruction flow and make me think about emphasizing different techniques as I go through the standard sun salutation poses.Worth a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beginners class of ashtanga yoga","review":"I thought I was buying a level three challenging work out. However, Baron says on the DVD that this is a beginner's class. It certainly wan't challenging for someone looking for more advanced yoga. I didn't realize that this was an ashtanga yoga disc. I much prefer the flowing vinyassa style.I found his style of speaking to be a bit harsh - not very spiritual or inspirational. The positioning of the yogi's wasn't really good- they were all facing one another in a line and it didn't allow very good camera angles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped take my practice to the next level","review":"Baron Baptiste is one of the inspiring, authentic master yoga teachers of our time.

The privileged life for a few in Shanghai, contrasted with the starving masses eking out a living in their midst. Draconic measures, executions and riots, an emigre community divorced from the reality of life in China. In seeing these pictures you see the beginning of the end of a regime--to be substituted by another of unknown pedigree. But the heartening thing is that through the pain and suffering you do not see people giving up. Look at these pictures and get a shot of adrenaline!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Depressing shots of poor people in distress and the violence of the final days/months of the long Chinese civil war.

Masterpiece and Unprecedented."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unsung Classic of the 1990's","review":"Sadly, Ride is no longer with us, but this album can still amaze those who have yet to hear them. An essential piece of music for those who like \\"Brit-pop\\", and for those who enjoy Stones/Beatles-ish songwriting. This could be my favorite album of the decade. Now if only guitarist Mark Gardener would release something new, and co-guitarist Andy Bell would rework his current band Hurricane #1 (too much like Oasis, Andy-- ditch that lead singer!), maybe I wouldn't feel so sad that Ride's dead and gone. Rest in peace, boys, and rise again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - best album Ride has made.","review":"Carnival of Light is a progressive, guitar-driven melodic album that compares favourably with the best of the Stone Roses, Charlatans, and The Verve type material. More earthy than their previous albums, and bearing some 70's riffs to drive their ethereally pensive song-writing.Black bird flying in the sky... Please don't look me in the eye... You are very very lucky. Its never easy to find me...If you've found \\"Carnival of Light\\", you have found a gem which should be a standard in any record collection. The band Ride is one of the best kept secrets of the 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surpsingly, I love it","review":"At first I was a little puzzled by this album. Truthfully, it's a departure from their earlier, shoegazer psychedelia.What we have here is an experiment with a more organic sound. It fits well with the label \\"Brit Rock\\" that was commonly used in the 90s to describe groups like Blur, Oasis, Suede and Pulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown away","review":"I was introduced to this band while browsing in a used C.D. store. The clerk was playing it and after listening to 3 or 4 songs I bought it then and there. Every song is unique and makes for a thoroughly ejoyable listening experience. I play it in it's entirety at least twice a week. 1000 Miles and Natural Grace are classic. Rolling Thunder has a Moody Blues/Beatles feel about it with Moonlight Medicine possessing a kinship to a Stone Roses piece. Definately a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ride found some Deep Purple lps in the basement....","review":"The qualities I usually associate with the band Ride...euphoria, mesmerizing bulldozers of fuzz -induced bliss, narcotic melody...are nowhere to be found on this record. Instead, it sounds like the band wanted to move away from the shoe gazing maelstrom of sound that turned people like me into nearly rabid fans, and experiment with the heavier psychedelic sound that Deep Purple was famous for. Though they pull it off admirably, you won't even find anything as good as \\"Hush\\" on this release (which is a shame, since most certainly could have pulled off a FAR better cover of the song than Kula Shaker managed to mangle!). If you find yourself constantly blasting \\"Smoke on the Water\\" out the windows of your '72 Duster, you may enjoy this albulm...but if you are expecting to find something akin to the glory that is Ride's \\"Chelsea Girl, don't bother....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ride's least-inspired LP is \\"Carnival of Light\\"","review":"Though some fans like \\"Carnival of Light\\", this is Ride's most contrived and unoriginal piece of work. Ride were one of the UK's best bands of the early 90's, but \\"Carnival of Light\\" shows them trying to sound like the Rolling Stones. All of a sudden they have this 70's retro thing going on, and the songs are not as strong as classics like \\"Today\\" or \\"Twisterella\\". Avoid this one and buy either \\"Going Blank Again\\" or \\"Nowhere\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near","review":"Nowhere near their former glory. What bathos--one of the most swirlingly spirited bands of the 90s opts to ape the Stones and Kinks. Ride rode in the wrong direction here.

I don't enjoy the direction they took...totally retro. I sense the band wanted to take a new direction, but didn't know where to go. In any case, look for the other releases by Ride, especially the highly-underrated \\"Today Forever\\" EP. Avoid \\"Carnival of Light\\", though.

The dogs are fun, but unless you are a major dog lover, don't bother. The \\"hero\\" is a smart-alecky ex-cop turned dog trainer, who has a snarky, married lover and is continually being harrassed by her uncle by marriage, a corrupt sherrif who tries to frame the \\"hero\\" for murder because he disapproves of his affair with a married woman. The writing is abysmal. The author would benefit from some 3rd grade English classes, because he seems to have forgotten (or never learned) the basic rules of grammar that most 3rd graders learn. Some books are interesting enough that bad grammar and sentence structure can be overlooked. These are not among them. The plotting is simplistic and the resolutions are telegraphed far in advance of the (blessed) ending. Save your money for a really good dog book, such as those written by Susan Conant or Laurien Berensen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I'd hoped for","review":"As both a lover of mysteries and a dog trainer, one of my clients thought that I would greatly enjoy this book. I am sorry to say that I found the writing sophomoric, the plot simplistic, and the attempts at humor fell very flat. The dog training \\"tips\\" which my new client found so fascinating were very worrisome to me. I actually brought the book into my training classes as examples of what not to do with dogs. If you enjoy dimestore novels with almost comic-book plots, then this would be an enjoyable read. If you're looking for a serious mystery, then I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better quality","review":"I bought this item after a bit of research over the net.

The threads are unraveling and as of now, the bag is not usable, because handles might break off. This has happened only after a normal usage and normal loads.

The fact is, however, that while instrumentally this recording is just as good as others have said, Eliades Ochoa handles lead vocals throughout; and, despite the talk of \\"his wonderfully ripe voice\\", he's just not a singer. His voice would be good enough to demonstrate what he was after to a real singer, but that's about it. Or again, the tone is astringent enough to add some good bite alongside somebody who's a lot more mellifluous, but this is not a voice that most people would want to hear out in front, which is where it is. (Cf, in a very different genre, Hatfield and the North.) And all too often, it's out of tune.When I listen to this CD, I think of the title of a certain Zappa instrumental album (\\"Shut up 'n play yer guitar\\"). And then I quickly take off the CD and put on a disc by Antonio Machin or somebody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another Dull Compilation!","review":"This album has some great tracks by chillout faves like the brilliant Nitin Sawhney, Gotan Project and A Man Called Adam.

At the back for this book is a wheel that spins and as you read through the book you spin the wheel so that all the \\"little ones\\" fall out of the bed. My son (1yr) loved this book and was in awe of the spinning wheel. However, the wheel is just \\"set in\\" the back page and not attached so it very quickly becomes difficult to turn the wheel. After about 10 reads it was nearly impossible to spin the wheel. This took all the fun out of reading the book, the while point is for the little ones to disappear off the bed.

Having performed the necessary surgery I found that everything works perfectly.

It leaks around the rim, where the orange lid meets the opaque cup.

The new documentary is good, if a little self-serving. Sound quality of narration is weak and needs closed captioning. Extra interviews and photo albums are excellent.

I feel like I'm gettig old but I'm only 32 damn it and I don't wanna have to search for these guys on adult contemporary radio. Del Amitri rocks! Granted their lyrics would go largely unappreciated on some of these moronic rock stations but come on. Band's like \\"Matchbox 20\\" and \\"3rd Eye Blind\\" really stink in comparison with these guys. It annoys me to see Del passed over for these trendy B.S. bands. They get all the air-play in what should be Del Amitri's place. These guys are an original great bluesy rock'n'roll band. They still sound hard edged yet smooth and very warm with an impeccable feel for catchiness (if that's a word) on this CD. I wish I could say something other than the obvious... Del Amitri is probably the best band, lyrically, vocally and musically, with the best all around songs, for their type of music (timeless)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best effort","review":"Waking Hours and Change Everything are two of my favorite albums. Twisted has one of my all-time favorite songs (Driving with the Brakes on). I admittedly had very high hopes for this album, which might explain my disappointment. Del Amitri's real strength lies is lyrics and music that illustrate the darker side of relationships. This album is just too happy. Bring back the misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal And Repetitive","review":"I bought 'Some Other Suckers Parade' because I had heard a handful of Del Amitri songs on MTV during the years, which I all found pretty alright.But the album is boring. It's poppish rock with tiny aspects of folk. The singer is good, the musicians are OK - but the music itself is so uninspired and unoriginal.Why didn't they just release a single? 'Some Other Suckers Parade' contains 2 or 3 melodies, with 14 different (and banal!) lyrics. Only exception is the closing 'Make It Always Be Too Late' which has something, without being superb.If you like this style, I will recommend you The Rembrandts instead of Del Amitri. I find it difficult to write that this album is bad, it's just uninspired and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Version Review!","review":"I am a huge Del Amitri fan. So my review is off a big fan who at this point is knit-picking. The album, as are all Del Amitri albums, is great. Again, as before the music and the lyrics are awesome. If you have not heard a Dels song before, not only listen but check out the lyrics and picture a story. My one problem with the album is that many of the songs seem a bit too short.

This thing just sounds good, it can go from dark and moody, to bright. It can go really deep in to reverb country, and yet when it does, the signal does not get all muddy.I had a Marshall Reflector. It's reverb was very weak, and would get muddy. Generally just zapped the quality or dynamics of the original signal.Line 6 has a good pedal here. If you are looking for that old Fender Spring Reverb sound this one comes pretty close. Plus, there is a generous handful of other usable sounds that do sound very nice as well. Cave might be my favorite.Nice adjustably with the 4 parameter dials too.Overall, I'm totally pleased, and the fact that it's reasonably priced is just icing on the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke only after a few uses","review":"Really enjoyed the effects made by the petal, disappointed it broke only after a month of having it.

Why nobody bothered to edit this look at the crowd down to just 5 minutes I don't know because it does get boring after the first 5 minutes of that. The only other problem that I have with this concert video is that during every song and everything that is said between songs there is a Spanish translation caption on the bottom of the screen, which was very distracting for me. It takes up almost 20% of the screen at times.I don't speak spanish myself, but for those of you who don't understand English, just Spanish, this aspect of the video might appeal to you. For the rest of us English speakers, if you can get past this constant captioning, you will enjoy this music video. This concert took place in an amphetheater outdoors, so the sound isn't perfect, but it's still pretty good and the picture is very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doobie Brothers Live at Hawaii","review":"I was really disappointed with this DVD.

I had just visited Dr. Vliet at Herplace Clinic in Tucson and found my hormonal levels to be way out of whack (as I had suspected) and I am now on a regime to get back in balance. The effect of testosterone is a fascinating one, in conjunction with the other hormones of estradiol and thyroid in particular, and if you ever wondered what a wonderful dance these hormones do and the roles that they play in achieving a healthy balanced state - this is a must read. I also recommend the other book I have read by Dr. Vliet, \\"It's My Ovaries Stupid\\" Don't be put off by the silly title - all her books are full of documentation and references and she has certainly done her homework. In my opinion, she is the preeminent clinician in this area and should be taken very seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible recording, bad interviewer","review":"As an avid Bon Jovi fan, I was greatly dismayed to hear this interview cd. The british interviewer didn't know anything about the band, and all he talked about was Jon, as if he was the only one there. It was so bad it was funny. They were laughing at the kind of questions he was asking. It was cute to hear Jon's voice though, when he was young. Half of the cd was actually inaudible. It sounded like the microphone was on the other side of the room, and there was tons of static. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it is incomprehensible. The interviewer actually calls Jon, \\"Jonbon\\" at first.

I have been a Bluegrass fan for 50 years but this DVD is a sad representation of what was advertised. For example, Johnny Hartford was once a fabulous banjo player, but in this DVD, his talents are confined to dialogue only. In fact, most of this DVD was down-home chatting in the absence of any form of quality sound. E.G., Some guy I never heard of sits next to a river somewhere and talks about banjo playing (he can't do any of it)while strumming a guitar - that is the entire theme of the DVD. Video quality stinks and sound quality and content is terrible. This is no Eric Weisberg (Deliverance)equivalent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns","review":"This book begins with a suspensful first page and continues to draw the reader into the story all the way to the end.

The best thing I can say about the cinematography and sound editing is that there aren't any instances of glaring incompetance.But it's softcore, and all that stuff isn't supposed to matter, because we're all watching it for the great sex scenes. Right? But there are no great sex scenes! Sure it's got Amy Weber and some other attractive women, but what's the point if all they do is briefly pose for the camera and the \\"sex\\" could be more accurately described as \\"naked people hugging and kissing each other\\".This thing was made in 1995, when people were starting to figure out how softcore movies should really be done.

Little more than a vehicle for lots of sex and flesh, the ball gets rolling pretty quickly.The only reason I bought this film in the first place was because of Amy Weber. Amy is one of the more notable models (IMHO), and well worth the price of admission.Oh, you want plot? Not much there, I'm afraid.Jeff Griggs is the \\"Psychic Detective\\" (and not a very good one). While attempting to solve a murder mystery, beautiful women keep throwing themselves at his feet, for some unknown reason.

It was incredible how relevant the cards were for each of us. Since my 2 daughters are only a couple years away from going to college, I ordered 3 decks to give one each to them and keep one for myself.

Cindy and Robin have out done themselves. I will be looking forward to more from these authors. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Password: Death","review":"This book gets you from the first page. Everything about this book is hot. When I started it I could not put it down and was disappointed when it ended. You yell for Bill and Laura to finish Robert off.

I look forward to the next installment of Bill and Laura and their next adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"This book really makes you think. This particular copy was my Dad's when he was in college, but he let me have it when I got older. I absolutely love it! There are all sorts of logic problems in the book, and even the 'easy' ones will sometimes have you scratching your head.My favorite section is the cross-number puzzles. Some examples of clues: 'The sum of the digits is the square of a perfect square' or 'First three digits of 4 down rearranged'.Other types of puzzles include determining the ages or street numbers of a group of people based on certain facts (often with conditions such as 'when speaking to someone older than themselves everything they said was true, but when speaking to someone younger everything they said was false'), finding the order of a group of people on tests, finding the the scores of football (soccer) games, and solving long division problems when all the numbers have been replaced by dashes (another one of my personal favorites!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I was a little worried based on the reviews being so up and down, but I have to say that after using this product it worked just fine.

Give it a go and add them to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the first shall be the BEST!","review":"Well, it didn't get any better than this for the Bangles. The guitars on this baby really shin, shimmer and flat out cook! The singing is great without being too sweet (re: \\"Everything\\"). The songs are great as well. Michael may have been more of a force on the other 2 studio releases, but Vicki, Debbie and Susanna are at their best on this puppy. A Paisley Underground classic! Great music to listen to on a long drive. The other 2 studio albums were over produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bangles' best album","review":"This is the best album, complete with great group harmonies. it's hard-pop at its best and the bangles at their best before the tensions in the group started to tear it apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"MINORITY VOICE","review":"I am definitely outnumbered. Most people liked the songs on this collection. I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bangles at their absolute best!","review":"All Over the Place is a masterpiece. Every song on it is a classic. The jangly guitars and the four-part harmonies are what set the Bangles apart from other artists from the eighties. I don't know why songs like Live, James, Dover Beach, Tell Me, Restless, and Silent Treatment were not released as singles, because I'm positive that they would have all been big hits. The one and ONLY drawback is that Michael Steele (the bassist) did not sing lead vocals on any of the tracks. Her voice is so beautiful. Even so, I would recommend this album to any fan of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take To Trip Back To The 60's","review":"The Bangles first full length release mines the sounds of 60's, specifically the British Invasion era groups. The band's vocals are shimmering throughout the album and the opening track \\"Hero Takes A Fall\\" is the best thing they ever did. \\"All About You\\", \\"Live\\", \\"James\\", \\"He's Got A Secret\\" & the appropriately titled \\"Going Down To Liverpool\\" all take you back to the Swinging London heyday. The band would take a more mainstream pop edge with their next release, Different Light, but on All Over The Place, they recorded a great, power pop album that relives the sprightly and fun music of a different era."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"At one point Trzoniec says you should start with a train set.Then,he recomends ''o '' gauge over 027 for a small layout,and tells us to buy all new trains,in o gauge.

You will notice that the original Hulk is a paltry 7 feet tall, not the 12 foot movie CGI. Anyway, the book reprints the three parts of the first Hulk comic book along with two later key episodes so that any not totally familiar with the character's development can catch up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fright Night","review":"When i was little, this movie had my scared and laughing at the same time.

Whether or not this practice is morally repugnant is one of personal choice, but to suggest, by proxy, that they better buy at this price or forever be \\"out of luck\\" is suspect.As for the movie itself, I like it. It has a tongue and cheek feel with some great gore. Roddy Mcdowall hands in an excellent performance and the vampire next door story runs well from beginning to end. It's an 80's movie that was on the \\"B\\" shelf with mostly unknown actors, barring of course Mr. McDowall, it transcended its genre and budget. When I saw it as a teenager when released to theaters I was very surprised by it and I think it has withstood the test of time.FYI, for those who know what I am talking about, an HD Quality version is available online for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME 80's HORROR FILM","review":"I don't write very many reviews but I feel I have to write one for this movie as it holds a very special place in my heart. I saw this when it first came out and went back to see it 2 more times!!! Since then I cannot count how many times I have watched this wondeful movie! If you like horror movies and not just blatant gore than this is for you! Every actor is fabulous. The special effects are STELLAR and it is just a damned great story too! This takes me back to very special time in my life when I was the same age as Charlie, the lead character. I adore this film and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! Not much has topped the absolutely horrifying andgruesome makeup on Amanda Bearse towards the end of the movie and I doubt anything ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite vampire movie from the 80s","review":"Who doesn't like Fright Night?...I haven't met one person yet that didn't enjoy Fright Night. I for one, love this movie and think its one of the best vampire movies from the 80s. Its kinda hard to believe that Amanda Bearse went from this..to Married..with Children....holy smokes!..lol...anyways, again as i said, this movie tops the 80s horror right along with Halloween..etc. etc. and should truly be in your horror collection..a true classic for all time, and remember, they barely play this film during Halloween as well...when is the last time you saw it on TV?...think about it!..thats why this is a must have!. Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fright Night (1985) Bluray","review":"I wouldn't sweat that 'Limited to 3,000 copies' Twilight Time version of FRIGHT NIGHT(1985), especially since it's not an official release and I've known for quite some time that a commentary with the director(Tom Holland) and actor(William Ragsdale) exist for the eventual Bluray disc paring + more Extras. This is a just a \\"bare bones\\" disc with nothing special save the transfer of the film itself. The high pricetag folks are paying for this version is ridiculous and ill advised.

Roddy Mcdowell is a great contrast to the teenage scene as a washed up actor turned vampire killer who with his english accent ads a great flavor to the movie. The movie is filled with real exotic scenes of sex and night music that every teenager dreams of!. watch it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only second to The Lost Boys!","review":"I think this was a great vampire movie with sexual tention writing all over it!

It would be a perfect movie to watch around Halloween with some friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marshalltown, Iowa","review":"This movie is destined to become an all time classic. The soundtrack is also worth listening to with its rock/disco sound. To Three Rivers, Michigan: The songs you asked about are: \\"Good Man in a Bad Time\\" by Ian Hunter; \\"Give It Up\\" by Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King; and \\"You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside\\" by Autograph.

Not to be missed!","review":"\\"Fright Night\\" is exactly that--a night full of the very best frights! Directed and written by horrormeister Tom Holland, \\"Fright Night\\" tells the very stylish tale of Charlie Brewster and his next-door neighbor. What's the significance of that coffin in the basement? Why are there gorgeous females entering the house and then exiting...in a body bag? Charlie wants to find out! So, he solicits the help of \\"vampire hunter,\\" Peter Vincent, played to the hilt by the late/great Roddy McDowall. Holland keeps the action moving at a frantic, fun pace--and this is easily the best mix of laughs and horror ever put on celluloid. Forget \\"Scary Movie\\" and \\"Scary Movie II,\\" ad nauseum.

But when Evil turned into a werewolf, he didn't get killed with a silver bullet like most werewolves, but fell down the stairs with a pencil in the middel of him, then Charlie's girlfriend, Amy, turns into a vampire and falls in love with Damage!Watch when Benson and Charlie break the curse of Fright Night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fright Night","review":"Yes I was excited to purchase this item as I had experienced a difficult time finding this in commercial rental options.

Am I supposed to believe that Roddy McDowall is a vampire killer?! I give him all the credit in the world, he was probably one of the most underrated actors of the last 30 years, but he needs to be cast properly, not as a vampire killer. The plot is weak, acting is poor, and it doesn't even qualify to have the word \\"Fright\\" in the title.

I was lucky in that I was able to secure Mysterious Island and Journey to the Center of the Earth at the 29.99 price, however, had missed Fright Night because I didn't know about it until after it had sold out within a month (November 2011). Now third party vendors currently have Mysterious Island (9 copies) between 84.00-85.00 and Journey to the Center of the Earth (10 copies) between 68.00-69.00.

Go get em' Peter Vincent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Campy' Fright Night Fun To Watch","review":"This is simply a very entertaining horror flick with a good mixture of suspense, comedy and good special- effects. The kids - William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys - are all excellent but the two adults - Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell - steal the show.Sarandon is very cool as the vampire; cocky, arrogant and smooth. He is easily the best character in the movie. McDowell does a nice job as the reluctant vampire slayer.The special-effects are good and the film is played strictly for fun, even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact, it reminds me of the word \\"camp\\" because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments.Note: I watched this 3-4 times on the tape so I am familiar with most of the film and after seeing the DVD, I swear several short scenes are missing (such as Bearse's quick shower scene)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"This little flick has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since childhood. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle.

It's one of those great films that makes you laugh, your skin crawl and screams to have the lines recited along with it.Another thing, IMHO, Chris Sarandon's vampire - Jerry Dandridge - has got to be the most sexy, sensual, menacing one in the history of film.

Mrs. Alain's technique is sophisticated and passionate, and she even takes the time to explain some of the organ's complex functions such as its multi-keyboard layout and its main registers.The directors somehow chose to remove the first 30 or 40 bars of the Fugue (from Toccatta and Fugue in D minor) which is frankly disappointing and a very unfortunate decision considering the complexity, beauty and relevance of this piece under any point of view. This is the reason I'm not giving 5 stars to this magnificent and inspiring production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organ, Toccatas & Fantasias","review":"As an ardent fan of Marie Claire Alaine this DVD epitomises the wonderful Organist that she is.

I bought it at a used CD shop because it looked unusual, and I found the liner notes interesting. I have many hundreds of CDs, but mostly well known classics. I frequently do try new things, and since I had never heard of either this composer or modern Spanish music, I tried it. I thoroughtly enjoyed it. I have some musical training, and listen a lot. This is well worth hearing, and I will listen to it often. It has a great sound, develops its themes well, but is quite modern in sound. I do not believe it will turn off those who cannot stand much of modern music with its discordant sound. Try it. I think you will like it.

We noticed that the watch stop working and it was rusting from the inside out, leaving a rust spot on her skin. I took some pictures as proof and will be calling seiko customer service for a replacement because amazon will not do anything past the 30 day mark.

I think the problem is with the seller, not amazon's problem. The sellers is possibly selling fake watches.I insist, it is not a problem with Amazon who was very attentive in trying to solve the problem.

Marcus is always pretentious, long-winded and under foot in his writing, and he is at his absolute worst here. If you were to randomly choose a book about Dylan, you couldn't do worse than this one. One star, and even that is too generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more precise look at the sources of his inspiration","review":"Plenty of biographies and critical surveys of rock musician Bob Dylan have been written: author Greil Marcus saw Dylan for the first time in 1963: he may not have known his name, but he recognized talent when he saw it. Thus began a long relationship between critic and musician which has led to Marcus' in-depth survey Like A Roling Stone: Bob Dylan At The Crossroads. Chapters consider song origins, Dylan's major concerts, and the search for exceptional lyrics. If you've read all the other Dylan coverages, Like A Rolling Stone provides a more precise look at the sources of his inspiration - from an insider's view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's That Zero Star Option When You Need It?","review":"I happen to believe that Bob Dylan is the most important American artistic voice of the last half century at least. I also happen to believe that Like a Rolling Stone is the best rock song ever. If one does not believe those two things, Greil Marcus' hyperbolic huffing of a book is not going to convince you. Only Dylan's work will do that. If, on the other hand, you do already agree, Marcus' hip pomposity is pointless. Is the man capable of writing a sentence without layered metaphors and with fewer than twenty-five words? By the evidence in Like a Rolling Stone, no. If you want to know what Dylan is and means, read his own Chronicles, not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior textbook","review":"This is a superior textbook for a senior level course in power systems analysis.

The history books have usually pointed the finger of blame at the South for starting the war by firing without provocation upon the Union troops stationed at the fort. Wills' research proves differently - specifically, that the Confederates at Charleston were cunningly maneuvered by Abraham Lincoln into a no-win situation. As with all modern wars, a self-righteous veneer was concocted by the Lincoln Administration to hide the true economic reasons for waging a devastating four-year war against the Southern States.

In March I went on a trip to four countries in Europe and took three different travel guides with me. Europe for Dummies was used much more than the other two that I had brought, and with justified reasons. A previous reviewer said it was too vague, and although I agree with them in some aspects, Europe for Dummies saved us more time and even money in some cases than I ever expected any of the books to. The descriptions are short and full of information, which is what I want when I am traveling. Detailed maps and directions also hellp make Europe for Dummies a great travel guide. Whether or not you would be buying this book to take with you, or to read it before you go on a trip to Europe, Europe for Dummies is a great source of information to prepare and inform you for the many awesome and surreal sights Europe has to offer.

You will laugh out loud, and yell \\"Pause it\\", if you have to leave the room. The way Monk is devoted to his wife's memory is so touching. Monk is intelligent & believeable, very well written!

There's one involving Monk's brother that truly had me on the edge of my seat, John Turturro plays the reacurring role of Monk's brother with masterful skill.Malcolm McDowell and Jeffrey Donovan also make appearances in different installments.There's also an episode involving Monk taking in a toddler that was hilarious and heartbreaking.If Monk employed better directors it would be winning much more critcal acclaim, because the writting and acting are a cut above the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!

You get right in, right away and begin creating within minutes. Frankly, it's one of the only books on software I've not wanted to put down. In addition, I'm finding myself going back to it time and again for additional info and insights.The project content worked flawlessly, and unlike some After Effects books, the projects all worked natively - I didn't need to buy any third party plug-ins.

I've been using Motion practically since day one of its release and it's strength (and weakness) is that it can do just about anything...you just have to figure out what you want done and how to do it. This book has great lessons that expand one's knowledge and outlook on the program."},{"rating":"2","title":"motion made easy","review":"this book is for anyone who feels overwhelmed by motion and its numerous applications. the easy to follow tuturials are what i needed to finally figure out this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always in Motion","review":"The thing I enjoyed about this book was the simplistic nature in the way it was written. It was easy to follow, and with the guided lessons on the CD, learning the program was easy. The CD includes many different animations to get you started.I fond this book easier to read then the Shake book i also purchased. Shake is a more complicated program, but the author of the motion book geared the book toward the beginner which i appreciate. If you are interested in learning the program, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Motion","review":"Being that I am new to motion this book was not an easy read. It actually does not give the novice a leg to stand on nor does it provide the detailed information needed to create the projects that you want. What it does do, however, is provide additional knowlege almost a part 3 of a 5 part series to motion. If you are new to motion I would suggest you look elsewhere for your instruction but if you are already familiar with motion and its intricacies then by all means put your money down. Even if I were well schooled in motion this still would not grace my shelves. The direction and applications that I have in mind for motion just does not correlate with the provided instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I sent this with my daughter to college in August and by October the casing for the wire had frayed open.

The information proved to be very useful. We did not follow any of the plans in the guide, but made sure to hit up the attractions that were rated not to be missed. The information on how the Fastpass system works was very useful, and allowed us to see more of the park than we otherwise would have been able to. The book is a little sloppy. With all the revisions it is a bit confusing and may seem to have conflicting information. Also, the maps and tables are not easy to follow. Still the information provided is well worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"think of it as Insurance on your Disneyland trip","review":"This book was extremely helpful.

Her description of events and activities in a book is a brilliant word picture. In Loving Katherine the reader can feel Roan Devereaux's thoughts as he is watching and helping Katherine, the same as the reader can feel Katherine's feelings as Roan spends some time at her ranch.

I thought the plot lacked direction, that the ending was an extreme let-down and that the entire film lacked a point.I left the theater annoyed, wishing that Ruffalo would find another vehicle for his talents like the wonderful YOU CAN COUNT ON ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"when being an independent film is just a moniker","review":"The movie starts out slow and explores the relationship of two people who seemingly love each other but make the other miserable. It then fast forwards to ten years later when the principles reunite and truly test their love and feelings for each other. The second half of the film is redeeming and really resonates at times. Overall, the film feels a bit too \\"indy\\" - as if it's trying too hard to not be mainstream and that's why it includes unconventional details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y did they even make this movie","review":"I bought this movie becasue I'm a Mark Ruffalo fan.

The more I use this map, the less I like it. One feature the old version had was a grid showing every square mile in the state. This allowed a person to tell with much greater accuracy when your next turn was coming or the distance between places. This map does not have that. One feature I do like about this map is the slight overlap between pages on the edges of the map, but that is the ONLY thing better about the map. My husband and I have used and do use the Wisconsin Atlas on a very regular basis.

The other people who left reviews on here about 'why mormonism is not christian' are completely wrong, and misinformed.

Some more fast-paced action would be required for a higher grade.Still, I believe that Solaris is about the best work that can be made wihtout deviating from the book that it is based on.If you like mind-boggling slow psycho-thrilllers then this is the movie for you, otherwise stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I saw this movie with 5 other people in a crowded theater. Had I known that I couldn't get a refund after the first 20 mins of the movie start, I would have walked out like a few other people did. Even after the movie, we weren't the only people to ask for a refund. All of us were very frustrated that we wasted 2 hours of our time and almost a year later we still talk about getting that 2 hours back! I thought that perhaps the movie would get better, but it never did. It isn't as if I'm not familar w/abstract-artsy films, but this didn't even accomplish that. It's as if there are major chuncks left out of the story. Now I'll have to read the book for some continuity. All in all, it's one of the very few movies that I wish I never wasted time or money on and I've seen some pretty bad movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the PBS Special","review":"I have NOT seen this book, but I saw the PBS special it is based on and that was 5 stars.

One of those looks and I'd certainlybare my throat for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Wow this movie is bad. I love vampire and horror movies too. This guy who plays dracula is sooo wrong. He isnt charming, menacing or scary. The action scenes are just horrible. A vampire gets its head cut clean off with one swipe of a dagger. And a one handed swipe at that. Another vamp has their head cut off with a pair of lawn clippers? Wow, our hero sure has some upper arm strengh to cut through a whole neck with one motion, spine and all. These vampires acted so silly too, not like youd expect. And how about the \\"virgin\\" product placment in about 2/3's of the movie? Bad acting, horrible direction, no scares. Stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly nonsense","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's not even scary. I rented it just because Gerard Butler is in it. Thank goodness he is getting better scripts these days. I don't think this movie even has enough humor in it to ever become a cult classic. If you are are a Butler fan, put your mind in neutral and enjoy him, if not then just skip the whole mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah humbug","review":"This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws: a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to explain it...","review":"The only words that I can think of are \\"bad\\" and \\"stupid\\". This movie really had nothing to it at all. I'll give the Judas thing being original...but even that was stupid. Why would he have a bad Transylvanian accent?

Not scary, nor even that creative through most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spin on Dracula","review":"I have always have a love for Dracula and Dracula movies and I must say that this one had a great spin on the fabled Dracula.

Don't give away the ending to anyone who hasn't seen it! The movie actually takes place outside Bram Stoker's world. In fact, in the movie, they mention the novel as being based on real life! \\"Dracula is real,\\" was the line of the movie. Get this video. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Retelling of the Dracula story.","review":"Wes Craven is to be commended,he added a breath of very fesh air to a story done to death (or un-death) pardon the expression. This was one of the top 3 versions of the Dracula story ever, the first being 1979's with Frank Langella, the 2nd 1992's with Gary Oldman and now Craven's. This movie worked on every level,I especially liked how Dracula had never died, he was just hidden away until they could find a way to destroy him. Also a very creative way to explain why he hates Holy artifacts as well as Dracula's true identity were put into this version. I just saw it last night and,weather permitting,plan to go see it again. If you have heard the story and think it can't be told with any new angles, think again. Craven has did masterful work here,and it is well worth going to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, good movie","review":"A lot of people seem to have a problem with this movie, I'm not sure why. Maybe the cast is too young for them or something. I enjoyed it very much. There is a nice mixture of action and plot. Some biblical intrigue and a bit of exploitive nudity.Now the DVD is pretty stacked. You got your director's commentary, trailers for multiple films, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, and audition videos. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is booming and banging it's little heart out. And of course, you get it in Animorphic widescreen, the only way to view a movie.So here is a quick summary: Decent plot, good sction, hot girls, stacked DVD.

They are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Dracula movie ever","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The plot is bad, the characters are week, the acting is absurd.

Bram Stokers being my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"Just as Dracula sucks the life out of his victims so does this plot. The gothic genre is \\"revamped\\" for the new millenium, but let's be honest it's a tired genre with a revised storyline which must have originated from the bowels of the gutter. Tired and lifeless actors and actresses dot the film and try to push the story along, but they fail. Justine Waddell, who holds some glimmer of hope, deserves a much better vehicle in which to star.

Especially if, like me, you are tired of Hollywood not taking the genre seriously anymore with movies like \\"Modern Vampires.\\" (watch that one for 10 minutes and you'll see what I mean.) Craven and his team do excellent work here even managing to throw some new twists into the mix. Like who Dracula really is and why he hates Holy artifacts so much. If you think Dracula is old news and can't be fresh anymore, think again. Check this version out, it has a very high scare ratio and lot's of great action and is very much worth the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Painfully Terrible","review":"This movie would be completely un-watchable if it weren't for Gerard Butler's beautiful everything. This movie actually caused me physical pain trying to pay attention to the plot(?) and the horrible actors carrying it out. Halfway through, I realized there was no point in paying attention to the pitiful story and just drooled over Gerry until the end. Only get this movie if you are a die-hard Butler fan.

First the story was your usual Dracula story but many changes were made to make it more modern. The only thing that I think kept my interest in this film was the finale in which Dracula explains his past. Whether it was original or not the Judas reference tied in really well into his character and makes more sense then any of the other Dracula movies created in the past. I think where Bram Stoker's Dracula succeed and this film failed was that story and visuals for this film were subpar. The movie didn't contain alot of action and the little that you receive wasn't enough to scare you. I wouldn't have rented the film had my best friend told me how much it freaked him out, but after viewing it my friend looks like a chicken. Only rent this movie when nothing else is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong 'Dracula 2000'","review":"This movie was just wrong. Everything was bad about it, except for Christopher Plummer's performance and Jennifer Esposito (bonita!). A group of criminals break into Van Helsing's vault to resurrect Dracula. That's the movie. I can't remember anything else that happened in this misguided movie with no direction. ... Vitamin C was nude. Why?

Sure there are some parts that could have been better, less cheesey. I wish they had went a bit more in depth in the backstory of who Dracula really is, for example. I thought the technical aspects of the film were wonderful; lighting, sets, etc. Please don't let the poor reviews keep you from watching this! The part when Dracula transforms from wrinkled old guy to a hunk with a six pack is worth the whole movie! Gerard Butler is smoking hot! Honestly, I do not understand why anyone would say no to him! I watched it on youtube because I wanted to see for myself if it was worth buying, and I have to say it is.

Otherwise, this is barely watchable, imo.I love vampire/werewolf movies, although I haven't seen a ton of them. This one definitely does not cut the mustard.Two things that I did like about it: 1) Obviously the chicks were nice and, 2) the origin of Dracula was an idea I hadn't heard before... very interesting, however, not my preferred origin.Other than those two, the story was kind of thin, the acting routine, and the fight scenes weak.There was really nothing meaty about this flick. It was one of those that I was tempted to fast forward through, but forced myself to watch it.Some examples of far, FAR, better vampire movies for comparison so you know where I'm coming from: Lost Boys, Interview w/ Vamp, Underworld series, Van Helsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It actually sucks...for a vampire movie.","review":"In the beginning of this film Wes Craven writes a good film, but it fell apart and became absolute garbage. What happened? Those fake fangs were awful and the acting was incredibly poor. I is almost embarrassing watching the film and knowing these folks are actually popular today because of bad b films like this. Honestly ave your money. Gerard Butler was great in 300 but not in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on an old story","review":"Enjoy tales of Dracular? This new and updated story line is thought provoking and will take you a step deeper into the mystery of who or what Dracular was. The real punch line comes at the end of the story and leaves you with a sense of - is this myth or \\"what\\". I bought this film not because I normally enjoy dracular type movies but because the main character (Dracular) was played by one whom I believe to be an up and coming great actor. It seems to me that what ever role Mr. Butler enters into he makes it his own and portrays the character in such a way that you become part of the character he is playing. A great actor, a good story line and I found it well worth purchasing. One of the few I would watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the collection.","review":"I really enjoyed this film... it could be because I love Gerard Butler or vampire flicks... but it's a good one none-the-less. I watch it at least once a month. It's much better and has a better plot development than say Queen of the Damned (which I personally think is awful). As always, I'd have to say rent a film before you buy it for however much, that way you're not stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFFINATELY BUY IT!!!","review":"I shouldnt be the only poor schmuk who had to sit through it!

If you are the type of person who is looking a for a on-the-edge of your seat horror flicks, then this is not the movie for you. If you are the type of person who wants a little horror and action mixed together, then this is the movie for you. At first this movie starts a little slow, and seems to be like a crappy modern retale of a classic story. However, things change very quickly. The best part of this movie is where the orgins of Dracula are told. I am NOT going to tell you about this because I do not want to ruin the movie for you. I will say that it is an interest outake on the Dracula legend, and a much better one too! This movie also contains a killer soundtrack, and a little bit of pop culture is added into the movie a la Mardi Gras. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially fans of vampire-type horror films. Gerard Butler portrays Dracula with a wonderful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always nice to see my city in a movie....","review":"Yes, that is about the only redeeming quality of this film. And you dont even get enough of it. New Orleans is always intriguing, yet this story is dreadful. Come on, people. Not a bit of it made any sense, and I am a vampire eficianado. I have read every vampire book, seen every vampire movie and played every vampire game and this is absolutely the worst ever since the video game version of Vampire the Masquerade came out! The curly haired guy from That 70's Show is the second thing worth seeing this movie for and he has a very short part. Without him and New Orleans this would get zero stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical Dracula is a Crazy Idea.","review":"The acting is pathetic and the thrills are cheap. So what, no one really takes movies of this genre seriously. However, the infusion of distorted religious and biblical facts to justify the real origins of Dracula is obscene, offensive, and downright blasphemous. The propoderance of horror movies with religious overtones such as Stigmatina, Lost Souls, Save the Child, etc. has turned this genre into trash. Religion and horror if mixed within the context of this genre is devilish. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula 2000","review":"A horrible movie.

How about a decent scary dracula with screen presence, not somebody from a shampoo advert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SPOILER: Why do vampires always become christians?","review":"This film is a modern adaptation of the original tale in the ranks of the recent \\"Romeo + Juliet.\\" The acting is mediocre and the believability simply plain. Near the end of the movie, the story strays into new territory where Dracula is actually Judas (the Biblical character who betrayed Jesus) and can only die by hanging and that must occur at sunrise. The \\"surprise ending\\" is something that both athiests and christians alike will find annoying and pathetic. As far as choosing this movie or another, I recommend watching \\"End of Days\\" or \\"Stigmata,\\" as both can be classified in the same genre and style, yet actually succeed in pulling off the believability factor. Especially the devil character in \\"End of Days,\\" which is (in my opinion) hysterically played by Gabriel Byrne."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS TERRIBLE","review":"GOD.

If you want to see a decent vampire film - go and rent a copy of Nosferatu, or, if you want to see some actors you might recognize, Bram Stokers Dracula (even though Francis Ford Coppola's ending destroyed the monster by trying to make him into a man).

It takes itself SO seriously, but really, I can never get past the writhing \\"succubi\\" and poor Gerry trying to seduce around those teeth! Definitely watch the audition tape; my cousins and I laughed until we almost cried. I have to agree with other reviewers, however, that he definitely does manage some incredibly erotic moments, even with his clothes on. It's also nice to see Nathan Fillion in his priestly role, not to mention Johnny Lee Miller (much better in Emma). If you're expecting epic plot and riveting reveals, this may not be your flick, but if you're looking for something fun to watch while eating popcorn and exchanging light banter, look no further.Honestly, there are some really nice moments in this film, but that's most certainly not why I watch it!!

This movie is a parallel to his book and all it does is kill of an important person, Van Helsing, to have his daughter take his place whom turns into a vampire and later becomes human again :(...)The acting is ok but nothing great. I really didn't see the point to this movie, when I saw it on TV I thought the plot would be interesting with Dracula coming back to life whom is chased by Van Helsing, then the story fell apart.Warning, there are a lot of corny scenes and jokes that ridicule the person whom watches this piece of garbage.I am really sorry this movie was made and feel bad for watching it.

One day I saw this on sale at an Academy for $50 and snagged. Went out the next weekend to the ozarks, again same temp and bag. I felt no cold at all. And the only difference was this mat. I told my friend it basically felt like sleeping on top of a heated blanket.On top of saving me the money from getting a couple hundred dollar bag, I got this mat which also saves me from the rocks/roots/dead cats i frequently sleep on top of.

It truly is a ready-reference to keep in your desk. It has lots and lots of great ideas that are very original and effective. It's easy to find whatever you're looking for and he really hits upon ALL kinds of situations teachers find themselves in. The main thing I found is this book is unlike any other I've seen. It takes any situation and gives you several possible solutions. What I liked most is that the suggestions work, they take minimal time, you don't always have to send the kid to the office, and best of all, the suggestions actually teach the student something, usually accountability and resposibility.

It didn't. Most of the ideas presented in this book were obviously for upper grades -- ideally, middle and high schools. Ideas for time-fillers that I hoped to use were definitely geared toward older kids (searching encyclopedias for information, cutting out specific ads from newspapers, writing small biographies). But the one thing that really got to me was this: Under the heading \\"Avoiding Problems on the First Day of School\\": The book says all of one sentence on how to prepare for students who cry on the first day of school. \\"...Be prepared; keep a box of tissues in your desk.\\" Yes, it's ideas like this that made me wonder what the author was thinking when writing this book.

But after the first few times leaping to it, it kind of gets dull. It's all very trippy and hip-hoppy, but it takes you nowhere compared to the transcendental grooves of Talvin Singh. The socially-loaded lyrics are nice and whoever that is singing can really belt it out. Don't hesitate in buying this CD, but at the same time don't think this is all there is to Asian Underground.

I have no idea why anyone who likes metal, or power metal, would like this. It sounds like an angsty american nu-metal band, with not much tecnical prowess, from what I could gather. The songs are in a structured verse chorus verse form, and far from growling, high pitched singing, or anything metal, the vocals can only be classifued as annoying.

Its been two years, and I was not using it for about 1 year of that time where it was stored away. Now it seems to be melting around the connectors on the base, and it stays on all the time it is connected, no more auto shut off (though that was pretty disappointing when it was working).

It is composed of ten essays that cover the important events and incidents of the battle for and seige of Vicksburg. There are a number of illustrations and maps that illuminate the text and anecdotal images narratively entertwined to add the personal touch to historical events.I would have enjoyed it even more had the author taken the time to go ahead and write the full volume this could have been. The essays are stand alone and somewhat repetitious. He knows the material better than perhaps any other. Make this one composite, whole narrative and throw in the kitchen sink. Nevertheless, if you're interested in the battle for Vicksburg, this will provide a decent overview that doesn't fall down to the minute level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers ten chapters detailing every major aspect","review":"Triumph & Defeat: The Vicksburg Campaign by civil war expert Terrence Winschel (Chief Historian of Vicksburg National Military Park) offers ten chapters detailing every major aspect of what is widely considered to be the key watershed battle that sealed the ultimate defeat of the Confederacy at the hands of Union forces. Meticulously reconstructing details and events from the critical battle that would capture Vicksburg and divide the Confederacy, Triumph & Defeat narrates history in a matter-of-fact tone that clarifies the complex interplay of forces, personalities, and events.

Pseudohip, relentlessly unfunny manga gangsterism, with sub-sub-Tarantino dialogue, flashy but mediocre camerawork, and bad acting all around.

I actually fell asleep.... twice! The camera work at times can be interesting but some scenes are way too drawn out without really going anywhere. The mood and pace of the film is very monotone and flatline, especially for a film that touts itself as being this grand rollercoaster ride. And in response to another reviewer here, Taranteno does take alot from asian cinema, but asian cinema borrows alot from western culture as well, at this point there is alot of equal give and take.

This film comes at you with a raging pace, with people standing still, and the camera not moving. It's all style (or at least tries to be) and almost no substance. You have absolutely no reason to care for the characters or for two leads to even to be together. I find myself wondering where is any of the motivation, at all? It's just random \\"cool idea for a mob guy\\" characters slammed together, and a guy and a girl equally slammed together in a story that ultimately does nothing and means nothing. How many times did I just want a static scene of a man sitting there to end up with the guy putting a bullet in his head so we can just get on with the rest of the film.All the characters seemed oddly disconnected from each other, which ultimately created a disconnect between myself and the film.

However, Meier has also written \\"Happiness is a Choice\\" (also a very good book) that deals with steps to get out of depression. I think Blue Genes is for those who have tried those steps, but are still stuck in depression (with additional guilt that they failed to get better) and may have genetically lower levels of one or more chemicals that can affect how they're feeling. Even if you may think they rely too much on medication, it is still well worth reading for the information it provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REFERENCE book","review":"This book is most helpful for pointing out the puns made in languages with which one is not familiar.

That said, it is nevertheless invaluable as a reference book when reading the Wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"so many things he misses, so much obvious stuff he includes, and so little detail on the meaning of some of the annotations end up making this book somewhat of a nuisance, breaking up the flow which makes the Wake enjoyable. I still prefer Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key to FW, though it admits that it does not try to catch every allusion. I find that most of the things that I really do want to find out, where I hear some echo of something, he doesn't touch on, or doesn't touch on to my satisfaction. Really, this project should be a collaboration online where people would add their comments to the possible meanings of different lines, because there are so many. Each man comes at it with his own knowledge, interests and needs, and can't get everything. So while this is useful for some, it's more of an impediment for me.

The introductions to each short story are sterile. For example, \\"his work was first published in S.F. magazine.\\" Who cares? The general editor touts how \\"rich\\" and \\"ambitious\\" the book is in his general introduction. Each introduction says something like \\"the author did most of his work in the 40's and 50's\\" without mentioning when the _selected_ work was written. You have to thumb through the acknowledgements to figure our whether you're reading a 40's or 70's story.Besides that, I found most of the stories uninspiring anyway. I do not understand the arrangement of stories. They appear to be in random order. Not alphabetical, chronological, temporal, or even cultural.If you're new to SF, I recommend starting with Hugo and Nebula winners.

It is a simple glossary with mostly single equivalencies given. The Swahili-English section is adequate for simple, basic sorts of vocabulary, but it contains none of the new terminology and vocabulary that has entered the language since the original lexicographical research was done. So, for instance, it would be inadequate for reading a modern Swahili newspaper, let alone a novel or modern play. Many of my students over the years have used this book and it was a useful tool given a lack of a pocket-sized Swahili dictionary that a student could easily carry around. But students had a lot of problems using the English-Swahili section of the book. Many times the gloss given for a particular English word, is not the correct one, or does not reflect modern meanings or usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial but helpful","review":"This book is useful in that it is simple and caters for the beginner however in a predominantly spoken language like Kiswahili there are usually multiple translations for each word.

I hoped it would be better coming from a Doctor who slams other doctors. She says all other doctors want to do is to put you on drugs to help your symptoms. But really that is all she suggests as well. She reccomends going on the pill to help a lot of the symptoms. What happens when you don't want to be on the pill and you want to get pregnant? The pill can actually cause some of the symptoms when used for long peroids of time. After years of trying I ended up getting pregnant by losing weight with diet and exercise. I was really not impressed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"I am newly diagnosed with PCOS, and I found this book to be very informative. This book is written by a doctor, but it does not contain a lot of medical jargon. This book gave just enough information to help a lay person understand. Also, I found information in this book easy to locate due to each chapter having subtitles. This book covers all aspects of PCOS from the initial diagnosis of PCOS to finding ways of coping with it. I have done some research on the internet, but I found this book to have person specific information rather than one general explanation. I also found hope in reading about different woman with different situations, scenarios, and solutions. To me this made the book seem more personable. This book also helps woman ask the right questions to diagnose and treat PCOS.

Tammy's collection is almost entirely a group of sober, thoughtful songs about the true meaning of Christmas (appropiately ending with a song called \\"Let's Put Christ Back into Christmas\\".)

They were a BIT looser by the morning but still not great. However, the part that fits around my wrist is INCREDIBLY loose and does not even touch my wrist. I am very dissapointed and am on the hunt again for a great glove. By the way, I am only 110 pounds so do NOT have very big hands. I can't imagine what a more normal sized person might experience with these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, intersting talk","review":"There aren't a lot of sources of John Lilly audio out there, so this is great to have. The sound quality is fair/decent. The biggest problem is that the tape speed is not steady, to the point that the timing of his speech is a little hard to parse. Humoress pauses are shortened, and phrases whizz by. It's all comprehensible, but it would be great if someone could pull this into a computer and clean it up a little.The talk itself is wonderful. Lilly has an absurdist sense of humor, and sounds like a really interesting guy to be around. I wish there was more material available. I recommend this over the ECCO CD. The ECCO CD is ambient/techno music with a few random snippets of Lilly speaking. It sort of seems unnecessary. It's not great music, and it's not satisfying if you want to hear Lilly speak. The K Talk is way better, imho."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music Makes The Movie","review":"There are directors you can count on to put together a good soundtrack--if not a good movie--like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Aki Kaurismaki. Jim Jarmusch earned his stripes from the start. Who can forget \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) in \\"Stranger Than Paradise\\" (or Neil Young's guitar score for \\"Dead Man\\")? It makes the movie! \\"Coffee and Cigarettes\\" is an omnibus film made over the course of several years. It features a few musicians, such as RZA (of the Wu-Tang Clan) and the White Stripes, and some are even on the soundtrack, such as Tom Waits and Iggy Pop. This is just a great compilation of great music--and the movie isn't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flute Case Review","review":"This flute case is very good and very durable. It has a very firm frame and is protective and sturdy. The case has a spot for a foot joint with two keys or three. I was very pleased that it came with with a sholder strap (a very comfy sholder strap), it also has a very comfy handle to carry it with. The inside is lined with pink vevlet and has a convenent outer pouch. The only things I was disappointed with were the color, it was more of a salmon or coral rather than a pink. Also if it gets scratched the leather on the outside chips (not horribly only in small specks). Overall I was very pleased with this product and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another non-existing book","review":"Have you noticed how many book titles are listed on Amazon for books that do not even exist, that are not onluu not published, but not even written? For example, this is a typical malicious title for a non-existent book. I really wonder about the listing policies of Amazon that let non-authors get away with this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christianity cannot be based on logic","review":"This book should be examined by anyone who wants an unbiased perspective of christianity. The arguments are as objective as any and the author doesn't go out of his way to scandalise the religion. Instead he makes the all important point that ultimately, christianity is a religion of blind faith more than anything that could possibly germinate in human logic or reason. Highly recommended to anyone contemplating a christian conversion and for christians who dare examine the arguments. Anti-missionary groups will want to order copies for their members and the Jews will rejoice for having stuck to their faith. Truly a book for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best material against x-ianity I've ever read!","review":"Although Dr. Martin speaks with very \\"large terms\\", that never stopped me from giving his book 5 stars. After the Introduction and Chapter 1, things started to click, and the large terms started to diminish (a little bit anyway). He goes one by one through the x-ian doctrines, and refutes them.He explains most of the historicity of the bible, which is what I liked most. Dr. Martin is also very logical about the situation. He does NOT put x-ians down in any way. When you read the \\"other side\\", it's a completely different perspective. If you're a x-ian, and you think atheism is a crazy position, then I'd read before you make that assumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time and money","review":"It is clear that Michael Martin made up his mind that the Bible can't be trusted before even looking at the facts. I have read \\"The Case for Christ\\" and \\"The Case for Christiantiy\\" and those books are much more balanced and thought-provoking than this. It seems that Martin, like most critics of the Bible, are driven by a strange emotional desire to deny God. They are not driven by the pursuit of truth. The idea of God and Jesus BOTHERS them, to their very core. Why is that? Maybe they don't like the idea that we have someone bigger than us to answer to. Maybe they want to think we ourselves are the true gods of this world and our lives, and anything that threatens that position must be silenced. It is funny to me that these people tout themselves as being \\"open minded\\". Michael Martin is not. A more appropriate title for this book would be: \\"I have already made up my mind, so don't confuse me with the facts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A one sided affair","review":"Have you ever notice that these so called individuals who don't believe in a God only have a problem with christinity.The truth will alway be under attact by people who are have nothing better to do with their time and simply like to live a life full of hypotheses."},{"rating":"1","title":"We will not know till...","review":"As like all books that deal with refuting Christianity, Dr. Martin sets out by claiming there is no real way to test to see if Chritianity is true. All of us on this side of the fence know it to be true by our inside awareness of God. The rest say, \\"No, He does not exist!\\" Well, only at death will we all know the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logically thorough and convincing but sometimes a dull read.","review":"This book is logically thorough and destroys Christianity on all important evidential and rational grounds, although I doubt that any who faith has been sufficient thus far will be led to deconvert. It will however let expose them to the fact that they have no rational grounds for their belief. My only criticism of the book is that it can be a dry read in many places, however, this keeps the book to the point and Mr. Martin's points are easy to follow and hard to dissent. A definite read for any who is interested in either sife of this debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Problems..","review":"I found that Mr. Martin misunderstands the historical truths that he is trying to argue against. Its hard to keep reading when you realize that he doesn't have a correct understanding of history. As another review has said, he sometimes writes as if he has not done the research to make a good argument for the issue and explains his difficulties with his own philosophical ideas and objections. I was surprised he didn't do more research before writing a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, just doesn't have facts.","review":"One star is all Martin deserves for this book. Instead of trying to discredit the Gospels, he attacks the creed's, which are held in high regard by the Christian churches, but are not essential to them. He can't disprove Jesus' Christ existence based on physical evidence because there is none against it. He therefore attacks it on philosophical/out-of-context grounds. He can try to come up with a new way to explain the empty tomb. I'll just say to have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and one-sided","review":"Why does this author refuse to consider that there is an intellect and power greater than his own?

I already cracked a bag open and started eating it before flipping it over to discover this. Very unhappy and disappointed, I already had great beef jerky (with sugar in it) at home and didn't buy this expensive jerky so that I could have more.

But oh my goodness, I couldn't even swallow the first piece. Even my dog stopped eating them after 2 pieces.It's hard to describe the flavor other than salty and metallic (I got the Teriyaki). The jerky is also alarmingly thick and covered with this sawdust-like powder, and most of the pieces have broken up into crumbs.I will definitely not be finishing the bag I opened, and hopefully I'll be able to give the other 5 bags to someone who is hungry enough to take them. I'm not one to complain about products, but I've also never felt so strongly about spreading the news to stay away from this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, great texture","review":"I like beef jerky to be tender, not leathery and near impossible to chew through. This beef jerky comes in perfectly sized pieces and is very tender, probably even more tender than my favorite brand, Pemmican.As for the flavor, it's not very strong. There is some flavor but the tenderness of the beef makes up for the lack of flavor. It also isn't as salty as other brands of beef jerky that I've had before. Overall it's a great buy and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worst jerky I've ever had!","review":"This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good......","review":"I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does. It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland). I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better. I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).

It's very dry, not hard but firm, and kind of falls apart in your mouth - but not in a good way. The flavor is dominated by smoke, whereas most jerkys also include soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.All in all, I'd eat this instead of stuff at the gas station like Oberto or a Slim Jim, but when push comes to shove I'll order Wild Bill's jerky, Big John's, or pick up some jerky at the local meat market."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy uninspiring read","review":"I read this book on holidays having just read Philip Roths \\"The human stain\\".It is readable but repetitive and stereotypical.

Some of the things I liked best were the guest stars playing interesting immortals (Roger Daltrey from the Who, for example), the Watcher element, and the moral dillemmas that Duncan always had to work through. Since this series involved mostly Europeans, it had a different rhythm and value set than a U.S.-centric series.I have the first season DVDs and especially enjoy the Watcher Chronicles extra.

As if a de-polarizing filter has been added to make the colors faded. Even the characters in the story are not well connected together, a girl loves this man giving no history of how this love evolved, a woman loves this girl and you barely know how they met or how they got to know each other....

It has all the (Christmas) bells and whistles, and, well, it's just better.

This Salsahits 2005 CD marketed by J&N records is really not a bad CD but I should have known better. It's quite rare and next to impossible to have songs like: Azuquita Mami, Mi Gente, Fuego En El 23, Somos Iguales, Indestructible and Lindo Yambu all on one CD SUNG BY THE ORIGINAL ARTIST. This one is not by the original artists. This is supposedly an updated version for 2005, hence the name. It makes a great background CD though. :) Good imitation artists but get the originals. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I agree with Jake, this CD took me by surprise.

The author states that the incredible tale is based on declassified secret documents that he aquired under the freedom of information act. I agree with the other reviewer, the events described are utterly unbelievable, but fascinating. If true, Lovecraft and Harry Houdini's brother, and the female companion they shared, helped to uncover a hidden nazi submarine base under classic spy novel circumstances, including a shoot out, and a coverup.

Well, there are some interesting details about India's customs, countryside, politics and history, but I thought the story line was awfully dull, and ended up fast-forwarding thru the pages to get to the end. Basically the story is somebody's threatening murder with little notes, and after 195 pages you find out who. The trip from page 1 to page 195 is a plodding affair. Bah.

The seasons of the year are matched with the sections of the music, the scenes change with the musical phrases, and even the animal motions are frequently synched with the beat of the music. This could be precious/yucky, but it never is.The overall effect is infinitely soothing. If you watch this at the end of a stressful day, I guarantee that you will be relaxed by the end. Even my 3 year old grandson, attracted by the wildlife photography, wound down from full riot mode to a civilized pace, and soon fell asleep.I have the laser disk, and it is one of the best video transfers I have ever seen - the sharpness is phenomenal.

If it were, Tierney would be be the reigning queen, given the purity and richness of her instrument. However, it is almost as if the the purity of her voice, and the unremitting accuracy of her intonation, are impediments that keep her from conveying the emotional content of the songs she performs.Unfortunately, for Tierney, the whole is LESS than the sum of the parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows promise, but...","review":"The music fan from NY has a good point that I believe was somewhat misinterpreted by tippinin44. While it is true that technique is something to be admired, jazz is not all technique. Ms. Sutton clearly has outstanding singing technique, but lacks the style of a Diana Krall or a Norah Jones. While the latter two do not have impeccable vocal technique, they convey their intended styles much more effectively.Ms. Sutton's first track, Route 66, is the best track on the album. The groove is entirely different from all other renditions of this particular song, and her vocals are tastefully restrained. The rest of the CD, however, is a virtual vocal free-for-all. Melodies are barely visible and forms are often lost. This is not nearly as bad as the fact that the performances are almost completely flat. It seems more that the musicians are going through the routine of making an album rather than giving serious thought to it or allowing themeselves to be lost in the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smooth jazz CD","review":"I first heard her voice on a radio stream and I had to buy the CD.

Which one you get should be based on the number of adults & kids in your viewing party. If there are more adults, rent it or get it, if you have more kids, go to the theater. Its not really that bad.But why? Simply because this, the original, has more profound humor that kids won't get. The sequel is more..\\"silly,\\" yet still decently funny to the experienced laugher.Bottom line: Tim Allen is SPECTACULAR, try to watch both this holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Christmas classic!","review":"This is the type of movie that all the family can enjoy during the holliday season.

I'd never seen it, but my wife and I were looking for some holiday cheer. The idea for the story is very good, and this could have been an excellent movie, but it was totally mishandled. First of all, those special effects, they are straight out of the 1960s, what an embarrassment. Secondly, the script is so lazyand Allen's performance is so poor, that there is no magic, only astonishment over the lacksidasical way the characters confront thingsthat normally would be awe inspiring. The sets are also quite cheesy and uninspired. The ex-wife and boyfriend also come off as ridiculous and artificial. There is little really humorous here, so much wasted potential.

This is not working and Eisner need to get that through his stupid, ugly, deformed, thick head. Now onto the review. Despite the PG rating, little kids wouldn't be able to understand the hidden adult jokes like when Tim Allen tells the little 10 year old elf girl \\"you look good for your age.\\" I believe this is rather unusual but what's more unusual is every elf in the movie are little kids working at Santa's workshop. I don't know if anyone's noticed, but this is rather similiar to child labor. Another thing, why does Disney promote Santa so much? Don't tell me because it's Christmas, I know that.

This one is no different. Scott Calvin stumbles into the role of Santa Claus, a job he does not believe in or want. The movie is about the adventures he encounters while growing into his new identity. It shows how there is still room for imagination, magic, and love in the modern holiday. It's fabulous for the whole family, but particularly for kids of a certain age who are starting to say that things like dragons, fairies, and Santa aren't real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for the whole family!","review":"Great movie for the whole family!

If you can imagine the movie \\"Prancer\\" with a comedic touch that's the closest I can come to a comparable. Tim Allen is amazing in this role. My kids have even made their own North Pole door sign and practice flying their reindeer after only one viewing!

Tim Allen plays a divorced father who wants his son to continue believing in Santa. He gets sucked into being the new Santa.

So his \\"normal\\" acting ability fits this movie fine.Tim Allen is great! He is slowly becoming the Clark Gable of family films.This is a MUST buy. We've watched it over and over and over again.

Whonton, in my opinion is the best Oval disc to date, but it's so different maybe it shouldn't be considered a true Oval offering. Yes, there is a german crooner. Yes, he quite often is off key. But his crooning strangely works to tie together the otherwise classic disjointed Oval sound into pretty traditional melodies! Try as I might to explain this wonderful disc, you've just got to hear it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals+Oval=Mess","review":"It a shame to see the experimental techno talent of Oval wasted over much of this confusing recording.

The first time might be cute, the 50th time is enough to put a harried parent over the edge. If you pick the music, you don't get music, you get another menu screen requiring another button to be pressed. When the DVD is done, it defaults to some meaningless screen, not the menu page.

The song is cathcy and called Down By The Docks."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Friends here!","review":"Do you have Season 7 Characters?Yes I do!I know the deltic.It's D9000.Royal Scots Grey D9000.Or 9016.Gordon Highlander 9016 is a deltic.Or D9009 or 55019.Alycidon D9009 is a deltic & so does Royal Highland Fusilier 55019.Emily is a new engine!Here are the Season 7 Characters:EmilyMurdochSpencerFergusArthurI got those and print them last year!What did you print last year?I printed Emily, Murdoch, Spencer & Fergus!I forgot to print Arthur this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting Dr. Williams","review":"Delightful, anecdotal, touching remembrances of the premiere American modernist poet by the premiere American modernist publisher. More conversation than dissertation, the slim book consists of a single light, often rambling but highly readable poem. It's a must-read for any devotee of Williams and provides great insight into the relationship that fostered and nutured the development of New Directions. Also includes Paterson-like snippets of prose as well as Kenneth Rexroth's moving farewell poem to Dr. Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only buy ROHO","review":"My husband has been paralized for 26 years and his ROHO cushion was finally wearing out. I purchased this one and was impressed with the assessories that came with this product. ROHO is only the way to go for those who have problems with sitting or need a good cushion to prevent sores. It last years and it is so worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while to grow on you ... and then becomes unforgettable","review":"I happened upon this by chance while listening to 'Forms and Feelings', a jazz radio program of exceptional quality on KPFA - a bay area station, that often presents new work. I grabbed me right away as something I wanted to know better. The 3 CD set is consistently superb, with only a few lagging pieces. I've listened to it at least 20 times over the past month. I haven't yet reached saturation point and still find deep consolation in it. I recommend it if you like introspective and quiet piano and yet it is complex enough to give new meaning each time. It's not quite jazz and not quite classical, but the best of both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book. If you read, read this one.","review":"Basically, I completely second the evaluation by the reviewer from Sydney, Australia. So, if you want my reaction to it, read that one. I'm writing mainly to thank the Aussie, because that review led me to buy the book, and have the almost painful pleasure of reading it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"the KING of all of boarder music","review":"THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF HIS BEST WORKS. IT TIES HIS CLASSIC SOUND WITH \\"CASAS DE MADERA\\" AND HIS NEW APPROACH WITH \\"SOLO UNA PATADA\\" THOUGH THE SECOND SONG IS THE ONE OF MOST LIKED BY MANY PEOPLE I TRULLY FEEL THAT THE SYNTHESIZER SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE TEJANO MUSICIANS. SO BECAUSE OF THIS I DO TAKE ONE STAR OFF. THOUGH I AM A LOYAL FAN THAT HAS MORE THEN 15 CD FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM MEXICO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight From The Rio Grande Valley","review":"I am absolutely the biggest Ramon Ayala fan alive. I love all their music and I've been listening to them and going to their concerts since I was a kid. No hay nada mejor! Puro talento y corazon en todo lo que hacen....Que Diosito los Bendiga y este con ustedes siempre."},{"rating":"2","title":"a long wait","review":"A long wait for 'A love divided' I had almost given up. However it was worth the wait and is a brilliant movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally biased film","review":"While I cannot say about the real persons this story is about, it certainly protrays the film from an entirely sympathetic ear to the Protestant side; making most of the Catholics in the village to look like criminals which any reasonable person would realize is far than normal nor even true. Rather than give pause to the cycle of hate it only seems to stir up more resentment by catering to one side.Coming from a mixed marriage myself I can totally relate to the challenges of a Catholic and non-Catholic couple; blame would fall on both sides and I feel this film is quite inaccurate in that sense.I give this film a 0 in rating since it's producers could not give a balanced perspective. Truly a disgraceful film and only promotes more hatred in my opinion. Definately not something you want your kids to watch so they can start picking and choosing who their friends will be and who they will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Poor Execution","review":"Unfortunately, PJF's story in Dayworld can't live up to the concept of the world itself. The book is poorly paced, and while the various personae are interesting, none held my interest for even their stint as central figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad print copy","review":"This book was not available in Kindle so I ordered a soft-cover edition.In all cases, the \\"i\\" was not dotted and many periods were missing. It became such a chore to read that I stopped.What portions I did read were interesting in that Frum predicted Jack Kemp was going to win the GOP nomination for president in 1996. Of course, it was Bob Dole (and what a splendid campaign he ran).Frum also touted conservative ideas that were popular at that time, but which have proven to be disastrous after eight years of the Bush administration.Also funny to read were the tributes on the cover praising the book as a classic by the very people who would stab Frum in the back in 2010 as a turncoat Republican."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I have a Pentium 4 1.8GHz PC and it works great for me. The manual said as long as you have a graphic card that is complient with DirectX 9.0, then the product works.I am not giving 5 stars because a couple software issues. But they can be resolved easily.1. The GemStar TV Listing software does not install automatically with the installation CD. You have to install the software manually.2. When you select the best video quality setting, the audio can go out of sync.The issues are documented on the ATI website.If you have a large HD, you can record TV shows in MPEG2 format and the quality is pretty decent. This is a great alternative to getting a DVCR which is probably 8 times the cost at the time of this review. Considered the price and the features provided by the card, it is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely dissapointed...","review":"I bought this in hopes that i would be able to hook it up to my pc and play console games... it worked!.... sortof. The card is apparently too slow. Press jump, jump a second later. So i unplugged my system and then i plugged the cable in. It was kindof blurry. Not terribly, but enough to dissapoint me even more. I expected far better from ati...It works alright so long as you use dscaler [...]Sad you have to use a third party application to get this hardware to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you have an ATI Radeon graphics chip FIRST","review":"ATI does not call out that fact you MUST have an ATI Radeon graphics chip on your computer until you run the diagnostics and it happily informs you that you should buy one of their graphics cards. This is NOT in any specification I have seen beyond the diagnostic message. I returned the ATI TV Wonder Pro card at that point. Then I noticed Kathy (see other reviews)had the same problem. ATI is doing themselves a disservice with this as I am not buying any of their products in the future. Also, I am going to first read ALL the Amazon reviews on a product in the future! I would make this a MINUS 5 star rating if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a user friendly product","review":"I consider myself rather knowledgeable about computer installations with software and hardware. I unfortunately spent many hours trying to make this product operation for use as a TV on my LCD screen. The software is extremely poor! I would not purchase this product unless you have a lot of time and patience to deal with the software problems and lack of technical assistance by ATI. My email response from ATI pertaining to my questions detailing my steps of installation were completely ignored. The only response that was given was a referral back to the home page at ATI. Good Luck to you if you can make it work! Or if you want to spend sometime on the phone to Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good waste of my hardly earned money","review":"ATI is a decent company.
