Can you say 'pedophile?!'I can't even BELIEVE the censors would let this slide. I stopped the film after this scene. It's not funny, it's disgusting.

Even though we've reached an age now where even criticisms are being criticized, I honestly & truly dgaf.

Full of funny and raunchy moments. I've always been a fan of Sandler's, and \\"That's My Boy\\" was a big improvement from \\"Jack and Jill\\", which was decent but not nearly as good.

The childish jokes and physical humor with lots of screaming always gets me in the funny bone, unfortunately there is none of that in this movie except maybe 1 or 2 moments for a total of 12 seconds.If you've been on the fence about watching this movie and are a fan of Sandler, I darn near guarantee you'll grab your laptop half way through this movie to check email or Facebook because you are just barely paying attention and waiting to laugh.This is one of those comedies that tries to have a soul (ala Just Go With It) but is unfortunately written so flat that the \\"soul\\" doesn't carry it and you just sit around waiting to laugh and it doesn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Great actors, but the movie sucked.

I think he's a very talented guy, but this one seemed like an attempt by Adam Sandler to see how extreme he could be. I like sick, off-the-wall humor until it becomes the whole premise of the movie. He's always had some of that in his movies, but this was ridiculous. It's almost like he was trying to see how many offenseive and perverse topics he could jam into one film for shock effect. A few funny moments, but all in all, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandler's cashing a check; cant blame him","review":"I normally enjoy Adam Sandler's movies, including his recently panned \\"Jack & Jill\\", but \\"That's my Boy\\" was quite horrible.

Even with Vanilla Ice in there. I mean, just how long can you milk the eighties? That was, hmm, thirty years ago. The music's still good, which he uses liberally. Paying for those copyrights must have been pricey. But hey, the marine, the uptight rich white family, the poor, misunderstood but lovable schnook with a heaht a gold.

And for someone so concerned with credibility, you'd figure Kurt St. Thomas could write his own material. After all, he spent all that time with the band... right? Apparently not, because he actually uses Michael Azerrad's material from Come As You Are. I've read CAYA, Heavier Than Heaven, and Journals, and by the time I got to the end of chapter two of Chosen Rejects, I knew Kurt St. Thomas was going to continue taking entire passages from Azerrad's book. Sure enough, that's all Chosen Rejects \\"offers\\"; Michael Azerrad's passages chewed up and spit out by Kurt St. Thomas, sometimes word-for-word."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rome story, straight from the horse's mouth","review":"Mary Ann, you're making up things. Kurt Cobain was suicidal, and tried to end his life in Rome. There's no disputing these facts. Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, the actual doctor who pumped Kurt's stomach in Rome and saved his life, knew Cobain was flight risk, and gave him a hospital room with no windows because of it. He knew Cobain was nothing more than a charming junkie from the moment he spotted his veins and heard Cobain speak after he was saved from his coma. Dr. Galletta also said that saving Cobain's life was a waste, which was so funny yet so true. Now THERE'S some brutal honesty for ya.And here's the link, Mary Ann.

It seemed that after the first 100 pages the stories got much better. I particularly liked \\"Voice From The Void\\", \\"Death Mask\\" and \\"Faith Like Wine\\". These were great stories. \\"The Ghost Of St. Marks\\" didn't interest me much. It was confusing - what was the relationship between Father Brian Stuart and David? It seemed like the author was trying to hint that they were gay, but you were left wondering what was the true relationship between them? I don't know; I just didn't get that one.Overall, a good collection of stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errr...wow","review":"My first foray into the dark and terrifying world of slave exploitation pulp fiction and what a surprisingly entertaining read. Like all exploitation, it wallows in the very bigotry it claims to denounce and so includes countless references to big bull n--s, mullato whores, and halfcaste darkies, while perpetuating every racial stereotype ever conceived. And yet once the reader overcomes the initial shock, the story is actually pretty good. Set in the 1790s, a rugged womanizer inherits a plantation in St. Domingue/Haiti and finds himself playing a major roll in the island's revolutionary war of freedom and independence. Featuring several real life individuals (Henry Christophe and Toussaint Louverture among them), the book is actually quite well written and for all its sensational use of racism, sex, and torture, is highly entertaining while offering some pretty sound factual information regarding the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Sun","review":"I read this book years ago, not long after it was published.

Our third reader is not pleased about the quality of the book. Our fourth reader did not agree with the plot and the characters. The book was good on the whole, but when you break it up, it is all together a horrid read. Our fifth reader thought that this book was horrible! She thought that it had no plot at all!

Unfortunately, the author's own ideas slip in several places, especially towards the end of the book, sometimes in disturbing ways. I say \\"disturbing\\" because this text is offered as an introduction to Buddhism. A reader who is unfamiliar with Buddhism may blindly accept several profoundly unenlightened ideas thinking they are Buddha's own, when they actually express the author's confusion.I would have given the book three or four stars had it been titled, \\"Buddha, His Life and Teachings, Plus Some of Osho's Radical Insights.\\" Even though I don't believe Osho's radical ideas are truly \\"insights,\\" at least that way an inexperienced reader would be prompted to separate words that reflect Buddha from words that reflect Osho."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most terrifying book of revenge I have ever read...","review":"This is Ruby Jean Jensen's most captivating book - in my opinion.

It features some of the most beautiful camera shots of the director's career. The subject matter is very unique and somehow gets under the skin - this is the great mythic-religous Pasolini's rendering of a modern spiritual figure. The man has the power to change the lives of all those around him - a sort of walking god-head.It is a difficult film to describe - and it is even more difficult to say why I like it so much...

Silvana Mangano stars as the wife and mother, and Terence Stamp appears in the first half of the film. The film's tone, both intellectual and shocking, is likely to be difficult for contemporary American viewers, but clearly Pasolini intended absolutely everything in the film. To best appreciate it, it is necessary to regard it in the context of the late sixties. The DVD has few 'extras' but the quality is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, haunting","review":"Through gorgeous cinematography and a bold symbolic language that makes it very difficult to take the film literally, Pasolini investigates the hollowness of bourgeois life. The film may be difficult for those expecting either a straightforward narrative or a 'deep' avant-garde experience: by resisting those boundaries Pasolini created a film that is both hilarious and haunting, dealing frankly with sex in a way that is impossible to ignore but difficult to take seriously. My advice to anyone watching this film would be to just let it do its work. This is a remarkable piece of filmmaking, and as such will be denounced by those who desire easy categorization. It is joyful, sad, ridiculous, political, and almost religious despite Pasolini's atheism. By letting the unexplainable remain unexplained, Pasolini created a powerful film that really gets under the viewer's skin(as evidenced by the extreme polarization it causes). An absolute masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"film history","review":"the film that changed the way cinema viewed family affairs. A classic by one of the best and most controversial directors.

Jesus/God/Satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways. The maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup, cures scarred children, and floats in the air. The wife bites the side of her finger, has sex with random strangers, and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as Mozart's Requiem thunders in the background.The movie is technically inept and badly written. Any randomly chosen film of Bunuel or Almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this Pasolini fiasco. Recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious.Two stars for the \\"So bad it's good\\" factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile textbook","review":"I found teaching from this a good corrective to bland and irrelevant fyc textbooks. It's built around a series of snowballing exercises that guide students from thinking about an issue that individually concerns them to becoming knowledgeable on that issue. In the process they pick up the basics of research, writing, and revision. It's progressive a la Dewey and Freire, with a heavy dose of logical reasoning, critical readings of sources, and media critique thrown in.One caveat: its layout could use some work. It's hard on the eyes at times. But if you're a progressive fyc instructor, you'll like this.

Some citizens found Billy to be nice fellow and others saw him as the terrible desperado/killer of New Mexico, Arizona and Northern Mexico. Wherever the truth might lie, he has become a legend, and dozens of books and movies have covered his short life. The writing in this book was stilted and old-fashioned; then again it was written 60+ years ago...but still an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book profoundly influenced me..","review":"I read it while in college, probably about ~1979. I gave it to my boyfriend's mother, who I pictured as Mira. ;-) and who was a very typical 50's stay-at-home wife. I don't think she ever gave me her impressions of the book... but this book remains with me even today, as sort of a 'think out of the box' bell-ringing epiphany. My mother was much the same way, you grew up, you got married, and your life was taken care of. Divorce hit her like a nuclear bomb, it was definitely NOT a part of the plan.

I was always raised to believe that I could achieve anything and be anybody. After reading this novel I realized that that wasn't always the case; had I been born thirty years ago I never would've had the chance to achieve all of my dreams...a chance I now have. I now understand why the feminist movement came to be, why the movement has not died and why it will NOT die.

I reread it last month for my bookclub. I recall that my first reading was at least satisfactory. Rereading the book has not been as satisfying an experience.

I started reading, page by page, but soon got bored with the \\"over-kill\\" at every turn of the page. I worked outside of the home for 15 years in various administrative positions, so I know that the things described in the book do happen: we women are definitely mistreated, underappreciated, underpaid, not shown the respect we deserve (even by fellow women), etc. But, please, enough is enough. I agree with the reader from Quebec that at times, the book read more like a male-bashing piece of fiction. And, definitely, Ms. French could have gotten what she wanted to say in less than 1/2 of the lengthy novel that was her end result. The quality of writing is there, even though more quantity than necessary was used."},{"rating":"1","title":"not-so-biting social commentary","review":"I had to read \\"The Women's Room\\" for class, and never before have I ever been so embarrassed to read a novel in public before.

The book's characters are so pretentiously psuedo-cerebral, it made my entire body hurt to read of their attempts at revolution. The book is in need of some serious editing; an abridged version would have been more tolerable. Lastly, French's decision to include herself (?) as a character and inconsistently breaking out of the third-person voice and into the first thoroughly confused me.

This sounded more natural than the version on Pablo Honey, and with this EP you don't have to buy the expensive import Itch to hear it.The Trickster is an excellent track in the style of Paranoid Android - if you liked that track off OK Computer, this CD is well worth ten dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief commentary on a highly underrated Radiohead release:","review":"Flagship tracks \\"The Trickster\\" and \\"Lewis (Mistreated)\\" are alone worth buying this EP for. Punctuated by intense guitar-driven rock and the layered, waif-like vocal talents of enigmatic frontman Yorke, Radiohead have easily moved ahead of their peers as the best musical product this decade. Prior albums \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" are dizzyingly awesome, and this short EP plays like a footnote to all that is Radiohead. In my opinion, this band is producing the best music in the world at the moment, and this EP is testament that even their B-sides and rarities deserve a showcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Pablo Honey","review":"The songs here show a definate improvement from Radiohead's debut album. Some, like \\"Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong\\" and \\"Permanent Daylight,\\" almost feel like they could have come from the Kid A sessions. Overall, this album is extremely strong and is an absolute neccesity to Radiohead fans.However, there's the issue of the price.I personally bought this because I was a big fan of \\"Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong\\" and thought that it would be cool to own an actual album of songs like it and not have to worry about having it burned onto a CD along with tons of other B-Sides. That's just what worked for me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 mp3 tracks?","review":"Much to my dismay, only 4 tracks were available from amazon MP3.

Considering I absolutely adore both of them says a lot about Radiohead's depth, endurance (released 6 years apart) and all round musical talent regardless of their current style.

But whatever the reason, it won't stop me from loving this EP or recommending it to anyone who asks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for sensitive or problem feet","review":"Shoe allows room for orthotics and the stretch accommodates swelling.

Once again, he uses his limited, but effective, voice to absolute perfection. I admit that the music can be a bit strange it times. But, than again, this is Franco Battiato who ranges from performing 60's classics live in front of the Pope to doing strange experimental music.Make no mistake about it. This is not teeny-bopper, bubble-gum music. Battiato is complicated. His words and music have meaning. However, you have to carefully listen to get his message.What more can I say? Great music from a really great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Your Brain Alive","review":"This book is obviously light-hearted and fun-filled. It seems intended for those minds who enjoy little differences in their daily life and seek cheap treats. I recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by light fun and capable of appreciating it. If you do not like fun and feel that proposed fun like this ought to be backed by experiments involving the exercises that strongly suggest a correlation between improvement of cognitive performance and the exercise then this book ought to be avoided by you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find something good to say","review":"Katz and Rubin's collection of exercises is an assortment of hackneyed ideas such as the communal chessgame in the office combined with many that are silly if not dangerous such as wearing workgloves while driving. This book may provide some new ideas for those who lives are unrelentingly monotonous but its exercises can largely be summarised as \\"do something different today\\". So do something different and don't bother with the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots Of Suggestions For Preventing Memory Loss","review":"This is a quick-read but very interesting and practical. The gist of the book is to improve memory, you need to keep your brain active and use all of your senses. \\"Routines can be brain deadening.\\" Basically, learn to enjoy new experiences, change things around, interact with people and change up routines. It gives lots of specific suggestions on exactly how to do these things. It was exactly what I was looking for!The most startling thing I learned from reading this book is: \\"Research has shown that watching television literally numbs the mind: The brain is less active during TV-viewing than during sleep!\\" (p. 117)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure hot air!","review":"The audacity of Dr. Katz is quite surprising. As a scientist he is well aware that the mjority of the claims made are unfounded. It is quite disappointing that to earn a few dollars Dr. Katz betrays the scientific community. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over simplistic - Brain Building 101","review":"Someone is cashing in on baby-boomer paranoia.

Read a book a month from Amazon and work the daily cryptoquote puzzles. It will be more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"The suggested exercises range from the irritating to the absurd. Katz is selling to an audience that is paranoid about their cognitive abilities but too lazy to do anything constructive about it, e.g. reading novels, learning languages, traveling to interesting places. He is a swindler, irresponsibly and knowingly selling his audience quackery."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This book might be the biggest scam ever. Including \\"increase mental fitness\\" anywhere in the description of this book should be considered crime. There is NO WAY that by using my left hand to brush my teeth in the morning is going to make my mind more acute, or by going to a farmers market is going to improve my memory. Anyone who thinks this book helps isn't being honest with themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make your brain die","review":"The first half of the book discusses how 'exercising' your brain keeps it healthy. This section is mind numbingly boring. It glosses over the science so you will learn nothing new and merely repeats the concept that exercising your brain keeps it fit, over and over and over. The second half deals with the actual mental exercises or \`neurobics'. There is nothing new or exciting and it is repetitive to the point where your brain is begging to be released from the mental torture. Let me break it down for you in a few of sentences so you can save yourself ten bucks. Use your less dominant hand to do things. Use your senses in ways they are not accustomed. For example, try to perform a task by feel that you normally do by sight. Finally, have new experiences. Here is an actual moronic example from the book: instead of a bagel and coffee in the morning, try a muffin and herbal tea. Your brain will be much healthier if you do anything other than read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurobiologists know: this is pure fiction","review":"Yes, this book does offer a \\"very interesting explanation of how the brain processes information.\\" Unfortunately, that explanation is not supported by experimental evidence. There really is no data to suggest that poking at produce or walking around a room with your eyes shut is going to induce the production of neurotrophins. Nor that such production of neurotrophins would result in new synapse formation. Nor that those synapses would result in a healthier brain. The arguments presented in this book form a house of cards that rely on premises that have no foundation in scientific fact. Dr. Katz must be calculating that his standing as a respected neurobiologist will be sufficient proof of his unsupported theories. It's unfortunate that he didn't use his intelligence and erudition to bring some real neurobiology to the lay public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Original, Informative and Fun. Excellent!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It illustrates a simple theory, that being the \\"use it or lose it\\" theory as it relates to the brain. What's refreshing and unique is its approach, its platform - that just simple mental gymnastics (that we see peddled in books, CD Roms and more all over) aren't enough. The book effectively explains, (and backs up with solid research at The Salk Institute, UCal, and other places) that strengthening the brain with cross-training through multi-sensory workouts and exercises (associating scents with activities or places, for example) can build and strengthen our synapses and dendrites . I found this fascinating as I took brain cell growth to be more of an early childhood-specific activity. The exercises to me proved to be fun, and real effective ways to \\"switch on the connections\\" and look at things differently. I hope it all pays off. Judging from the insights and solid research behind it, I think it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me think of incense and tie-dye!","review":"Having been a child in that era and just discovering rock music, this really brings back some memories from that part of my life.I actually bought this as a gift for my son who somehow got really into 60's music (maybe my giving him my entire 60's/70's vinyl collection sparked his interest?).

It is a complete rip-off. I may never buy another CD from Amazon again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some old Animals tracks, mostly not the Animals","review":"The first 13 tracks on this CD are another re-iteration of tracks recorded by Danny McCulloch, the bass player with Eric Burdon and the Animals in the late 1990s. They have been released under several titles over the past decade or so. Beware if you see CDs with songs such as Howlin', Frisco Queen, and Colour of the Sunset.The last 4 tracks are taken from the original Animals' concert on December 31, 1963 at the Club A Go Go in Newcastle where they were also backing Sonny Boy Williamson. These are excellent tracks capturing the group live in their early days. Mojo Magazine has called the original album from this concert one of the top live albums of the early British Invasion. The entire concert, with both the Animals' and Sonny Boy Williamson's sets has just been re-released as \\"Taken Alive\\".

Yes, this cd and the company who made it, was a scam. If by looking at the label, you thought, hey this looks like the perfect Animals collection; good price, good song material, all true, but, IT's NOT THE ANIMALS!!!!!!!!!!!!It is a bunch of modernized versions of old classics by The Animals. The guy who gave this cd a five star review, must be drunk, or deaf. I was so shocked when I first heard this cd. I kept skipping the tracks one by one, and every single one was modern and electronic-ized. It was like a bad friken dream!

This is an aweful cd, it's just a collection of some of The Animals most well known songs, which have somehow been \\"digitally remastered\\" to grate on your eardrums. It's not even Eric Burdon and The Animals who sing the songs on the cd, it's some moron with a synthesizer. My God they should all be burned and sent back to Hell where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ridiculous!","review":"I echo the sentiments of all the other reviewers. I did not buy this CD on Amazon.com, but it was an impulse buy while browsing in a local used CD store. I was lured by the cheap price. I usually research reviews and \\"try\\" before buying by getting CDs from the library. Needless to say, I will be returning this. There are no liner notes with musician/songwriter information. Anyone with even a casual knowledge of music will recognize that this is not The Animals, but a canned, synthesized cover band.

On the first track there's some guy who tries his best to sound a little bit like Eric Burdon, but in fact sounds like he has a chest disease. It's all downhill from there. Because I didn't actually pay for this, I'm not too enraged: the intro to \\"Don't Let Me Be Mistunderstood\\" made me laugh out loud. But not much.Like the others said: don't buy this CD.

Easy to read, with many examples to help you understand the different conventions and there use."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Place to Go!","review":"I know of no book that conveys the most popular bridge-playing conventions as painlessly as Barbara Seagram and Marc Smith's remarkable TWENTY-FIVE BRIDGE CONVENTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW. They are all there, patiently explained, with examples drawn from appropriate circumstances and topical quizzes following immediately.Generally, the book starts with the basic conventions like Takeout Doubles and Blackwood and progresses to the more esoteric ones like Reverse Drury and Roman Key Card. We might argue about the exact order these conventions appear; Ms. Seagram is BIG on the Jacoby Transfer and its big brother, the Texas Transfer. Should people really learn those before they learn about Cue-bid Raises and Balancing? But that is a small wrinkle in such an excellent presentation; if you and your partner prefer to skip a lesson or two and come back later, this book will serve well anyway. Deserves a place on every good bridge-player's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Declarer play clearly explained","review":"This book explains gradually more sophisticated principles of declarer play in a clear, concise manner. I'm a recreational player trying to succeed in local ACBL club play, and this book teaches a progression of skills to understand and incorporate into my play. For me, the detail, number of examples, and chapter quizzes are about right. Understanding the principles and actually applying them in competitive play are two very different things, but this book clearly shows me the path I need to follow to raise my game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Explanations!","review":"I'm not a fan of bridge books, although I love to play.

It probably took the author a half an hour to assemle them and ready them for publication. If you are seriously interested in getting to know the real Grant, then read his memoirs, one of the great books written in the English language. Most of these quotes are extracted from Grant's memoirs, without editorial comment (mercifully).This is just a slap-dash job designed to be sold in a \\"Cracker Barrel\\" restaurant waiting area.

I figured it would have more things (possibly behind the scenes stuff), but she only sings a few songs, and talks VERY breifly about them. It would be a good buy for fans of her early stuff, especially Jagged Little Pill, but might be disappointing to others.I have to say that the sound quality is FANTASTIC though. I was very impressed with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Great Treasure","review":"This is the first VH1 Storytellers DVD that I have purchased and I have to admit that I am with truth greatly pleased. The setting, the directing, the music and Alanis herself all give off this vibe that relaxes you and alleviates you of your stress. Alanis' beautiful and captivating voice makes me smile as well as cry. I found it to be a great treasure to watch her engage in conversations with the audience. It's really interesting to hear what she has to say, even though her songs speak for herself. Alanis with truth knows how to pull in an audience and she knows how to offer a great performance.

The first song either already started by the time the DVD show begins, or they she simply did a short version of it.Besides that, her performance is top quality. The sound and image quality of the video is great. The DVD also allows you to play the show omitting the storytelling bits.Set List:Hand In My PocketYou LearnThank UUnsentYou Oughta KnowThat I Would Be GoodStillExtras:UninvitedHead Over FeetI give it 4 stars only because I think it was short. It is so good that you wish it was longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis is great - the DVD isn't","review":"The music of course is good and seeing Alanis interpreting her songs is inspiring for all of us that enjoy creativity and spontaneity. But the producer really did not do a good job. Regularly, he'll focus the camera on the audience, closing up on some man or woman, who is singing along as if she had been smoking marijuana (sorry guys). I understand that the camera may not be at all times on a close-up on Alanis, but instead it could be on the other musician's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very emotional Bonanza.","review":"But fun. It's about a boy who's struggling to get over his father's death when Ben killed him in self defense. It's fun, emotiomal, dramatic, and many more adjectives I can't think of right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"The Best\\" instead, you'll get 3 of these 4 songs","review":"I have no problem with the material here, especially since it contains two of Dave's biggest solo hits - \\"California Girls\\" (one of the few remakes where the imitator blows away the originator) and \\"Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\\". The other two are fun but inessential songs. No matter what though, this is a pretty steep price for what is essentially a four-song CD single. Three out of these four cuts are available on \\"The Best of David Lee Roth\\", along with 17 other songs, for only a few bucks more than this one. I would recommend that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Value","review":"The first time I heard \\"Just A Gigalo / Aint Got Nobody\\" was on the Village People \\"Macho Man\\" album. Does this mean Dave ripped them off to? I think a thousand acts have covered Gigalo, but ask a hundred people who's song it is, and Diamond Dave will be the version most people know. The line about \\"a day when youth will pass away\\" is especially poinant given how Dave looks like the Cryptkeeper from Creepshow nowadays. Coconut Grove truly sucks, but the other three songs are great and are on \\"The Best\\" album, making \\"The Best\\" a great value and Crazy from the Heat an over proced redundancy. A better use of the silicon in wasted in this CD would be to make a DVD release of the DAMNED VIDEOS to these songs. Gigalo and California Girls are about the videos as much as they are about the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis Prima COVERED JUST A GIGOLO???","review":"Whoever wrote that idiotic sentence -- be advised -- David Lee Roth's rendition of \\"Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\\" was a word-for-word, note-for-note, nuance-for-nuance ripoff of a record that Louis Prima, Keely Smith, and Sam Butera recorded in the 1950's. Just as Roth ripped off the Beach Boys with 'California Girls', so did he rip off Louis Prima. Most karaoke junkies today only remember the David Lee Roth ripoff. Just goes to show how ignorant the average American record buyer (or voter for that matter) is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Great, But Fun","review":"An EP recording with only 4 songs on it is not usually begging for people to line up and buy it. Finding out that these are pretty much just remakes and covers is also not necessarily the best marketing technique...Unless you are David Lee Roth. Then you can pull it off. These songs are a fun mix and are good choices to have playing in the background at your party, especially if you're somewhere warm. The other side is that it shows the diversity of Roth's influences and roots. I would not dub this as the greatest CD of all time, but it's one that people seem to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"When I played the CD it was apparent that the anti-theft feature had been triggered so it skipped, then played real fast, and kept doing this so that all the songs were ruined.

She thinks she can handle taking care of the house and her 3 year old brother, but she is sadly mistaken. Her dad is not much help.This is the most ridiculous and sexist of the Anastasia books. Although they make a big deal of titling the housekeeping schedule \\"Krupnik Family Non-sexist Housekeeping Schedule\\" it is pretty obvious that Mrs. Krupnik does all the work around there and that the rest of the family would be (and is) lost without her. The happy little ending is that Mrs. Krupnik buys a microwave and therefore is better able to do all the housework. Bull. Still a pretty funny book, though.

It's beautiful and dark and melancholy--all of which are the highest of compliments, if you have musical tastes like mine. I also adore Mona's voice, it's low and raw and full of emotion.

They're certainly not bad, but they leave something to be desired. \\"Death\\" seems to be written with great care and attention as the murder happens and the mystery begins, but then it just ends. It seems to me that the author was given a page limit and once he reached it, he simply \\"solved\\" the crime. The criminal isn't necessarily someone we've ever met before, it isn't someone integral to the plot, it doesn't make sense - it just is.Zubro made me feel cheated.

I think it really captures Al Capp's Characters to a T. All the girls chasing Abner were great. Jeff York could of used about 30 more pounds of muscle to really look like Abner(those skinny arms just didn't cut it). At least he wasn't sloppy and overweight as he was in the 1950's when he appeared in \\"Old Yeller\\". This movie is now being sold on DVD at stores like Walmart for $1.00, what a shame as some of this high budget trash they make today and sell for 20 bucks isn't even worth a nickel! This is a movie that reaches down into the town of \\"Dog Patch\\" and carries a great story to the end of the show. Some of the folks in the movie like Mammy Yokem look like they escaped from the set of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" that was made a year earlier in'39(she would of made a Great munchkin). Bottom line get this movie classic, you will really get a kick out of it,\\"Enjoy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but really strange","review":"This is one really strange film. The people who made tried to make humans into cartoon characters through the application of pounds of makeup. Everyone has the look of a postnuclear mutant tribe. The dialog was really hard to follow because of the way they talk (I can't even describe it). Its almost like a warhol film from the 1960s. Everything about it just seems strange and off. But for whatever reasons, its compelling to watch. One virtue is that its not boring like other adaptations of Lil Abner (the musical in particular) and there is always something stranger to see every few minutes.I think the film as a film probably works better with people who understand the source material really well. If you don't know it, its really difficult to follow whats going on.But regardless, this film will be an interesting experience for almost anyone.

Some of the acting was good enough. But this was obviously a low budget effort filled with effects that struck me as pretentious and that eventually became tiresome. There were too many overexposed backgrounds, too many split screens, and too many hotel hallways meant to remind us of The Shining. Finally, there was way too little Hamlet.

I was referred to this book by the bicycle shop where I purchased my road bike. The salesperson who helped me had taken up biking later in life, like myself. He had made amazing progress, and attributed it to Lance's book. For those like myself, who are on the steep part of the learning curve, it's good to have an accessible role model (Lance Armstrong) by means of this book.

Although only from 1999, it felt much older in terms of camera quality, etc. All i can really say is that its average. The story just lacked a compelling punch to take it over the edge. The cast and acting was ok, but not that interesting. The music was boring. The story is ok, but also lacking punch. And so it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers Lane","review":"Ahahahaha. It's so cheesy, it's good. The only reason I ordered this movie was because the movie stared Anna Faris from House Bunny. I thought the movie was super cheesy but I enjoyed it.

It's full of many repetitive elements: For instance an ugly, dorky, perverted guy gets his jollies by either looking up someone's skirt or being in the appropriate location to see the leading female characters constantly without their clothes ( he gets plenty of frontal views of the red haired one).This movie makes several attempts at humor which consistently fail miserably. This movie is also listed as being an action adventure but fails to deliver entertaining action or adventure. If it was possible to give this title less than one star I would have done it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible excuse to get people naked","review":"This movie was so horrid that I barely made it through the first episode. I am probobly the only guy who doesn't like this, but the fact that Kotetsu was so young (she couldn't be older then maybe 14) really disturbed me.

It sounds standard but reallyyy lots of fun. The animation was on excellent, well spaced with lots of different camera angles. The fight scenes were very good and the soundtrack was very different and quite catchy. All in all I was left wanting more but unfortunatly this is all that has been animated from the original manga series.

It was enjoyable to read about a true historic event with a character in the book exactly my age. You may tend to think that Billy is a fictional character but he is not. This makes the book more enjoyable for teens to read.The book was very well written and gave an accurate portrayal of what life was like during the Indian's struggle to keep their homeland.

Billy Caldwell is a 16 Year old boy who travels with an Indian Chief name Tecumseh. Billy ventures out with Tecumseh and fights the Americans. Now, I'm not a big war fan. This book is really slow. It took me 1 month to read. This book starts too get a little better toward page 185 out 227. That's 185 pages of boring. I like books like Harry Potter that aren't so real.

Maybe you made them or you were given them. Maybe they are different sizes or the wrong color? Sharyn shows you what to do to make a beautiful quilt out of blocks that you do not know what to do with. My favorite thing in the book is where she takes the same blue star blocks and shows you how to make 7 different quilts out of them and only one of them turns out to be blue. The woman is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Considered a clasic","review":"I bought this dvd when I bought the Cd and I am so glad I did. Lauryn Hill is my favorite artist, and I have always seen the spiritual side of Lauryn (in every song she has ever sung/rapped), but this dvd is a treat. With the Cd I tend to skip through to my favorites and bypass most of her converstions, but the Dvd helps you to see the fullness of who she is humanly and spiritually. You see and experience her beauty unpolished, real, and thankful. This is another staple in my home and is played just as often as \\"the hang over\\" and \\"Toy story\\". I would highly recomend to anyone buying the Cd to get the Dvd too, it's more helpful to experience gift and feeling a part of her message. \\"It's freedom time yall!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Deal","review":"This was a breath of fresh air.

I have never met people in life as real as she is. She reveals who she is in the most intimate way. She tears away the layers of herself right in front of you.

They all clean up wonderfully and you don't know how much better food tastes when it is cooked in ceramic/corning. No burning, scorching or cooking too fast. Food stays moist. Uncover it if you want browning when using the covered dishes.The only thing I would caution against is putting any ceramic/corning/glass dish on a cold counter right out of the oven, you could crack it. I often have the dish in my potholdered hands on the way to placing it on the counter and remember that it needs to go onto the stovetop or a cutting board. Please don't spray Pam on the handles either as it stains and won't come off on the Khaki.

Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO or Showtime Should Continue this Show!","review":"When this show was on, I found it difficult to believe that it was on regular TV because it was actually too good. It definitely seemed like something I would pay to see at my local movie theater or on a paid cable network. Sadly, not enough viewers tuned in to enjoy the magnificent storyline and scripting, and as a result, the show was canceled. I still hold out hope that another network (HBO? Showtime?) will bring this fantastic (too good for regular TV) cast back together to continue where the last episode ended. If you have not seen this show, just download the first episode and then you will hooked.

This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross!","review":"My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy. Well, my son usually takes regular rice cereal fine. I fed him this and at first he would gag and most if it came right back out. I tasted it and holy crap is it gross. It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful!

The plastic containers he carries sandwiches in won't set flat in the bottom, they have to be on their sides. He won't be using this cooler as intended, but both of us were impressed with the materials and construction of this cooler, so we will keep it and use it to carry snacks and drinks for day-hikes and bicycle trips.

Worse yet the melted cheese and grease will go in between the bottom metal plate and the plastic housing with no way to get it out except when it is stored on end (one of the advertised features) upon which the cheese and grease will then run out and onto the shelf or cabinet it is stored in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Power Cord","review":"Purchased this popper for Xmas, made 3 batches of popcorn and the power cord broke in half, now there is a chance of getting shocked because the bare power wire is now exposed, very dangerous for children, I returned it to the store for a full refund, I am now looking for a replacement.

It's my favorite in my whole collection. Kingdom of Heaven is my most favorite movie and I really wanted this sword. If you've seen the movie and have no idea who Odo is, he is the German \\"Viking\\" in Liam Neilson's troop, you know, the big guy who gets a crossbow bolt through his neck...and keeps on going!This sword is much heavier than the other broadswords you will find, almost 4 pounds! The center of balance is about four or five inches from the hilt, so it's a little imbalanced. If the grip where a little wider, then this might have countered this problem. My thought is that the heaviness and foreward balance of the sword is ment as a reflection of the Odo character from the film. If you are a fan of this movie, I'd say don't let this one slip away! Really good, officialy licenced replicas from Kingdom of Heaven are getting VERY rare! Get it fast! Get it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Parts are Greater than the Whole","review":"This is a 'tweener -- could have been three stars, but I opted for four. Mid-tempo alt country on almost all the cuts and therein lies the problem. Listening to the songs individually, one thinks \\"all-around good stuff,\\" lyrics, music, playing, singing, but after 13 very similar cuts one is also left with the feeling that the Voles could use a bit more variety in approach and arrangements. At the end of the CD, it's very hard to go back and distinguish the parts -- but the highlights, when you do, are \\"I'm the One for You,\\" the title cut (a sound that is frequently repeated in the other tunes, e.g. Back in Your Heart, Please Come See Me, and Hope You Know), and \\"Something Broken.\\" There is plenty of talent here, but it is also easy to see why the Volebeats have gotten lost in the tidal wave of alt-country music -- not a whole lot sets them apart from the talented crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I would never recommend anyone to silverinsanity they would have to be insane to purchase anything from them they should be closed down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoot Out the Guitar","review":"I heard the opening moments of this album at in a local record store one day in 1982, and recognized Mr RT's guitar immediately.

This is the perfect soundtrack for two people falling out of love with one another. Don't let this scare you, though--this is sublime stuff. But be warned: this is not for the faint of heart; this music will sweep you to your feet.

This is as good a record as was made in the 1980s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This is one of the most brilliant albums I have ever heard. Linda Thompson's voice is rich and evocative, and Richard Thompson's guitar work is simply amazing--fire, passion, technical mastery, excitement--he is one hell of a guitarist.

I rented the movie purely to see Gong Li, who is one of the most beautiful actresses out there. I was absolutely blown away by this film. The story, the acting, the flow; everything about it was masterful. I am a big fan of Zhang Yimou, but this film far outshines any other work he's done before or after. Gong's acting is superb, matched entirely by You Ge. The scene with the \\"tea\\" revenge caught me so offhand, in both the touching portral of Chinese family life mixed with the wonderful quirky humor, that I laughed out loud and nearly choked on some ice tea I was drinking at the time. 10 minutes later I was crying my eyes out.

This is a simple, stirring tale that takes us through 3 generations of ordinary people in extraordinary times.Whether it is some knowledge of the cultural revolution you crave, or a basic poignant movie, just watch it instead of reading these reviews.

The setting starts from the post-Japanese invasion of China, through the Chinese civil war, Communist victory, Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. Through the experience of one family, the film provides a critique of the Maoist policies and personality cult. No wonder the film (and book) has been banned in China.

Yimou does an excellent job portraying how an ordinary, apolitical family survives great political upheaval and personal sorrow. Ge You and Gong Li give two amazing performances. You are wrapped up in the movie within minutes and soon feeling the same emotions as the actors. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, shout hurrah or ball your eyes out, or walk away feeling grateful or depressed.

There aren't even any good fight scenes in it! I watched the first tape of the OVA and thought to myself, \\"Wow, this is going to be good!\\" Then I saw the second tape and could only feel disappointment.

I saw the preview of this DVD on Last Exile (which is a pretty cool series) I was attracted by the excellent detailed animation in the 2 minute preview. I couldn't find a review on it so I went and bought it. Unfortunately all this movie has going for it is the animation. Which personally I think is superb! The story is sorely lacking and the translation must be way off, Heck I don't speak a word of japanese but I can even tell I was missing more to the story. There is no explanation to any of the characters nor why they are there except there deamons attacking Japan. No explanation on the demons at all. Plus the movie seems skip alot from scene to scene without explaing any of the event. To top it off you have an ending that makes no sense. You don't even know what exactly is happening. I advise just to rent it and if you do put it on mute and just look at the eye candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't that bad","review":"A lot of people who reviewed Sakura Wars said it was pretty bad - mostly because it was impossible to follow and the fight scenes were too short. Well, the OAV's still have a lot to offer; some pretty good steampunk visuals, attractive character design, and (with 2 notable exceptions) fairly attractive character personalities, too. I'd say it would be better if it were LONGER, mostly because there's a lot of good material left untapped here. Definitely worth the price if you're into shoujo anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another case of Style over Substance","review":"Short review: Sakura Wars has some of the most beautiful animation that I've seen in an anime series. I was really struck by the use of color and detail in this anime. Unfortunately, that's where my enjoyment of this anime ended. I found the story to be very tired, and the characters about as interesting as drying paint. Too fluffy for my taste.If you like \\"You're Under Arrest\\" then this might be along your line of anime (...but maybe not). If you like Eva, Lain, and Bebop; then you probably wouldn't get much our of Sakura Wars. I recommend renting it before committing your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great piece of animation","review":"I saw the japanese version, Very good theme song, a definate hit.

This does not sit well with the spirit of Simon who returns to wreak havoc on Mark's string of one-night stands.The film as a whole is uneven. It kept jumping from being a movie about AIDS to a ghost story to a comedy to a drama to a soap opera, and was never quite able to hold my interest. The acting is marginal and sometimes overly melodramatic so I never really liked the characters.

You won't find any of those things here.The dialogue it horrible. Plotlines are really boring and utterly unbelievable.

Don\`t miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just the writing and acting but also the photography and the music","review":"I only started watching this series in 2005 and got hooked while recovering from surgery, seeing it through a Vicodin haze. What a weird effect! This series is as groundbreaking as my former favorite, \\"Law and Order\\", not just for its fascinating story lines and for the great characters (it has made me a huge William Petersen fan) but also for its amazingly creative and artistic photography -- casting a blue spell over what should normally be institutional-white laboratories and faux-wood-panelled courtrooms -- and the quirky, spooky soundtrack, which deepens the mood of many scenes. There is also plenty of humor in this show, too (Grissom and Greg Sanders are really a hoot!) which is lacking in the spin-offs (and in L & O as well!). I must have seen each episode of the first five years five or six times on cable and I never get tired of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise","review":"My best friend is a fan and she loved when she got this as a gift. she even ordered another to give to another friend of ours"},{"rating":"2","title":"great stories, overly gory","review":"Love the interesting stories and the characters; plots, pacing, and suspense are all great; but the series is overly gory, ER is mild in comparison. That's one reason I like the dvds so well, I can fastforward right through the gory parts, plus miss the commercials; or rather, I don't miss them. Like the fact that the film stars in this series don't consider it beneath them to do a tv series. The mix of personality is good in this, would probably like a little more love interest stories added to this, but that's from a gal's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love C.S.I.","review":"I have been wanting to get all 6 seasons of C.S.I. for some time now.

The characters remain interesting and the show never seems at a loss for excitement. It's interesting to see how the show and its characters have evolved over the years. Finally, when there is nothing else on television, I can watch CSI, again and again. The special effects are great, but if you have a weak stomach, you might want to look the other way during some of these scenes.A definate must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The great CSI","review":"I love CSI and it is a joy to heve all of the episoids from the first season. it is even better because it is in full screen. of course if you love csi yo will love this with all of the epiciods from the first season."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for Horrible Video Quality","review":"Being a long-time CSI fan, I was really looking forward to owning the first season in wide-screen format on Blu-ray. Unfortunately, this set does not come close to meeting my expectations.This release has the worst video quality I have ever seen on Blu-ray. Even allowing for the age of the show, the picture is overly grainy, with dirty spots, and the color is over-saturated and has a strange orange tint. This set feels like the studio planned a Blu-ray release, realized they didn't have the quality they needed from the original film, and just kept processing it anyway so they could cash in on the Blu-ray hype.Not-so-bonus: Disc 1 contains a 2-3 minute advertisement for the upcoming Star Trek Blu-ray set that cannot be skipped or fast-forwarded through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeking Truth","review":"I've always liked CSI and wanted to start at the beginning and watch all the way through to the end. This first season was awesome! It's not the best crime drama for no reason. I especially liked these first episodes because they explore exactly why these characters do what they do: Evidence is what provides truth, even when people and circumstances or crime-scenes don't. These guys are unconventional defenders of truth, and that rocks in a world where truth isn't very popular.."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI-Season one","review":"I have never watched the show on TV.

C.S.I. had some rocky beginnings, but the first season is still worth owning. Alot of the backstory comes from the first season, so if you watch it over and over again *like myself* you'll want to own this. There are some great episodes in this pack, that you'll want to watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite season","review":"The title says it all - the 1st season is the most smart, humane and best-balanced of all so far.They really have a good balance between technical data, corpses and characters interaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have 5 stars if it were in it's original 16x9 aspect","review":"First I'd like to say that I am really impressed with this show. I would have given it 5 stars except for on thing......the show's aspect is 16x9 widescreen and the DVD is fullscreen.I'm guessing that the boxset is fullscreen for one reason....Warners Bros went the lazy route on this because the DVD set was actually produced over a year ago and they don't feel like re-mixing it. FYI - This boxset was released in the UK last year. I hate the fact that companies like Warner Bros don't condsider what the fans want. Considering how popular the show is you would think that they would have made both a fullscreen AND widescreen version. I give FOX kudos for releasing 24 widescreen. Why can't Warner Bros do the same?I'm also betting that Warner Bros will release the show widescreen when HD-DVD's become popular in a few of years from now. At least it will be widescreen AND in high definition then."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOO GOOD!!!","review":"I'm 100% satisfied!

I must say, however, that if this is the number one show on television, I'm scared by the public's lack of taste. CSI, is without a doubt, one of the cheeziest shows I've ever seen. It makes MacGyver look like a compelling drama. If the ridiculousness of the storyines don't zap all energy from your body, the over-dramatic special effects will.

I knew a few people from the Fairfax County (Virginia) Urban Search & Rescue team that was deployed to assist this effort, but none of them could provide the kind of detailed account presented here. In many ways the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building was a dress rehearsal for the even more devastating attacks that would occur less than seven years later.The strength of the American people is our ability to set aside our differences and band together in times of grief and danger. For all our diagreements, we genuinely care for each other and will go to amazing lengths to help complete strangers. This trait is noted again and again in this book, which serves more as a reminder of the depth of compassion in this country than of the evil of the attack itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plagarism","review":"The author of this book has \\"Karen\\" give the SAME EXACT PHILOSOPHY that you would find in \\"Our Unseen Guest\\", written over 50 years before this book was published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This book was a big dissapointment. If you are a Christian do not read this book , it is blasphemy! The mother contacts a psychic to talk to her dead daughter ( The Bible forbids this). Spirits can & do disguise themselves as our loved ones (evil spirits) to send many messages that are lies. They ofcourse know alot about the deceased person ( it's their job to know us well & find our weaknesses).

Like many people, especially girls it seems, I had not read comics as a child. I thought they were all cheesy, concerned with flashy pictures and action, not indepth stories.Then a friend introduced me to Brian Michael Bendis.Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl? is in the super hero genre...but not. It starts of the series with a bang, and what's most interesting about the use of super hero storylines is that it explores the strange side stories you would never hear about in an issue of Superman or Daredevil. Super heroes in the news, as regular people, their home lives, what they are before and after powers, and how what they can do would effect the \\"real world\\" around them.This is truely a unique series and the writing of Bendis in any comic shows what the medium can really do. This was my introduction to comics and it ensured I would continue to come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbingly Boring","review":"I guess Bendis is under the impressing that crime drama should have dull and redundant dialogue. Not only is the dialogue boring but the artwork is so simplistic that you are left with nothing else to look at as each character repeats themself over and over and over. It is like watching one of those police chases on T.V. where the reporter need to keep talking but don't have anything new to say so just keeps saying the same thing a dozen different ways. The entire story could have been told in 2 issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a comic for children","review":"A great piece of crime fiction that just happens to be a comic book. In this book one of a city's most beloved superheroes is murdered and it is up to two detectives to solve the crime. The characters' dialoge is very true to life and the story very believable. If you like super-detailed art, this comic isn't for you, but Oemings' style is the perfect fit for this dark, realistic book. A fantastic read with an ending you don't see coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!!!","review":"Great leather case! Phone fit perfectly.

My daughter was 9 months old when I got it and sat next to it, hitting the baseball with her hand and ignoring the bat for about 5 minutes then moved on. When she was 11 months old and could walk she was already way too big for it and just ran around the house hitting things with the bat. The \\"adjustable height\\" only adds about two inches. Even if she was tiny enough to use this, I doubt hitting a ball in a circle with some annoying repetitive phrases would interest her very long.Save your money for the Little Tikes Little Champs Sports Center or Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Baseball. I don't own those but they look much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short...","review":"This was a gift to our son at 13 months old.

He has to kneel down or sit if he wants to play with it.The voice on our unit is kind of muffled and hard to understand. That aside, it's annoying to us that it only says 3 or 4 things over and over again.This toy is a dud for us. Even when we try to play with it to catch his attention, he is not interested. On the rare occasion that he does play with it, he hits the ball with the bat or his hand and the unit wobbles or tips over.I do think this toy might be good for a baby that has just mastered the ability to sit on their own.

Also, it is either on or off, and the heat level cannot be controlled, so there was no way to lower the heat and still keep it on.

I was concerned about it only staying warm for an hour - most parties last longer than that. I was pleased to read in the directions that this can be safely used plugged in over an extended period of time. The unit cycles itself on and off to maintain the proper temperature. It also can safely be used with a proper extension cord. Three 11X7 glass dishes fit on it with room to spare. Two llx7 and one 9x13 fits, but more snugly. The unit itself is very heavy. I have model TWT-40 and the cord does come off. Hope this info helps!

Alternating elegant acoustic-based lyricism with fist-pumping rock-operatic melodrama, the album wears its pants tight and its heart on its sleeve.

Originally released in 1989, it collected 10 songs from Icehouse's hefty catalog and added one new cut (\\"Touch The Fire\\"). It's interesting to hear how the band went from being a rather basic 80's synthpop band (\\"We Can Get Together\\") to Iva Davies' solo collective ala Roxy Music or Steely Dan (\\"Hey Little Girl\\"). Davies' greeting card to his home continent, \\"Great Southern Land,\\" is also much more interesting than the corny \\"Down Under.\\"The import version of \\"Great Southern Land\\" sports more cuts than the out of print US CD, and also replaces the overdrawn remix of \\"No Promises\\" with the album version, to the song's benefit. Fans of 80's music like Roxy, Fixx and Ultravoxx would do well to seek this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icehouse Great Southern Land","review":"I never get tired of this album, even though we first bought it 20yrs ago and I wasn't a big Icehouse fan.

The characters are well rounded and just literally come to life. It is also a wonderful, touching love story with a happy ending. What a great book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"This book is absolutely charming... It made me laugh outright at times.

I was so disgusted with her whining, childish heroine that I swore I would not pick up another one of her books and couldn't understand what was seen in her writing. But because of the many raves about her Charming the Prince, I picked it up at the library to read it (at no risk or cost). I only have a few chapters left to read, but I wanted to say that this book was very enjoyable. I found throughout most of the book I was reading with a smile on my face. Her hero was what every woman dreams about and her heroine was smart, spunky and non-whining (a treat!). If you pass on any of her books, don't pass on this one.

I am even less of a fan now. This was one of the most ridiculous stories I've ever read. The premise was interesting and could have been great but the \\"warfare\\" between the father and the multitude of children was just TOO ridiculous.

He ignores her and sets his children out to terrorize her. He is surprised when she joins forces with the children to make HIS life miserable. Eventually the two find a truce and find that true love always wins.This was my first book by Teresa Mediros, and I found it to be very charming and sometimes extremely funny! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"I enjoyed this book because although it stayed within the confines of the romance genre, it still managed to be very orignal. A happy ending was a sure bet, but watching them get there was a real treat.Instead of tucking children away out of sight, the author brings the kids actively into the plot. They manage to be interesting without being too cute, too.A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightful and hilarious","review":"seeing a large warrior being brought to his knees by meddling children is always a good way to start off a book in my opinion. this book was fabulous and had me laughing to the point of tears most of the time. the romance is very well played out and flows easily throughout this novel. this is my very first book from Mrs Medeiros but it certainly will not be the last. Well done Teresa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book I've EVER read twice!!","review":"This book is the only one out 300 that I have ever read twice.

That's really unfortunate because the movie is actually quite good.The DVD boots to a low quality static menu listing the contents of the disc. I'm guessing most folks that aren't too tech savvy will be stumped at this point. It's not clear which entry is the movie at first. The movie is actually the last entry.The video quality is almost unwatchable.

Unfortunately, I have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which I specifically want my students not to make. This has been frustrating for my students, as well as myself. However, I am confident that when this problem is cleaned up, the book will be among the best Applied Corporate Finance text in the market. I strongly recommend a new, corrected edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too elementary for any real users except new students","review":"The book covers a number of concepts in a broad swath; while the new finance student will get a decent overview with some applications, seasoned users will get the standard fare dished out in elementary finance texts.

You attach both,one on top of the other, and insert the cable through them. I know IT wont fail, it might tear the bolt out, or blow out the piece of wood on the dresser, but the metal parts wont fail... which is all you can ask... as for ease of installation...once you look at how it works, it is mindless to see the best way to put it in your specific furniture... also you can easily undo it to remove, or clean behind the item.. which most others wont do...

This happened about four times, then it all together stopped working. If I needed this to survive, I would be dead. Not to mention, in that time, about 45% of the butain was spent. In my opinion, I am lucky it did not blow up in my hand; seriously, this lighter is dangerous. Aweful price, quality, and advertising.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fuel, too little flame","review":"This thing chugs fuel. I cannot understand why because it only generates the smallest of flames. It may not blow out and it may be rugged, but as a camper, I want a lighter that's going to carry a couple weeks of fuel and can help in wet light scenarios, not something that dies after a few uses and is difficult to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped to 2 stars after 3 weeks.","review":"I read another review in which the smoker did not find it worked well lighting his cigars, it works just fine on my Arturo Fuentes's. I'd give it 5 stars if it held more fuel.UPDATE: I just updated my review and dropped it from 4 stars to 2. This thing is very hard to adjust to get a flame. Most of the time it doesn't have a flame at all, it just glows orange. I can hold my finger right over the glow and it barely gets warm.It seems that if it is at all cold outside this thing is useless. I was expecting much more quality for the price. Considering returning it before the 30 days expires. Or perhaps I'll just keep sending it to the manufacturer until I get one that works, maybe they'll get the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on the first click","review":"I purchased this lighter for back woods camping and to replace a less expensive \\"storm proof\\" lighter, which was perhaps storm proof but never would light. The price of this lighter was high, but when you are far from civilization, you really need a product that you can rely on, and so far this one has never failed to light on the first click. The blaze orange color is also a help if you happen to drop it a pile of leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I'll start by saying that I love Amazon. This lighter on the other hand is horrendous. Of all of my purchases from Amazon over the years, this is the only one that I truly regret. The lighter seemed nice enough for about three days and then stopped working entirely. I lit the thing less that 7 times and now it fails to light at all. Yes it is full...Worse, it also leaks when its full. Now I am left with a non-lighting \\"lighter\\" that hisses butane. This is by no means a survival lighter.

Very dis-satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work - right out of the box!","review":"Save your money, this lighter is simply NOT RELIABLE. I purchased this brand new lighter, filled it with expensive ultra-filtered butane and was able to light it exactly three times before it broke. During the third light I heard a pop, the flame went out and now it won't relight.I sent mine back for a FULL REFUND. Save your money and definitely do not rely on this lighter for camping or outdoors survival. Although the outer case may be strong, the important part is the durability of the lighters internals, such as the starter and the seals. Judging by my experience, this lighter is neither reliable or durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"In all honesty, this is the worst buy that I made from Amazon. The thing got clogged with the recommended fluid it was supposed to take. The look I would rate a 5 star, but the functionality is a zero 'cuz it doesn't work. I would never recommend this to someone who is in need of a lighter, never! A 99 bic is the most reliable lighter that I've ever used. Within 3 days of arival, I threw it in the garbage.

We filled it with the recommended fuel, and it lit right up. After that, it would not give a flame.

I had 2. I have a barely working black one and had to return the green colored one since it never ever had a flame come out of it. A lighter at this price level should last for years. But not to even work at all is criminal. Windmill sucks just like the Brunton Stormproof lighters do as well. Although I would choose this over Brunton. Why can't companies keep abreast of their products and use them from time to time. Don't waste your time. Who needs the hassle of return shipping. Stay away or you'll be asking for disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward design and poor durability","review":"This lighter worked perfectly when it first arrived but started to break down quickly. After a month the plastic cap separated from the frame. A week later it stopped sparking. This was disappointing given that the lighter was never dropped or mistreated.I also found its design small and cumbersome for single handed operation, especially for those of us with large hands. Complicating matters is a latch across the top that must be released manually before you can trigger the cap and expose the ignition switch. Basically, three actions to get the flame going.I'm still looking for the perfect windproof torch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's lowest quality there is, don't be fooled","review":"I'm sure some of these do work and work well. Parts of the lighter are well built, but some critical parts aren't. Then again, that's the problem really, that only some of them may work well. Overall I rate this a one star because the product's features don't fit together well, nor do they match the claims. Parts of the lighter are well made and parts are the cheapest construction possible. Obsolesence is built into this product is my guess, and that causes premature failures.Anyway, I got one of the non-functioning units and took some time to discover just what the problem was. What I came across was low quality construction leading to multiple malfunctions (element and delivery mechanisms). It did work, but just a little. I used 5 times filtered butane (no cheap stuff). After a couple uses it just died a slow death.This lighter looks to be mostly a gimmic, not a daily-use or robustly useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work When It Counted","review":"Bought this lighter new for backcountry backpacking emergencies. I tested it at lower altitudes before my backpacking trip and it worked fine. Last weekend far back in the mountains at 11,500' this new lighter did not work when I needed it -- the piezo element was either defective or broken. Fortunately, I had backup storm matches. Otherwise I would have been completely out of luck. This piece of kit will never find its way into my backpack again. It is unreliable, and expensive to boot. I would have been better off with a Zippo lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better with age.","review":"Back in the wonderful days of vinyl I picked up a copy of this album. Because of the exquisite musicianship of Bruce's previous albums, I was anxious to hear how the music translated live. (At this point I had not had the opportunity to see him live.) Lets put it this way. I've worn out nearly three copies so far. This is without a doubt my favorite live album ever. When I heard that it had finally been released on cd, I had to have it!! (It's tough to wear out those suckers, thank God.) By the way, make sure that you get the copy with Bruce's comments. His very insightful and often hilarious commentary has always been a wonderful part of any live show that I have seen of his. On a parting note, I've purchased several live albums over the years. Most have a tendency to \\"date\\" themselves after a few years.

Though Behold the King draws historical and grammatical hermeneutic directly from the Greek text, fluency in Greek is not required for students and theologians to understand Toussaint's comments, ponderings, and interpretations.

They do a great version of Randy Newman's \\"Have You Seen My Baby\\", and originals \\"Tula\\", \\"Houston\\", and \\"I Don't Want The Night To End\\" are also impressive. But, as much as I love this music, I must advise that there is a better way to get it. In 2001 a collection called \\"Not Just A Rumour, More A Way Of Life\\" was released that has almost every song on this album (only \\"Name And Number\\" was left off), AND almost all of the Rumour's second album, \\"Frogs Sprouts Clogs and Krauts\\" as well.

Kind of. Whatever they sound like, it is awesome. They definitely have a punky edge to them, but there is something more to them. I don't know what it is, but it makes them good. They are a little different than most of the other grunge bands out there. It could be that they are a little more melodic. I like how \\"Boot Straps\\" begins slow and then all of sudden becomes a punk song. The end of \\"Liver vs. Heart\\" is pretty cool.

I needed a pair of inexpensive goggles that would fit comfortably over my MX helmet and protect my eyes from dust and debris. WOW - these goggles are perfect. I purchased two pairs of cheap goggles off ebay for my kids. They always fog up and are not very good. I even purchased some anti-fog spray from Amazon to spray on and they still fogged up.To my surprise, these Raider MX goggles did not fog up one time during a 4 hour ride. No spit, No anti-fog spray, no constant wiping. Just wear and go. Wow. So I gave these to my son and now I need another pair for myself.Longevity will be the issue with these goggles. The lenses will probably scratch easily. But the price is right and I'm very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of goggles","review":"I bought this for my son to protect his eyes while riding his go kart.

There is an understanding that humans can easily kill each other,however they rarely have to.

I work up a sweat every time (and am noticing improvement), and I enjoy the combinations and the fluidity of the routine. Violet Zaki is an excellent instructor and I intend to find another one by her, hopefully just as good. She works you with kickboxing, squats with optional weights (I tend to use 5lb weights), the dance for toning your hips and butt, and then finishes off with yoga. Personally, the yoga bores me, so I stop it there and go straight to the mini ab workout. As she says in the video, if you do the ab workout 2-3 times in a row, you'll get the most out of it. In a nutshell, I have a lot of fun waking up and working out to this DVD, especially because I think it's difficult to find any good ones.

I agree that the above are nothing more than news articles (edititorials really), which were yellow journalism at the time and are very little more now. This book is of very little use to any serious student of Iroquois culture, as the author would mold our history and culture to fit contemporary political views and agendas. The term \\"thnic Iroquois\\" is especially ignorant considering the source, but I digress. The book provides an elementary understanding of true traditional culture and does not provide a compare/contrast of the handsome lake religion to the great law. I would recommend the book but I believe it would be a disservice to any serious student of Iroquios culture. Try Parkman, Morgan, John C.

The plot devices are unimaginable, the dialog is choppy, and often times the author forgets to inform the reader of crucial details.After all, a murder novel isnt a mystery if the author has not posed the \\"whodunnit\\" question with any talent; it's merely an obfuscated tale of events.Skip this book, or pick it up second-hand and read it on a long plane flight.

From the moment I pressed play and John Fiore's \\"comare\\" Marie emerged from the limo, I wanted to throw my remote at the TV...ANYTHING to make her STOP TALKING! The reason I gave any stars at all was because they did cover basically all the sets from The Sopranos and gave some backround information. They also had some interviews from cast and crew members.

It is mostly just looking at locations, like Pizzaland, or the Sopranos home in North Caldwell, or Satriale's pork store. It's like taking one of those boring tours of stars homes. I've never done that and never will.What's worse, there's a lot of what passes for comedy but is really unfunny. Someone plays the dizzy ditz, and she isn't the least bit funny or entertaining.

If you are already practicing covered call writing as I have been for several years you are probably aware of the importance of timing when to sell your covered calls. By selling calls at the wrong time you could end up losing your stock and giving up further stock profits which are usually much higher than the covered call premiums you obtained. Unfortunately this book does not go into strategies for timing your sale so as to enhance your premium value but avoid the stock being called. I would recommend that this book be supplemented by other books that go into more detailes on timing option sales or purchases. I have been able to at least double my returns by using good timing strategies in addition to ideas in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M READY TO GO!","review":"I am a relative novice at investing.

Considerable space of the 125 page book is spent on breeding, genetics, and the care of the whelping female. I would think this of zero interest to a beginning Rottweiler owner. On the other hand, there is little attention spend on training.Far better is Urs Ochsenbein's book \\"Rottweilers\\". It's about the same physical size, although longer at around 150 pages. Ochsenbein details everything from puppy selection and health care to training.

The build quality and overall look of the item is fantastic. It really served to kind of bring home the character of the room, giving it somewhat of an oriental look. As some other reviews have stated, I wish the power button was located on the base somehow instead of the cord... That however is a minor complaint, and overall the lamp looks fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankenlamp","review":"I would have given 4 stars if the first one had not been missing a shade. I would have given 3 stars if the second one had not shown scratching around the base. I ordered the first one to arrive just before I needed it, so used Prime Free Two Day Shipping. When I found it was defective, time was short and I added another $3.99 to get the second quicker. After combining the usable parts, I have a working lamp but still have to repack the other and take it to the post office. I guess it comes down to, are you feeling lucky? After saying all that, it is a very attractive and functional reading light for two, placed on a table between the sofa and chair. I used two 27 Watt (actual, not equivalent) CFL, and my wife thinks it's almost too bright.

After perusing the first of many books and workbooks, I discovered that learning Hebrew should start at the ripe ole age of 3 or 4 ... not for one in their early 60's!!! For thosewho are accustomed to learning languages it may be just a snap, but not for me!The books & charts are wonderful, provided you can make heads or tails of it !!!!Well, at least I know!

The music sounds like a dead ringer for Aerosmith's \\"Love in the Elevator\\" period. The problem here is, Heep was and is basically a 70's band. Wasting their talent on this sort of early 90's hair metal was not a good move. Heep was at their best when they did what they did best - 70's hard rock, heavy on the organ and bass, with mystical themes in the lyrics. The music here is not bad, for the genre - it's just not what we have come to expect from Uriah Heep over the years. You'll like this one only if you think Aerosmith (and Poison, and Warrant, et al) are the pinnacle of rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"First track that's all","review":"When I came into a store last week, the song playin was just great so I asked \\"who's that?\\".The answer was Uriah heep, the song Blood on stone.I was very surprised cause I'm a Heep fan up till High and Mighty (plus conquest and Abominog).I was so glad to hear such a great song from a newer heep, i bought the cd.Well that's about it...one real good track and 11 or 12 fillers.Not bad, I mean those guys know how to make music but really uninspired.The one good thing I discovered was the singer's voice...that guy sounds good, I might try some new Live stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heep's weakest?","review":"I hate to criticise Uriah Heep. For one thing, they're always being piled on; for another thing, they're one of my Top 10 favorite bands. But after just listening to \\"Different World\\" for the umpteenth time in a vain effort to find whatever great it was that I'd missed, what can any objective reviewer say? This is a weak album. There are some decently written songs sprinkled throughout the disc, and some typically strong musical performances as well. But the production, the mix, and the general style are not suitable for Heep. I wouldn't have guessed this was a Uriah Heep record if I didn't already know it. It's not a terrible record, but it's not very good, and certainly the weakest release of Uriah Heep's long and satisfying career. Whatever you do, buy this disc last."},{"rating":"1","title":"This record stinks -- don't buy it!","review":"This is probably the worst record that Uriah Heep ever recorded. If you are not a collector I warn you from buying it. If I could I would give it less than one star. I don't even understand how it succeeded to be recorded at all. Why didn't they discard the songs and start all over again?Buy Demons and Wizards, Salisbury, Look at yourself, Sweet Freedom or The Magicians Birthday instead.

I also expected help with first sings of aging (I am in my late 20's). I've been using it daily for a month and a half and I do not notice any difference in my skin, I have not gotten acne but my face is as oily as before and new whiteheads have appeared.

If you're used to Seduction Cinema product's, you may be disappointed, as the concept and production here are pretty pedestrian; a cheesy tv set and not the usual vain attempts at storytelling you get from them. A couple of the girls are hot (especially Julian), the girl/girl stuff occasionally rises above Skin-a-max level (not enough pink, unfortunately), and I find Julian Wells to be one of their best attresses. She is not a silicone sex bomb, but she's attractive, blonde, seems bright and is game in attempting to pull off their lame attempts at comedy.

Hardly.","review":"This wreaks of \\"student film\\". It tries too hard to be cute and quirky. Other reviewers compared it to \\"Eraserhead\\" and I have NO idea why. Eraserhead certainly didn't try to be cute. This film is also compared to \\"The Twilight Zone\\" series. Again, a body of work that one would hardly be described as being cute.Everything in this film screams - AMATEUR - and it makes me wonder if the other reviewers aren't somehow connected to this project. The acting is horrible. There are way too many shots done at weird angles, as if trying to be SO avant garde. Not. This is a joke, and a poor one at that. Avoid it. Especially if you are a fan of David Lynch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long out-of-print live recording fills much-needed gap.","review":"This CD, which was once deleted at Thompson's request, is now back with additional tracks. A mix of three club dates in New York in 1982, Thompson is heard rebuilding his live act after the split with Linda. On some tracks he's simply stunning (as in \\"Genesis Hall\\"), offering new insights into songs usually associated with Linda or Fairport. Other times he's quite ragged--missing notes, clearing his throat, and so on. Although it is generally fine listening, and essential for fans, this record would have been even better with more of Thompson's clever stage patter thrown in. As a bonus, though, this CD offers a chance to hear several songs never recorded in the studio, from the hilarious \\"Woman or a Man?\\" to the bouncy \\"How Many Times?\\" to the gut-wrenching title track. Not the place to start your Thompson collection, but very enjoyable for anyone even slightly familiar with his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHEER TORTURE","review":"RT has more chops than the Omaha Steaks web site as is clearly evident on this release. Still, I cannot overlook the coughing, wheezing and sour vocal notes that permeate this album. This is a very poor performance that should have never seen the light of day. I think he ought to join the Bee Gees and take poor old Maurice's place in the band. He wouldn't have to sing that much and besides they even look a good bit alike. Maybe no one would know the difference.Small Town Romance should be re-relased under the title I've Suffered For My Art, Now It's Your Turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary album; a must-have","review":"I started my RT collection a few years back like the above reviewer (with a few extra bucks in my pocket, I bought \\"Rumor and Sigh\\"). After the first listen, he had me hooked. After that, I picked up you? me? us?, and followed up with \\"Small Town Romance,\\" which is easily one of the most incredible albums I've ever heard, folk singer or otherwise. I was fortunate enough to see RT recently in concert, and realized how funny the man is--there are a few spots on this album where he cracks the audience up, but it doesn't reflect just how witty he is. If you're a folk fan of any degree, BUY THIS ALBUM. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate Early Performance!","review":"I just bought this CD to add to my RT collection and it is amazing! The sound quality is fine. Remember, he is playing at a club! The sound is as crisp, clear and full as you could get at the time. I loved the bare bones passionate vocals and guitar work that is reminiscent of John Renbourn (and incredible compliment). All the tracks are strong as would be if the artist is Richard Thompson; I don't think he could play or write anything uninspired. My favorite tracks are: Genesis Hall, The Great Valerio and For The Shame Of Doing Wrong. But all are absolutely first rate! The high energy guitar work on the instrumental \\"Roll Over Vaughn Williams\\" alone is worth the price of the CD. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage, part II","review":"Based on the Amazon preview, I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on this album. Geez, it sounded like a bunch of 16 year old hacks destroying any classic Zep song they could find. I didn't hear anything new or challenging in the songs. Just a challenge to get through the mangled noise. This goes the same for the first album in this series. Why they felt the need to make a second album like this is beyond me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted","review":"An L.A. cop and a murder victim's father struggle with their realization that all women are prostitutes in this washed-out DVD of a middling 70s thriller. Burt's amusing flippancy in most scenes undercuts what elsewhere tries to be a morally murky drama, and long romantic scenes dull the thriller pace. The picture's blatant misogyny doesn't help matters.Most of the scenes are set bound so except for Burt's sweet ride we don't get much period flavor. The whole thing plays like a very foul-mouthed T.V. episode and the vulgarities are so plentiful and tin-eared that even by today's standards they may shock.Amid some rank overacting, Eddie Albert as the affable but venal villain clearly steals the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Message, Poor Movie","review":"I like these types of movies, and saw the DVD on sale for $9, so I gave it a look. With Burt Reynolds and Catherine Deneuve being movie legends I figured what did I have to lose. Unfortunately, the movie really misses the mark and is not very good, except for the message. Slow and predictable, it reminds me of a bad Frank Sinatra's movie.Robert Aldrich, who did a masterful job on \\"The Longest Yard - 1974\\" was the director, and he and Burt were the film's producer. The film really needed a good producer and it might have been better. However, it was great to see Deneuve in a U.S. film and the DVD quality is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching this movie reminds one of how bad an actor Burt really is/was","review":"Would you believe there was time I thought Burt Reynolds was a good actor (Sharkey's Machine)? But even in \\"Deliverance\\" I didn't think he was that great. I just keep seeing him as \\"The Bandit\\" driving around, making an a** of himself, while being chased by Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). I also realize how bad an actress Catherine Deneuve was when I watched this flick. Beautiful and gorgeous, but terrible acting.Burt kinda' plays his old Dan August part in this movie. The interaction between Reynolds and Deneuve borders on hilarious; when they're trying to be serious. Seriously.It must have been that period of time when acting was different. Even Paul Winfield comes across like he's doing a reading at an audition. His scene with \\"The Albino\\" is terrible (i.e. stereotypically laughable).Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan contribute to this slow, laborious undertaking in establishing the plot. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real con job","review":"Slow, murky and joyless, Hustle has little to recommend it.Burt Reynolds and Paul Winfield are dull as dishwater (dirty dishwater just about sums this movie up) and the plot - about a dead stripper and her war Veteran father - is about as exciting as watching paint dry. The whole thing could have been wrapped up in a (very) average episode of CSI.Catherine Deneuve is cute as Reynolds' hooker girlfriend, and I had fun pretending to myself that Ernest Borgnine's police chief was the same character as the one he played in The Poseidon Adventure. Yes, Hustle was that boring: I had to make stuff up for myself.There's lots of gratuitous female nudity too, so add sleazy to the film's credentials. But most of all, it's just a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Upfield masterpiece","review":"Gleeful anticipation describes the approach of Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte to an interesting case, and it also describes how any reader familiar with Arthur Upfield's Bony series begins one of those novels. Winds of Evil is the fifth novel of the series. Bony arrives at the outback NSW town of Carie to investigate the strangling murders of an aboriginal girl and a white man, as well as the attempted strangling of a white woman. Under the guise of a farm labourer, Bony discovers that all the events occurred during fierce sandstorms. After himself having a narrow escape from the hands of the strangler, he eventually refines his suspects to eleven men. With an interesting cast of characters, Upfield's usual eloquent descriptions of the surrounds, plenty of twists and turns, and the odd red herring, Winds of Evil is another Upfield masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer was better than the entire movie","review":"After watching the trailor, I was expecting a great mystery, but was very disappointed.In fact I nodded out a couple of times"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I started watching this film based on the synopsis which described it as a \\"tense thriller\\". There was nothing tense or thrilling about it. I shut it off halfway through. It slowly meanders along with an Inspector who refuses to turn a murder suspect and his accomplish in to the authorities. For what reason? His own curiosity about them and their crime? If I had stuck around, I would have found out. Fortunately, I had much better things to do than waste another hour on this sad excuse for an exciting crime story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"This book is painfully simple covering only common sense issues.

She is a great cook; everything she's made from other books has been delicious. While this book has beautiful images and very reasonable portions, for some reason everything we've made from it was a disappointment. Cookies had an off taste, frosting was drippy, etc. Last night, we decided to give it one more try. My daughter tried to make cream puffs and they came out like little crepes- dough was too runny. I know that it may have been cook's error, but when I handed her \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" and she looked up the cream puff recipe there and made flawless puffs (with NO help from mom), you've got to wonder about her track record with this book.

I had never heard of Chris Peacock before. I am sure the people who live in Washington State know his name very well, for this is where he performs his magic.To talk a little bit about this cd, I would like to begin by saying Chris sure is a master of the piano. He plays in a very natural style with great command of his songs. He does not try to show off, but delivers a grand perfomance.The only dark spot I can bring to your attention, about this cd, is the song selection. I thought it could have been better. Chris plays a mixture of classical and popular songs. I feel like this was probably a mistake to mix the two venues.I will plan to buy more of Chris' cds in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses TOO Much","review":"I got this hoping it would help with the puzzles.

I like SYNT, but despise The Locust and #12 Looks Like You.This cd is borderline boring. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the vocals, or the electro-grind parts. The sticker on the front of the cd compares them to Despised Icon and The Red Chord...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!!!? Those two bands are far superior to this band.

What a joke.Not to exagerate but this has to be the most misleading dvd I've ever bought in my life ( shamelessly I own about 130 DvD's of just about everything ).Don't waste your money unless you're really into incubus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the wrong DVD","review":"Although a lot of people said it is good, this DVD may not attract other people. What I am looking for is a beautiful song. But the title and the cover of this DVD is much more beautiful than the concert. I think I bought the wrong DVD.I couldn't conclude the music is not good. It is just not my style. It may be amazing for many Incubus fans.To me, I just feel the DVD is very noisy. When you place the order, please check on the web about the Incubus and make sure you understand you are going to buy.Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MorningView Sessions DVD","review":"What better way to promote your new album than to release a DVD of your band performing the songs. The MorningView Sessions DVD is Incubus at their best. Eventhough the concert is relatively short (12 songs), incubus does an incredible job performing songs off of MorningView, as well as the favorites off of Make Yourself, and SCIENCE. If you like the acoustic guitar, then you will enjoy the two song acoustic set performed in the middle of the show(Mexico, followed by Drive). However, if you are into the fast paced, alternative style, The MorningView Sessions does not disappoint.In my opinion, the two best songs on the DVD are Circles,an energetic, fast paced song, which is performed to perfection. The next best song performed was Glass, which is a more hardcore alternative song off of SCIENCE. However, don't take my word for it. Everybody likes something different. That is why this DVD performance is perfect for any Incubus fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning !","review":"Incubus is a great live band. and this is the DVD to prove it if you like the live performance on \\"When Incubus Attacks Vol.2\\"then you'll love this. Why because this is simply the best live performance by incubus yet. Hearing the raw energy in \\"Pardon Me\\" or the beauty of a acoustic \\"Drive\\" will have one wanting more.This is overall better then \\"WIA.2\\" The only downfall is theres not as much stuff. But the stuff that is on there is good enough for a incubus fan.The standout tracks on this album are \\"Pardon Me\\",\\"Stellar\\" \\"Warning\\" \\"Drive\\" & \\"Wish You were here\\" the best song is \\"Pardon Me\\". So go ahead and buy it. if you never heard incubus live then this is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Food Movie to Date","review":"What a wonderful and warm movie! Understated, passionate, and disarmingly humourous. Eden, even with English subtitles, does not slip in its pacing and movement. My teenage children and grandparents loved it. It doesn't get any more inter-generational than this. The use of \\"food\\" as the backdrop and catalyst for character and plot changes was brilliant. Indeed, no character is left untouched and unchanged by the remarkable cuisine of our protagonist (not even the dog). I know the movie \\"Big Night\\" is often touted as THE food movie. But, truth be told, Eden leaves the Big Night in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Yep, hip-hop is dead & this fool helped kill it.

I dont know if it was that I heard damn near every song already or whatever, but this album sucks. Then to put it up against Kanye's album makes no sense. I dont even like Kanye but no one can say that 50's album is better than his. If you do then you must be a die hard fan and 50 must have thrown you a t shirt from a show. Either way, I dont understand. Did 50 wanna retire?? He can with the millions he made but damn 50....I loved your music back when but seems like you were really off base with this one.

As Jay Z became exponentially lazy, 50 went from 1 ok album to bad almost instantly. This album is a tour de force in bad rapping, it's almost a Dirty South record with the monotonous beats and weak lyrics. I can't decide what is the worst but will go with Ayo Technology since the name is the most retarded thing of all time, and Justin Timberlake (who is a fag) sings on it. 50 you're rich, stop torturing me with Crap that floods the Radio and makes white kids blast it from their Jettas."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 better be worshipping his producers","review":"This album is complete crap.

I can't stand songs that have hot beats, but weak lyrics! Crap like this is turning me away from the music I love...I can't completely agree with the idea of hip hop being dead, but its definitely on its death bed right now.

'get rich...' was a solid album, but everything hes put out since then has been worthless. what separates true talent like lil wayne from watered down sesame street rappers like 50 is originality. lil wayne juggles words and keeps you guessing about what hes gonna spit next, while 50 seems to say the same rhyme on each track with a different beat in the background. its not surprising kanye killed him in record sales, since kanyes new material is actually worth listening to. this album is beyond bad. the beats are for the most part horrible. the hooks lack originality. lyrically, this is one of the worst albums of the decade. at times it sounds like he let a third grader write the songs. its disgusting that this guy can put out such a crappy album and still sell millions. wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"You....Suck!","review":"This new album \\"Curtis\\" is just garbage.

And \\"Amusement Park\\" \\"Peep Show\\" & \\"Fire\\" are HORRIBLE TRACKS. Easily in the worst songs of the year category.

It sucks compared to Get Rich Or Die Tryin, and is comperable to The Massacre, but it isn't nearly as bad as some people are saying. The good songs are \\"I Get Money\\" \\"Ayo Technology\\" \\"Come and Go\\" \\"Follow My Lead\\" \\"My Gun Go Off\\" and \\"I'll Still Kill\\". The mediocre are pretty much all the rest. Eminem and Dre are the reason this CD isn't as good as it could be. Their lack of originality and creativity is astounding. Dre's beats are lazy and Eminem continues his downward slope into tarnishing his legacy with mediocre songs and lazy flow. Overall, this CD isn't bad. Actually, I am playing it more than Kanye's, even though Kanye's is slightly better. 50 Cent's new cd ain't bad, but it could be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your self a big favor, throw this out the window.","review":"Please do your self a huge favor and buy any albums from project blowed or battle axe records more than worth your money and stop filling your head with the worst kind of garbage which this or any other commercialized rap/music has amounted to including kanye west, maintstream hits the gutter for me out my window the cds go and down into the sewer drain they flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 keeps going downhill","review":"50 cent has gone so far down since Power of the Dollar its ridiculous.

Obviously the lyrics were terrible. Please listen to his earlier music if you are a 50 fan... both Guess Who's Back and Guess Who's Back Again.. Power of the Dollar... great CD's.

Which brings me to my point why hip-hop is dead is 50 cent an emcee no hes a \\"rapper\\" just like chingy but with more money. Does 50 cent have any emcees signed to gunit? 1 group mobb deep \\"havoc, Prodigy\\" havent dropped a decent album since murda music of course.

We've heard it all before. You're a gangsta, you got shot, you're rich.

The only track I like on the album is I Get Money. There's nothing new here, and lyrically he's only getting worse. I think he's so rapped up into making commerical music that he's lost sight of the potential he had when he first burst onto the scene. I should have known better than to purchase this after all of the terrible singles he released like Amusement Park. And on top of that he has too many guest appearances, that's usually a sign of a terrible album. Do yourself a favor and save your money!!! Don't worry Curtis you're not getting any more of my money.

I agree with the majority that Get Rich or Die Trying was amazing, a classic and Massacre was a strong 2nd album. Curtis however is horrendously unoriginal. I could only jam to two songs: Ayo Technology and Peep Show (that's only because Eminem put it down). Every other song is about his teflon vest and the different ways to murder. At least in the past you could bop your head to the beat.Anyone that gave this album over 2 stars is just a groupie and doesn't know music. Unfortunately 50 is highly successful at marketing and will probably outsell Kanye which would be a grave injustice to the industry of Hip Hop.

I was disgusted by Peep Show- I deleted it and replaced it with the far superior collaboration You Don't Know from Eminem's The Re-Up on my computer. Robin Thicke was wasted on this- Follow My Lead sharing an album with Amusement Park and Peep Show was even more hypocritical than 21 Questions sharing an album with P.I.M.P.

It also seems like that gunshot to his jaw will never successfully heal, because he keeps slurring and mumbling his repetitive lyrics. The background beats are annoying as well, with their polished pop sound that appeals to the mainstream so much.Unless you like shallow, talentless, money-hungry hip-pop, stay away from Curtis at all costs, not even as a frisbee or drink coaster.

There's very little in the way of discernible talent here.Yet again, we have an exercise in lame self-indulgence and adolescent fantasy, as we're expected to spend our quality time listening to a man who thinks owning a large arsenal of weapons is some kind of credential.Hip Hop is not dead - there's some really good stuff out there, but you're going to have to look past this kind of tripe to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD","review":"Do not buy this album if you are a Rap/Hip Hop fan because your ears will literally bleed from hearing this. I thought his first album was okay but the rest sucked a**. I hope he keeps his promise about if Kanye sold more than him he would quit singing. I am tired of 50 thinking he is a good singer I would rather listen to Clay Aiken or Big Rueben. F**k the 50 fans all their doing is killing Rap/Hip Hop by supporting this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album cover says it all.......","review":"He was thinking, \\"D**n, Game ruined my career.\\" When those two broke off from each other, The Game annihilated 50 on his mixtapes. He made a lot of people open their eyes to what 50 had become......a gimmick. Don't get me wrong, \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is a certified classic. But like Game says, \\"50 got rich and stopped tryin\\" and it really shows on this album. I'm glad I heard it before even thinking about buying it, otherwise this review would've been a lot uglier. It goes to show.....when you build your career on beefing with people (50 vs Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, etc), sooner or later somebody is gonna take you out. Funny, 50 has become the exact sort of artist that he used to make fun of Ja Rule being (singing on hooks, wannabe love songs, pop hits, etc). I guess what goes around comes around......"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst pop rappers ever.","review":"But the song with Mary; All Of Me, that sample, well, it's hot. REAL hot.He has to use other people's beats (I Get Money) to get rich and talking mindlessly (Tracks 2-4,Tracks 6-10, Tracks 12-14 and 16-17). I find that so damn pathetic!Follow My Lead is a crappy song. Very crappy. 50 Cent writes his music (or at least some of it) and that's good. But he doesn't really talk about much other than being rich, and awesome, going to parties and being better than others. And hot women. Yay! We haven't heard that before!!Amusement Park is fun though. Nice beat. Someone laced it, and it's wonderful. Probably the best song here. But Fire is wack, and Nicole is even wacker. The only song that she did worth noting is Come to Me. And that was DIDDY'S song. LOL @ her.Kanye obviously won with the album sales, so why doesn't his tired a$$ retire?????!Download Amusement Park and All Of Me and let's call it a day!1.5 stars for an occasional hot beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nursery Rhymes is this is what 50 has become?","review":"The only rapper to do nursery rhymes and do it well is Nelly.I enjoyed 50's first cd and ran to buy the second when it debuted,I should have slowed my roll.Wanksta had a catchy beat and that was about it.So,I listened to a friend's \\"Curtis\\" the third cd and when did 5o need the likes of Justin Timberlake and Timbaland to duet on his cd's???Mary J Blige????Yeah and he had the nerve to twist lips about JaRule on J.Lo's single...how absurd!You have got to be kidding me...this cd has nice beats but rapping about money on almost every other song gets little tiring and boring.This CD is nothing but a big fat YAWN..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Not Enough Dr. Dre input!","review":"It seems like 50 is slowly drifting away from Dr. Dre's beats and input. This album suffers from that. Unlike Eminem, 50 Cent can't be successful without solid, focused production that only Dr. Dre can provide. The only super solid songs on this album are the ones that Dre produced. Purchas with caution if you're a Dre fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nothing new: Fiddy is still a killer, still wants to shoot you, but now he brings in all his famous friends and the CD still sucks.

But I made it through the entire album on first listen - which is a rarity these days, as most new albums have only two or three good tracks, and the rest filler.If you are new to gospel, her messages are poignant without being pushy. They allow you to interpret them in your own way and in your own good time.Every time I hear this album I am moved in a different way.

The small town of Galen is being terrorized by a serial rapist/murderer that is leaving a very bloody trail in it's wake. A doctor, policeman and a mysterious reporter try to unravel the mystery before the assailant strikes again. The movie is based on a gruesome, but well written novel of the same name. While the movie's low budget shows, it does feature decent cinematography, acting and a creepy score.Oh yeah, there's a very weird dynamic between the doctor and his daughter, that adds to the squirm inducing plot of the movie. Weird.If you like early horror, slasher and supernatural movies, give Incubus a try. It's handled sort of like a murder mystery at first, before the story starts to really unfold. Again it's about a rapist/murdering demon, so prepare for some disturbing shenanigans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Editing Terrible","review":"The mistakes are so distracting.

I often rent the film with the cheesiest cover in the video store just for laughs, but this was beyond awful. I could have made a better movie with a few friends and a camcorder.Rent this so you can say you saw the worst movie ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythm is Important","review":"I purchased this book on the recommendation of another author (in her review of her book she said her writing was influenced by the author). \\"Oh, Play that Thing\\" takes place in the 20's and through the dust bowl disaster, The main character is a savvy Irish immigrant who has landed at Ellis Island to start a new life in NYC.The author's way of writing is like a stream of thoughts and words. Reading the first few pages, I wasn't sure I liked the book, but as I got into the head and life of the Irish man, I got into the rhythm of his thoughts and the way the writing in the book worked so well.I found the story fascinating and the beat of time and his life very hypnotizing. How Roddy Doyle, the author, manages to insert a famous celebrity into the mix and engage you in the story is entirely successful, and I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good follow-up to the first book in the series","review":"One of the reasons that I read series is because I hope that the author will keep the same voice from book to book. In this, 'The Last Roundup' series let me down. Only once during the first one hundred pages, did I sense the same voice: when Henry Smart is interviewed by the immigration agent upon his arrival to America. Actually, the writing style in this book reminded me of another book about the jazz subculture in the 1930s, Half-Blood Blues, which I also abandoned. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing sequel","review":"Very confusing and unbeleivable sequel to the wonderful A Star Called Henry. I enjoyed the section when Henry was with Louis Armstrong, but the rest of the book did not live up to the quality of A Star Called Henry, and it was often hard to follow what was actually going on. I frequently had to back up a few pages because I thought that I had missed something. I made myself finish the book but honestly, I did not enjoy reading it and I was glad to be finished. I hope that the next book is more focused and that Doyle goes back to the style of prose that made me such a fan of Henry in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Play That Thing","review":"Was very impressed with this Author's first book, \\"A star called Henry\\", which contained historical value and a good plot. This book was rubbish in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roddy Doyle misses the mark","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I have read almost all of Roddy Doyle's books and lovedthem. This book is so disjointed and confusing that I could not follow the story line. The characters were undefined and random so you never really connect with any of them. I stopped reading toward the middle of the book. Ifigured that I gave it enough of a chance. I would not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kipling has an ear for dialogue.","review":"If you've ever been around a group of men who are engaged in an activity; they have a certain way of talking to each other. When they tease each other with mighty insults then you know that they really like each other. Kipling draws a male character better than anyone I've read. Even, sad to say, more so than my favorite, Jane Austen.When this group of men are talking; they sound just like men would today; with the exception of the horrible colloquial English, that an earlier reviewer referred to, and nowadays people do not refer to their religion as if they really believed it like the story characters did. I do think that if Kipling were to portray modern working men that you would hear an accurate reflection of modern conversation.Just a fantastic story. Highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age","review":"To grow up reading Kipling is to grow up with a special relationship with the world. In Kipling's world a person should be useful and to be useful you must learn to do useful things. You must also know right from wrong and you need someone competent to show you that difference. A spoiled boy is given the directions to manhood by a hardbitten sea capatain and his son and crew after falling overboard from a luxury steamer off the Grand Banks of New England. One of my favorite Kipling stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is better","review":"I had recently rented the movie version of Captains Courageous, and it occurred to me I had never read the original book, and would like more of the background and details of the characters shown in the film. Don't bother. The movie is much better for modern audiences. I found the first part of the movie followed the book fairly closely, but the last half deviated significantly and was much more interesting. Many of the attitudes and prejudices of the late 19th century figure prominently in the book, and trying to read Kipling's attempt at writing in various accents was difficult and confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The subject is profound and delineated very clearly. Whether you agree with the author or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocked and not pleased","review":"Was very unhappy with game. Since Truth Be Told was so wonderful, I assumed this game would be also. WRONG!Would have sent it back but it wasn't worth the effort.Was the first thing I ever ordered from Amazon that I was unhappy with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing... barely","review":"This is a poorly written book that seems to miss the fact that it is aimed at beginners. As mentioned in other reviews, the author attempts to add humor to his writing. That can be a good thing when done correctly, but is frustrating in the wrong context. Near the beginning of the book, his advice for the reader having trouble with the project is something like \\"wave a dead chicken over it\\". Could be funny, unless you're desperately trying to figure out what went wrong. There are many typos in the book (though I don't think I've ever read a programming book that didn't have at least one). The use of poor quality black-and-white photos also doesn't help, especially if the color of a wire is important.I think most readers will learn something from this book, but it is still a poor investment and not the best choice for those trying to learn microcontroller programming. Save your money and shop around."},{"rating":"2","title":"This an excellent introduction to C and the AVR","review":"I think the first two reviewers are being a bit harsh. I have worked through the book and found that there were some annoying typos, but what book doesn't have them? The main thing I like is that the author has a funny and relaxed way of explaining things. Also this is a very cheap way to learn. The Butterfly is only $19.99 and the compiler is free. I was able to get some interesting programs running very quickly and I think I've got a good start on C programming. I might have given the book a 4, since there are some typos, but I've decided to give it a 5 to help balance the bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was very excited about this book after reading the first sample chapter. However, the rest of the book seems that it was rushed to press. The text contains many errors, important concepts are inadequately explained if at all, and many of the pages are simply code listings found on the CD. If I had not asked for the book as a gift, I would return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise, mixed results","review":"I purchased this book and \\"Embedded C Programming and the Atmel AVR \\" by Barnett, since feedback went both ways. I must say this book appears rushed, has some crucial errors (especially for first timers), typos, poor layout in places, and a weak index. However, it does tie into the WinAVR compiler, and for those that need help there, the book is useful. All examples use the ATMEGA 169, as expected. Barnett's examples mostly use the 90S8515 (some ATMEGA 163), with the CodeVisionAVR compiler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tutorial and project book!","review":"I got started in C and AVR with this book. I found other texts harder to understand. But Joe broke it down and made it easy to learn and I was very grateful for having this book. The projects were fun and useful and I ended up immediately using code and ideas from the book to create more advanced projects with the Butterfly (Turns counters, resonant frequency tuners, etc). You should be able to get up to speed and writing your own advanced functions after following this book within one week. If you are already adept at C then this book will show you some fun project ideas and get you running fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIM","review":"This album magically impressed me by the clarity of the lyrics and the deep sensual drums.

McCain is out of touch. These stories are not his own, but are just a retelling of the good works of others. In his introduction he shows how out of touch he is by telling a story about how he and his family drove through a bad neighborhood in Mexico and that somehow taught him a lot about human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Virtue of Virtues","review":"\\"Character Is Destiny,\\" by Senator John McCain, reminds me somewhat of the series of books by virtue's czar, William Bennett. Bennett's forte was compiling vignettes from classical literature to illustrate various admirable character traits. McCain follows suit by highlighting character as illustrated by famous and not-so-famous individuals from ancient history and modern times.His choice of heroes and heroines is eclectic enough to please folks on the right and the left. As the subtitle suggests, the book can be a shared experienced between young and old, parents and children. It is worth the reading for its celebration of the human spirit, in particular the spirit of hope that overcomes despair, love that conquers hate, and faith that defeats doubt.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" and \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Inspiring","review":"John McCain, like Kennedy with his \\"Profiles in Courage\\" gives Americans a pantheon of heroes and heroines as inspiring examples of true faith, courage, integrity and simple dignity. The character of the people profiled speaks for itself, so I will simply say that it's a spiritual delight as well as a humbling experience to be reminded that there are still some people, even in eras of terrorism, prejudice and war, who manage not to lose their humanity. Should be required reading in classrooms across America. Five stars, and thanks, Mr. McCain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good seller, o.k. book, questionable author...","review":"The book shipment and packaging was great. The condition of the book was just as expected. The seller delivers as promised. The book itself is a joke... John McCain is just another liar, as are the others in DC.

The idea is great, the product isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character is Destiny: a reminder of the good in humanity","review":"Character is destiny was initially purchased with my nine year old son in mind. It would be perfect for him; the writing style is relaxed, fluid, and engaging. But there's more to it than that. Character is Destiny focusses in on those episodes in history when an individual man or woman has made a positive impact on those around them, selflessly putting others before them and, whilst not actually changing the world, they've managed to change their little bit of it. I've read this book and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes breating technique is important","review":"I started taking yoga last month and started to learn about the importance of proper breathing.

The Candy Snatchers rip into their tunes like no other band currentlly calling themselves \\"rock'n'roll\\". There is a certain element of danger and violence lurking on this record that ain't so subtle. This album kicks right into sonic overdrive and just keeps gettin' wilder and meaner. Larry May tears his voice to bloody shreds as the rest of the band slash and burn through one blazing song after the next. This stuff is just plain GREAT. Period. These guys played to an almost empty house in Toronto and STILL TORE THE DARN ROOF OFF OF THE PLACE! Really kids, The mighty Candy Snatchers give it their all.

Money very well spent - even the second time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"musical perfection","review":"The fusion of the two greatest rock composers ever has lead to an album of immense proportion. The songs combine the power of Jim Steinman's (composer of Bat out of Hell I and II and others) lyrics with the tunes of ALW. The songs vary from powerful rock ballads (The vaults of heaven, tyre tracks and broken hearts) to gentle melodies (When children rule the world). This album is highly recommended, at least as good as ALW's Cats and Phantom."},{"rating":"2","title":"LLOYD WEBBERS BEST WORK SINCE \\"PHANTOM\\"","review":"The long awaited new musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber is definetely worth the wait. It is apparant that Andrew Lloyd Webber has returned to writing briliant musicals that stand the test of time against such greats as Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Cats and Jesus Christ Superstar. Whistle Down the Wind takes you through some of the most beautiful songs I feel Lloyd Webber has ever written. He then propells you into rough, raw and high energy numbers that thrill and captivate. Lloyd Webber's collaberation with Jim Steinman is one such collaboration that mirrors previous collabrations with the legendary Tim Rice. If you are one of those persons sick of hearing the same old Andrew Lloyd Webber style of music, well Whistle Down the Wind is the change you need and you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received item","review":"I rated the item low because I have not received this product yet - I hope I will in the near future"},{"rating":"1","title":"One ugly musical","review":"Of course English Girls and Tire Tracks is the same melody. That is not a secret.This musical is probably the midlife crisis of Andy's. Most of the songs are shameless efforts to get just another hit song. (No Matter What, which actually made it to the charts, is a nice song, though.)The lyrics are forgettably meaningless, while the story is awful. Even Starlight Express is better than this one. At least it hasn't that pretentious want for being \\"emotional\\" and \\"deep\\".Keep away from it.The title song is cute despite it's abnormally nave lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I read the book first so...","review":"...maybe that's why I just couldn't take the musical. One of my problems is that Swallow is, really, just too old to believe that the man is Jesus. And the other children, at least musically, are marginalized. We don't get a good sense of their characters through this CD. For those of you who complain that the plot is pointless, the original M.H. Bell novel might clear some of that up. For the musical, a lot of the original clarifying points were lost...And the accents ARE pretty bad, huh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack... eject!","review":"You see the name Andrew Lloyd Webber and assume it can't be horrible right? WRONG! When I put this CD into my player I was horrified. Some of the music was ok, but most of it was awful and cheesy. The London cast putting on southern accents are really bad. The lead character Swallow, has a voice made for a high school production, but not a soundtrack like this. This is not typical ALW, Musical Theater, or good music. This is good milk gone sour. I do however like the voice of the character Amos (pronounced in this CD as AY-MOSS) which is why my favorite song is \\"Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts\\" I suggest this for collectors, and ALW fans, but don't expect the normal, this is a new rock-christian ALW."},{"rating":"1","title":"zeek didn't like this cd","review":"the music in this soundtrack is gorgeous, the voices are refreshing, but the story bothers the heck out of me. what was andrew loyed webber saying with this play? i am a big fan of webbers art, i consider him a genious as far as music goes, but as much as i like the songs in this cd (like Whistle Down the Wind, and If Only) i don't like to listen to something that bares such a fowl and obviously negative view of God and christianity. if that doesn't bother you, than i guess this cd is a great part of a collection, but as for myself, i can't listen to it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ALW musical ever","review":"I can't believe i wasted the money!

I purchased this film along with Slamnation and Fooling with Words. The film barely kept me engaged and the poetry and performances were lackluster. Fooling with Words gives a more comprehensive look at the craft with poets that are not relics of an age almost forgotten. Slamnation is a must have and will wake you up from the coma that Poetry in Motion might cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Eighties Poetry - A Slice of History","review":"Fans of poetry will love seeing the famous poets read their work. Ginsberg sings \\"How To Meditate\\" and Bukowski is sprinkled throughout the film, giving advice to writers and describing the poetry scene of that day. It's great to see the poets perform their work, speak to the interviewer back stage, and learn about their poetic ties. On the second viewing, I found myself fast forwarding to the scenes with Ginsberg, Baraka, and Bukowski. On the third, only Bukowski. The film captures the Contemporary American Poetry scene of the early eighties, but with poetry's progression into new areas, the film becomes an archive. People interested in American poetry should see this movie at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game!","review":"this is one of the most fun games I have played in a while -- when our family got together we played by the rules for a while, then made our own.. it was fun to spend time with our entire family playing a very fun game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed overall in this expansion set","review":"We love our Apples to Apples party box and were excited to add this expansion pack to it. However my family was disappointed overall in this set because most of the cards are combos containing ampersands. For example noun cards include fame & fortune, bells & whistles, arm & a leg, etc. Adjective cards include plump & tender, hail and hearty, rough & ready, hit & miss, fast & furious, etc. My teenagers were especially annoyed by these cards because many of them are just so vague. We've tried to mix them together with the cards in the party box so that nobody gets an entire handful of them again (lots of moans when that occurred) but it'll take some time to get them all evenly distributed. I hope that expansion set 2 does not contain so many cards of this type and I'll ask around to make sure before I purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad & Worse","review":"Our whole family loves Apples to Apples! We know each others' judging tendencies, so know whether to select a literal or metaphoric parallel, or a funny or ironic card. We passionately argue our positions or we pander, whichever wins the round.We were excited for this expansion pack, having played our other cards into predictability. But these are so awful! My wife described using them as being on 'a forced march'. Most of the cards are pairs of words, e.g., Surf & Turf, Chicken & the Egg, The Birds and Bees, which are virtually worthless juxtaposed against their supposed counterparts: Dazed and Confused, Bright and Shining, Short and Stout. Mom, Dad, two college-age daughters and a middle school son all thought the expansion pack to be worse than irritating.We are so disappointed, because the original cards are so creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power metal at it's best","review":"Wow, what a great album. The concept of making a heavy metal album based on the Farenheit 451 book by Ray Bradbury is very cool. The lyrics come through very nicely and you actually get the feeling of the amazing novel. The guitar arrangements are masterpieces all by themselves. Imagine an old Fates Warning/Iron maiden sound full of all sorts of tempo changes, there has to be at least ten to fifteen different guitar riffs in every song. The vocalist operatic 80's singing compliments the music very well. Another one of those albums with a well thought of concept, that actually brings the listener back for more and more.If classic 80's power metal is your cup of tea, this album is a must have. By the way, Track Ten is a classic fates Warning song. Chalk another one up for nuclear blast.

I gave it four stars only because I consider \\"The Ladykillers\\" to be superior.As always, Sir Alec shines in the lead role, with fine support from Stanley Holloway and Sidney James, years before his \\"Carry On\\" fame. The humour here is dark and subtle, and of course there is a delightful \\"twist\\" at the end, an Ealing trade mark.I found the quality of this DVD to be more than acceptable for a 50 plus year-old film. Some of the location scenes in London are interesting, with areas damaged by the \\"blitz\\" in World War II still very evident.So--if you like comedy with genuine wit and style ( very rare today, in the era of teen-oriented gross-out movies ), you will enjoy this one.

The album art is a shocker,and Sinatra's choice of material and arranger lacks his usual judgment. He did few themed albums- the choice of material is limiting, and dogs like \\"Autumn in New York, \\"Isle of Capri\\" and \\"Blue Hawaii\\" are only there to fulfil the travel motif.I don't believe he ever sang those three again. His version of \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" is bettered by his live Melbourne concert, and the \\"Great songs from Great Britain\\" has a superior \\"London By Night\\" Kipling's lovely poem \\"Mandalay\\" is butchered by Sinatra. It can be sung in mess halls by drunken soldiers, but not by cool hipsters who use slang like \\"cats\\" and \\"broads\\" for men and women.

Unable to rate the audio at this time due to the lack of a home theater system, but sounds pretty good thru my Turtle Beach gaming headset played from my PS3. The front of the case had a hole in it which I was disappointed about being that it was brand new. The disc was in excellent condition though so not a big deal. Overall, great product and I'd recommend this movie to any martial arts fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"i hope you have more","review":"It works perfectly, I may get more of these movies as gifts for friends and family members, who also love bruce lee, so better stock up"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MOVIE","review":"IT IS A GOOD MOVIE.

I had the vhs, laser disc, dvd, and now blu-ray. Unfortunately Warner really jumped the gun. the video has hair balls, specks and missing frames. Sure it's sharp but why couldn't they get the film out of a cleaner can. I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played poorly","review":"I don't know if this disc was not prepared correctly or what, but it did not play well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ALL THAT","review":"Sure this movie is a classic but lets face it. Its the bad acting that kills it and the lack of real substance to the story line. If this movie came out today people would hate it. The Karate Kid out does this movie and what does that tell you. Luckily, Bolo Yeung and The crazy old man with the bear claw find work later on in a real good movie Bloodsport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Bruce Lee in his last and most explosive film before his untimely death is probably the best and most entertaining action movie ever made. Bruce Lee is an under cover agent sent to bust up Hans [shi kien] island. Fighting in a tournament along side Roper [John saxon] and Williams [Jim kelly] Bruce lee must prove that Han is running a drug business. Bruce Lee and John Saxon must get through Han's henchmen [Bob Wall] and [Bolo Yeung]before getting a peice of the master. Explosive action with probably the some of the greatests fight scenes ever filmed. Action/comedy star Jackie Chan plays a stunt double for Bruce and also get's his neck violently cracked in the movie.Sammo Hung get's in a dramatic fight with Bruce at the beginning. Predictable but Awesome!!! starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim kelly, Shi Kien, Bob wall, Bolo Yeung, Sammo Hung, and Jackie Chan Rated R for Martial arts violence,brief nudity, and some vulgarity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I bought this already loving the movie, but hating the \\"grainy\\" poor quality that comes with being a 60-70's film ,etc. The film looks Awesome in Blu-ray!! If makes the film that much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Enter The Dragon\\"-Blu-Ray Edition","review":"The image and sound quality was, and is, by far, superior to any previous version on video,broadcast,cable,satellite.Extras and bonus features include documentaries,trailers,T.V.spots,and more.This is Martial Arts Legend/Icon Bruce Lee's final,last,completed,major film,and his best.It's the film by which all other martial arts films are measured.This version of the movie[102 minutes],includes 2 scenes missing from the previous 99 minute home video release version.I only wish for,and dream,that it could be the original,never released,2 hours,or longer,version seen only by Warner Brothers Studios executives.If you love martial arts action adventure,I highly recommend this film classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martial Arts Classic Remastered (for the most part)","review":"This HD DVD looks so much better then the standard DVD version it's pretty impressive. Most of the movie is remastered in HD, but there are certain shots that look quite blurry. There are only a few blurry shots though. When the police drive up to hassle Jim Kelly I noticed a very blurry shot, but it was brief.Most of the movie is outstanding. Some of the close ups showed the pores in the skin of the actors. The detail of the good shots is outstanding. More than half of this movie looks as good as HD cable. I gave it five stars because it's from the early 1970s and I didn't expect to get a cutting-edge image throughout the entire film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Lee Fan","review":"If your a Bruce Lee fan or just a fan of martial arts you have to have this movie, I'm glad I finally got my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Fighting without fighting","review":"This movie gets the adrenaline pumping. Excellent story, Excellent acting EXCELLENT fight scenes of REAL kung Fu techniques...no WIRE FU here! There is drama, comedy and many kung fu styles but you have to watch it closely [ use the slow moption] to understand Bruce Lee's 'way of the intercepting fist' technique. It is too fast for the naked eye!The philosophy \\"the ultimate Kung fu style is to have no style\\" \\" Be as water\\" .. Profound.This truly inspires you to take up Kung fu and Nunchaku's... I did! Watch it with the wife.You can buy this DVD with your eyes closed. It is that good. really a 6 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has 25th Anniversary scenes.","review":"Most anyone looking at a review of this already knows what it is. That being the case I just wanted to add that this version has the scenes included with the 25th Anniversary Editions and that the picture quality is outstanding. I state that because I had doubts about how well restored the picture could be and what effort would be made into transferring it from optical.The audio wasn't lacking, but I didn't find it particularly remarkable either. It was clear and crisp, but I didn't notice any remix work for surround or anything like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie Bad Transfer","review":"This has the worst HD transfer that I have ever seen. Many of the scenes looked like bad internet video with visible pixelization. Already have the DVD, don't bother with the blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Bruce Lee fans!!!!","review":"The British Govt recruits Lee from his Shaolin Temple to help overthrow the evil Dr. Han. The DVD version has many new scenes never seen before, one being a scene where Lee's Shaolin Master tells Lee that he must destroy Han b/c he is a Shaolin disciple using his Shaolin Kung Fu skills for evil. Lee goes to Han's mysterious Island to fight in Han's tournament while trying to collect evidence of wrong doing. At the same time, Lee is settling some personal scores with other combatants and fulfilling the mission given to him by his Master....a twist to the plot you would not know until you've seen the DVD. It's the way Bruce wanted people to see the movie. The DVD also contains biographies of the cast, 3 trailers, footage of Bruce working out, and a documentary. The audio/video is superb. if you're a fan of Bruce Lee, you must have this DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Martial Arts Classic","review":"If you are at all a Martial Arts fan see this film. The best fight scenes ever recorded, beating anything Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and even anything else Bruce Lee ever did. Sure the plot is hokey, but if Mortal Kombat thought it was good enough to rip off completely, then it should be more than good enough for any action fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the Dragon","review":"When, I bought this I thought disc were two individual guess not.

If anyone is looking for the best instruction they can get in Colorado Springs, I'd suggest the defense institute. They are top notch. Look them up and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cigar","review":"As a martial practitioner since childhood, I only find a mixture of Wing chun labelled as Jeet jun do, half baked grappling and bits and pieces of phillipino martial arts in this book. There is no comparison to the latest proven Brazilian jujitsu books currently available in the market. Spend your hard earned money into an author or an art that is well proven. Do not believe in anyone of the self proclaimed street fight experts who has never put his art in open competition but rather hide it in the dark alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart guy, Mediocre book","review":"I got my money's worth with the tidbits. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Mr. Vunak knows his stuff. Somehow the book's a miss. Good state-of-mind stuff. Only place I've read about chewing on your opponent. Didn't care for the techniques offered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book is a lot better than most of the \\"martial\\" arts books out there. One reviewer has written some gripes but this book delivers a lot of useful information. Vunak couldn't put everything in one book of course, and why would he? He already has a plethora of videos on the market. This book gives you a good overview of his other products, teaching you some solid...and useful basics that you can pursue to a further degree if you wish to do so. I think this book is an excellent and inexpensive way to get one's feet wet with Vunak's system. You can then see for yourself that he's a \\"real deal\\" teacher and fighter....then get his other products. Seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Paul Vunak wrote a great book on street fights, the one the real man has to deal with, not the... \\"all hits banned\\" he may find on a dojo mat.When you're on the street you simply have to do one thing: NOT GET HURT, and you may do this only having developed your \\"killing\\" istinct, i.e. that state of mind in which you've reprogrammed your istinct not to be a bunny-hearted loser but a fierce fighter, a 21st century warrior.Vunak, coming from his vast experience with SEALs and martial arts helps the reader to handle tough situations reacting well. As a self defense instructor I found that all the principles shown in this book are the real ones you use in a real fight, so I suggest all people, both unexperienced and skilled martial artist as well as women, to deeply read and understand and so APPLY those principles, if they don't want to hardly and painfully discover that real fights are mayhems and you can get badly hurt unless you fight for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"mini\\"","review":"Its huge, its well detailed and durable.Im loving it, \\"to bad\\" it takes half of the smaller maps i have.The only downside is the stat card, its the size of a 9-pocket portfolio, so I ended up \\"stitching a pocket\\" to my 9-pocket portfolio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Little Chopper","review":"This little chopper, \\"Nutone,\\" now made by a third party, is not worth buying. We had the older Nutone in-counter power unit and food processor, which worked well. This chopper almost tore itself to bits when we first tried to use it: its assembly is fussy and its parts are not robust. Its capacity is too small as well, it will not even handle a whole onion. It does not perform any other food processing, like shredding cheese or slicing vegetables."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICK SPRINGFIELD ANTHOLOGY","review":"This Australian compilation from 1998 is a generous 24-track collection that spotlights Rick Springfield's entire career (back to his early days with Zoot). All of the big hits and misses are here - from \\"Speak To The Sky\\" through \\"Rock Of Life\\" - along with three previously unreleased cuts that will be of interest to hardcore collectors. Nevertheless, the main reason for most listeners to pick this up is the fact that it's a strong overview of Springfield's career, and a really entertaining one at that.TRACK LISTING:Jessie's Girl / I've Done Everything For You / Don't Talk To Strangers / Love Is Alright Tonite / What Kind Of Fool Am I / Affair Of The Heart / Human Touch / Love Somebody / Bop Til You Drop / Celebrate Youth / State Of The Heart / Rock Of Life / Speak To The Sky / What Would The Children Think / Comic Book Heroes / I'm Your Superman / Believe In Me / Hooky Joe / American Girls / Child Within / Elearnor Rigby / Take A Hand / Archangel / Bruce"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plaintive, ahead of its time, timeless.","review":"The sampling of Nick Drake's works speaks to the loneliness inside this troubled man (and to the loneliness in all those who can feel.)

An almost uniformly downbeat CD but worth a listen for the mature musical palate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing collection of nick drake obscurities","review":"This has got to be my #1 in my cd collection.

This company put about 8 packing peanuts in the bottom of a box of 4 perms and one perm box was smashed. The perm solutions were all over the other boxes and ruined salvaging anything from the broken box.

Unfortunately, the women are posed holding a large sword as a prop to indicate their fearlessness.I suppose that this was the feature that \\"sold\\" the book idea, but I would much prefer portraits of my heroines without the sword. The sword is a symbol of much more than fearlessness, and detracts from the book. It makes the book corny.My husband bought it for me for mother's day last year; I'd guess from an amazon recommendation -- but it was a most disappointing gift -- one that I would never leave out for others to view. This wouldn't be true if the swords weren't in every photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Animation, poor transfer","review":"The animations on this disk can be had on the \\"super jewelcase\\" version of this disk.

To make matters worse there is even a female response to this assbackward track(why? somebody please tell me why?) called chic-o stik. These fools cant rap, their beats sound like cheap background music for Atari games and their beef with Dem franchize punks is the lamest rap beef in rap history(yes even lamer than Nelly vs Chingy)! How their wack album went gold is proof that insanity is a reality. F*** Dookie4Life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still resonant after all these years","review":"I caught this on PBS this weekend and was quite impressed. Despite its *very* dated appearance, it drew me in immediately with its wit - it made me sad again at Wendy Wasserstein's untimely death. But it was not just funny - the characters felt real and you could sympathize with their ambitions and ultimately their unfulfilled desires. I would recommend to any fan of Wasserstein, esp. as this is probably the only chance you will get to actually see the play performed.Incidentally, I noticed in my copy of the play (published with The Heidi Chronicles) that the PBS version was all of the original cast, except Meryl Streep's role was originally performed on stage by Glenn Close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this production.","review":"I saw this when it first was broadcast on PBS channel 13 in NY back in 1978.I loved the story line & the great cast of characters,wonderful acting,all the cast members shone through this masterpiece of writing.I was surprised that it was actually on DVD,had it on VHS from a tape that I had made from a rebroadcast on PBS but had lost it.Thank you Wendy Wasserstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 years later, I still listen to this one regularly","review":"This is my favorite Leon Redbone album, although I adore several others.

It contains many of the signs that you would use when beginning to teach your young child to sign and communicate with you about all the every day things in his environment. The repetition is just perfect for those little learners to take in the words and signs (and perfect for mommy and daddy to follow along, too). Excellent gift for new mommies."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 17-month son loves it!","review":"I have Vol 1 to 3, my 17-month son loves them all. We started Vol 1 when he was 8 month-old. So glad that we let him learn sign language, he can't really talk yet. Therefore, he communicates with us by sign language. And he loves the \\"boy and girl\\" on this vol. Only thing I don't like this volume is the words they teach, I don't want my son to learn \\"Candy\\", \\"Ice Cream\\", \\"Cookies\\" etc all kind of \\"Junk Food\\". I tried to avoid him to eat junk food, but this vol exposes him to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for this video HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","review":"Our speech delayed toddler is a signing MASTER now. We thought this video would be over his head (with songs and short sentences) but he has responded beautifully to the kids' explanations & comments, the woman narrator and video of other kids using signs.

We will order another volume of this one, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD","review":"This is my son's favorite of the three Signing Time videos he has. Not only was this particular video very helpful for him to communicate about some of his favorite items to eat, but the \\"boy/girl\\" song at the end (and remixed additions) are upbeat and very catching to his eyes and ears.

Anyone familiar with Shane's work won't be disappointed with either the lyrics or the music. It's kind of a new sound for Shane, almost Cajun on some tracks, but the lyrics are the mad Irishman at his sarcastic best -- that's right, sarcastic, for those of you that didn't get the lyrics the first time around. This album is also fun! So get yourself a six-pack of Guinness, climb in, and let the Shane do the driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"New depths","review":"Before I heard this album I was convinced that MacGowan's minor(!) drinking problem never would damage his music, considering his earlier accomplishments. This proves me wrong. From start to finish this is the kind of garbage I'm embarrased to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Painful","review":"As a longtime Pogues fanatic, I found listening to this album a really, really painful experience. In spite of his legendary boozing, Shane MacGowan has written some of the greatest songs ever, but you wouldn't know from it listening to \\"Crock of Gold.\\" He now sounds exactly like what he's become: an extremely ill man. He seems to have lost not only his gift for songwriting, but also the ability to discern what he and others have already written. Just try to find a song that's not, in some way, a recycled Pogues tune. Furthermore, his voice has degraded to a pitiful whine. I've heard more pleasant ramblings from homeless people on the subway. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC -- I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crock","review":"The drink has sapped all Shane's fire, spirit, and creativity; the Crock of Gold is simply that, a crock. Stick with The Snake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather corny","review":"The decline continues. Generic tunes and trite, self-conscious Bad Boy lyrics. Silly and more than a little pathetic. Shane MacGowan was a real talent, but it would take a superman to survive both his self-abuse and an uncritical audience that'll evidently eat up anything he puts out as long as he lays on the usual cornball mush-mouthed blarney. People can talk great Irish poets, but right now Shane is neither bard nor seer. He's just a sickly has-been coasting for fans -- aging, gullible and belligerent -- who greet tales of the I.R.A. the way teenage metal heads greet evocations of Satan.More than a little embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I'm a great Shane Macgowan fan and tried to like this CD and I just couldn't at all. His voice is slurred and lifeless from all of the drug and alcohol abuse. The songwriting is average and the melodies are stolen from Pouges songs (NW3 and Sally MacLenane). I have a problem with Macgowan fans sticking up for him and giving great reviews even though his stuff is substandard. These fans would give him 5 stars if he belched and farted through an album. This is NOT a good album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but that made it all the more interesting","review":"Definitely a dated book. But from Jack Webb's writing you can tell he was an accomplished person. The book is riddled with crime stories as it explains the varies levels of the 1950s Los Angeles Police Department. It's not quite like his docudrama Dagnet series, yet I almost heard his voice as I read. The story of the Black Dahlia was by far the most interesting and I can see how introduction writer James Ellroy became fascinated with the case after reading about it in this book. I found myself looking up documentaries that covered the never-solved Black Dahlia case. (Found one by James Ellroy as a matter of fact that offered a plausible answer to whodunit).If jack Webb were alive today, I would truly love to meet him to discuss this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for the movies and.....","review":"five stars for the DVD quality! This is a great package for the Hoppy fan! I like the older movies of the series the best and this is the best package I've found. I won't comment on the movies as any Hoppy fan who hasn't seen any of these would be sure to love them! I would be remiss if I didn't put a word in about George Hayes, the best sidekick of them all. He is as much a reason for purchasing these movies as Bill Boyd. I'm very pleased with the quality of the DVDs. That is a real problem with these old movies I have found. Most of the complaints and poor ratings of them are usually about the quality of the DVD not the movie itself. These two, given the age of the films are first rate! I highly recommend this set! Great quality both movies and DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit Back And Enjoy","review":"Very satisfied with my purchase. Finally something not made in China. A true American Icon.

I'm really feelin' the tracks \\"Got It Locked\\", \\"Real Raw\\" and \\"The Chron\\" f/Dr. Dre. Since \\"Got It Locked\\" has been played a lot, the album should also feature, a remix version. That would make it really interesting. I'm hoping Dre (Executive Producer of this album) will realease it pretty soon! The dude Tela shines bright!

If you foolishly put off buying the first album do not hesitate on this one. The tracks to be found on this second masterpiece are constructed so that you cannot tell if you are on a cliff and about to fall off or on a plain with the wind in your face. See Gridlock live and you will know the feeling first hand. If this is not humanly possibly then take a day off of work and devote an entire afternoon listening to nothing but Gridlock and I guarantee you will see why music is as important as breathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job, Amy","review":"Amy Grant's distinctive voice is in fine form on this CD. I'm glad she has gone back to singing overtly Christian music as opposed to her more secular material.Yes, Amy does get a lot of help from her husband Vince Gill. Not only did he co-produce this CD, but you hear his harmony vocal and guitar all over this CD. Amy and Vince sing a soulful duet on \\"Rock of Ages.\\"There is a lot of country feel on this CD. Amy's version of \\"Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus\\" is downright bluegrass. The closing song, \\"Oh Love That Will Not Let Me Go,\\" is done in a modern jazz style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"What more can I say. These hymns are such a part of my history that when I heard this CD, I was sorely disappointed. Too much tinkering. Amy Grant has such talent, it's too bad she blew it with what could have been a slam dunk with a more straightforward treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as legacy","review":"it's ok if you love country mucis mixed with hymns.it's the continuation of legacy but it's definately not as good as legacy.It's ok i guess, nothing \\"WOW\\" about it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative....Not","review":"I would have to agree with \\"Okie\\" that Amy's stuff is not nearly as good as it used to be. In fact, her creativity has gone downhill dramaticall in the last 7-8 years. When she was married to Gary Chapman, I know the relationship was rocky, but he was the flint that sharpened her musical steel. Now, she has become a little vince clone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album","review":"This is a fabulous CD and should not be relegated to any one category of music. This should be in pop, folk, and popular music--not just gospel.Although the subject of the songs are faith-based, the original arrangements and selection of songs reaches a broader audience. For example, Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee is arranged and sung in such an original way--where else can we listen to such beautiful classical music with a modern twist? The one original song, Carry You is so beautiful..makes you wish for more...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Vince, Not Enough Amy","review":"Amy Grant's albums used to be ground-breaking, fresh and innovative. Not any more. She has lost her identity to Vince Gill. How sad. What more can I say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Miss the Salt and Light Human Amy","review":"Lead Me On, Heart in Motion, House of Love. These songs spoke to imperfect humans, trying to achieve something greater. This and Legacy panders back to her preaching to the choir days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"Amy lost much of her Xtian fan base when she defected from Gary Chapman to Vince Gill. This album is not going to help her regain what she lost, because it sounds too much like Mr.Gill. Granted, he is a pretty good instrumentalist and a tolerable singer, but not a good producer; not even the great Brown Bannister could rescue this album from the Gill influence. Coupled with the dismal sales of her previous 2 albums, this one does not bode well for Amy's musical future."},{"rating":"1","title":"You MUST be kidding me!!","review":"This CD is the WORST CD on the planet. I got a coupon from a Christian bookstore and I picked out this CD, because I really wanted to begin teaching my daughter the old hymns.Amy Grant REALLY messed up. It's like she didn't even really try, knowing the diehard fans would probably buy it, but this CD is soooo bad! I mean, she even changed the melody to Jesus Loves Me. She's kidding, right? She even changed the melody to her OWN songs.Bad, bad, bad. I wish I could give this ZERO stars. All I can say is that at least I didn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock is Top","review":"I have been an Amy fan for 23 years! I have to be honest, the first time I listened to this CD, outside of carry you and helping hand, I wasn't sure. The style is much different than the traditional Amy sound. I really liked Legacy and loved Simple Things (containing Looking For You, which may be my all time favorite Amy song), I just wasn't sure of this project. The hymns are not ones I remember singing in church. But now after a few weeks, each time I listen I find a new connection; a string of lyrics that speak to me, a sting of notes that catch my attention. I recently have found myself singing or humming this while at work. So, Amy fans - keep an open mind and you will find this recording to be a true winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touchs my soul","review":"This album touchs all the spiritial feelings of ones soul. As I listen to this album, I can almost feel each song shift my emotions into a different gear. This is a great album to melt away the stresses of the day, while at the same time bringing an inner peace at the promise of tomorrow, by way of ones redemption in our renewal of faith. It is a beautifully produced album, and I am glad I have it in my collection. Re: the comments by \\"Christian Mom\\" It sounded kind of familiar. Almost like what a blacksmith would say when she would have an ax or two, too grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Time Hymns revisited...","review":"I've been enjoying this album along with Amy's 2002 release. Amy has brought new life to these old time, classic hymns some of us grew up on and still sing today. Today, we tend to sing the modern hymns and lay to rest those songs which still move many of us. Amy chose to bring back those hymns in a traditional, country-style setting and it works! Some of my favorite hymns sung here are Sweet Will Of God, Abide With Thee, El Shaddai, Carry You, Know We Are Christians/Helping Hand. If you remember and enjoy the older hymns, you most likely will like these versions and if you're new to these songs, this is a wonderful introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Stone","review":"This is one solid trance/house album. The album seems to take you on various destinations, hence the title. Each track sounds as if it's from another place. I would say this is in my top 2 for the year's releases, right behind ATB The DJ in the Mix 3. This will be in my player for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Not so good.","review":"This cd did not impress me, and thats sad cause I'm a HUGE fan of the trance genre.

Hands down, no doubt. The ring looks amazing for the price. Just don't expect the diamonds to look as big as they do in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Do not buy this album. Heard Russo sing on Growing Up Gotti and thought it would be classic Sinatra-type music. The music is not bad but Russo ruins the music with stupid inept comments and introductions to songs. On a live album this is expected but on a studio production it spoils the effect of listening to the music. I was so disappointed that I discarded the cd. Russo does not have a great voice but it is not a bad voice either but his talking inbetween the music irritates to the point of distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential listening,","review":"This collection of live, on-the-spot recordings showcase the legendary Fairport Convention like nothing else. They worked seamlessly as a musical ensemble, and Sandy Denny's voice is incredibly moving.\\"Heyday\\" features songs from the best songwriters of the period: Dylan, Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen, Richard Farina, Joni Mitchell. The live recording of Dylan's \\"Percy Song\\" is gorgeous, and surpasses the studio version in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesser effort from TU","review":"If you heard Transglobal Underground somewhere, or heard OF them, and want to try out their music to see if you like it, my advice to you is this: rush out and get \\"Psychic Karaoke.\\" Then get \\"International Times.\\" Both are exciting, exotic, multifaceted and over all thrilling albums that will make you dance, trance, whatever. Two examples of the TU folks at their best.\\"Rejoice, Rejoice\\" is not such an album. The other reviews here pretty much sum it up: there are a couple of strong tracks, but most of the music is uninspired, sophomoric, even irritating - especially when compared to the towering strength of the aforementioned two releases. You'd have to pry my copies of \\"Psychic Karaoke\\" and \\"International Times\\" out of my cold, dead hands before I'll give them up. As for \\"Rejoice, Rejoice\\"? After a few listens, I sold it on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing","review":"After discovering TGU and Natacha Atlas in Istanbul in 1996,I knew that these guys were great. They have not disappointed me so far. And I am pretty sure they never will.Whichever genre of music they use( Indian, Middle-Eastern or Gypsy, qawwali,ambient, drum'n'bass, hip-hop),they always come up with great songs.In this CD, my favorites are Rude Buddah, Ali Mullah, Air Giant and Sky Giant.The only problem is that I am hearing Natacha Atlas less in every new album.Anyway,if you like this CD, check out Talvin Singh, Natacha Atlas, and other TGU stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ecletic, often sucessful, conglomeration of world & dance","review":"With instruments like dhols, sitar, tabla, and milk churn (!), it is immediately clear that TGUG means business in an international way. Samples and synthesized beats abound, pushing certain tracks on this album -- including Thousand Year Heat and Sky Giant -- wonderfully into the adrenalin zone. Some tracks fall flat: their treatment of Ali Mullah which, though dedicated to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, is not a patch on his classic song, even as an interpretation. Pieces like Air Giant reveal TGUG's ability to create elegant soundscapes, reminiscent of Deep Forest. All in all, a solid world dance album with moments of pure gold and surprisingly engaging energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats not to like?","review":"Very well made. Looks great too. I knew before I bought it that you can't store blades in it but thats the trade off for a pretty sleek great looking and feel to this knife. Nice that I can flick it open with one hand too. Only thing thing that'd make this better is if it stored an extra blade or two...but thats usually the first thing to break on all my other knives except for my Greenlee 0652-23 Heavy-Duty Folding Utility Knife..but the Greenlee is extremely bulky but a great knife as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious issues with knife","review":"I am surprised this has not been addressed. I purchased this to replace a cheap Husky knife I purchased from Home Depot that kept getting jammed after a few weeks time and would not close. On this knife I had three problems: (1) Whenever you unfolded the knife to use it, you had to watch not to cut yourself on the blade, so you had to open it from a very particular hand position and angle or you could easily cut yourself. (2) The clip atop the blade is loose, it does not 'snap\\" in in some fashion so as to secure the blade very well and would often swing open at certain points when usign this (3) When I went to make my first blade change I COULD NOT close the clip no matter how hard I tried. I had to return this item to Amazon. Simply could not use it at that point. I had had it only about 3-4 days.I gave it two stars only because it seemed like it had nice potential - it had good heft, nice polished wood grain handle, otherwise this was a one-star experience to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rolls Royce of Utility Knives","review":"It's difficult to imagine a pocket tool made wih greater workmanship.

I also had to meet the safety requirements on the job site (no pocket knives). The blade changes out easily. I use it for cutting fire blanket, plastic and of course boxes. I gave it four stars because of the weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's solid, and it cuts stuff, but...","review":"...I wouldn't buy it again.Heavy (good and bad), solid feel, woodgrain looks nice, etc. The quick-change mechanism is exactly that, and solid/tight when closed. Those are the good points.There are two main reasons I wouldn't buy this knife again. First, the lockback design. In the age of liner locks (release with your thumb for one-handed closing), it makes no sense to manufacture a knife with the lock release on the back. I never grab this knife because it takes two hands to close it. Second, and this is a MAJOR design flaw, when the knife is closed, you can squeeze the blade assy closed further and the blade edge actually contacts part of the inner frame, nicking the blade. This is a huge oversight and completely unacceptable.But hey...it looks nice sitting in my toolbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"item came used","review":"The item seem to be used... oily, fingerprints, sticker on blade handle and overall looked dirty.

This knife lasted all about 5 minutes and literally broke the first time I used it -- cutting up the Amazon box it came in. The head on the bolt that holds the body of the knife together sheared right off and now it's a wobbly/useless mess. I'm too busy/lazy to fuss with the RMA to send this back, so I'll retire it to my drawer of other misfit utility knives. I can also confirm that this knife is way too heavy to carry in a pocket all day.

For the price, the quality of the workmanship is impressive.Pros: Real wood inlay, sturdy construction, excellent blade holding mechanism,Cons: Heavy and slightly bulky.

The knives I've owned all ranged in price from $6 - $16. For under $15 you are getting an awesome knife. The wood grain handle is simply stunning. It feels and looks like it would cost upwards of $25+. It feels substantial in your hands, and very secure. The blade it came with is exceptionally sharp, and cuts through anythings. I've owned it for a short time, but it appears to be very durable, and I'm sure it will stand the test of time.

These were perfect. THey can be easily cut into rounds using a serated knife, and to encourage chewing, they are long enough for you to hold them to the one side of the mouth.Also, since our daughter loved puffs of all kinds... we wanted to at least introduce a variety of flavors.

As he grew older he did not give the same attention to the others, not even for 5 minutes. Now he is 14 mos old. He still watches them and LOVES Rachel (he has fallen for her). He has been signing milk, more, and dog since he was 9mos old. He is more prominant with his signing and is able to pick up new ones from me (like please and sorry).

Anyone who is familiar with the de Azevedo family knows that, whatever they do, they do it good. Emilie makes it so much fun. It moves quickly, yet very easy to learn.

Excellent teaching techniques have been deployed. Having children do the signs, brief explanation of the signs, the songs, the presentation, all combine to one effective teaching tool.

The programming director for their ferries must be a true nihlistWhat was even funnier was that the movie was subtitled in Thai, which meant only people that could understand English or read Thai would follow what was happening.The best moment of the movie was when the terrorists hi-jack the sinking cruiser and my travelling companion, who is English, commented, \\"What are these guys, Irish?\\"This comic relief was the only thing that made the ferry trip tolerable.

Ice T is awful as the hedonistic leader of this motley crew; Claudia Christian is gorgeous as always but looks she belongs in another movie.

I finally called them and the representative that I talked to informed me that they had to contact the make and have them ship the item to me which I could've done myself.2.) Aubuchon Hardware employees' have no customer service skills at least the one(s) I talked to.3.) They did not meet the delivery deadline.I can go on forever but to make a long story short I canceled my order with them.

You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sports Bra ever!","review":"This sports bra works like a dream. Myself being a well-endowed woman, but with a small band size (32D), it is nearly impossible for me to find a sports bra that fits well. This bra fits true to size, and works amazingly. I have tried several other sports bras, but this was by far the best one I have ever owned. The bra keeps everything in, and doesn't make me feel self-conscious about myself when I run. It does everything a bra should do, and also has really easy-to-work straps and three back hooks instead of two for extra support. I have recommended this to several friends, and would recommend it to anyone with a large cup size trying to find a good sports bra. I will not ever buy any other sports bra after finding this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort is the word","review":"This is a very comfortable bra. I am not a serious runner, but I do light jogging, jump jacks etc. I find this bra to better than other sports bra's I have tried and far more comfortable. Found it easy to put on and take off. My shoulders and upper arms have pain when they are raised mid height, so having the back hook is wonderful. I have actually become stuck when putting on a bra that slips over my head. The bra minimizes bounce, straps stay up, yet I don't feel like I'm taped up. I will buy more of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand why people like this bra","review":"After hearing all the great things about this bra, I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try. Boy was I greatly diappointed. This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support. I'm only a 36B, I don't know how anyone larger could like this bra. My old Champion bras give much better support. I returned this bra, the material was thin, provided no modesty coverage and had no support. I can't see how it's rated to be a high support bra for running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great minimizer that's comfortable!","review":"I know others have poo-poo'd this bra saying it's flimsy and doesn't support. I totally disagree but I think it's all in the type of bra you prefer. I prefer minimizer bras that I can wear with tank tops and t-shirts. For that use, this bra is great. There is no discernible \\"cup\\"; it's more of a band or wide strap that holds me in well. I don't feel like I've got miles of boob walking out in front of me, but it does give me nice cleavage. I love, love, love the way the straps adjust in FRONT with velcro. It's hidden and you can reach in and re-adjust the bra at any time without having to twist around like a Chinese acrobat to get to the straps. I'm buying more of these, in different colors, just as soon as they have the colors I want in my size."},{"rating":"2","title":"great running bra","review":"This is a very comfortable bra for running. The first time I wore it I had too much \\"bounce\\", but I adjusted the straps and got a good fit without sacrificing comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous and incorrect sizing","review":"I wear a 34D bra, and ordered this in the same size. The bra was ok in the band measurement, but the cup size was a B, at most. It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered. If your breasts grow out of your sternum, I suppose this will work. This was definitely not a size D or C bra. It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny. Returning. Disappointed. All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again. Stick to Nike, Under Armour, Adidas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for high impact!","review":"This is my favorite sports bra ever. I'm a 32 D, so most bras either fit around my chest and squish the girls out the top and sides, fit the girls but then are too big around the chest, or they simply don't provide enough support. This bra fits well and gives great support for high impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"34DD Runner is happy","review":"I read all kinds of reviews after looking for a sports bra (avid runner and gy rat, but have had weight gain this year and led me to have much larger bust then ever). At 34DD, your options are limited. Amazon has amaing prices for moving comfort and I settled on the Fiona and the Maia bra. I wore both of them to the gym for hard workouts and to work. The Maia is high cut and more restricted movment. I am actually very pleased with how both performed and glad that I got two different versions. I actaully thought wearng one 8 hours and then heading to the gym would be too much, but it was comfortable. It might feel tight initially, but both the Maia and Fiona wore true to size 34DD, I have them both on last hook at this time. I am glad that the girls are held up with a lot of support and I can continue to work out, run, anything, and not think about ho much the girls hurt or are moving. They stay in place and feel great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um what support?!?!","review":"I'm so confused. I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C's and up??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts, and contemplated buying this for the longest time (I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found) and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome! Bought my regular bra size, which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design, but here's the thing. When you say a sports bra is supportive, I'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING. One of of two ain't bad right? It's definitely supportive under the bust, but the bouncing? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times, and I couldn't handle all the bouncing. Oh and it's barely lined! So beware! Because if it's cold in the room, others will definitely know. This is definitely going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best runner's bra","review":"I have three of these bras so far and love them. I am not so large, but definitely felt that the majority of \\"jog bras\\" out there were leaving a lot to be desired. My typical bra size is 34C but in the Fiona bra I get a perfect fit by sizing to 32D. I was initially concerned that I might chafe where the velcro strap doubles back, but I don't notice it at all. As a bonus, the velcro allows you to stealthily remove the bra under a shirt after running. I did not notice any pilling that another reviewer mentioned. They are also showing a great deal of durability, as I wash and wear these with great frequency. So, I feel this product really delivers and is definitely worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good","review":"It's so beautiful, so comfy, so stylish. I wear it every day, I don't care if it's intended for gym work or not. It's the best bra I've ever had; it holds my breasts in the way they've never been held before... I feel so easy breathing in it, at work or walking or running...Already ordered two other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing support, even for a D cup!","review":"I purchased this bra in a 40D about 8 weeks ago when the typical spandex/cotton blend sports bra I had wasn't doing its job. I absolutely LOVE this sports bra and I've purchased 2 more since. I work out 5 days a week and I've never had an issue with this bra rolling or anything like that.It is a snug fit, the band width is true to size but it makes sure to hold your breasts in place. I typically put it on without the shoulder straps fastened so that I can arrange my chest and then strap up. I have had NO issues with the velcro on the straps, which was an initial apprehension for me.I am 100% committed to this bra. I had purchased another style by moving comfort, but this is by far my favorite. While working out I don't even notice the bra, which is exactly as it should be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra","review":"This bra does exactly as promised. It fits very snug and keeps the girls from bouncing around. I like the adjustable straps and hook and eye enclosure in the back. I did not give it 5 stars for one reason-- if you have large nipples, they will show through. Other than that, I love this bra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I wanted to love it..all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope. Seriously, I don't understand the attraction. Wish I had returned it, instead of giving it the chance it didn't deserve. :(It's awful!!1. Offers very little support and zero bounce control.2. Flimsy. No structure whatsoever.3. A limp, shapeless piece of fabric.4. Cups are strange and loose.5. Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front, turning and twisting.6. It's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully, per instructions. The result was my usual bra size. That's what I ordered and it's so oversized! The cups seem huge.Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"go with the enell","review":"Tried this bra. I am a DD, and this was not nearly supportive enough while running. Also, the straps adjust at the front/shoulders, and that extra bit of fabric really rubbed on my skin, and a week later I still have actual scabs from it. I would highly recommend going with the Enell sports bra, it is so worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sprots Bra","review":"I have always been a 2 sports bra wearer for support when I work out (34DDD). However, I finally found a bra that is great on its own. I run in comfort these days and everything stays in place! The velcro straps stay put so I don't have to tug (although I find I have to tighten them so they hit either above or below the collarbone). Overall I am very pleased and plan to buy more. I would love if they could work this into a racerback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great support for DD!","review":"I bought the Moving Comfort bra based on the good reviews on Amazon. I'm so happy I did. Better support that I've had in years. I like the way the straps adjust in the front. The bra fits in the size I normally buy, doesn't rub me wrong, and breaths well. A week after I bought it I ordered another one. By the way, I also bought the Moving Comfort compression shorts. I've never bought this brand before, but I'm very pleased and impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortabe","review":"This bra has been great for gym, haven't played sport in it yet but am expecting the same. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it does still flatten chest area but not as badly as some. Great to have back opening/closure....no struggling to get it on. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even works with a breast prothesis!","review":"For almost 30 years it's been difficult to find a sports bra that works well with a full breast prothesis. This one does the trick even in the DD cup size and holds both sides firmly in place for my activities including tennis, hiking, bicycling and yoga (no falling out in down dog). This amazes me since there is no pocket to contain the prothesis. Moreover, it's so comfortable I choose to wear it for overnight travel by plane or train. The durability is terrific also... I just purchased a couple of new ones, but what I've had for two years continue to serve me well. Now I don't have to wash so often. I just hope this product continues to be available."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sports bra!","review":"After reading the other reviews, I bought this sports bra in a 32DD. In regular bras I wear a 32DDD, but since they didn't have the DDD I went with the DD. It fit almost perfectly!The band is not 100% flush with my chest (more like 50% chest, 50% on boob), but I believe it is because it is not my correct cup size. It pushes my boobs back into my body and somewhat together after long exercise sessions, but I think that adds to the \\"no bounce\\"! I compared this bra to my regular non-specialty sports bra and it is like night and day! Yes, there is movement, but nowhere near as much bounce as with my old champion sports bras. Definitely worth the extra $$. I won't be buying any more sports bras that go with the S/M/L sizing. I didn't give this bra five stars just because I have yet to try it on \\"high impact\\" athletics- I've only tried it with jogging, hiking, etc. and it is thin, so in cold weather beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. Excellent support for larger busts. Fits great, very comfortable. Super supportive. I would purchase again and recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Support","review":"This is a great sports bra! Very good support, however your nipples do show that is why I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts sometimes","review":"I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder. Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs. No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little to tight","review":"I like it very much. I feel it is a little to tight, probably I need to try another size,I have sized in Victoria Secret the past month and they recommend me a DD so probably it could be my problem. But above all it brings great support. The only thing I could recommend is to do something to cover the nipples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bra Ever","review":"The Moving Comfort Bra's have worked just as described. They are comfortable and hold everywhere that I need them to hold. They offer a wide range of sizes and are very affordable in comparison to others in this same market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good","review":"I have long been looking for the perfect sports bra, and the Fiona is good, but not perfect.I wear a 36 Ddd, so finding any sports bra that supports and compresses can be a task. This sports bra is supportive and has an excellent amount of movement restraint, it is comfortable and I feel as though it wicks sweat away well. For me though, the band around the rib cage rolls up constantly, not to the point of exposing me, but to the point of annoying me; this could be due to the fact that I ordered a size that is a cup size down and a band size up from my normal size. And don't exactly expect a lift and separate effect from this bra, but I don't expect that from any sports bra that actually compresses enough to hold my chest in place at the bra size I wear. The rib cage rolling doesn't bother me to the point where I won't wear it, so overall I'm pleased. Would I purchase this again? If the price were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BRA","review":"This bra is amazing. I have been searching for a good sports bra for about 6 months, online/in the store. I did order a size cup up, since some of the reviews said to do so. My boobs stay in place, no rubbing, no straps falling, and easy to put on. When I need to order more I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra for the $$","review":"Most sports bras in this price range do nothing to make running acceptable without at least 2 bras. I can do jumping jacks and jog without wanting to scream. I thought it was odd to have velcro holding the straps, but it seems to be doing just fine. The bra was a little stiff and uncomfortable when I first tried it on, but now that I've washed and worn it it's very comfortable. Buying a second one now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running!","review":"The Moving Comfort Fiona Bra is the best sports bra I've found for high impact sports like running. I'm a full 36D and this bra doesn't budge during my runs. It is not as attractive as the cute t-back styles, but functionally, it is the best product I've ever tried. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trouble with quality, and no cup!","review":"Although the design is good (adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band, as described in Product Features), but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours. I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt! So it's not my body problem, but the quality.And there's also no cup as described in product features! Honestly, I spent this much for getting these cups. Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving, and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups. But when I received it, there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought a differnt moving comfort bra but this one is bad","review":"bra doesn't have padding in the front so when it is cold everyone can see know what happens. otherwise it fits ok but doesn't provide the support a sports bra should.

I do not recommend this for any big-busted girl doing high-impact activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it...but don't love it","review":"I bought this based on a large number of favorable reviews. I wanted it for running. I wear a 36C but got a smaller band size because I like the fit to be more snug. It is comfortable and no chafing but didn't keep the girls as contained as I would like. I will wear it but probably not for running."},{"rating":"2","title":"so comfortable!","review":"I love this bra for running and wish I could wear it all the time because it is so extremely comfortable to wear but unfortunately there is no separation and therefore I end up with the uniboob which I hate. So as far as it being a good workout bra I would give it 5 stars but because I can not wear it as an everyday bra I only gave it four stars. I do love it and will look into finding another bra from the this company that is similar but has something to separate as well as support."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't fit well","review":"I didn't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time (same company, different style), it fit different and I didn't like the Velcro straps. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Keeps You In!","review":"The thick straps and soft interior fabric makes this sports bra the most comfortable I've ever tried. The shoulder straps are not painful, and all the big-chested women know what I mean when I say that. I ordered a DD, my size according to the size chart, and it fit really well. But, my goodness, does it keep your girls from flopping around on the treadmill! It also stands up well to sweat. I say that because some lower-quality sports bras get wrinkly and gross after a few weeks at the gym. You will be satisfied with this product. It's breathable, comfortable, soft, and tough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the only one that works","review":"I've tried dozens of different sports bras and this is the only one that works.

I went to a bra store, got measured, and they recommended Moving Comfort Fiona. For the past 12 years, I thought all sports bras come in Small, Medium, or Large. This bra made my workout so much more pleasant. It has shoulder straps that adjust with velcro, and the construction and material are all high quality. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny if you exercise everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing no support","review":"So I rarely review anything online,but I really just wanted to say few things about this bra.so someone else doesn't get caught out.im a 38d with a 27 waist so im just big on top..and I cannot get over d reviews by people with bigger bust than me,dunno how they were supported by this bra.it is honestly for me anyway,was a glorified shelf tank top,absolutely no support total bounce and just very light.sports bras arent supposed to be VERY comfortable so I knew once I put it on that it wasn't gona be much use for running.i log 35+miles a wk,its prob good for yoga etc low impact sports.i would highly recommend the Juno great great bra for running or the enell 100 ,this is only my experience but I have it now and can't return it so tis a bit of a waste.good luck gals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bra","review":"If you like to run and need support this is the perfect bra for you.

This bra is AMAZING! It is comfortable and the front adjusters make it possible to nurse without removing the entire sports bra - a feature I have not found in any other sports bra. It is also so supportive and keeps everything held up. I highly recommend this bra to all nursing (and non nursing) mamas out there.

GENIUS. One glitch - I received a larger size than ordered, but it actually fits well, so I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sports bra ever","review":"I love this bra for ashtanga yoga. I'm petite and a 34DDD, but all the sports bras I tried were heavy and bulky and the underwires stabbed and poked and rubbed when I did complicated yoga poses. I decide to try this in the 34DD (the closest I could get to my cup size) and it works! The support is super, but it's so smoothly constructed (with the velcro-adjust straps) that it feels like I'm hardly wearing anything. No matter how I bend, stretch, or twist, it's comfortable and never binding. If you are unhappy with the sports bras you've tried, this is a truly different option. The other Moving Comfort bras I checked out didn't work for me, but I own three of the Fionas and wear them for Zumba, jazzercise, yoga, and belly dancing. It's even pretty enough to wear as a camisole under a sporty top or hoodie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite sports bra","review":"This is the most comfortable, supportive sports bra I've found and I've tried many.

Gave 4 stars because the size between colors differs. I am normally a 36DD but I took the review suggestions and purchased a 34DD. I received a black and white bra.

Oh, and I haven't experienced uniboob so far, however... with my moisture wicking work out shirts, this bra does show when you are cold!! Regular cotton shirts, it doesn't show. Great product... extremely surprised and satisfied!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best running bra ever","review":"Adjustable length straps are great. Im a 32E and I wear the DD in this bra. Uni boob yes, but oh well. I don't bounce in this bra and that's all I care about. I do wish it had better wicking fabric. I start to chaffe around the middle after 6 miles if I'm running hard. A little body glide does the trick though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you need support","review":"I've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one, it sounded like just the ticket. I'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD. The bra is well made and comfortable, but there really isn't much support. It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts, but it didn't work for me at all. Darn it, I loved the green!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit and Great Support","review":"I love the Fiona Bra! My first thought upon trying it on was \\"what a great bra!\\" I am a C cup with a large ribcage. It is very difficult to find a bra, much less a sports bra that goes up to 40C. I was very happy to find it. I love that it hooks - I hate trying to twist into and out of one piece bras! The 4 hooks make it so that there are no back fat bulges. I am a runner and don't even think about my chest anymore - I barely bounce! It is also very comfortable. The front straps are adjustable velcro. Some people say that they rub, but they don't for me. For activities like yoga, I would recommend something else as it can be restraining in some odd positions, but for running and walking I highly recommend it!I found it at Scheels for $25"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so much I bought 3!","review":"This is an amazing sports bra, after trying it, I bought two more (thankfully, they were on sale!). As a bustier woman, I appreciate the full support and flattering shape of this bra. It is like wearing a real bra with a comfy sports bra over it. It is so supportive, comfortable and shaping that I even wear it when i'm not working out. It is durable enough to endure an hour run on the treadmill. It doesn't smoosh you flat, it has molding so it keeps you perky yet tucked in. I can't say enough good things about!

This needs no extra support and covers everything so if needed you can walk around with out a shirt. Nothing spills out the top nothing seeps out the sides, it's perfect. With is being adjustable no matter what size I am from C to DDD it still fits. Can't believe it took this long to find something that finally fits and works.

The materials are good quality and construction is clean (no weak seams, loose threads), but bounce control wasn't optimal and some of its \\"features\\" actually hurt a bit. I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them. This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more. The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro. You adjust them by unlatching them, pulling them tighter, and reattaching to the Velcro strip. This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have. The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment, and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros:Good materialsGood constructionCons:Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big chested women rejoice!","review":"I'm somewhere around 38 DD-DDD and this bra is completely and utterly bounceless. Caveat: there's no separation and sizing runs a bit odd so order one band size larger than normal and one cup size smaller. That said, the shoulder straps don't slip, there's no poking underwire in my armpit, no pressure points anywhere, and the velcro adjustable shoulders really do make a big difference allowing for more or less freedom from bounce depending on your needs.

I just bought another one, as I'm not liking my other expensive Champion bras that are supposed to be high impact. I'm glad I went down a cup size. I bought a 'C', but am a 'D'. Will buy more in the future, this is the only bra I want to exercise in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasantly surprised!","review":"Great bra for larger cup sizes. I was skeptical about a bra without an underwire, but this bra was comfortable and provided very good support without quishing. The only complaint is that the dark color bled a little bit onto my tank top after a sweaty spin class so I recommend washing a few times before wearing. I will be buying a few other colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to size","review":"Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is \\"true to VS sizes\\", but I did not find this to be true. My VS size is 32D, but the cup size on this bra is huge. I plan on returning it, but I'm debating going down to a B or C cup size (it's really that big). Chest size fits perfect though. I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the \\"sports bra hop\\" to get out of my other MC bras. I just can't give it a better rating because I can't wear it in the size I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"reeeeally tight","review":"i'm actually not a 32B but am a 30B/C, and got this thinking, sports bras are usually too tight so why not try the next size up? well, this was so tight i had to return it. i could barely breathe with it on, and it squashed my chest without supporting it. felt like one of those chest-binder things. the good: it's clearly very well-made with high-quality fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sports bra I have owned","review":"I have trained for events for the last 20 years plus.

By the end of my run, I was clutching my boobs in my hands to keep them from knocking me unconscious.Additionally, the lining is only stitched to the body of the bra at the edges, so after wear, the bottom band has rolled up so much that the lining is all but hiding the main fabric.It looks like Enell is going to be my next stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"not true to size","review":"not the same fit as others of the same brand, model purchased the same size.

I learned from previous reviews that it's a good idea to order this a cup size down. Thanks to the Fiona, I can run and do activities with higher impact like Zumba with little to no bounce - and no pain!

A sports bra that Supports!","review":"I have been big busted and have battled looking for a supportive, comfortable sports bra for many years. I have tried dozens of them and always been very disappointed, that is until I found this one. I was a size F when I first started wearing this bra and was soo suprized by the support, even though the bra was only a size D (the biggest I could find at the time) it couldn't have suported me better. I finally felt comfortable in a higher intensity class at the gym. I since have had a reduction and now am a small D and this sports bra is still unbelievable. The size D is still a great fit and I will never stray from this brand! I am a forever lover of Moving Comfort! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bras!","review":"I love these bras, and will never wear another brand of sports bras again! The comfort, the support are unbelievable. I love that you can adjust the straps as you are running! This is very helpful on those \\"fat\\" days.

It's not perfect, I still feel like there are better bras out there. For the price though, it is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not comfortable for me","review":"I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable. They are located in the front of the bra, and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone. I have heard great things about MovingComfort, so I don't think it means their other bras are unpleasant. I just found out that this one wouldn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs big","review":"I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big. I will keep it anyway because I don't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra. I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go, then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio, but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities. The other thing I don't like is that the material is very slippery, so it is hard to fasten the hooks. On a positive note, the colors are beautiful. I got the mojito, which is a nice bright green. A lot of sites only offer basic black or white, so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a NURSING bra too!! LOVE IT!","review":"I love this baby and have 3 of them. Wore it before I was pregnant and now love it for nursing as well!! The velcro straps make it easy to drop one side down.

This bra offers no support at all! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support. All I can say is that It offers NO support at all. I can say that It is comfortable, that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch. However if you actually need support because your active, KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want. People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Support for High Impact","review":"Great fit, I do spinning 3 days a week and elliptical 2 days. This bra is tremendous. I dont \\"like to move\\" much and the clasps in the back are great for changing need of support as you lose weight.

With a 34DD (according to Victoria's Secret) chest, it's not easy to find the right support. The girls hardly move in this sports bra. They get machine washed and hung to dry and have lasted quite some time. I always ask for another on my birthday and Christmas. The Fiona offers plenty of compression and support to make it through a 10k run. I like that the straps are adjustable and the back has the hook closure for added adjustment. I've tried so many sports bras and this lives up to my needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bra Ever","review":"For bigger busted women, this is it. Instead of a razorback style, the regular bra-like straps, along with the back closure, provides a nice, snug fit. On the front of the straps, there is velcro so that you can adjust the length. In another review, a user suggested buying one size smaller in order to create a tighter fit. I did this, and while it was tighter, there wasn't enough breast coverage for my taste. I returned the C and ordered a D (my size) and the coverage is perfect. If you practice high-impact sports/activities, my suggestion is to go with an over-the-shoulder sports bra like this one for added control, versus a razorback style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great support!","review":"I have been using this sports bra for months, and love it. The straps have velcro, but after many many washings, they haven't had any problems. It fits great and really has great support. It is the most comfortable sports bra I have ever had. I am well endowed, and have had problems with every other sports bra. I am a huge fan of this product!It is pretty true to size, but if you aren't sure which size you'll land on, you might order one of each of your two best guesses. For me they both fit, I just prefer one over the other, and I ordered more in the size I preferred the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it snug and run for hours!","review":"I am a 34DD in a regular bra, which means I need a lot of support when I run. I bought this bra in a 34D and I'm glad I did--the DD would not have offered the support and may have caused the bra to \\"curl up\\" as other reviewers have mentioned. Once I've got myself installed in it, the girls aren't going anywhere. Yes, it's a bit of a uniboob effect, but that's way better than having underwires pushing into my ribs! I was so excited and amazed to find a non-underwire sports bra that I can wear to run. And it even comes in gorgeous colors in oddball sizes like mine, so I can wear it without a shirt in the very hot Texas summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Nipple Show'","review":"To start off, I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra. The material is very thin (2 layers thin). Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage. There are no 'cups' in this sports bra. Secondly, yes it does have adjustable straps, but they are velcro and fasten under the straps. I like to do a mix of excercises, but mostly cardio. I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on. It offerd moderate support, the ladies did some bouncing. I didn't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity. I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C. It had an ok fit. Not too tight, but not too loose either.(That is with it fastened as tight as it would go.) If I were going to keep it, I think a 36C would fit better. Overall, it is fine if you don't mind nipple show, a few bounces, and the velcro straps. If you want compression and minimal bounce, take a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this bra","review":"this bra is so comfortable, the straps easily adjust, and it clips in the back ( i hate having to pull over sports bras). i bought a couple more, it's even better than lululemon's redic expensive bras!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to size","review":"Seemed well built, but not true to size order bigger than you are. cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bra review","review":"This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman.

I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it, I was disappointed to find that it didn't fit well at all. I could do it up but it wasn't comfortable. Reading other reviews, I thought it would have more padding then it did. Even though my boobs were pancaked, due to the fact the bra was too small, the bra still showed headlights. The adjustable straps is a great feature but I don't think I'll be ordering this bra again in a different size."},{"rating":"2","title":"fiona fits!","review":"I won't put a video of me wearing the fiona bra with less bounce, but it's pretty great. The straps are easily adjustable and the texture is silky so it doesn't cling to your tee shirts. I own several, and love them. Its not a bounce-proof, but a significantly bounce-less bra for horseback riding, skiing, and every day wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp Melted","review":"I loved this sports bra.

The DD was very tight , uncomfortable to to wear around but provides enough support to exercise and hopefully run."},{"rating":"2","title":"good construction but STILL not supportive enough","review":"This is a nice sports bra that comes in a lot of different colors. The coolest feature is probably the adjustable straps. Yes, you can use them for a custom fit - but you can also use them if you're a nursing mom!In terms of support, it seems as if I am the only disappointed customer. I really thought this would provide more support than my other sports bras, but I still have to double up with another sports bra. It is somewhat more supportive, but not enough to wear it alone. I tried tightening the straps but it didn't really change it - I'm still bouncing uncomfortably. Perhaps there is no such thing as a supportive bra in my size - I am currently a 36DDD.It would be fine for walking, maybe light jogging - but it is not good for jumproping and jumping jacks. I will keep this bra and wear it for lower-impact workouts, but I will have to double-up for anything that involves jumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great, got another!!!","review":"Not much to say other than this is one of the, perhaps THE best sports bra I have ever purchased in my life! Do not let the whole 'hooks in the back' deter you! I was skeptical at first--even thought it would be all weird and uncomfortable--definitely not for someone as active as me! But for a girl who has had to on more than one occasion wear one, two, or--yikes--dare I say more than three!!!--bras for specific events, this one is a keeper! I have had this one and used it a couple of times a week SOLELY by itself for some time now and it is still keeping things...well, up! er, in place, that is!

This bra really did the trick for me after many others failed. I am not a runner, but do some serious hiking and was very comfortable the whole time. Nothing pinches and my back and shoulders felt good even after wearing it for a whole day. This bra offers really good coverage, with no \\"spillage\\" out of the sides or top like some others I have tried. Adjustable velcro straps in the front are really nice as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"There is nothing good about this bra. It doesn't move, true. It flattens, true.

Didn't realize this one did not have underwire. Gives you a uni-boob. Thought I'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it isn't. Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics. Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob. Wish they would come up with a seamless version, though. But, this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back. One thing to be careful, though, is the velcro strap adjustments. Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bra for the price","review":"This is a pretty comfortable bra. I would like it to have a bit more support--I am a 42dd. However, it seems hard to get enough support without underwire.

While I may never enjoy running, I do love these sports bras. I own 12 of the Fiona make and they work for sprints, aerobics, half marathons, and everything in between. I'm sure they are great for marathons also but I can't run that far to test it out. They also last really well. I've had some for over three years and they still work great and look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I don't really \\"need\\" a sports bra, but when I have a workout top that doesn't have any support, I wear this. It works well. Comfortable and fits well. I am flexible in my arms, so I can hook the back just fine, but if you aren't flexible, I imagine it would be difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order a size or so smaller","review":"I actually do like this bra a lot, but the sizing is off. I have several different brands of bras that are 38 bands and they often fit rather tight, causing me to use the largest setting on the hooks. I ordered this bra under the presumption it would be like all of my others; it is not. It is a size 38 band size, but I have to fasten it on the smallest hook setting and the band is still too large. I would definitely recommend that if you buy this bra, you get it about one band size smaller that what you normally wear. One other thing is that it does not separate the 'girls' like it shows in the image, but rather gives you 'uni-breast.' Other than that it is very comfortable and I love that there are no hard, uncomfortable strap adjusters on it, only the front velcro ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"At first I really liked the bra, it definitely holds my DDs in place, but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders. I only wear it in moments of desperation now :("},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sports bra for the larger sized runner","review":"I have gotten 5 of these sports bras and love them all. I finally went a size up to (C-D) to criss cross the straps in the back (adjustable velco on front of bra straps) so I can wear them also with my racer back running shirts and this makes the fit very snug but comfortable. I have chafed a little on the longer runs (5-10 miles) under the lower bra band in the front when I criss cross the straps in the back but apply a little sports glide on my skin before the run and problem solved! The Fiona Sports Bra in my opinion is one of the best made support sports bras on the market that is both comfortable and well constructed to last. Almost a complete no bounce bra with soft and wide straps that don't dig in or pinch and moisture whisking is excellent even on long runs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"holds me comfortably","review":"At some point in my 30's I started paying a bit more for a bra. I don't like paying for a product that isn't seen - but this one is worth it to me. So far, I've bought 3 pairs and I'll probably buy more when they wear out. I run about 30 miles a week. I have a C cup, and this works really well to keep me comfortable. Excellent support with minimal movement and no squashing. The two layer construction in front make this a bit warmer than my other moving comfort bras. That's been fine through the winter, but may be an issue in the summer. I found some in last years model for less - so you might want to look around a bit when buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a decent sports bra....","review":"As a 36 DD, I was thrilled to see that there was a high impact sports bra out there for big chested women that had great reviews and I bought it hoping that this would be the bra to stop my chest from bouncing everywhere. While the bra does support me, I wouldn't say it is the most supportive. For me, this bra would be great for low impact exercise (like yoga, pilates, etc), because it keeps me in place. But I would not recommend this bra for high impact exercise unless you wear another bra with it. I ordered the Maia as well and when I put it on top of the Fiona, the support was perfect and there was minimal bouncing. So overall, I would say that this is still a decent sports bra because of the price (much more affordable vs. the Enell), its comfortable and the bra runs true to size, but I wouldn't count on this bra to be a high impact one if you are big chested."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST...the PERFECT bra!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this BRA! I have a fairly large chest for my size and I have recently gotten into running. I noticed that it was hurting my back and the other bras were so hard to get on and off that it made it difficult when I was running relays to change them. This bra still gives me the same support but without the headache of getting it on and off! I would give it five stars but I don't like how the holes around the straps are not really reinforced with strong stitching or something to make them a little stronger so I do worry that with the amount i use this how long it will be able to hold up...but it has been over a month...almost two of every other day use and is still doing well...we shall see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great support","review":"I love this bra.

It doesn't have underwire, I had total uniboob. The band at the bottom wouldn't stay put, it kept rolling up a bit. I bought a 38C, the same as I wear in the Maia, but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering. I may try wearing a regular bra underneath, but I never do that with the Maia. I wouldn't wear it unless my other two aren't clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as expected from good reviews","review":"I figured this HAD to be a great bra with all of the glowing reviews from other busty ladies, but it failed to deliver.

I have run, done other cardio, weight trained, etc in this bra and don't have to worry about jiggling all over the place. I also don't have to wear two bras at the same time anyone, one works fine.

Harsh but accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"so,so","review":"I can't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head, in fact,not as good.

The book's title and look were appealing to his pre-teen sensibility, and he was totally willing to sit down and read it cover to cover. He even was inspired to take a film editing class, and he seems to understand now that making movies takes more than filming your friends playing a video game or something dumb.This is not a particularly advanced book, or one that would be necessary for a child who is really focused or self-starting.

I think it was very terrible to choose such a horrid book. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"It probably reads better in print. The audio has a juvenile intonation. Not recommended for in- car use if you tend to fall asleep at the wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been a series of articles in the New Yorker","review":"This material would have been perfect as a series of four very interesting articles in the New Yorker. Unfortunately it was combined (under a theme that was a bit of a stretch) and over-expanded to fill the pages of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Horrible Result","review":"Mr Pollan had a great idea for a book--evolution of 4 different species of well know plants from the plant's perspective as influenced by humans. There's about 30 pages of good information to this end. The rest is horribly long and painful unrelated tangents that he clearly enjoys writing about, but have absolutely nothing to do with the subject. For instance, in covering apples he talks for freggen ever about John Chapaman, aka Johnny Appleseed. Who cares about Appleseed's sexual frustrations with a potential 10 year old bride??? Who cares about his love of sleeping in hollowed out logs, or on the snow if sleeping in the log would disturb some insects??? If you're ridiculously bored and don't mind reading about random garbage you might like this book. If you're looking for enlightenment on this subject or like a well executed book, don't even think about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"I got a library copy, so I'm really glad.Pollan has the amazing ability to go from Point A to B through the most circuitous route imaginable. I did borrow it because a friend recommended it, and, I do like reading books in the popular science category. But this one would have done much better, in my opinion, with a lot of editing. Those who've read it and not liked it will agree that Pollan keeps repeating himself, and he keeps sidetracking on sidetracks. Apollo, Dionysus, Apollo again, Dionysus again. WE GET THE POINT. It certainly doesn't help if you keep repeating yourself. This is what happens when authors try to write poetically without paying heed to subtlety; metaphors get stretched, the writing becomes ponderous and unbearable.Pollan could write an abridged version, without TOO MUCH of the flowery language, and I think I might actually like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I read this book over a weekend, and found it thoroughly enjoyable. The author does have a distinctive style, chatty with a tendency to go off on tangents. Not to everyones taste but I liked it.Some reviewers have noted that the science could be more rigorous. That is what pubmed is for, this is pop-science, written by a journalist, and one is of the better offerings within the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"An \\"ethnography\\", if you will, of these four plants. A must read for gardeners, eaters, anthropologists, and historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book!","review":"Here's a book you can enjoy on many levels. It's filled with facts about plants and their relationships with Man, and it reminds us that plants use Man for their own survival as well.Beyond that, it actually touches on the meaning of life, and helps to connect all living things in your mind. It's one of those books that you'll keep thinking about long after you've read the last page. It's one of the best books I've read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Botony Very Interesting","review":"This is a great book, that goes very well with the other books Michael Pollan has written (In Defense of Food and The Omnivores Dilemma). A little different style from those two, as it takes the view from the plant, rather than our view of the plant. Great look at how the plants listed in the book (apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes) actually have a hold on us, as opposed to the other way around.Great book, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in botany, gardening, organic food, or anything else related to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, great read!","review":"For anyone who interested about the way that humans are changing plants and agriculture to \\"better meet our desire\\" this is the book to read. For a term paper I wrote on GMOs, I was especially inspired by Pollan's chapter on the Potato. It is a great book, very interesting, and very fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy this book.................","review":"I am not a botanist.Yet. But the study of evolution is quite an exciting journey, made more exciting by the mind melting,eloquent ideas posed by Mr. Pollan. Bought the audio book version, and I can't stop listining to it. From the story of Johnyy Appleseed, to Holland in search of the history of Tulips, the Amazing Marijuana Plant, and the control of the Potato. Seemed random to me. Not any more. Incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Louis Zukofsky to Michael Pollan","review":"This book is stunning! Imagine that the end of the chapter on the apple made me slightly weepy. Mr. Pollan can write! This book is seemingly researched with care. The approach is inventive, the tone often funny, the descriptions lyrical. Mr. Pollan could use an editor to cut down on some redundancies though, and it seemed to me that Mr. Pollan somewhat loses sight of his thesis in the last chapter on the potato, but the information therein makes up for this slight glitch. Too, at first I struggled with the many personifications that pepper this book, which seem to indicate an anthropocentric assumption at the heart of the text. But in the end, it seems to me that Pollan is arguing for a kind of up-dated Objectivist philospohy, rather like the one developed by the poet Louis Zukofsky, a philosphy that we would as a culture do well to revisit. This is a very compelling book. I intend to teach it in some of my upcoming courses."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are the world","review":"Pollan's book is a vivid reminder of how intricately human society is woven into the ecological framework of the planet and in particular that of plants. His descriptions of how our societies have affected and been affected by just four plants opens up a series of thought-provoking questions to mull over the next time you find yourself in a garden, at the dinner table, or taking a walk outdoors. It's written with sensitivity towards those he disagrees with, and this gentle touch makes the story he's relating much more effective at prompting you as reader to engage. The weakest part of the book is the chapter on Tulips, but that is hard to criticize since the chapters on apples, marijuana and potatoes are so good.Read this Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"A book club selection, and one of my favorites. This book is so much fun, so informative and entertaining. One that I recommend over and over again, becuase it so unique and so accessible. And I used 'so' a lot! Think sow seeds, ha.Apples, potatoes, marijuana and Tulips! I will admit I would have enjoyed learning more about cocoa...we think we humans wield so much power.A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype?","review":"This book needed severe editing to remove redundancies. His point of view is eye-opening, and could have made a fascinating article in The New Yorker magazine. Time and again in each chapter, the author repeats the same anecdotes and snippets of information. His editor should be ashamed. I am irritated to have wasted time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuggets of information buried in an avalanche of opinion","review":"Michael Pollan had a great idea, but the finished product just does not live up to its promotion. Much of this book is filler material. He takes four plants and gives different historical perspectives on them, some more successfully than others. Perhaps the least interesting for me was the chapter on Tulips. The most interesting was his final piece on the potato.Would I buy the book again? No. Would I recommend it?Only if you are prepared to be bored by about half the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information","review":"Started out liking the chapter on Apples, less the next and so on. It seemed like I was getting the same story in each chapter only more elaborate and wordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal","review":"I could describe this book as science or history, but I think I'll go with poetry. It's the sort of thing you'd read when you feel like your life hasn't contained enough appreciation for the sublime. It's wicked interesting, but the stuff you learn along the way is more of a substrate on which Pollan creates an expressive work worth admiring for its own beauty. Can't recommend enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by Pollan","review":"I recently finished Botany of Desire and Pollan's more recent Omnivore's Dilemma. Both books are full of great factual information about what we eat, the implications of doing such, and the forces of nature that bind us tightly with other plants and animals. I loved both of these books. It opened my eyes to so many things that were both enlightening and, at times, frightening. Even though the content of both books is full of factual information, Pollan communicates it in a fashion that makes for an enjoyable read. I suggest getting them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Sweet, Insightful","review":"I was continuously amused and enlightened about many things in this book; suffice it to say I dog-eared quite a few pages as I wanted to go back to re-read certain passages for the perspective, perhaps for the phrasing, or for the knowledge.Humans certainly have the desire and the ability to bend nature, but a good lesson learned in this book is to let nature be itself, even as you make it do your bidding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary History","review":"Michael Pollan is a journalist, a plant-lover, and a curious man. The combination of these results in some brilliant and enthralling prose on the human relation to plant life in a way that is new to the non-biologists in the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"The book's research is rather questionable. Too simple. Too limited in sources. Too much of the author's own idea or guess work. If you read it as a story book then it is not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"I read this after a review and it was spellbinding. The auther writes about the plantworld in near magical terms. The last chapter on potatoes should be required reading for all students. Amazing book and I've already bought two and gave them away as gifts to like minded friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, did I learn a lot!","review":"Obviously, I still have a lot to learn. I found this book completely fascinating and anything I wasn't sure about I looked up and anything I became interested in I investigated. Great stuff! This was recommended reading for college biology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pop Science","review":"Although this book deals with come scientific issues, it does so in a very accesible manner. The basic topics presented are how and why certain plants have been domesticated by man. The twist is that the why covers not only the why from the human point of view, but also that of the plants. As the book points out, not all plants are willing to be domesticated (the common example for this is the oak tree), but those that are have generally enjoyed an abundance unknown by other plants.Four case studies are presented, with each of them illustrating a different reason for man's domestication of plant species, and a particular species that represents this desire. I found the first (Desire: Sweetness;Species: Apple) and last (Desire:Control;Species: Potato) to be the most interesting in the book. The last one in particular raises some important issues and tough questions regarding genetically modified food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Ideas, Boring Read","review":"The Botany of Desire presents an innovative way to think about how plants have propagated. The ideas are fresh, but, unfortunately, too few for an entire book. This subject matter would have been better served in essay format. The history presented about the tulip, rose and potato is fun and interesting--worth the read in these parts, even though one has to wade through the interspersed philosophical musings of the author that are reiterated one too many times in (dare I say it?) overly-flowery language. The self-deprecating, blushing tales of pot smoking experimentation were silly and not worth the time to read. Honestly, I cannot recommend this book unless you want to be bored most of the time while reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor.","review":"I expected good things from this book, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. But Pollan's argument isn't new, and it isn't persuasive. Most of it seems like a contrived effort to come up with a book. I think I could forgive even that if it were more entertainingly written. Would I buy this book again? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"Pollan's book is unexpectedly dull reading.

Experienced gardeners and garden book fans may be disappointed with this book--I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fell short of my expectations.","review":"Pollan's prose was simply dull and his points were predictable. On the whole I found that the book lacked originality. Would I buy the book again? To be perfectly honest, no, it came up short of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing.","review":"When I saw this book so well-reviewed , I decided to check it out. As someone who's read a lot of reflective garden books, I found Pollan's prose weak and lacking in much real service. He wrote nothing new, nothing that surprised me. I wouldn't buy this book again or recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-botany","review":"In view of the many reviews already out there I need not add much. I read my way through the Apple chapter, which was readable, but quite light on facts (heavy on wordy prose).I tried to read the Tulip chapter but soon felt quite uneasy. On page 69 I hit:\\"To induce flies into its inner sanctum (there to be digested by waiting enzymes), the pitcher plant has developed a weirdly striated maroon-and-white flower ...\\". It is hard to imagine that this is the result of mere ignorance, and not to suspect actual intent to misinform people on plants (and botany)?Maybe some time I will try to read the chapter on Marihuana, which should be mostly about the history of its use and thus safe in the hands of (even) Michael Pollan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undesirable","review":"It's the polar opposite of good writing.

Evolution is about the random mutations that occur and the survival of the fittest.

That is unfortunate because the topics are and should be very interesting and easy to write about. As other reviewers have said, the author talks about 4 plant species: the apple, marijuana, the tulip, and the potato. The information on the does not run that deep - at times it seems like he did some Google searches and cobbled together the facts into a story written at a middle or high school level. To make matters worse, interspersed within the information on these topics Pollan has inserted many annoying personal thoughts. I eventually found myself identifying and skipping these paragraphs. It is as if he didn't think the plants themselves are interesting enough on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little book","review":"Two mismatched heroes.

Not only are there a variety of recipes from wartime Britain, but there are also photos of models in a recreated 1940s setting partaking of them, which is a cool touch. Some of the ingredients may be head-scratching to Americans, particularly sago and sultanas, but just go with the flow (Hint: Tapioca can be substituted for sago, and sultanas look a lot like golden raisins).

The speakers are what you'd expect $5 speakers to sound like. 500 watts is an total misnomer. Its more like 15W-20W or about what you'd expect out of a $30 boom box. When playing a cd or dvd, there's no display on the front to know what track you're on. It only displays \\"DVD/CD\\" or FM/AM station. The rear wireless speaker has a constant buzz. when you turn it on or off there is a loud \\"crack/thump\\" as the amplifier turns itself on. Its very light, and seems very cheap. Everything from the cables to the speakers are the cheapest you can possibly get.What's good: ease of setup (everything is color coded). The video part of a movie is good. Having 5 sources of sound in a room is nice.Overall, I'm torn.

I can't decide if i like this one or Angels Cry better. Both have awesome guitar and catchy melodies. Everyone thinks that Holy Land is their best, but it didn't do that much for me. song 2 on it was awesome, but the rest just wasn't heavy enough for my taste. I normally like really progressive stuff, so when i heard that Holy Land was their most progressive, i assumed i would love it. not true. Anyway, these guys are at the top of the metal guitar list... they just rule! Much better than other power metal guitarists, and on par with prog gods Petrucci and Romeo (almost) just get this cd and angels cry, phenominal guitar work. The rest of the band is awesome too.

A lot of people had said to me prior to buying \\"Fireworks,\\" that it's their best to date. So this is it? This is as good as they get. Not impressed. Yes, it's melodic. That's abou tit. Vocals are incredibly weak, if there is a bassist in the band he didn't apparently play, and the drums are horrible. Now, the band may be good and their engineer and producer suck, but I really doubt it. Of all the power metal and melodic metal in my collection, this doesn't even compare. Angra needs to look to other bands for inspiration. A few to mention would and should be, MANOWAR, IRON MAIDEN, ICED EARTH, HAMMERFALL, GAMMA RAY, HELLOWEEN, IRON SAVIOR, GRAVE DIGGER, AND RUNNING WILD. It still seems Sepultura is still the best from the South Americas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a Classic!!","review":"I presently only own two Angra albums at this point (this one and Rebirth), and I only have one thing to say...\\"THANK GOD FOR EDU FALASCHI!!\\"Fireworks should be a great album but it is marred by the horrendous voice of Andre Matos. The best thing Angra ever did was loose this guy. The songwriting is strong and the guitar playing is exceptional but each song is held back from being a classic due to the off-key and amateurish wailings of the lead singer.The production is awefully flat as well (surprising since Chris Tsangarides handled the production duties!) This kind of music desperately needs strong/dramatic production to work correctly and the mix on this one is not up to par.HOWEVER...the album does grow on you after repeated listenings, so if your a fan of the band you may want to pick it up for the musicianship. Just imagine what this album could have been if Falaschi handled the vocals instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsory sci-fi reading!","review":"This is, frankly speaking, one of the most underrated jewels of science fiction collection that I have ever read.

If you buy this product, be ready to use your TV remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote. In addition, the user interface of the player is horrible - much worse than my old Sony. I returned this the day after I bought it and exchanged it for the Sony SLV-D370P, which includes a remote to control the TV and has a great user interface.

Bryan Smith's fixation on the Goth character, Melinda, and his attempts to convey sexual tension are embarrassingly poorly written.

This album and the others by this singer are not opera, nor are they classical. This singer is pop. I have held my tongue and waited for this trend of popera to pass, but it isn't and I'm vexed at the comparison of singers such as Ms. Jenkins to legitimate voices.If you are looking for some truly exceptional music by singers who have actually been on stage in an opera outside of grad school, try Stephanie Blythe, Vivica Genaux, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, Ewa Podles and more I'm certainly forgetting.

I have found her voice to be quite pleasant. I'm not usually into mezzo-soprano stuff, but I knew there was something special about Katherine's voice. This album is very beautiful; I'm glad she finally released in the US. My favourite songs are \\"House of No Regrets\\" and \\"Song to the Moon.\\" Many of the songs on this album have been sung before by other artists, but Katherine puts her special edge on them to make them sound different. What I found to be odd is that Katherine's voice reminds me of Charlotte Church sometimes. Must be a Welsh thing. But really, Katherine has set herself apart from any other artist. I don't think I could compare her with anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but why get rid of 3 of the songs that are on the UK CD","review":"This is a very good CD.I do not have the US version but I do have the UK one and this version does not have three of the songs that are on the UK one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous addition to my music library.","review":"To one particular negative review by another customer, my advice is to NOT use specific criteria, as if you're weighing a heifer at the county fair. If the technique basics are there, each singer produces to her (or his) capacity, and her own very specific vocal expression. The only absolute criteria is if the singing results in your personal pleasure. I am very happy to have added her to my music collection. She fits well into my playlist of classical divas. She also fits well into my palysist of mainstream divas, and that is an accomplishment not attainable by some of the top classical divas.Philip Reavis"},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"Voice is OK, but not a concert-opera class mezzo.

At this point you either loved thenm to death or you hated their guts. No band goes from alternatve rock to hard core metal but this band managed to somehow pull it off and with style. From the crazy opening of the now classic \\"King of the Closet\\" to the beautifully structured epic \\"Nothing but Skin\\" this album mixed all the harmonic elements of their first album with a new sound that caught everyone by surprise. It's light years better than \\"Silence\\" and matched only by the sonic velocity of \\"About a Burning Fire\\". The bonus tracks are a real treat and the bonus cover art makes this one really worth getting.

But if I ever had to listen to someone scream for almost an entire album, it would definitely have to be Christian Lindskog. The guy's amazing, as are Simon, Tomas, and Marcus. I bought this album with big expectations because I loved \\"Silence\\" so much, and though it took a while, they were well and entirely fulfilled. \\"A Thought Crushed My Mind\\" somehow manages to combine hardcore with melodic, and the result is pleasing.

Tish decided that she was going to step up and take action and that's what she did. She went a lawyer and told him what had been going on and he told her that since she was old enough to press charges she could. The end of the book wasn't very good. It just stopped.

There is plenty of blame for all sides but the only blame ascribed by the Likud Literary Legions is to Israel's left wing activists and critics.

The thing with Woody is that he'll have you laughing out loud like a fool one sentence and the next he's got you staring off into space thinking, \\"Yeah, yeah...that's true.\\" Conversations with Death, the supernatural explained, the story of one man's pathetic attempt at a life of crime, and the single best description of sex I've ever read- \\"...executing with total emotional commitment the absurd choreography of human passion,\\" it's all in there. I was always afraid of Woody Allen because I thought you'd have to be Jewish to get it. Rather, you'd have to be dead not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best buy yet!","review":"A wonderful book, full of writing that only Allen is capable of giving us: he is an iconic figure, his movies are legendary, and his wit is superb.

While some parts are not as well animated as others, they tend to keep it well rounded and stunning.Do not be fooled into thinking this is some cutesy cartoon for kids, with adorable little kill-me-now pokemon and Sailor Moon. (Who, by the way, are solely responsible, along with their Digimon brethren, for the anti-anime mood in most districts.) This is DISTURBING. People BLEED. People drink what the other people are BLEEDING. VERY heavy anti-christian messages, as well as exposing the more fanatical side of our religion.Very good anime, I reccomend it for the more strong stomached."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Death of a true genius","review":"I personally love this DVD, this series, this whole new style of the anime style that has been emerging lately, but if your an old time anime lover like me you might not want to start out with this series, its cruder, more violent, better written and deff better drawn than all of the older style animes, but if your looking for action packed, balls to the wall, fight scenes and morose speculations of a dark time then this is your DVD my friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Only 3 Episodes?","review":"Hellsing is without a doubt my favorite anime series I have ever seen. Beautifully illustrated, amazing plot, and the most bad-ass protagonist outside of Vampire Hunter D. My only gripe with the DVD sets is they only include 3 episodes each. Why? I mean, 3 half-hour episodes can hardly take up an entire DVD, so I guess they went heavy on the speicial features. Either way, I'd rather have more Hellsing than special features. Oh well, I'll be buying this one anyway...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get IT Straight!!!","review":"Please edit your review.The name isn't Arucard!!!It's AlucardDraculaalucarDSheesh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to My Expectations","review":"I would first of all like to say that I have read the manga for this anime, and found it very enjoyable. Upon liking it so much, I decided to try out the TV series. I rented this first disc, and was sadly disappointed. From the high quality of the manga that I experienced, I was hoping for the same quality from the DVD's. But I was sadly disappointed. The plotline was askewed and confusing, and this is coming from a person who already knew it. The animation itself is not nearly as detailed and interesting as that of the manga, and the characters, especially Alucard (not Arucard, or Arukard) are more annoying than cool, which is how they are in the manga. It is my recommendation that this anime be left to the books, and not made into television, for this representation is misleading in terms of quality. For those of you out there who like the idea, but not the presentation of this DVD, I strongly recommend the manga as an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a fan of anime but....","review":"I'm not a big anime fan but every so often I get talked into watching a series. This one is a good deal of fun. It's not half the head trip of Lain or Akira it's just a good fun series. The art work is nice. Unlike many American audiences I don't mind the use of still frames and there are a few. There's blood and sex and violence and one of the main characters smokes. If you've read Dracula anytime recently or are up on Catholic Protestant debate in England it's good for a giggle. Rumor has it that a season two is in the works hopefully to land on fan servers within the next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"The first episode was amazing, it kind of reminded me of Resident Evil because of all the ghouls running around. The music was something new and left me wanting to hear more. The animation was the only problem. In the first episode, the animation was flawless, it almost looked like movie quality animation, but in the 2nd episode the character animations got sloppy. Their faces and hands werent drawn as nice and it looked choppy at times. Ive noticed this is other anime shows in the past too, and I wish they hadnt done that here.The dubbed version of the show was pretty good except for Arucards voice, it just didnt sound as creepy as the original. And I dont know why they thought it was necessary to redub the sounds that the ghouls made. If you decide to get this, watch the subtitled first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vash meets Vampire Hunter D","review":"Here is a series that...like Cowboy Bebop and TRIGUN...bleeds cool.

Andrew Lambert discusses in this excellent book how the ship was designed, how she was (accidentally) preserved by being used as a jetty at a Royal Navy fueling facility (!), and how several years of hard work in Hartlepool restored her to her original grace. The book is exceptionally well illustrated with period and modern photographs, as well as line drawings and plans, and will appeal to anyone interested in a generally overlooked period of naval history, when sail and wood were giving way to steam and steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tetra Koi Vibrance","review":"This is such a convenient way to keep my Koi fish HAPPY!

Central Rain', and Peter Gabriels 'Red Rain' from So. The balance on the this live recording leaves something to be desired (ie, for maximum listening pleasure start with the volume way up then gradually turn it down), but it really is a heart-wrenching masterpiece.

Everytime they touch an album it turns into pure gold and that's what hapened this time. The 3rd installment in the Northern Exposure series is defintely the best. With tracks like Sasha's own \\"Belfunk\\" and Jayn Hanna's \\"Lost Without You\\", this CD makes you want to either dance or just lay down and listen to the wonderfulness of this masterpiece. Even if you don't like Sasha and Digweed, buy this CD for \\"Losr Without You\\"- not yet released in the US. The songs flow very well and keep you in a trance for over an hour. If you're new to this genre and are wondering what CD would be good for your money, buy this album and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good body grooving chiller","review":"This is the first trance CD i've gotten and i'm now wondering why I waited so long. I haven't listened to many DJ mixes either but this is by far the best I have heard yet. Sasha & Digweed really have a good ear for mixing cuts. It really changes my view on the artistry involved in DJing and how it's possible to express oneself using others material. This CD works both out on the dancefloor and to chill. In fact it may be moreso of the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Progression into Greatness","review":"although i haven't heard this compilation in awhile, i still think Sasha and Digweed are top notch DJ's. both Cd1 and CD2 can be a little repetitive at first listening. but once you get into it, i realized that perhaps the best trance songs i've ever heard could possibly be Space Maneovres and Sasha's own Xpander (always has been a fave song of mine). also, tracks 7-9 on CD2 are pretty mind boggling good. I feel that Sasha is a far better DJ than Digweed, however, but once they collaborate together they create some pretty fantastic melodies. i recommend this compliation as a sit back and become entranced set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flat for me","review":"I'm not a trance guru, and sorry to drag down the rating on this album by being the only one to complain about this album. For me this two-CD set is too flat. No ups or downs. no climax. Maybe it'd be good for ambient music, but my feeling was that you could almost lay an another set of mix on top of it. It was that flat for me. I liked the \\"Trance: State of altered consiousness\\" although I have to agree with others that it contains some cheesy mix. I loved Sasha's \\"Expander\\" and expected similar taste from this mix, but I guess I was wrong. Anyway, I was looking for more climax and \\"themes\\", or even some melodies, but this album was just not my type."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZINGLY MIXED S&D ARE MASTERS OF MIXING TOGETHER.","review":"Sasha and Digweed are two of my favorite DJ's.

I find their stuff to be overblown, junked out new age pap. Which is not far from how I feel about the first disc on this album. But the second. Oh, my. Tracks 1-8 are out of this world. Deep, moving, and they make you want to get up and move. Very, very impressed with that cut, and so happy to have it. I've listened to it countless times and I still shiver and shimmy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Trance cd PERIOD","review":"The northern exposure serious with Sasha and John Digweed is spectacular. I don't believe any other modern trance works compare. This however, stands out the most. Both discs (one from sasha one from digweed) are incredible and will have you dancing around your house.

This CD unfolds what makes the best Djs in the world really buzz. The music lacks the hard hit and tweaks that are otherwise the very heart of trance music, but that in all makes the collection of music wizardry a class beyond compare.

Enjoy this...a definite classic from the legedary jocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly amazing","review":"This album was one of the first trance compilations I had ever heard. At the time, I found it mildly interesting. As my appreciation for the genre has grown (tremendously!), I've found that there's much more to it than I had ever thought.In particular, I now consider (most of) disc 2 to be the very definition of progressive trance. It's not the dark, groovy prog of James Holden's Balance 005, or the floaty prog of Northern Exposure I: North. From the middle of \\"Pure Frictions Groove\\" through \\"Rock Stone,\\" you can put your headphones on, drift off into a meditative trance, and let the consistently evolving beats guide you deeper as the melodies become part of your very being.It takes time to grow on you, but when it does, it will become very special indeed.

Those melodic, complex compostions are very subtle and deserve to be listened to over and over. So what the hell happened this time? Sure, there are some decent tracks here but so much of this collection is rediculously repetitive and annoying that I can not understand why so many people liked this CD. The reason why the first two installmets are so good is that they use elements of many different styles ranging from New Age to fast intense techno similar to the likes of the Chemical Brothers, Fluke, Uberzone, etc..

It's all just very real, which is something I love in an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sultry and a Great Listen","review":"Rachel Yamagata is truly a rare talent. The most notable thing about this all too short EP is her voice. Imagine a combination of Fiona Apple and Alanis Morisette (without the quirks) plus a healthy does of smoky nightclub. The instrumentation is subtle and compliments the music perfectly. There's some accoustic piano and guitar, the occaisional programmed drum kit, but it's all sparse and doesn't take away from the striking vocals, strong songwriting and achingly emotional lyrics. I think Rachel is an artist with long-term potential and will be with us for years to come. This EP is especially recommended for fans of John Mayer, Fiona Apple, Macy Gray, Etc. You will love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yamagata","review":"I ordered this for my son because he plays the cello and also likes Indy music.

I find that there's just enough substance on this to keep me coming back to reiterate the messages. Of course two songs on this made it to the album, but they are different versions and these are more subdued and minimalistic so they're interesting to listen to. \\"These Girls\\" is a great and somewhat cynical song that works well off of the tragedy in \\"Would You Please\\" right before it. Vocally, her maturity is right on for this, but the music has the electronic influence Beth Orton and others and it doesn't really sound as if Rachael is comfortable with that, which is the only reason that I'm giving the Ep four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it's pretty good, but not genius. I think she'll have plenty of time to show us that later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fan/fellow musician","review":"I really love the songs on this albums - really strong collection of tunes about love lost and living in the urban world. At first listen, I was pretty puzzled by the rhythm tracks with electronic drums and bass on many of them but the strength of the songs carries thru. \\"Along for the Ride\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire\\" are very strong and only Danny could have come up with the brilliant satire and stinging rebuke of \\"Just Like Eva Braun\\".

It was a blast from \\"Back in the Day\\", but wonderful to see a very youthful Lynn Whitfield and Alfre Woodard!!!

Some of us who have never owned a diamond, no matter how small, and can't afford the Major bling, appreciate this type of convenience. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and informative","review":"I finished reading this book very quickly. Every story was intense and captivating. The book was enjoyable for entertainment value alone, but it also contains critical information about personal defense.Ever wondered what it was really like to be attacked by someone trying to kill you? These are stories of people who lived to tell the tail. Many potential murder victims only survived because they had a loaded gun handy.On a personal note, my brother wasn't as fortunate as many of the people in this book. He was returning a tape at a well lit video store on a Sunday night when he was kidnapped by four thugs. They had his car, his cash, and all his possessions, but they murdered him anyway. Apparently just robbing people had become boring to them. They are now in jail, but I often wonder if my brother would be alive today if he had a gun with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great true crime book with a twist - People defending themselves!","review":"This is a great book. There are lots of good reviews and descriptions here ... but I just wanted to add my positive review. The reality is frightening ... like a good true crime book should be. Wish they would make it into a movie showing how real people in many cases saved their own lives by having a gun. Or, would love a sequel to this book - The Best Defense Part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Charles J. Sykes of Gun Control","review":"Purchase this volume in volumes! Give as gifts to friend and foe alike. You will have made a wise investment. I am cheering at the top of my lungs for this book. Way overdue and impeccably researched.For another author who can preach to the choir and still make it fresher than a morning in April, read Jerry Furland's novel about the near future, \\"Transfer-the end of the beginning\\".Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good bathroom reading","review":"It's alright, some fairly straightforward tellings of real-life crises by an excitable writer.Sometimes the embelishments made presumably for the reader's sake tend toward the melodramatic.But if you believe the cops are here to protect you (they mostly take reports) then you need to read this and things like it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final word","review":"I feel this is the final word in the gun control debate.

Easy to read and fast-paced. The author gives you a series of true stories about how \\"average citizens\\" defended themselves with weapons. There's not a lot of preaching, and again, this is a very fast paced book. This makes it exciting to read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's interested in self-defense. It's not heavy on gun technology and thus is appropriate for any type of reader.

It is vitually useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The package is cooler than the software...","review":"I tried to do basic drawings and quickly became bored with the steep learning curve and kludgy interface. Features galore, but like one of those dog turds that gets the white fuzz on it - pretty on the outside but still stinks on the inside.Best testimonial: I returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware - limited to three floors","review":"I own a small city house with four floors plus basement and purchased this software to plan the renovation. Was very disappointed when I fould out the limit of three floors. This limitation is not mentioned on the website or any description of the software.Later remark: Gosh, I wonder why this review is marked as unhelpful by over 50%. I genuinely intended to provide important information for home-owners with several floors. In my opinion it was very inapproprate of the software provider to omit this aspect, and therefor I gave a 1-star ranking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Difficult!!!!","review":"I'm usually a quickstudy when it comes to learning software and yes, I do read manuals. This program takes too much out of me and the book is no help. I made some progress but found the preview or \\"liveview\\" was terrible. Laying floor or ground cover was also more trouble than it was worth. There are no tutorials and I also ended up with graph paper and pencil. Save your money. But at least someone is addressing the Mac crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Program!","review":"I used 3D Home Architect for years on a PC, going back several years. I finally found this program for the Mac, and was hopeful, but the program is useless. The interface is not intuitive, and nothing seems to work the way it should. Even simple features like copy and paste seem to fail. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A capable but hard to use product","review":"this product has tons of features but it was not nearly as easy to use as I had hoped. The interface was confusing, the interaction methods are completely foreign to the Mac. I've been using Macs since '85 and I've used hundreds of different programs. Most have a somewhat familiar feel to them, even if you DO have to read the book to use advanced features. This one was so weird I couldn't even draw a line without reading the manual first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"Tough learning curve. Still practicing. I am pretty good with computers, but you almost have to be a computer architech to use this software efficiently."},{"rating":"1","title":"WLG","review":"Pretty much a worthless piece of software. Kitchen design does not work, and trying to rotate anything takes way too many steps. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought It, Hating It","review":"I bought this because I'm trying to go \\"all Mac\\", and I had enjoyed it's PC-based predecessor. But this version, for the Mac... I get errors when I try to print a model to assemble. There's no framing editor, and no lumber estimator! Worst of all, when my architect friend asked me to export into DXF or DWG format - these are industry-standard formats - that is when I found out 1) Punch! does not export to either, and 2) no other commercial app reads \\"Punch\\" format. So frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less developed than Windows version","review":"As the other reviews have pointed out, this Mac version has turned out to be a big disappointment. After spending the money and a fair amount of time trying to figure out the unintuitive software, I learned there were virtually no construction-related tools (framing designer, etc etc). I'd consider this more a sophisticated toy than a serious house-design software. It's too bad Punch is not more honest and up-front about the limitations of this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuitive Home Design...","review":"I've used Punch! Super Home Suite for years (on a PC) so I figured the learning curve wouldn't be such a big deal for Home Design Studio. I was so wrong. Apparently by \\"intuitive interface\\" they mean you have to be a psychic intuitive in order to figure out how things work. There were some improvements made from earlier editions and definitely more features - still limited to only 3 floors though - and some things that should have been simple - intuitive even, were unnecessarily complex multi-step procedures (like the second floor automatically sitting on top of the first floor.)The short and simple of it: I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be good for PC's but worthless as a Mac app","review":"Stay away from this software. It may be a great product in the PC world but for Mac it is terrible. Little in the way of support, lacks most tools found in PC version. Common things like wrought iron fences or a tapered round or square columns aren't to be found. I don't know what else is out there but this is NOT a good choice for sure.This software needs a major upgrade right now and they should give anyone who spent good money on this version a free upgrade.Oh yeah, the support person they have monitoring the forum for this Mac Only version doesn't even use a Mac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased","review":"Recently bought the cd and was thoroughly disappointed. Same old 80's beats throughout most of the album. Only worthwhile song comes from the album's title, Savoir Aimer. Personally, I'm waiting for his \\"best of\\" cd if it hasn't come out already. I considered his live cd, but I prefer studio recordings anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sore the Next Day Workout!","review":"I thought this dvd was fast paced and a complete, sweaty workout. Almost as challenging as Tae Bo, but I did enjoy using weights part of the workout. I'm not that out of shape but boy was I sore for the next 3 days, good and challenging dvd to switch off with in your workout routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, tough on the knees","review":"This is a great workout, but not recommended for those with bad or weak knees because there are a lot of squats and plies. I work out pretty regularly, and when the weights segment comes on, I find that I get tired really quickly.This is a challenging workout, I sweat like crazy, but it does get incredibly repetitive. The sound quality isn't all that great either, Ellen's voice is kind of muffled, and one of the girls in the video doesn't stop grinning, which I found to be incredibly annoying.All in all, good workout, although sound quality could use some work. Oh, and there was virtually no ab work, other than in the 5 minute bonus workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ellen's best...","review":"As a discliple of Ellen Barrett I was fairly disappointed with this video. The moves just aren't as measured and graceful as in her other videos.It also pains me to see these fair skinned girls squinting in the sun on a beach as they work up a sweat. I think the producers thought this would somehow be soothing, but it drives me crazy.Furthermore, I did not enjoy the Conde Nast advertising. ick.Buy Ellen Barrett's \\"Crunch\\" dvd's. They're fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enjoyable and No explanations","review":"Why I don't like this video:1) Ellen Barrett doesn't explain the proper forms2) The model on the cover isn't the one in the exercise video (that bothers me, like they lied or something and she's in better shape than anyone in the video)3) Its 45 minutes long and I generally like 30 minute workouts. It could have been organized in better increments.4) The girl on the left of Ellen Barrett has a forced fake smile throughout the video. You can see her on the back of the dvd cover. Scary.5) Ellen Barrett is not very personable6) A lot of the moves do not have smooth transitions7) She doesn't give you time to learn the move. She just starts doing it without telling you how.8) This video is obsessed with HOPPING. Yes, they LOVE TO HOP in this video. And i hate hopping.For all these reasons, I will probably1) Throw away the dvd2) Donate the dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cardio","review":"I really enjoy the cardio in this workout. It really works up a good sweat. I usually do the cardio and the total body turnaround. The toning section is very challenging, but only works biceps and shoulders. It seems like too much to me. I prefer more variety when toning upper body. Altogether, I think its a great workout. I workout with several different videos and try to fit this one in atleast once a week. This is the only video with Ellen Barrett that I have and she does a great job cueing. I am very interested in working out with more of her videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low intensity work out!","review":"I've been doing this work out for about 6 months now and I love it. It has a little bit of everything...ballet, aerobics, strength training, some mat work. It may not be challenging enough for some more advanced work out enthusiasts but it's great for a \\"I have to push myself to to a light workout today\\" kind of day! Very easy to follow...Ellen is not annoying. Definitely recommend it for all but the highest fitness level exercisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Repetitive","review":"Went into this workout with full energy but after a few minutes found myself bored. There is just too much dull repetition!! It would be ok if the moves were challenging but marching on the spot gets old. Could be good for lazy workouts/ beginners I suppose..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best I've seen/done","review":"This is a reasonably good workout. It's not really instructed as well as others I have seen. For example, Ellen Barrett doesn't tell you about proper form etc, so you may do things incorrectly and possibly lead to injury. Having said that, this workout is designed to quickly burn fat and reshape your body and it will if you do it often. The scenery is beautiful again (shot in same location as her last workout). The dvd includes a 5-minute upper and lower-body \\"bonus\\" segment. You will need some dumbells for this routine. She will keep you motivated, just keep yourself safe while using your know how from other workouts, and incorporate that into this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound quality is mediocre at best","review":"I am surprised that the other reviews don't mention the mediocre sound quality. I often find it difficult to make out what the instructor is saying, which makes for some awkward transitions until I can *see* what the women are doing and then follow suit.Like some other reviewers, I thought that the workout would benefit from more instruction on proper form.Overall, however, it's a worthwhile workout for me (beginner/intermediate) and I definitely broke a sweat. For serious muscle toning, I will continue to count on The Firm since this DVD doesn't allow you to \\"heavy up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it alot!","review":"Like it alot!

It's either the right size or it's not. More importantly, the seller had this part available when none of the local fish stores in DFW did. They were fast and fairly priced. I highly recommend Marine & Reef. You can purchase from them here on Amazon or on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluebird Cafe","review":"The Bluebird Café's protagonist is clearly the island state of Tasmania and the fictional city (original and recreation) of Copperfield--although it's the depiction of the real places of Tasmania that make this book so entertaining. It uses a disjointed narrative structure similar to Illywhacker and The Beautiful and the Damned but not as expertly. In this case, the unusual structure hinders an otherwise interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant documentary","review":"Finally out on DVD, this is a terrific account of Phil's life. My only regret is that there are really no extras on the disc - it would be great to see outtakes from the interviews and better still the whole live performances which go to make up the numerous clips shown in the documentary. I don't think that there is much unreleased studio material left at A&M or Elektra but there seems to be a wealth of live performances as shown tantalizingly in this movie and readily found on You Tube. It would be great if someone were to put together an archive release of his live work."},{"rating":"2","title":"how heroes are born and return to the earth","review":"a sweet film for the uninitiated, like m'self, and comprehensive for those who knew him well. ultimately a loving portrayal of a genuine hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many \\"sound bites\\" and too few extras.","review":"I agree that this is a fine DVD about a fine person. My quibbles are these: too many short snappy sound bites (one-liners from his close friends/colleagues), butted together with other one-liners to make some point - rather than in-depth interviews (more than, like 10 seconds, I mean). Second quibble - when I see Extras listed in the menu - in a DVD like this which I think has some gravitas - I don't want just these: a text biog of the director (a mere 20 lines) + a few photos (just ten - all of Ochs) + 4 trailers of other movies. Come on!!! My expectations are: longer interviews with the main characters; longer (like, at least one full-length) videos of an Ochs performance; and some out-takes, surprise stuff, related interviews (Dylan?!?) that couldn't be used due to time constraints. Oh, and a commentary track. Very, very disappointing in that regard. Even so, I'll give it 4 stars because, as a Brit, I learned some things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune","review":"This is excellent and I would recommend to fans of Phil Ochs as well as people who never had the pleasure of seeing him live in concert to understand just how important a figure he was in the 60's.This was done truthfully and tastefully with the contributions of many family and friends, it pulls no punches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune","review":"This is a comprehensive review of the life and music of Phil Ochs. It can be a great introduction to anyone who knows nothing of Phil Ochs and a real insight to a life long admirer like me. I first heard of Phil Ochs in the fall of 1968 and have bought all of his albums, first on vinyl then again on CD including the \\"Broadside Tapes\\" which are the very raw material he recorded when he first reached New York in 1962. Phil Ochs was, in my opinion, the best and most prolific protest writer/singer ever to hit the streets of the USA. His lyrics were more succinct than Bob Dylan's and he was a far better singer. With his knowledge of written music and orchestrations, he recorded some beautifully melodic songs full of subtle harmonies and words that struck deep into the psyche of the 1960's. This programme should be used as part of the US History classes in our schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary on a dead poet","review":"If you're a Phil Ochs fan, this is a must have. I just reread his biography that was published 2 years after his death in 1978. This video painted a prettier picture of his life but glossed over his later problems with alcohol. This documentary, along with the biography, will remind you of the genius lost and the poet remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't anyone interview Sammy Walker?????","review":"Phil discovered Sammy Walker and took him under his wing during his last few years. Sammy is still alive and well in North Carolina; not that hard to find. He could've provided crucial insights on Phil's decline and the good times they shared.You'll hear Phil singing a little of Sammy's \\"Song For Patty\\" as he walks down a street clowning around, talking about Barricade Records..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumphant Farewell to the Silent Era","review":"\\"The Iron Mask\\" (1929) was Douglas Fairbanks' glorious valedictory to the art of silent film. Collaborating with director Allan Dwan and set designer William Cameron Menzies, the producer-star poured all his resources into this lavish sequel to \\"The Three Musketeers\\" (1921) - acknowledging the advent of sound with two brief talking interludes. Restored by film historians Patrick Stanbury and Kevin Brownlow from an original 35mm print (courtesy of the Museum of Modern Art), \\"The Iron Mask\\" can be seen as Fairbanks' finest achievement. However, for all its style and exuberance, the swashbuckling adventure has a melancholic tone that lends a poignant grace to Doug's silent farewell - accompanied by Carl Davis' sweeping orchestral score. For modern viewers unfamiliar with the spirit and athleticism of Fairbanks, \\"The Iron Mask\\" represents a terrific starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better book?","review":"Currently using this book in a theory class. There must be a better theory book out there. Bounces form one theory to another while covering a specific theory in a chapter.

But the film became more of a social commentary on censorship and a bunch of obscure comicbooks and their creators. I like the Golden age stuff,I was excited to see it on Netflix because of Stan Lee but this focuses too much on \\"fighting the Man\\" and the system. I am in it to see comic books not a bunch of washed up leftists spewing their propaganda from their comfy lofts in San Francisco.I prefer Stan Lee Mutants and Monsters than this. And I was Born after 1980 but I appreciate the Golden Age and not some obscure basement hippie stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This CD totally blew me out of the water. I ordered a bunch of old Eurobeat CD's from Amazon the other day, but this one was the best of the bunch by far. By the fourth song you'll be tempted to go back to the beginning and start again before you finish the CD...trust me, this is THAT good. This is money well spent if you like 80's dance music, but with a 90's remix feel to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best BBB album of all time!!!","review":"I've loved Bad Boys Blue for years, their music is awesome, just makes you wanna get up and dance, but this CD totally blew me away. Most of the remixes of their old songs are even better then the original, especially classics like Totally Miss You and I Am Your Believer. Some of the new songs are out of this world, they instantly became my new favorites. Power Of The Night is very upbeat, perfect for dancing. Can't Live Without You is not only danceable but great for listening, makes you wanna sing along. Baby Don't Miss Me is slower then usual BBB, sad and gorgeous. The rest of them are amazing too. There's not one lousy track in this album, which very few albums by other artists can claim. If you love dance music, especially European and a bit of 80's flavor, this is an absolute must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must have\\" album","review":"This album is great.

And then again, I got to watch parts of the movie here and there on tv and I finally found out the name of the movie. I was so relieved that I had to buy it. I love the comical way Andy Farmer tries hard to adjust to the country life style when he was so used to city life & I also love it when most of the town people are gathered in his living room singing Christmas carols and Andy sings \\"Joy!...\\" but is abruptly interrupted by someone in the crowd giving a quick ovation and can't finish the song.

It also has a Christmas theme and that seems to get overlooked when cable is playing holiday movies at the end of the year.Give this one a try, might surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Chevy","review":"I like all of Chevy Chase's movies but this one is classic. How goofy and funny can he be? He tries so hard to write a book and may be trying too hard. His wife, on the other hand, just gets her inspiration from a stuffed squirrel she found in an antique shop. Men normally don't like their wives making more money than they do, or succeeding when they have failed and Chevy is no exception. I love the Christmas scenes and laughed all the way through when the townspeople tried to do better than the other to get the bonus. I'm glad in the end that Chevy and his wife stayed together. I think the town will be the better for that. Hilarious.

I figured I was in trouble after the first \\"joke\\" was just plain stupid. There were a few moments where I did laugh, but they were few (Irish Setter, Dog Tail in Fireplace). About halfway through the movie, it was as if the writer forgot that it was intended to be a comedy. I don't recall even smiling, let alone laughing, during the second half of the movie, and the ending is less than comedic. The DVD was nothing special, either: no good extras or features.To sum it up, this is a movie I think you can do without.

Add to that a horrible print campaign (Chevy Chase with a cracked egg on his face), and it's not hard to see why this movie bombed. And that's too bad, because I think this is one of Chevy Chase's best movies.This is a classic \\"fish out of water\\" movie, with the twist being that it's not the fish that's bad, it's the water. Chase and his wife try to escape the crazy life of the city by moving to the country, only to find that life on the farm is not all it's cracked up to be. Think Norman Rockwell after smoking five joints!The tone of this movie is more laid back than the Vacation series and other Chase movies, but easily finds its own pace. Probably the last really funny movie that Chevy Chase made."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie to see over and over again","review":"Funny Farm is a movie I get out when I want to see something light and funny. I have watched this movie at least 25 times. It is interesting why I watch it over and over again. Perhaps it is the simple story and the pureness of the theme. Perhaps it is the lady who gets her first story published. Perhaps it is because I see myself in this movie. The only offensive part is when Chevy Chase swears saying God_____. Oh how unnecessary that was. Worth buying in this world full of awful movies and certainly better than watching television with all it's doom and gloom.

The reader is given little insight into \\"street life\\" in New York or how the \\"system\\" works against those it should be helping. There is also little characterization of other homeless. Most of all, the author spends many nights \\"crashed\\" in the offices of his employer, \\"Street News\\"-so he is not actually even homeless or even jobless.

I was expecting to learn a little bit about the lives of homeless people-- you know-- all of the suffering that they endure etc., etc. Instead, what you get here is a story about a homeless man and how he works for a newspaper. He goes on and on discussing his position at the newspaper and never really elaborates on anything else. At first, I couldn't put the book down. I was patiently waiting for some intriguing stories about life as a homeless man. Then I decided to put the book down about 3/4 of the way through. I gave up. Boring, boring, boring.

It's a fact that a country itself does not hold religious beliefs, and while there is Christian heritage, there is also Freemason heritage, strong atheistic heritage, Muslim heritage, and Jewish heritage.

Maybe it would be a fun pick-up-and-play game. Nope.The pitcher and batter both move like they're in slow motion. There are maybe 8-10 passed balls/wild pitches per game. Half the time, the AI fielders wait until a ball hits the ground before they start to chase it. The AI runners almost always wait for a ball to hit the ground before they start to run (and the baserunning in general is pretty moronic). Half of the opposing team's outs are ground balls to the pitcher. Fielding is disorienting, and there are no dives/leaps/etc. Curve balls break like 10 feet.The only positive thing I can say is that the graphics are decent for a handheld. This game isn't really worth purchasing at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"By FAR the worst baseball video game I've ever played. There's really no excuse.

They have a great club-feel to them and are perfect cruising music as well as feelgood music. The other disc, \\"Sex Drive\\" is surprisingly really good too.

Sexual themes run rampant in both of these songs (like, duh!), but it really doesn't detract from these songs. Unless you giggle at the word sex or the mere thought of it. After listening to this EP for the umptenth kazillionth time...I can't help but think of the German dance Group E-Rotic. I prefer to listen to the Euro stylings of E-Rotic, however, I am pleasantly surprised by Dead Or Alive. Some critics claim that these remixes sound alike...but they are of the same song! Well, two songs, so what do you expect!? Of course some things are alike, but I found many differences in the mixes...maybe you should listen a bit closer? I thought Dead Or Alive went out with the 80's...guess I was wrong.

This captures in real-time the process of an obsessive personality who uses marketing technique to create art - rather than using the real work of personal expression and thought. Pop culture eventually finds a way to package and sell almost everything that is creative and makes it bland and accessible to the masses.... street art apparently is not immune to such a fate. How does one define success in art? These are many of the resulting questions and thoughts one is left with at the end of the movie - excellent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN to the nearest exit!!","review":"Ostensibly a documentary about street art, \\"Exit ...\\" morphs into the story of a somewhat deranged poseur named Thierry who fancies himself a street artist after hanging out with a bunch of them.

That's part of the fun.","review":"Funny, sharply satiric documentary about the modern art world, especiallythat of the street/graffiti artists who now command hundreds of thousandsfor their work.The film started out as a documentary about street artists like Banksy, beingmade by a very eccentric unknown amateur French film-maker, without muchobvious talent. But somewhere along the way, the tables turned, and Banksytook over and made the film about the film-maker, who himself finds success(still not showing much talent) as a street artist.Endearingly weird, perhaps partly a set-up or a put on (who could know?) thisis almost like an Andy Kaufman performance piece.But along with the laughs, it has something serious to say about \\"what is art\\" andthe awful interaction between art and commerce that can drain all the art from \\"art\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant art... the camera dude is a poser sell-out tho...","review":"I thought that the french camera guy was pretty cool until the end when he turned into a huge sell out poser...

Also, actual art and the practice and experimental work that gets treated as art just because it has a name attached to it -- it's not the medium that matters, but rather the artist's intent. In the end, this gave me a greater respect and appreciation for at least a couple of artists (the people behind their brand names) who are totally conscious of the difference between their rehearsals and their art, as well as sympathy for the things that they accidentally unleash just trying to be reasonably nice people. I certainly recommend giving it a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"street art is great but someone else should have handled this material","review":"Banksy and some of the other street artists that the French guy captures on film are great and I esp enjoyed Banksy's willingness to be politically charged in Palestine nonetheless, but at the 1 hr mark when the French idiot faux raconteur tries to make his own art is when you can shut off the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally surprising plot twists that make you question the meaning of art itself","review":"Stumbled upon this on a sale through RoKu and amazon for cheap rental. The plot twists are so astonishing that the viewerfinds themselves having to redefine thier conceptual summation of the movie, so much so that a discription of the movie would inevitably be a spoiler to the full enjoyment of the film on its initial viewing. For myself, when I had to reconceptualize what the film was about it induced a meditation on what art is all about. I think this is what the filmmaker was going for.

What gives the film its edge is the bizarre lens provided by the man who videotaped the artists. It's an obsession really, but it has no goal. After he shoots hundreds of videotapes of the artists, he has no idea what to do with them.In a second twist, the videographer himself becomes a pop star, creating \\"street art\\" for sale and making lots of money at it.While Banksy and the other graffiti artists come off very well in the film, the art fans desperate to be part of the Next Big Thing come off very badly indeed.The film is thought-provoking; that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espresso","review":"A GOOD COFFEE TABLE CONVERSATION BOOK IN THE GENERAL SENSE, NOT OVERLOADED WITH DETAILED INFORMATION BUT VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espresso - Crema of Coffee","review":"Great book about espresso.

After reading it is clear that espresso is more than just coffee. The book has the complete history of how espresso was invented, the history of the machines and every thing you need to know to get a good cup with the magic crema. It also describes the complete process about the bean's travel from the tree to the cup including treatment of the raw beans, roasting, grinding and brewing. It will also advise you on how to select your own equipment and that is where it is a little to limited.

Its power is its storytelling, in that each song serves as part of an unfolding vision of the mindset of these individuals. Vocals are a screech which cannot be replicated elsewhere, and guitar work favors fast arpeggios with deliberately understated use of melody.

It is very eye catching with a rectangular, yet curvy design. Black and silver with a polyurethane strap, it is rather chunky (which I like) yet I hardly notice it on my wrist.The numbers are a stylish silver-tone, the hands are luminous, the digital display can show time, date (which I've set mine to do), elapsed time, and an alarm. Setting is a breeze, just follow the instructions in the manual. Oh, and it is water resistant to 100 feet.

Then in the early 1990s a renewed awareness of this major literary figure saw the reissuing of her work, only to have it fall back into obscurity once again. Now The Library Of America has brought her work back into print again and in a format that will insure that her fiction will continue to be available to both scholarship and the general reading public for decades to come. Volume 1: Novels 1930-1942 includes Dance Night; Come Back to Sorrento; Turn, Magic Wheel; Angels on Toast; and A Time To be Born. Volume 2: Novels 1944-1962 features My Home Is Far Away; The Locusts Have No King; The Wicked Pavilion; and The Golden Spur. Dawn Powell: Volumes 1 & 2 is a very highly recommended addition to both academic and community library literary fiction collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading","review":"This book is fantastic, probably better than Dan Brown's Da Vinci code.

A must read if you liked the DaVinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY SONG BRINGS HIGH VIBE AND MEMORIES!!!","review":"So many tracks on this album were my tunes that I used to listen and dance on those crazy high-school parties 25 years ago. After so many years it brings the memories and still puts you in the mood for another great party and makes you feel great again. Absolute must for any Italo Disco 80's era fan. By the way, great remaster worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure and Excellent","review":"\\"Rust\\" is one of those obscure, overlooked CDs that really is a true gem. It's more than a diamond in the rough because Kevin Brown takes his band of largely unknown sidemen through a great set of original tunes, kicking up the dust on some tracks and welling' up the tears on others. His excellent slide and blues guitar playing shine throughout, when he gets revved up on Write a Bible of Your Own, its hard to keep one's feet from tapping along.This solid set of blues-rock numbers may not break any new ground as far as subject matter or technique, but Mr. Brown infuses each song with emotion and graceful playing. His is a fine songwriter as well, and his wit shines on Don't Quit and Telephone tears. The one notable guest, Joe Louis Walker, trades vocals and licks with Mr. Brown on, what else, Hey Joe Louis.If for no other reason, you might want to track down a copy just for the short instrumental Sunny Side Up, which could turn your whole day around for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"no shipment","review":"Apparently they didn't have the item in stock, but never let me know anything. Hope my fish don't die before a replacement can be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Small Group Swing","review":"Until I heard this cd, I never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman. I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections (\\"Oh, Lady Be Good\\", \\"Avalon\\", \\"Shine\\" and \\"Rosetta\\" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare","review":"A showcase for Fountain's clarinet, this album should appeal more to fans of Pete than of New Orleans' music. Pete's claim that his primary influence was BG, especially the Goodman of the trios and quartets, is fully demonstated on this session. The accompaniment is swinging, crisp, and rather lean, thanks in some measure to the absence of a piano, but none of the supporting musicians measures up to the capabilities of the leader during the solos. Wonder if Pete planned it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"aroi","review":"They are good, fresh and hot as you know what. Made beloved wife smile and that makes it even better bargain.

I think this is the first one I did not give a five star rateing to. There is no police work in this book. No Carella Kling, Hawes, Myers, Willis or any of them doing much of anything. The book is all about Roger Broome who comes to the city, committs a crime and spends the whole book trying to work up enough courage to tell the police about it. Really, that is all the book is about. I would say, SKIP THIS ONE IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He Who Hesitates (87th Precinct)","review":"I actually gave up on this one. Most 87 Precinct books are very enjoyable, but I could not get into this one. I think this book must have been one of the first or an attempt to change styles by Ed McBain. This is the only book of his that I have read or partially read that I would rate as \\"I don't like\\". I have probably read over a dozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time classic","review":"I first read this book from Paladin Press about 30 years ago. It still ranks as one of my favorites. Ragnar may spin a few tall tales in the course of this book, but that is part of his charm. I am a life long hunter and fisherman (on two continents incidentally), and while I have generally tried to hew to the rules, game laws seemingly the world over are so convoluted that complete compliance is rarely possible unless you want to dance to the tune of brainless bureaucrats most of the time. When Ragnar writes of how to avoid falling into the clutches of the game warden, he most definitely knows what he is talking about. Incidentally long after the reading this book I studied law, which gave me even deeper appreciation of the wisdom of Ragnar. READ THIS BOOK. Even if you are not an aspiring poacher or survivalist, you will be entertained while learning at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information worth knowing","review":"The title of this book is misleading Mr Benson maybe should have named this Poaching to Feed Your Family instead of Survival Poaching. This is a good companion to Ragnar's Urban Survival book. There is not much information that would help you in a wilderness survival situation. If you want some wilderness survival information A good place to start is the U.S. Air Force Survival Handbook along with Wilderness Survival by Gregory J. Davenport. Professional training would be the best because these books will not teach you everything you need to know but will increase your chances by a very wide margin if you can learn what they teach. The info in this book is worth knowing just in case of hard times. All in all I enjoyed reading Mr Benson's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practicle book","review":"This book gives good information on how to trap a wide range of animals and while I doubt some of the traps work it is still a very good read.

If you are interested in hunting/poaching I think you will be greatly disappointed, although there are a few morsels inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Tinder","review":"This book contains very little information that would actually be useful in a real survival situation. If you are interested in how to procure meat in the wild this book will dissapoint you.Instead, I reccomend studying tracking and primitive trapping. Those are skills which will pay off in the woods. It is full of tall tales. If you were in a survival tiuation there is one great value in this book. It is would make great tinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional Stories","review":"The writer has a typical poachers attitude with many stories that seem to be exagerated and doubtful. Some of the techniques he boasts about are impractical. The writer attempts to say that he knows how to manage wildlife better than biologists. He knows nothing about managing wildife over an entire state. It is obvious that he would not be able to manage wildife over a small section of land either because once his poaching depletes the area he moves on somewhere else. He cares nothing about the rights of people in general and only about himself. He is no more than any other typical poacher who brags about his poaching. He is obviously under the impression that poaching without getting caught make him the great hunter. He doesn't have a cluse and unfortunately never learned to appreciate nature and the outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"sacrifices use-ability for spill-ability","review":"I anxiously awaited this product as my old reliable IBM was on it's last, last leg. After typing for several hours, I couldn't wait to return it. Wetkeys doesn't post their return policy, so I anxiously await it and will share my experience in an addendum. Here's the problem: The space key doesn't depress with the same pressure after each word. Sometimes it skips two or rarely more spaces,more frequently it doesn't register the space. The keys take more effort-to-depress than regular keyboards, so you end up with double letters too often, especially the aa. I've had to go back and deliberately maake a space between one in five words where the space bar did not register a depression. That's way too much. Finally, after fighting with this keyboard for several hourss, my fingers ache. I've never experienced aching fingers after typing before. I can't recommend this keyboard ass it stands.

There is a tremendous difference in the taste of various brands. Some have almost no 'Hoisin flavor' and some have a lot. Some are spicy and some not. To me this is non-spicy, which I like because I do not tolerate spicy (hot) foods. The 'Hoisin flavor' is mild. It tastes like sweet and sour sauce with some added 'Hoisin flavor'.

The product was not available locally, so I went to Amazon and found every item that was needed to prepare the dish. Again, because of Amazon's shipping options I was able to receive the ingredients on time for the evening of the meal. Did I pay more, yes. Did I need as much as it came packaged, no.

The selection covers almost all the songs from this era in Ultravox's history and brings back memories of listening to the old vinyl versions I've had for years. The sound quality is wonderful also. A very reasonable price for some classic post-punk/New Wave songs. John Foxx deserves more credit for his contribution to this genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultravox Mon Amour!","review":"Like the other reviewers here, I too, counted THREE INTO ONE as one of the best anthologies by the pre-Ure Ultravox. That is, until this set came along. This generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the Eno-produced \\"The Wild, The Beautiful And The Damned\\" to \\"My Sex\\" and \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\", this version of Ultravox was the missing link between Roxy Music and Adam Ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. Its influence on everything that came out of the U.K. in the eighties can't be measured. You certainly don't need all three Island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse.

The text is very interesting, but the pictures that, with no doubt, must be magnificent in color and printed form, become almost useless in b/w and the smallish size of the kindle version. Even a pdf or a mediocre color scanned copy of the printed book would be million years ahead. This is the last book reliant on pictures that I purchase in kindle format. I did'n find the option to have it returned (as I managed to do with another architectural book in kindle version I bought). I think Amazon must improve a lot the picture presentation and management for Kindle, or the format, a very practical one indeed, will become confined to literature, essays and text that don't depend on images for having a wholesome experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"17,10 USD for a CD R???","review":"I'm really dissapointed with this item!

Wanchic is a long time band member for John Mellencamp. The band's preceeding release \\"The Why Store\\" with the song \\"Lack of Water\\" showed promise and gave optimism for the future. \\"Two Beasts\\" takes it all away. Way too much is centered around lead vocalist Chris Schaffer and he is unable to carry the load. \\"No Matter\\" is really the only ear popping track with \\"Working\\" being respectable because of an excellent bridge which pops about 40% into the track. \\"Burnout\\" and \\"Two Beasts\\" are so so at best. \\"Do-Do-Do\\", \\"Who is Your Love\\" and \\"Maniac Man\\" are below average songs and though I'm sure \\"When You're High\\" would excite some, it is nothing to me but a shallow pop song.

It is well-written, well-directed, and powerfully-acted. It offers insight into the offshore, island fishing culture of the northesat coast, particularly the Maine lobster fishery. One-family, one-boat lobster fishing defines much of the Maine orientation toward self sufficiency, pride, and justice. This in not a warm & fuzzy feel-good film.

And yet you didn't need all of that the first time, just like your kids don't while you've got them sitting in front of the tv on a cold and stormy night instead of running through the house screaming and driving you insane when all you are trying to do is get some housework done.

I love this movie and is one of my all time favorites. When it was announced that a new edition was coming, I was very excited because I thougt they will improve the film. I own the 30th anniversary edition and while is not a terrible DVD is also not perfect. My first dissapointment was to know that again it was a single-disc edition. Then, I knew that the new feauterette that looked very exciting (Wizards of Special Effects) was only a way to promote Wizards of Waverly Place. Also no new restoration was added and they even cut a featurette that appeared in the previous DVD. What a shame that Disney could not put out a descent package for this wonderful film, so my recommendation is that if you already own the 30th Ann. Ed., stick with it because this new edition is not woth buying. Let's hope that maybe Disney will deliver us a strong 2-disc set in 2011 when the movie will commemorate its 40th Anniversary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the original","review":"This copy of the movie contains all the scenes that were deleted from the original movie, and they were cut for good reason.

After I read it, I went out and found Adams' and Brooks' first novel, the Unwound Way, which I enjoyed just as much.The books are pure space opera, but of the best kind. It's like all my favorite plot elements in a science-fiction adventure have been brought together and judiciously mixed with a healthy dose of originality. These books have some of the most delicious plot twists I have ever had the pleasure to be confounded by.I hate comparisons to other others, but I want to make people read these books, so I'm going to make a simplified comparison.

The music should be familiar to fans of Graceland, but on Zulu Jive it's the real deal, without nasal rhymin' Simon grafted on top. A compilation of four South African groups are included. Aaron Mbambo (with his backup girls sounding a lot like Bob Marley's) and Shoba have a rawer style that's more fun to hear, while Joshua Sithole's harmonies are better polished for radio. Rounding it out are the fast-moving instrumentals of the Rainbows. A great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best prog album of 1999","review":"Just ignore any negative reviews that you read of this album. They are probably written by people who did not listen to this album more than once, but this is a really deep album and requires more than one listen to really appreciate fully. Billy Sherwood is a great talent, much better than Trevor Rabin. He plays almost all of the instruments on this album, and has an excellent singing voice and writes good uplifting songs. I would describe the album by calling it a mixture of classic-Yes, 80's Yes, Asia, Pink Floyd, Ozric Tentacles, Alan Parsons Project, and World Trade, but that wouldn't do Billy justice. Billy does have his own sound, he is influenced by other bands but he is not a slave to them. \\"The Big Peace\\" is one of the best prog songs ever. \\"Self Made World\\" should be put in a time capsule of great 90's music. This album was never a hit, but it is a great album. Buy it and listen to it repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remember","review":"I heard the last track on this CD on Aural Moon Progressive Radio. I really liked it so I ordered the CD as soon as that song finished playing. The rest of the CD however is a bit shaky. Not a real fave. Track 4 was worth multiple plays but that's about it. The physical quality of the product was adequate - no scuffs or scratches that might have hampered its play. I really liked Billy's collaboration with Chris Squire and thought this might be an extension of that sound and there were similarities but overall it was a hard listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for review, but does not have updated $ amounts!","review":"This Kaplan audio (CD) review of Regulation section of CPA exam is in question and answer format.

These 2 items are wonderful, just keep in mind that the Kaplan audio CD does not have the updated $ amounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"We ordered this for my 13-year-old daughter. Of course she was very excited because it was pink and appeared to be a good deal since the only other review on Amazon was positive. Unfortunately three of the six tuner heads simply didn't function - they can not be tightened. When we took it to the music store to see how much it would cost to repair it the cost was about what we spent on the guitar. Unfortunately with Austin Bazaar even if they ship you a defective product you must pay the return shipping charges so as you can see we'll have to give this guitar and Austin Bazaar a one-star review. I could see having to pay the return shipping charges if we simply didn't like the color, but I can't believe I'm required to pay because they shipped us a non-functional product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm..","review":"This is my first guitar, so I wasn't expecting much. I recieved the guitar, the case, one pick, and the stand (not all that the picture shows). I expected everything the picture shows, so i emailed the company and they agreed to send me everything else. They sent a strap. I gave up after that because it was too much hassle, but that was a dissapointment. The guitar itself had funny spots of messed up (smudged?) paint on it. There was a few dings on it, but over looking that, it plays well and wasn't too expensive. (Well, they sell the same guitar for like $30 dollars without the stuff in the picture.

You used to be able to buy the wheels and the fluid separately. However, this package is like bundling a pack of 10 hot dogs with 8 rolls, and forcing you to buy them together, always. At least before you could buy an extra wheel or two before if you had fluid leftover; now I've accumulated tons of fluid that's just going to go to waste, because I can't buy the wheels separately any longer. A way to waste money buy putting it into the manufacturer's product for no good reason.

Unfortunately, I was not able to locate a cheaper alternative that did not end up costing me more when I added in the shipping. I guess if you have Amazon Prime (as I do) then this is the best option. Since one wheel fixes up to 50 disks and the cost of replacing those disks would be so much more than the $12.99 this replacement kit costs, I guess the price is worth it.A note to Digital Innovations... I think most buyers would expect to get 3 wheels for $9.99, not 1 for 12.99!By the way: The fluid is not some magic ingredient either, it's water and rubbing alcohol!

I go to an automotive store or department, then buy Wet-or-Dry type sandpaper. Number 400 grit is the fastest for this purpose, but you can get a perfect shine on the disc you're repairing if you go up to number 1000 grit. Apply water-proof glue to the old wheel, you don't have to remove the old surface. I loop the whole sheet of sandpaper around the disc, tape the edges to hold it and let it dry. Then I carefully use a razor and cut away the excess sheet of sandpaper. ALTERNATIVELY, you could first cut a thin ribbon from the sheet of sandpaper and glue it, but I find my way a bit easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel didn't fit","review":"Got this for my existing CD cleaning machine that has a worn out wheel.

Get all the Richard Thompson you can get your hands on. I know you will want to thank me later, but that won't be necessary. I saw him in concert playing solo. Having a band with him would have been superfluous. I put him up there with Stevie Ray and Jimi for guitar-playing and Dylan for lyrics. He has wit that can make you laugh one moment and an emotional wallop that pierces your heart the next. Richard has never played a false note or sung a contrived lyric. One caveat; he is not for the simple-minded or those who are into faddish music. This is time-less, near-perfect music that makes you think and feel. Thank God for Richard Thompson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very logically structured","review":"This book presents something like 50 sentence patterns. This makes things overly complex since (naturally) many of them will be related and just minor variation. To complicate things further, the author also introduces what she calls variations to the basic sentence patterns. This endless variation without a clear structure is annoying. However, you can naturally copy down all the structures and create a diagram of how they are all related by yourself. Paradoxically this will probably improve your learning, but shouldn't the book really do this?Calling it a dictionary is slightly dishonest. It is a learner's dictionary of very simple sentence patterns.

I stumbled across this album recently when it was released on Yahoo's music service. I was quite suprised that the music was drawing me in, so much that I needed to listen to it again. Here was some stirringly emotional stuff! This is not an album that you can listen to just anytime. It is mostly solemn and dark but it has a drive to it that is uplifting simply because it is so powerful. It's hard to find this style of music that doesn't sound overbearing and cheesy. Marillion manages to push very close to the edge with the dramatics but never goes overboard. It's really nice to find good music that you somehow missed the first time around. I'll have to go through some more of Marillion's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfying","review":"Marillion is really starting to amaze me. After listening to the marbles album, I thought the other albums would not come close to being excellant. well, Afraid of Sunlight is very satisfying. Their is a wide veriety of different songs here. From the beach sounding toungue in cheek up tempo Cannibal Surf Babe, to the popish ballad Beautiful, to the title track and best song Afraid of Sunlight;which gives me goose bumps every time I here this song. Great song writing also. One small beef; Thank God for a lyric book. I wish Steve's voice was a little bit more clearerto understand the words to the songs. Overall, If the only album you have fromthis band is Marbles, Please make this your second.

They thought it was a masterpiece (and right they were), but just couldn't understand how the world hadn't noticed. Racked by self-doubt and emotional turmoil, Marillion started recording \\"Afraid Of Sunlight\\". As Steve Hogarth says: 'There never has been an initial \\"vision\\", or a master plan ..Like the others, \\"Afraid Of Sunlight\\" was another product of flailing around in the darkness. I think it's the best record we've made'. This quote says it all.On 24 bits it sounds great. Best songs are: Afraid Of Sunlight, Beyond You, King, Out Of This World and Beautiful. The bonus disc, however, is an interesing collectors item but does not add anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Effort by Britain's Best!","review":"Without a showdow of a doubt, Afraid of Sunlight is Steve Hogarth's masterpiece as Marillion's frontman. Throw influences like The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Yes and Phil Spector in a bag, mix and stir with Marillion's unique sound and the gorgeous production of David Meegan, and you have a modern rock classic that ought to sit on everyone's shelves. Hailed as a \\"near work of Genius\\" by Britain's leading music magazine \\"Q\\", it's an album that is worth the effort and one you'll return to, time and again.

Not only does the band now seem to have run out of ideas completely, but the sound is a mess, too. -Or rather, the mix.

Like with the previous release, \\"Brave\\", trying to be Pink Floyd doesn't suit them; some faster songs would've.(And a better album front cover.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Marillion squanders it's considerable musical talent by allowing Steve Hogarth to continue as vocalist and songwriter. What was once an outstanding prog outfit has degenerated into a pseudo-eighties hair-metal pop band. This is a terrible waste of ability.

The onetime lead vocalist for the UK soul outfit Brand New Heavies, Davenport is gifted with pipes that stand tall next to those of her more commercialized peers. In 1998, she unleashed her fine self-titled debut album which demonstrates growth from her days with BNH. I find it hard to resist the jazzed-up \\"Whatever You Want,\\" the electronic bleeps of the funky \\"No Never Again,\\" and the love jam \\"Under a Red Moon.\\" But she doesn't really let up wintil we get to \\"Bull-------,\\" a spicy mid-tempo jam with sass and attitude. The disc hits just a few weak spots with the ballads, but on the whole, this is a smart solo debut that's light on gloss and heavy on substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really was disappointed by this album","review":"I bought this album because it was one of my Amazon recommendations, which are usually pretty much on point. Unfortunately, I felt it left much to be desired, and at times the whole soulsistah, \\"riotgrrrl\\" thing seemed forced. I think her voice is great, but this material does not do her justice.Perhaps, as one of the reviewers below suggests, one cannot expect N'Dea to continue along in the BNH vein. I enjoy the BNH, particularly her contribution to the group, and I thought this was just not a great solo debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"N'dea rocks out","review":"N'dea the soulstress from BNH comes out on her first solo album. A good variety of pop/funk is explored free from the recipes of previous bands. Because of this, it sometimes lacks the pure groovaliciousness of her earlier work, but it stands on its own as a credible effort anyway. Somewhere in between this album and BNH's would have been my preference however. Not as outrageously funky as Funk Inc, not as slick as Incognito, its an honest portryal of a singer with a lot to give. Worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Talent!","review":"Yet another underrated artist with a very powerful voice. N'dea's vocals are strong and the music is also great. Hopefully she gets the recognition she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slinky, soulful and funky","review":"As a long-time fan of \\"Brand New Heavies\\" I thought I would give this album a try, and I was not disappointed. The album is not only a showcase of N'Dea Davenport's vocal skills, but a pleasing combination of styles that flow smoothly from tune to tune. There is a whole range of jazzy, funky song styling that is lacking in so many R&B performers these days. The lyrics are fine, but it is N'Dea's harmonizing on top of the soulful beats that makes this an album to add to your collection. A bit of acid jazz, a smattering of Drums & Bass, and a whole lot of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this hasn't been a big hit worldwide...","review":"I can hardly add anything to the accurate comments and analysis made by previous reviewers. I bought this CD immediately when it was released, and started playing it insistently on my show in Madrid, Spain. It was one of the ten best albums of the year, without doubt. Why it did not sell is simple : marketing and unfair competition from big companies, who generally offer worse products, but sell a lot. To give you an idea, her cd was hard to find in Spain, so very few radios played it. I however encourage N'dea to persist in her project. And prove that this solo album is not a mistake or coincidence. She is highly talented and has more fans that she might think..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a waste of ...","review":"real talent?!?

N'dea, hire yourself a better agent baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"When a talented lead singer leaves one of your favorite groups, it leads to a very difficult decision when they launch their solo projects. Will it be the quality that you are used to or will it be a bust????? N'dea has definitely made this a valuable purchase to add to my collection. The musical variety displayed on this CD allows her to gradually move away from the \\"acid jazz\\" sound that we are used to hearing and give her an opportunity to blaze her own trail. My favorite songs are the seductive \\"When the night falls\\" and \\"Underneath a Red Moon.\\" This CD is a break from all of those artists with big budgets and little talent. I look forward to her next solo project."},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman's got talent!","review":"This album is not for those looking for a series of songs with your everyday rapper/singer, remake of a 70's or 80's dance classic, top 10 hit. N'dea has managed to incorporate blues, soul, swing, and acid jazz, to her classic vocal style a la Brand New Heavies, without sounding artificial or contrived.She has captured the essence of creating an album by staying away from conventiality and doing her own thang (think Dionne Ferris' solo effort). The more I listen to it the more I appreciate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful solo debut by a distinctive R&B voice","review":"On her first solo effort after leaving the acclaimed Acid Jazz operation, Brand New Heavies, N'dea Davenport steps out with a diverse blend of old and new R&B. Her rich and soulful vocals enliven even the blandest of material, and she's at her best singing softly on \\"Real Life\\", wailing over the dance track \\"Never Again\\", and breathing real life into the Neil Young track \\"Old Man.\\" Let's hope this talented artist finds an audience so that she can continue to produce classic R&B records."},{"rating":"2","title":"the next computer game","review":"i slept on this for a minute but its very funkee. check it out maan you won't be disspappionteed.

Hm, a good time for whom, one wonders?Farrell likes to leave out certain facts. Like, for example, his complaints about how men die sooner and work more dangerous jobs. The former is proof of what, exactly? The latter is disingenuous---men work more dangerous jobs from wihch women are excluded because these jobs tend to pay better. Then the danger is used as an excuse to keep women out of those jobs because the little ladies need protection, for which men of the Farrell type expect gratitude.

After trying on the medium, I'm not sure I believe that. I have a big nose, but I still think the medium is quite small... even if I had a normal sized nose. Because the fit isn't right, the mask leaks air and is uncomfortable.I think this is a good product, but I'm going to have to order a large.I'm guessing the small would have to be for small children. I can't imagine any adult would need anything smaller than a medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.

Although Shanghai and China are fast moving targets, the book provides a spot-on snapshot of the issues facing Shanghai at the millennium and has helped me make sense of this fascinating yet perplexing city. The author really captures the successes and failures of fin de siecle Shanghai well. Also, there's lots of anecdote to make the book a lively read-the chapter on vice is particularly fun.

Gene Roddenberry's cutting edge script puts love and hate, man's inhumanity to man, revenge and its aftermath, racism, pride and shame, etc., into taut 25-minute episodic packages that will keep your eyes on the screen and off of your watch. This is remarkable, considering the series is well over 40 years old. Adding to the pleasure is an excellent DVD transfer.

Both have sultry co-stars--Patricia Neal and Lauren Bacall, respectively. The Fountainhead can be found on VHS for a rather high price, and I don't think Bright Leaf ever even made it to VHS, to my knowledge. It was an excellent film, with Cooper playing a tobacco plantation magnate whose greed and bitterness takes over everything in his life.

What we have, unfortunately, is a rambling, often incoherent, ill-tempered, unfocused attack on the television and the press, at least as viewed from a small town in Florida. Sommerville doesn't like the world very much, but instead of producing rememdies for everything that has gone wrong with our communications system, he resorts to a Luddite solution: stop paying any attention to the news at all. While the blow-up-your-tv solution has a certain simplicity, a nation that pays no attention whatsoever to what's happening on the planet will be led by the nose into one demented military adventure after another by a govenment totally freed from the constraints of public opinion. This is a thoroughly self-indulgent book. Wrong-headed books can sometimes be entertaining, but this one is dead boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't See It? Take it to the Big Screen!","review":"The Game Boy Player can be a great piece of hardware. There are a lot of games out there that, while designed for the small screen, require a lot of time and attention to detail, which can become a pain when playing on such a tiny screen. The Game Boy Player solves that problem, letting you convert any game from the countless library of Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles to a bigger screen. The graphics obviously aren't going to improve (they usually look the same as on the GBA), but the bigger image saves the trouble of straining your eyes to make sure you didn't miss anything.Of course, this is the only real advantage in having a Game Boy Player. It's really not an essential piece of equipment in the gaming experience; if you have no real interest in playing Game Boy games on a bigger screen, the money would be better used on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finaly!","review":"I was wondering, when Nintendo was going to fill the last hole in the GameCube that was left by the N64.

For those of you who have never done it, you would not beleve what a pain in the *** is is to use the GBA as a controller to link your GBA game with your GameCube game.I've gotta ask though, will this thing replace the GBA/GameCube cable?If the answer is no, I give it two stars not five."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's 1 inch and the biggest thing on the market?","review":"It's the Game Boy Player.

Picture playing Zelda on the big screen. It's like the good old days. Then also playing Golden Sun. Let the RPG titles roll in. Also, the younger ones can play Pokemon on it. You can connect you GBA to the GCN and use it as a controller, or use the GCN controller. This increases the GCN's library to about 1180 games. That wil lkeep you busy.

I dont care about the color, at all. Its nice. and if you care that much, have your console painted a complimentary color by colorconsoles.com, Anyway, i got this, and plugged it in, and eagerly popped the disk in the tray. It went downhill from there. To occupy the entire screen, you seriously lose quality, which is mediocre with the border.

It is hard to control it with the game cube controler. Then again you can use a Game boy Advance. Once you get this you don't need a Game Boy.

There is no difference in game play for any game, and you've lost the capability to move around. The graphics overall don't change, only the size.

At times the music seems completely raw, completely pure, completely gorgeous. This CD will make you heady, I am in love with it! Check out tracks like \\"Cocoa Butter,\\" \\"Mom's Mercedes,\\" \\"She Gives Tone,\\" \\"Last Lines,\\" and \\"She Might Be Waking Up\\" - which plays over the end credits of the film - to see what I mean!

My son is now a grown man and stopped riding in the car with me many years ago, but when I saw this MP3 for sale I jumped on it and now I get to say \\"Merry Christmas Mr Sinatra\\" and remember (with rose tinted glasses, without the tantrums) happy Christmas's from long, long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Sinatra","review":"How could you not love a Christmas disc by Old Blue Eyes.

If you add to that what is supposed to be the most joyous time of year, then as the title suggests , one would expect this album to be full of more upbeat christmas music. In this respect the album is in contradiction to the title.Most of the songs are of the more traditional, sombre kind and in the way they are performed enough to send those who find Christmas a loneley and unenjoyable experience reaching for an artificial lift. For those people I would suggest a healthy dose of Leonard Cohen as a better tonic.If you really do enjoy Christmas & Sinatra, there are much better collections on offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"&#65533;I&#65533;m All Alone at Christmas and No One Cares&#65533;","review":"This may be sacrilegious to many but I many but as a long time Sinatra fan I find this album to be a disappointment. Instead of \\"Jolly Christmas\\" it should have been titled \\"I'm All Alone at Christmas and No One Cares\\" Except for two cuts arranged by Nelson Riddle (\\"White Christmas\\" and the early version of\\" Christmas Waltz\\"), the album is dreary. The arrangements by Gordon Jenkins are somber having little if any feeling of joy to them. In addition Sinatra's voice sounds tired. He recorded two albums with Jenkins in 1957, the other being \\"Where are You\\" and it is obvious that his voice has deteriorated greatly since the 1956 album \\"Close to You\\".The two Nelson Riddle arrangements were recorded in 1954 and are full of life and the Christmas spirit. Sinatra's voice is beautiful. It is unfortunate that \\"Jolly Chrstmas\\" was not recorded at this time with Riddle doing the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor arrangements","review":"I am a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this CD is a MAJOR dissapointment.Frank sings pretty well (although certainly not his best), however every song on the album is ruined by terrible back-up singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning--this album may put you to sleep","review":"I enjoy Frank Sinatra's singing A LOT, but this album is, in my opinion, dreadful. Practically every song is sung in a very slow tempo with almost no emotion put into it (as far as I can discern). The result sounds very insincere and dull.

If you enjoy Frank Sinatra and/or Christmas music, do not bother buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remember","review":"Having listened to a couple of tracks, this is NOT the Frank I remember from live tv shows.

I hate to sound repetitive- judging from the reviews of this and the earlier releases of the same package of songs, everyone else feels the same way. I wanted to carry that five star rating over to this new re-release since there is only one review. This is a great album in every sense. There isn't a single throwaway here. \\"Mistletoe and Holly\\" and \\"Christmas Waltz\\" are my favorites since they're relatively unheard (Sinatra co-wrote Mistletoe). Jingle Bells is also quite definitive of Frank's style. This is a huge part of my family's Christmas, and I think it will bring wonderful memories to you and yours. Be advised that in addition to earlier versions, you can pick this package up under the alternate title \\"Sinatra Christmas Album\\" on Capitol, usually for bargain price. Thanks to Frank for this wonderful album, and to you for reading my review. Happy Holidays to you and yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh by gosh, by golly","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best Frank Sinatra Christmas CD available. The album was originally recorded in 1957, when Frank was arguably at the peak of his singing ability. The first side featured secular Christmas songs, while side two featured religious Christmas songs. They are all well sung by Frank, although he didn't seem to have the affinity for Christmas music that Bing Crosby did. The CD has two bonus songs, which are \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"The Christmas Waltz\\". These songs were released on a single in 1954, three years before the album was recorded. If you want to hear Frank Sinatra sing Christmas songs, this is the CD to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"If you are hoping to get some insight into Harper Lee, you won't find it here.

He certainly showed later that he had leadership abiltiy, as illustrated by this fine blues-based CD from the early 1990s.

After I bought this cd and found it sadly lacking, I purchased the cd titled \\"Unforgettable Nat King Cole\\" (on Capitol,released 2000). It has all of the great hits in stereo and in perfect sound. It should receive the 5 star rating. Why people should rate the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album 5 stars is beyond me. It should get at most 2 stars. I'm sorry I was snookered into buying it. I can always use it as a coffee coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"What makes a voice distinctive and memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also includes the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made after he had passed on. That particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!","review":"This album is a must get.

However, when we put this dry Royal Canin in front of her, it's as if we opened a can of her favorite wet cat food! I don't have to tell you the health benefits since Royal Canin is a industry leader in high quality healthful cat food!

Mulholland Falls, NO!","review":"I bought this because I am a big Louise Fletcher fan. She has a VERY small, uncredited cameo here as Esther, the foul-mouthed secretary of Nick Nolte. She is worth watching in anything (to me, at least). She has starred and costarred in some pretty bad, low-budget pictures. This is a big-budget film with big stars, however, which leaves me to ponder at just how mindnumbingly awful it is. How anyone who has seen LA Confidential and Chinatown can sit through this sloppily constructed, poorly written waste of celluloid is beyond me. Louise Fletcher earns my 1 star (this deserves none); she is lovely, well costumed, and beautifully photographed (in what little time she has). Unless you like bad movies, stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A garish and ridiculous neo-noir that features Nick Nolte in full screen-chewing mode, Melanie Griffith in full awful-Melanie-Griffith mode, and some truly terrible dialogue and situations, Mulholland Falls has a good first scene but nothing else to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLHOLLAND DRAWLS","review":"A handsome film unfortunately stranded with a smarmy storyline that leaves a bunch of very promising ideas unattended, unfinished, or just plain wasted. The pace is murderous; you've seen countryside post offices work faster than the detective work in this film. Hate to say this for a movie with big tykes like Nolte, Griffith and Connelly in it, but it's a clunker. Grab \\"Chinatown\\" instead if a classy noir suspense caper is what you're after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 40's -50's Feel","review":"If you enjoy a good feel for the 50's mysterious atomic era, along with a murder mystery, this film is for you. It involves a team of LA police investigating a murder involving a person from the Atomic Energy Commision ( A.E.C ). naturally, there are some problems when the team tries to enter the test site. There are some GREAT shots of the Nevada Test Site Plowshare crater formed by a large nuclear explosion ( Yes it's real !!! ). In a few words.....a great movie, and a very good plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bla bla bla bla.","review":"Another glossy film with absolutely no substance.

Manages to trash every good idea and runs all possible interest into the ground (over and over and over again). The entire cast (as well as the otherwise talented director) should be ahsamed! This one belongs in the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful film. What a waste!","review":"Stillborn, dull would-be period melodrama with an extra-gravely Nick Nolte plodding endlessly through cliched scene after cliched scene. we wonder of the stars (Rob Lowe, Bruce dern, Louise Fletcher, William Petersen) who appear in the film, but are not given credit (did they have more scenes that were cut, so they bailed?). Might as well, this was a career downer for all involved. Melanie Griffith is particularly wasted. Check out the \\"streets\\" as old cars are conveniently parked apart (none are close together)and the street signs are those we have today. Where did the budget of this film go? Just to the cast, who must have taken the money and run (judging from their performances). Only Jennifer Connelly is worth the one star. She is tough and mysterious, too bad we didn't see more of her. Even Chazz Palmentari's death scene look embarrassingly staged. What the hell were they all thinking???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulholland Falls","review":"I really enjoyed listening to the sound track from the movie Mulholland Falls. It was a great movie noir of a special time in LA history. Beautiful sound track that stays with you long after the movie ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"good cast, weak script","review":"Although I've never got why anyone thinks Nick Nolte is a leading man, the rest of the cast is stellar. The problem is this is an L.A. Confidential ripoff that runs like a made-for-TV movie.Put it this way, Melanie Griffith is in this. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Chinatown","review":"It's easy to make a comparison of this movie and Chinatown. But to suggest that you'll like this film if you liked Chinatown is ridiculous. Chinatown was a great film. Mulholland Falls plays like a bad made-for-TV movie with cliché characters at every turn. Nick Nolte is so bad he's painful to watch. And Melanie Griffith isn't any better. Except for a couple of good scenes here and there, not even the excellent performance by John Malkovich could save this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable.","review":"As a fan of film noirs, I was sorely disappointed with this film. A good cast and nice art direction can only go so far if there is no story. I've seen worse films, but that isn't saying much in the way of a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's good.","review":"This one's a laugh-riot. Top stars and good director, all for naught. The 1950s look is adequate (if not totally believable), the cast stale (they do more for this than this does for them), and the story laughable. It's fun to spot actors not in the credits (Bruce Dern, Louise Fletcher, William L. Petersen and Rob Lowe) as well as those known actors in small parts (Treat Williams, Andrew McCarthy, Daniel Baldwin). A waste, but still worth checking out. I personally LOVE projects like this: a well-known cast and director collaborating (along with a big budget) on a project that ends up stinking to high heaven. One thing's for sure: no Oscar nominations went to anyone involved in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the bad reviews!!!!!??!?!??","review":"Watching this film I was truly reminded of some of the classic noir tales(chinatown,body heat.) Not to say that this film is in the same class, but it is a very strong, and surprisingly funny. All of the performances are right on, and the direction is flawless. And while the story is not in the same catagory as the classic noir film, it does contain enough enjoyable elements to put it above the heap of most modern crime dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"RED HOT Jennifer Connelly","review":"See this movie, if just for Jennifer's performance. She has a small but unforgettable part. The movie on the whole was very good, exceptional story. Above par acting. My one fault was of the lead roles, their was not one true hero. Melanie Griffith has the part of Nick Notle's wife which she play very well and you feel for her. I recommend this for those that want to study the art of movie making."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie!!!","review":"This movie has everything: great actors, great soundtrack by Dave Grusin and great cinematography.

After finally figuring out a few stitches, I tried to teach my son myself, but a newbie teaching a newbie something they do not understand does not work. As soon as this book came in the mail, both my children (now 9 and 7) picked up on the finger crocheting chain instantly and they are looking forward to the next baby step. Where before my son was frustrated, he is now excited. I am not an experienced crocheter, so I cannot give you a review for the limitations, but I think it is a great beginning book."},{"rating":"2","title":"single crochet easy","review":"This book is great for anyone that wants to learn how to crochet.

This book is a nice idea, but missed the mark in my opinion. Also, the patterns provided aren't really what most kids would be interested in making. Unless your target audience is NOT a beginner, this book will likely fail to spark an interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with terrific illustrations","review":"I bought this book for my daughter a few years ago. She wouldn't let me teach her how to crochet, but later picked up this book and taught herself in one morning. She was 8 at the time. I have since used this book with our kids craft club. The illustrations are wonderful and show everything from tying a slip knot to chaining to turning a row and finishing off. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, although I suspect my daughter taught herself simply from the pictures. I highly recommend this as a good starter book. The Crocheters Companion by Nancy Brown is an excellent reference as you continue learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a small P.S.","review":"Putting together the information of the different reviews will give customers already a good idea about the plot of this very interesting movie. But I just wanted to add -I'm somewhat surprised that nobody made the comparison- that the sultry voice and some little feminine gestures of sensual Miss Joan Greenwood in this film bears quite some resemblance to Veronica Lake's. In fact, there was another thing that reminded me of a V.Lake/Alan Ladd movie: the character of the old boss of bosses of the textile industry somewhat resembles a catain pg industry, head of a dubious chemical plant in 'This gun for hire\\" 10 years earlier.I guess the choice of \\"white\\" for the new product is not a concidence, being the complete opposite of the \\"black\\" city and the black cars and suits of the bosses."},{"rating":"2","title":"YaDADUMdeeDOODAHaY","review":"This is the sort of movie you watch with a smirk on your face. There ishumor, but it's under the surface, and laughter comes only with the bleakest of insights. This is a world where everything good is soiled or misunderstood, no matter how obsessive compulsively clean we try to be.Any chance to watch Alec Guinness is a privilege. He suits his role ideally.It's definately not a 50s romp though comedy like Some Like It Hot, more of an intelligent satire with base entertainment value... something a little bit more lighthearted than Sunset Boulevard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty Tinker","review":"I ordered this about 4 years ago, when my son was tiny.

I tried to get help from tech support, but it was useless. They did not know how to help and their response time was awful. They refused to give me a refund on the program.

Goes in and puts postings of how great his company and his products are and then doesn't cover up his tracks. I think Amazon needs to remove this company's product from their website for unethical use of the rating system. It is people like this Bob LaGarde that give the industry a bad name.

I immediately noticed what I could only describe as a pock marked bowl.

The sink was smooth, but the imperfections were noticeable in my lighting. I called Kohler to see if this was normal for their product, and was told that it was abnormal and shouldnt've passed inspection, so I exchanged it for one of the same. Sure enough, the new one had the same markings.It's a sink, so all I expect is that it is shaped correctly and the bowl is free of visual defects/imperfections.

The recipes are somewhat of a mystery though because CeeDub doesn't share many of his flavorings. Many recipes say \\"salt, pepper to taste, and SPICES\\". Which spices?

The instrumentation definately showcases their Quebec heritage.

All in all it's wonderful.BUT it would have been considerably more fun if the wingman you flew with were a bit more active in the game. I can understand that it is difficult for a designer to balance out the need for the player to be the protagonist in a game and the amount of support given to the protagonist by the cast, but I think the designers put far to much responsibility on the player. It feels like no one else is relaible. No other pilot kills anything. All the responsibility falls on the player pilot.In conclusion, buy this game if you are into action orientated plots, and fascinating space shooter, but be prepared to do the work of a six ship squadron all by your lonesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"When considering the amount I piad for it..","review":"This game really wasn't all that bad.

The title itself can be misleading. Whilst from the outset, it's literally sex, lies and videotapes but without those issues, there wouldn't be the much needed honesty, transparency and communication that facilitate a satisfying resolve for all parties that are concerned.

The man had trouble in love in high school and never got over it. He has grown into a man who masturbates to video interviews with women about sex. He can't have sex with another person.

She is a great interpreter of traditional folk music and contemporary singer-songwriters. She has a stark, dramatic vocal delivery and generally choses her songs with care and thought. What she is not is a jazz singer. Her vocals do not swing and just simply are not suited for jazz standards. Her singing on this album comes across as brittle and wooden. Her vocal range is not that dissimilar to Peggy Lee, but Peggy Lee is able to sing with a jazz rhythm and beat, while June, unfortunately, is not.

I'm very glad to have found this book. It made me realize that we do all have our own languages. The way we communicate to others our sadness, sorrows, and how we ask for forgiveness. It's how we choose to accept those apologies and move on to better things. I've learned a lot about myself and glad that this was available to help me through my journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better Installments in the \\"Five Languages\\" Series","review":"This book is one of the better installments in the \\"Five Love Languages\\" series of Gary Chapman. Having read the original Five Love Languages title and a few of the follow-ups, this one provides the most additional fresh material to the initial volume. Being able to communicate a sincere apology is an increasingly needed skill in today's age of dodging responsibility and laying blame on others. Chapman and Thomas do a good job in providing the reader insight as to how to apologize in five different styles, depending upon the recipient's personality or \\"apology language.\\" Included with the book are an apology profile and a group study guide. For anyone wanting truly to make amends in a fractured relationship, this volume is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Its a book that teaches you the high importance of apology. How it helps maintain relationships, and how to apologize to each person, and let them know its sincere. Because sometime you are, but the other part doesn't believe you. This book explains why and how to make it right.Bad part is, that after it ends explaining that (which is at about half of the book), the rest is pure b.l..... blah, blah, blah..... That's why no fifth star.But just read the first half, and its more than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Help for Understanding Forgiveness","review":"I thought this book gave great perspective on how people differ in their perception of an acceptable apology and insight into why we do or don't apologize.

Because it only fits on the head, you do not have the flexibility to put the weight on different parts of your club for a variety of exercises.It works for what it does--adds weight to the club head of some clubs. However, there are other products that can do that and also fit on all your clubs and put the weight in various spots for warming up and improving smoothness and accuracy.

He is an excellent professor, amazingly well versed in history and the law. His theory of the five types of legal arguments is very helpful in understanding and organizing such arguments, especially in the area of Constitutional law. It has helped me clarify the reasons behind the rulings and why the law is interpreted the way that it is. It has been helpful in all my classes, and I anticipate it will be most helpful on up-coming exams. As law students or practicing attorneys, you may not be able to benefit from Professor Huhn's lectures, but you will most certainly benefit from his book. I higly recommend it for first year students, as I think it will help you in clarifying what I am sure is still new and confusing material."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, i was surprised, this was very good....","review":"what makes this so good is that you know the info that north gives us is based on truths and therefore scary....i will certainly now go and read his first book which i guess i should have read first...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read by Col.

More importantly, it also seems to be the only collection, comprehensive or otherwise, that includes my favorite Hollies song, \\"I Can't Let Go.\\" Ten tracks may not seem like a lot, but the price is also on the low side, so it's not an egregious rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steering you to their Best ALbum","review":"This is fine and all, but their best collection is the Greatest Hits (Epic).

The story line skips around and seems to have no continuity or narrative flow... I still don't understand why the author, at college age, spent 3 years living on the island...

Chris Cornell, former members of Rage Against the Machine, over the top vocals, guitar driven anthems, relentless bass, foot stomping drums. What's not to love? That is until Revelations. On this album, it seems like Audioslave abandons everything that makes them the awesomeness that is Audioslave in favor of songs that are less than stellar and not even memorable. What's worse is that Cornell's \\"I hate the President\\" attitude blatantly rears its ugly face. You know what Cornell? If you dislike George W. that's your right as an American. But putting in your lyrics really makes lousy music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible album that should have never been made","review":"Their first two albums were awesome.

Then the first album or so basically sounded like RATM playing with Cornell singing. That at least makes sense.Now what was one of the hardest, most intense bands out there (audibly as well as politically) is making music for my 60-year old dad.If were some nobodies on a stage in a local tavern or something I'd say \\"Ok, these guys are 'ok'\\" then I'd leave without buying their CD. This is danceable, commerical-shopping-mall rock. How this was born from these individuals is beyond me. Three members from RATM plus the amazing singer of Soundgarden = useless.(And it's getting so funky I keep expecting Cornell to start rapping)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below expectations","review":"After two CDs that were great and even better, respectively, one would think that their 3rd effort would even surpass them. Sadly, no. This CD explains why the group disbanded. Sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Breed of Rock","review":"For all you head-bangers out there that think this album is too soft, you better move on. From listening to the DVD that comes with the CD and reading about where Audioslave wants to go with their music, it's obvious that they want something different than the typical hard rock stuff out there.I don't know...maybe you have to be a thinker or at least a 30-something to get Audioslave's music. I've been a rock fan my entire life, but their music and lyrics not only appeal to me as I've grown older, but they can make those that have never gotten into \\"rock\\" a real fan. Chris writes deep lyrics that make sense to almost anyone, and the different beats and jams that come from the band are just unique...and it works.Yeah, it's great to rock to Show Me How To Live or Set It Off, but this new stuff speaks of a new language in rock that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some variety?","review":"Chris Cornell is the best hard rock singer in the business - now that Robert Plant is semi-retired. His work with Audioslave HAS NOT matched his music with Soundgarden - it has been a major disappointment. Each CD regresses despite new production tricks - every song is intense hard rock and all the songs run together and sound the same after a while. Where are the shades of gray we heard in Soundgarden and even on his solo albums? The guitarist is highly overrated - he seldom (if ever) plays a melodic solo and his psychedelic riffs are tiresome cliches. This CD may be good for head bangers and someone wanting to hear bleak and depressing lyrics. For someone who wants to hear a diverse hard rock band - look elsewhere. The latest Wolfmother CD is even far better than this junk! Chris and company - you are losing me fast!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly pleased!","review":"I liked the previous 2 albums but the 1st one moreso. This album I enjoy more than the past 2. There's a little bit of everything on it: Earth, Wind, and Fire influence, a 70's funk jam, beautiful vocals such as in \\"Shape of Things to Come\\", and the usual catchy bass line in songs such as Wide Awake and Original Fire. \\"One and the Same\\" makes me just wanna get up and dance around the room and has an awsome guitar solo in it. And you can tell that that ol' \\"Rage\\" guitar is still there, of course. \\"Until We Fall\\" and \\"Moth\\" aren't my favorites but even they have choruses I like. 10/12 songs on this album I can sit down and listen to easily. That's great considering I can rarely do that anymore because most albums are full of fillers. And \\"Nothing left to say but goodbye\\" sounds like something from a Soundgarden album (people say it reminds them of Spoonman). I was impressed with how much I like this album and I'm even the songs that I haven't listened to much are sounding better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I liked it more.","review":"A long-time fan of Soundgarden and Audioslave, and Rage Against the Machine somewhat, I looked forward to hearing this album, expecting to be blown away. All of the songs are just fine, there's nothing wrong with them, and yet I'm not thrilled. It's just okay. I'm very disappointed that this album isn't fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet","review":"Finally, 3/4 of the most political band in recent history decides to add some fire to their lyrics. Audioslave not only tackles the Hurricane Katrina fiasco, but sounds damn good doing it.This is probably the best CD I've bought in the last five years, which is saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original sound","review":"I'm going to have to agree with the first review I read of this: The first album (still the best) sounded like Rage Against The Machine with guest artist Chris Cornell, the second album was weak at best, with a handful of songs standing out after repeat listening and the band trying to find a new sound, and they've gotten much closer to finding it here. Yes, there's a weak track or two, but I love the funk direction they're going, and there are some real rockers and powerful numbers (most notably \\"Somedays,\\" \\"Wide Awake\\" and \\"Moth\\"). While I won't say this is a better album than \\"AUDIOSLAVE,\\" I will say that they sound like a different band now. The one real problem I have with this album is Tom Morello. The noise solos have to stop - it works occassionally very well, but he's so damned talented, it's a waste of music to have him not take a musical solo for at least half of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"AUDIO SLAVE","review":"I PURCHASED THIS CD BECAUSE OF A SONG I HEARD WHEN I WENT TO THE OPENING OF THE MIAMI VICE MOVIE IT WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE MOVIE SOUND TRACK HOW ODD!

After a full listen of this album, I was very satisfied. The opening and title track, \\"Revelations\\", starts with very hard guitar riffs. I love this track, its pure rock.Originally when I first heard the first single,\\"Original Fire\\" I was not impressed. This song has a different sound and I didn't care much for it. But being a rock music lover, I had to go get this album. The gem here for me would have to be the album closer, \\"Moth\\". I totally love the riff in this song. A totally awsome rocking closer. \\"One and the same\\" has a Rage type of feel to it. A couple other favorites off the top would have to be \\"Shape of things to come\\" and \\"Somedays\\"...If you love Audioslave, and great hard guitar riffs, you should definetly get this album hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good LP","review":"I'm glad that Audioslave is back after there last effort, which if I remember had two good tracks almost.

It's great that you can listen to this CD all the way threw, which is kind of rare this days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing departure.","review":"Long story short: I was dissapointed with this album. I felt it was a bit too pop influenced and seemed to be an effort to cater to a more \\"accessable\\" sound...TOP 40 radio and Audioslave just don't belong together! Funk/Red-Hot Chili Peppers type thing goin' on just didn't do it for me. I kept waiting for the down and dirty rock sound of old, a-la \\"Cochise\\" and...save for \\"Running From the Sound of a Gun\\"...it just never shows up. I loved thier first two abulms but was so bummed about this third one that I literally sold it off to a used CD store after having it a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You people must be deaf!!!","review":"This album is terrible. It does not rock. I kept hitting the \\"next track\\" button, trying to find rock, but alas came up empty. You can probably write these guys off. There's no more rage in the music (pun intended). The first one is a classic, too bad they had to blow it. RIP.Go pick up the new Motorhead or Slayer instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin meets Earth Wind and Fire","review":"Ok whats with the negative reviews for this disc? It still sounds like Audioslave except there writing is more mature and complex. Out of Exile was and will always be my favorite Audioslave disc, but this disc is really starting to grow on me and if you give it a chance it could surpass Out of Exile. I think these guys get better with each album and Revelations is another step up for Audioslave. If they wrote there self titled disc over and over again wouldn't it get boring, instead we get something different and exciting on each release. I just hope this isn't there last effort and they keep making music for years to come instead of breaking up like most bands do. Revelations, One and the Same, Broken City, Somedays, Shape of things To Come, and Jewel of the Summertime, give those songs a try and then listen to the whole CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audioslave Revelations","review":"I did not like this album as much as their first two albums. All the songs sounded similar to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INSTANT CLASSIC!","review":"No matter what other reviews here might say. This is another classic album from one the best rock bands on the planet today. Who else can flat out rock like these guys in todays scene? Great recorded and produced songs but not over produced,too flashy,or for lack of a better word, blatantly commercial. I agree that the first album was a masterpiece, but the second was just as good.This is the next step in the evolution of the band as all great bands have done before them.Just refreshingly honest rock. Sure to endure and rise above the rest for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it loud and over and over again.","review":"The more you listen to this cd, the better it gets. I have to admit, out of exile wasn't that good but it did have a few good songs.

Nothing fancy, no artsy fartsy stuff, just straight up rock n roll. Reminds me of Deep Purple with Coverdale. Don't analyze this one, Just enjoy the rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This is a good cd from audioslave, but not as hard hitting as I wanted. I guess I am always expecting RAM, and not getting it. This is not as good as the last cd, but gives the same sort of vibe as the last cd. I would buy it again, but just know it needs a little punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get over the sophmore jinx w/o really trying.","review":"Out of Exile was a disappointment to me and I wondered if it would be the end of Audioslave. I was happily proved wrong yesterday with the release of Revelations. This album ROCKS HARD! Lots of hooks, catchy head bobbin' rhythms, good if not semi great lyrics, and at least 3 hit bound tracks make this a GREAT Audioslave record. They are sounding less and less like RATM with every release and that is a good and bad thing. I really liked RATM's sound, heavier and angrier than Audioslave. Revelations is less heavy and angry but cathcy and tuneful in a pop sort of way. More FM radio friendly if you will. They still have an edge thanks mostly to Tom's guitar chops. If you liked the 1st Audioslave record, you will dig this one as well.Why can't I buy a disc with THE WHIP on it? Why, why, why? Peace Out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IGNORE THE EDITORIAL REVIEW","review":"This album is great! No ballads fall \\"painfully Short\\" as the editorial review states! It is a funky rock album with so many great songs. Audioslave delivers meaningful lyrics, awesome guitars,and a driving percussion- the more you listen, the more you'll love. Too hard to pick favorites, but from the first song, revelations to the last song, Moth- you will enjoy this. Each Audioslave album has been different from the last- if you appreciate lyrics,and songs with meaning along with a great band to back them up -thats what you get! Buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Spirituality Simple","review":"This book has done for spiritual guidance what few others have done -- keep the pathway simple.

Usually I'm hesitant to use the word \\"surrender\\" as readily as he does, but in the context presented it makes complete sense and I find it accceptable. Persons familiar with the complext \\"Course in Miracles\\" -- that mainstay of many New Thought religious studies -- will find Grace Unfolding an easier approach to some of the Miracles concepts.

The shootout is so loud and intense that Ponch has to shoot at John (narrowly missing him) just to get his attention.Too many sight gags to list, that'll bust you up.

If you like Airplane, Top Secret, the Naked Guns films you love looking at this one. Starring Emillio Esteves and Samuel L. Jackson as two Police Officers who must solve the murder of Whoopie Goldberg ....Make no sense? See the movie and it will all make sense. Bruce Willis, Larry Wilcox, Eric Estrada, Alison Beasley and Charlie Sheen also make appearances. My favorite cameo is James Doohan - the ever-popular Scotty of Star Trek.There are not a lot of DVD extras, but it was the film and price that brought me to it.

I've starred in some musicals and a few plays. If you know broadway... then you know these songs from many dvds, and musical soundracks. The songs are excelent, but there's nothing special about this album. (You could probally hear (and see) these classics on every other cd or dvd that has \\"Broadway's best\\") It might be worth buying if you're not familiar with musicals. Makes a great gift! I reccomend buying Broadway's Lost Treasures, edition 1. You can see all of these performed live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Newbies Intro To Broadway","review":"This CD is the ultimate! I have been a lover of the musical theater for years and wanted a good CD that would inspire my wife to love the theater as much as I do. Last week, I took her to her first Broadway show (Phantom) and I had to pry her from her seat when the show was over. When I saw this CD I simply had to have it to share the other great musicals with her. To say the least she is hooked. I WANT MY CD BACK....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, quite good.","review":"This is really a good selection. You can't go wrong with 'West Side Story', 'Man of La Mancha', 'Fiddler on the Roof', or 'The King and I'. I guess you can always argue why two songs from one show were selected, while another show may be completely omitted.My only real disappointment is with the selection of the Aretha Franklin version of 'I Dreamed a Dream'. The song is too stylized by Aretha, and sounds nothing like it is performed in 'Les Miserables'. I didn't care for this version in the least. I would have much preferred Randy Graff or Patti LuPone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only OK","review":"Ella signs beautifully, and the sound quality is fine, but the backing music is very generic, and the CD only contains 20 minutes of music.

It has wonderful humor, Merlin is terrific and wonderfully voiced as is Archimedes,the Owl.

There are many animal metamorpheses that Merlin and Wart undergo; check out the fish transformation, great stuff! I especially enjoyed the fat female squirrel who became overly enamored with Merlin. Buy it, add it to your Disney collection and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always and forever my favorite","review":"The Sword in the Stone has always, and will always, be my favorite Disney creation.

The other games and cartoons are grainy and not up to what we have come to know as Disney standards. There are a lot of people in this world you can't trust, but I always figured Disney was above all of this...well Walt Disney was.Now everyone is just out for as much money as they can get. Re-releasing this cute movie as a 45th anniversary special DVD is nothing more than trying to scrape in those dollars. Even at $20.00 it's not worth it.And just for general purposes, I'm sick and tired of buying any type of DVD, Movie, Video that contains ads to buy even more of their products. Most people just fast forward through them anyway.We are inundated with commercials on TV and now on movies we buy. I would love to put in a DVD and have the movie start without seeing all the hype.

It just doesn't seem right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Do NOT like this film!","review":"This is one of my least favorite Disney films! Everybody keeps picking on this poor kid, Arthur (no I am NOT calling him Wart like the other jerks in this movie!). Everybody keeps confusing him or bossing him around! I am glad Merlin's lessons distract him from those other things in the castle, but what right does HE have to force Arthur to take lessons! I also hate Sir Ector! He's obviously like Uncle Vernon from \\"Harry Potter and a male version of Lady Tremaine; favoring their own biological kid while treating their UN-biological kid like a slave or absolutely nothing! George Bruns's music is also his most forgettable and bland out of his five films. The only thing I reccomend in this movie is Made Mim's wizard's duel, but it is not enough to save this stupid animated film!

I am not a huge disney fan, but I do like king arthur movies, so this movie is one of the few disney movies I watched when I was younger. Of course, their are many legends of King arthur and many a film about it, and Disney's version is slightly different as well. But, it is a fun movie and has a great theme, Brain over brawn, knowledge is the key to suceed. The animation in this movie was good, although it has a somewhat different feel than some of the orininals disney films such as dumbo and snow white, but very lively colors and excellent quality animation, again good for it's time.

This one still beats any Saturday morning cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Addition To The Arthurian Tradition!","review":"Although aimed at children, anyone interested in King Arthur and his legend will enjoy this spectacular tale. When young Wart (Arthur) meets the wizard Merlin, he begins to learn what it's like to be a king...when he meets the Mad Madam Mim, he almost learns what it's like to be dinner. The only let-down is the inconsistency in Arthur's voice - at least 2 actors played the part - one of whom sounds far more Californian than old English."},{"rating":"2","title":"sword","review":"This is a great movie.

The film lacks action and replaces it with tons of diolouge, since most of the film has Merlin teaching Arthur so many lessons. For some reason, the film works a lot better than one would think especially with the inclusion of the great wizard battle, which has Disney animators at their comedic best.The Gold Collection DVD includes great extras including two great cartoons, with Mickey Mouse and Goofy. But the best feature is the black and white 1957 TV show \\"All About Magic\\", hosted by Walt Disney & The Magic Mirror. Included in this TV special is the entire \\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\\" sequence from \\"Cinderella\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another must-have Disney classic!","review":"I remember the first time I saw this movie. I've always loved Arthurian legends, and in its usual style, Disney puts aside many historical facts in favor of a more entertaining movie, fun for the whole family.

All films have been made in some form of widescreen since 1953. 101 Dalmations includes a theatrical release in 2.35 but they chose to give us only 1.33 No need to buy. They did the same on The Sword in the Stone. They released Lady and the Tramp and Sleeping Beauty in 2.35 why not these? Such a disappointment to not have these films as originally intended especially since it's 2008! Come on Disney-get with the times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not widescreen!

As a kid, my cousin and I would rewind funny scenes and watch them over and over. I'm so tired of boy meets girl, girl needs rescued, boy rescues girl, they get married... How boring. I do like some of the classics but I don't understand why people get so upset when there are movies like The Sword in the Stone and The Great Mouse Detective that go off of that path and try and be original. I like that my son has something to watch other than princesses. I love the quirky humor and each time we watch it, we discover something new. To each their own, I suppose.

It provides excellent guidance on all sorts of aspects from choosing a location for your Portuguese home to working and setting up a business.It gives good guidance on the legal and financial aspects of the purchase, including mortgage, which can be somewhat difficult in a foreign country. Also additional information on tax and other important legal considerations. It goes much further, with sections on renovating, letting and selling, a bit too early for me but good to be able to read about it.I would say there is only one weak point in this book, the advice on learning the language. I speak Portuguese and my recommendations would be quite different. This said, the book directs readers to specialist booksellers where they can see for themselves and choose the best suited course to their needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an Audiobook!","review":"They make this sound like it is an MP3 compatible file that you can listen to audibly on an MP3 player.

Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Greg Egan, Frank Herbert, Kim Stanley Robinson etc.), and I like British humour (John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson), but HHGTTG was a looong piece of nonsensical drivel, punctuated by some mildly funny bits, very few thought-provoking ideas (thanks to their absurdity, such as being so bored with immortality as to insult everyone in the Universe, and worse, _in alphabetical order_!) (the Babelfish is a genuinely good one though), and a lot of delightful British speech.It's more interesting why exactly HHGTTG has generated such fandom and how come that its mostly pointless memes managed to occupy the minds of so many individuals. But alas, crazes shall never end (the Bible, anyone?).Overall, I regret having wasted 13 hours in order to hopefully understand what all the fuss was about.

He tells her he's a musician as are his pals (including Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom) and they need a quiet place to rehearse their classical music. They are, however, a gang of robbers planning their next heist and they intend to use the old lady to pull off the job.This drle 1955 black comedy is from the Ealing Studio. The heist is carried out despite the old lady's constant, well-intentioned, and funny interruptions, she gradually realizes her part in it, and justice prevails with lots of giggles. Guiness, sporting a large overbite and flyaway hair, is charmingly devious as the gang leader, but it is the inimitable Katie Johnson who steals the show. She's so likable and convincing, completely inhabiting the role of the befuddled, sweet landlady who is blithely unaware she is surrounded by criminals.Highly recommended for those who enjoy classic British comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guinness the Great Plans a Heist","review":"One of the Ealing Studio's 1950's gems, \\"Ladykillers\\",in this Blu-ray incarnation, offers a full screen print with pallid skin tones and faded lighter colors. Working best with the darker colors of the filmmaker's palette,this is the best version of this mordantly funny film we're likely to get.Alec Guinness, in a performance which suggests the mastery of German expressionism or Alistair Sim at his most dyspeptic,leads an ensemble of British character actors, including an admirably resrained pre-stardom Peter Sellers.The crown jewel of the production,as befitting a story which pits Victorian morality against mid 20th century cynicism, is the diminutive but determined Katie Johnson, portraying an elderly destructive force which, in its absolute sense of self rectitude, unleashes havoc on a singularly unfortunate group of tradesmen, criminals and policemen.Witty rather than full of belly laughs, \\"Ladykillers\\" is a distinctly memorable addition to the heist film genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic comedy but major shortcoming in the Blu ray release","review":"There are no English subtitles. This is really a disgrace. Those that think English speakers do not need them should have their heads looked at. There are millions of people who are hard of hearing and hundreds of millions to whom English is a second language who NEED subtitles to follow the dialogue. To spend money and add Norwegian subtitles (when most Norwegians speak better English than most of those who use it as a main language) and NOT provide English subtitles is just disgraceful. A great comedy but to go to all this trouble and expense and then deny enjoyment to tens of millions of semi English speaking viewers is commercially stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I like this version much better than the Tom Hanks movie.

If they hadn't made their disappointing remake of this film I would not have sought out the original. Everything the Coens got wrong in their film the makers of this film got right. Alec Guiness is deliciously goofy as Professor Marcus, the leader of the gang of thieves. Mrs. Wilberforce, as played by Katey Johnson, is measuredly sweet and resolute in her sense of right and wrong. Herbert Lom as one of the thugs is comically menacing. Peter Sellers as the teddy-boy is good but just adequate here. It just goes to show you that you can have all the elements of a good story, which the Coen brothers did, and a misreading of them is the difference between classic and the mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"liked this old english comedy, as I am a peter sellers fans this is a good farcical comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classic and what a GREAT cast!!!","review":"This is a must own comedy classic,and such a marvelous cast!!!!

I have given them all away, and find I still want more copies to share. The deep political and philosophical understandings of the ever-talented Ms. Hammad, woven beautifully together into these passionate poems, motivate the reader to no end. Her compassion and insight are matched with her gift for lyric, in style that is fondly at home with the griots Nikki Giovanni, Audre Lorde, Helene Cixcous, Sapphire, Gil Scott-Heron, Nawal el Sdadawi, Michael Franti, Dead Prez, and anyone who has suffered long enough to know the difference between living and fighting to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply beautiful","review":"This is not only a great book but also a engaging CD, and listening to the audio versions of her poems tends to make me emotional every time.

However, I don't like his \\"The DJ in the Mix\\" series.Sticking to ATB studio creations, I bought Trilogy to get more of the same great trance. In CD1, I only enjoy listening to Justify repeatedly, while others are just OK. The distinct rock sound blended with the some trance feels like bland pop-rock.CD2 has really grown on me. My media player seems to love it, so I've been listening to it often while doing homework and was really surprised when I checked and found what album the songs were from. I enjoy CD2 more than CD1.In the middle of all 95 tracks, Trilogy CD1 tracks stick out like a sore thumb. When the distinct rock sounds come on, it feels like I've already heard the style from a real rock artist.I give 3 stars to CD1 and 4 stars to CD2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"This is another great album from ATB; the two disc set reminds me very much of Two Worlds, but better.

The second half of CD1 isn't even worth playing - same deal with CD2 although you'd only want to play that if you're already asleep.The whole thing is slow, dreamy & boring.

The remixes of Lies, Love on your side, Hold me now, Doctor Doctor, King for a day and Get that love were all very welcome new mixes to my ears. Also of note is the classic U.S remix of Lay your hands on me. The '88 remix of In the name of love is the same as that on the Greatest mixes release.

Mine was not, so I get a dismal 1.05 mbps speed to the AP. Not catastrophic, but not good either.Think about this: you want an access point when your router's range is insufficient. Which means, you have a large area to cover. Whenever you have large areas to cover, it's rarely the case that the point farthest from your router, might happen to be on the same electrical breaker.In sum, powerline adapters are really not great at what their primary application is supposed to be: to help cover distant parts of you house/office/building...However, if you happen to have the two parts (router and the access point) on the same electrical breaker, then great, go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off by techdepot","review":"I ordered this product 64mb smartmedia.

Some are vintage 1950s classics of the hard-boiled genre, while others are new published works from some of today's hottest authors. The classics are laced with subdued violence and implied sexuality, while some of the newer books are full of swearing, violence and sex. And, I've enjoyed all of them until now.STRAIGHT CUT by Madison Smartt Bell is a Hard Case Crime book that I just can recommend. It really is a long, meandering mess, and even as I read the final pages, I really didn't quite know for sure what was going on. Tracy seems to be in some sort of love triangle with his wife Lauren and best friend Kevin.

This fact is enough for his stepdaughter to question what happened to cause his death, and for her to set out with three friends to find out more about it.

Yeah, it's chock full of ear-candy. And sure it's affectionately done. I listened a couple of times and was compelled by none of it. Perhaps it's the conspicuous lack of tension.

It's one of the best movies I've seen in this genre. The story was exciting and for the most part close to believeable without too much effort put into suspension of disbelief. I mean, sure, there are a few two many coincidences occurring when a kid whose father has been framed and imprisoned winds up unintentionally stumbing on evidence which leads to his father's release and vindication, but the fun tone of the movie makes this easy to accept. The soundtrack and production were very strong. Some of the actors seemed a little inexperienced at times (and strangely enough, I'm talking about the adults in the movie and not the kids!), but overall they pulled it off and made a very fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"God given and inspirated by the Holyghost .","review":"The book was very powerful, and I related to the revelation by which Brian Fox was given by the Holy spirit.The Seed has uplifted my understanding of mankind in another way.Genetics play a big part in a persons future, good or bad.And the Holy Bible concured w/ The Seed scripturedly,mind blowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One way or the other","review":"Truman Capote has been widely criticised on the basis of his way of life and questioned about writing fact or fiction. In my opinion those who attack the author on the grounds of these critics miss the point, although they might seem quite successful. Capote in this book examines the depths of human nature, its marvels and horrors, no matter whether it is fact or fiction. I would not agree with those saying it is only 'Handcarved Coffins' that is worth to read. Every each story in this book has its own essence and personality, which makes it a valuable piece of literature, one way or the other. Deep thoughts in simple yet beautiful wording. I would strongly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handcarved Coffins is the only one worth reading","review":"Capote had pretty much destroyed himself by the time this volume was first published, still Handcarved Coffins is an extremely powerful piece of writing and worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.....just don't look too closely for the truth.","review":"One of the most purely enjoyable books I've ever read. Capote can paint a great image in just a few words. His economy is what I like most about him.This collection kicks off with a few fascinating short stories, then the main course: his 100 or so page novella 'Handcarved Coffins', his alleged investigation of a multiple murder in Kansas. Great stuff, a compelling read, but I'd take it with a pinch of salt.After that come a few pen portraits, including one of his dope-smoking cleaning lady which is very funny. There is also the revealing account of an afternoon with Marilyn Monroe (Capote is a shameless but fascinating namedropper, so be warned).In some ways the UK version has a better cover, a great photo of the author dancing with Marilyn Monroe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"I bought this after hearing \\"Fall\\" on the radio, once, back in 1995. It reminded me a little of the Cocteau Twins but with a male voice of course. I wasn't disappointed, most of the record is full of catchy, interesting songs and I tend to trot it out every couple years. Its a shame they never made another record but there was a lot of signing of alternative bands in the 90s capitalizing on the alternative craze so I guess we should be lucky we got one album out of them. Check out the official video for \\"Moon\\". Its on youtube and its pretty awesome, a low budget sci-fi deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The French have got this electronic-techno-thing down","review":"As many of the other reviewers have noted, if you liked Daft Punk's \\"Human After All\\" you're going to love this. This really is the epitome of what, to me, electronica should sound like. It's fast paced, non-stop, energetic and poppy. While bits and pieces of it get kind of sketchy, this album leaves you wanting more than the 13 tracks on here. Track 6, \\"The Past\\" is a hard-pounding bass adventure. It is very reminiscent of Phillip Glass' work on the \\"Qatsi\\" series with Godfrey Reggio. \\"La Rock 01\\" is one of the better known tracks off this album, and for good reason. It ties together everything that one can love about techno. The trippy loops, the bass line pumping, the mid coming up. It is a one song introduction to all things electronic. Overall, \\"OK Cowboy\\" is by far one of the better pieces of techno that I have heard in a long while. Seriously. If you even just liked Daft Punk, you'll love Vitalic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically Worthless.......","review":"I ordered this answer key/solutions manual to go along with my textbook, right? Well this is the worst excuse of a student's aid/solutions manual I have ever seen. It is only about 1 inch thick while the actual Giancolli textbook is 4x this size. Definitely disappointing. There are only about 5 to 10 solutions from the back of each chapter when given like 50 - 100 per chapter in the text book. How do you solve the other problems like it listed in the text book? You're on your own to figure that one out. Because the answer key is very limited on their choice of problems to show. Now, the ones they decided to show were helpful, they did not make it confusing, which is a plus, but that's the only thing I find helpful from buying it. To sum it up, don't buy this manual, you will waste your money.

By the end of the day, red paint had chipped off the cake platter and the velcro was pulling away from the sides of the cake slices. I thought my daughter and her 6-year-old sister would have a lot more fun with this toy. They love playing pretend house and store with their plastic foods, and they love having parties with their stuffed animals. They haven't played with this since the birthday. Also, I was disappointed that the wood tray didn't come with some sort of lid, even a plastic one. This toy was a bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy but paint chips easily.","review":"My kids love it. They use it all the time. I eat cake practically all day, if you know I mean. It is a great toy and can be educational to teach fractions and counting. Bad thing is that it is dropped often so the paint chips easily and the wood bends. If you don't mind having less than perfect looking toys I think that this toy is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy is exactly what you would expect","review":"I'm very happy I got this toy for my [...] son. He enjoys playing with it. Maybe not the proper way, but his way and as long as he is having fun that is all that matters. I do wish that the candle flames came off. It would be nice if they built the candle as two pieces (one piece candle and the second piece the flame). I believe another person thought this as well. Overall good toy, well built. I'm not sure how long it will hold my sons interest. But I think it is a toy that if stored away when he gets tired of it, it will eventually come back out again someday when he wants to play with it again. I would recommend this as well as many other Melissa and Doug toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand-me-down and gift.","review":"We got this set from a friend who had 2 girls that played with it. When we got it there was chipped paint on some of the more played with pieces, but since my daughter is past the 'toys in mouth' phase I don't mind (and she seems pretty diligent so far about keeping her toys out of her little sister's mouth) - I look at it as charm in wooden toys :) It still works as it should, and my daughter loves serving us cake (or pizza).I just bought this for her friend's birthday - I think she'll love getting a \\"birthday cake\\" for her birthday. I chose this both because my own child loves it, and also because I don't buy things for others that I wouldn't buy my own child - we love the durability of wood in this house, and M&D; has great customer service in my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 year old nephew and he loved it!!

First, as others have mentioned, there is no lid to the box. Annoying! Secondly, the paint does come off the pieces! Of course, being \\"food\\", kiddos are going to put pieces in their mouths to pretend-eat it. (Even though I always tell them not to!) It is very obvious which pieces have been in kids' mouths, due to the paint chipping and wearing off. Even if it's lead-free, it's not a great thing to have happen! Third, there are just too many little pieces for this mom's preference and I end up finding them strewn all through the house. And finally, it's just odd to me that the two of the cake toppings are jelly beans and gumdrops. Overall, I do not like this toy and would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to play Birthday party!","review":"Bought this for my 2 year old son who loves to play birthday party. He enjoys putting the different candies on each slice and adding a candle if needed. My 4 year old son also enjoys playing with it too. Durable and easy to swith the toppings.

I went in to buy this set at a local toy store and was saddened to see the Made in China label- in fact all the products that were in that particular store by Melissa and Doug were made in China. What bothered me about that fact was that they market themselves as USA made and that clearly isn't the fact anymore.I chose not to buy it anymore- particularly with the amount of red paint on this toy food product. Now they do say they test and test and safety test.But as a parent, I chose to not buy it anymore because of my concerns about product safety from China.Sad to say I will no longer be buying Melissa and Doug- the stuff is adorable I just can't be guaranteed of it's safety anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Play with","review":"My daughter just turned two years old and enjoys this toy.

It worked and I'd give it about 9 out of 10 rating scale on fixing the library's badly scratched discs. But a year later (maybe less!), it appears as if the internal gears are stripped. Apparently the gears inside are plastic and don't last long. Unfort., there's not much choice on CD scratch repair machines to choose from.

I think if she had a better script and if they used better actors, I think their acting abilities would rub off on her and help her become a better actress. Instead they used two other girls that we don't care about and that can't act and made the movie even more ickier.

Why does hollywood think we want to watch this worthless garbage? Brittany Spears is a talentless hack. Her time is almost over. She will soon come crashing down from atop her mountain of manufactured fame and fall flat on her giant over-exposed behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is one of the WORST movies I've EVER seen! Horrible story, horrible plot, horrible music, horrible acting!! Don't rent this movie, or buy it. If you want to see GOOD drama movies with AMAZING singers in movies, I recommend Jewel's movie \\"Ride with the Devil\\" and Mandy Moore's movie \\"A Walk to Remember\\" instead of this waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appropriate for kids","review":"I took my young daughter to see this movie and was so disappointed. The numerous adult themes in this movie was inappropriate for my daughter and what was expected to turn out to be a mother-daughter bonding did not materialize. This movie was horrible and strongly encourage parents to read a careful synopsis of the movie before going. This movie raises issue like rape, alcoholism, etc. that is inappropriate for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMES UP SHORTER THAN BRITNEY'S CUTOFFS","review":"Predictable and pandering, the 'plot' of this stinker includes a romance between a coming-of-age Britney Spears, a crisis involving one of the minor characters and an implausible finish, with a message that is probably the wrong one for its small target audience -- that it's fine to go 'all the way' before 18 and to then run away to LA where your dreams will come true, even if your voice sounds like tadpoles in mid-monsoon. Hard to take any of it seriously, or for that matter, to take it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong turn at the Crossroads","review":"I usually have a pretty high tolerance for trashy movies, but this girl-power road trip dreck made Swimfan and [almost] Bad Boys 2 look good. I couldn't even get through the whole film before departing. Watching Spears trying to be a thespian was painful. Granted she has some sort of indefinable allure on a certain market segment, but between her bland uninteresting features and ineffectual acting ability, I don't know which was worse. Poor Aykroyd, how he must pine for the old days of SNL and the Blues Bros. after a project like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"My friends and I went to see crossroads","review":"The acting was horrible, the singing was horrible, we just thought this movie was too long boring alot of the time, and we all agreed that glitter was better than this, a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!","review":"My friend told me she rented \\"Crossroads\\" for out slumber party. I said \\"Yay! I love that movie!\\" which I DO, the thing is I thought that she meant the movie called Crossroads with Ralph Macchio in it. I was in for quite a surprise when Britney's eerie grinning face popped up on the screen. At any rate, I did watch the movie and to put it bluntly, it sucked like a vacuum cleaner. It was bad, it made my IQ drop five points, you shouldn't run away screaming if someone tries to make you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking a Well Known Rule","review":"The majority of well-known music icons have no acting talent. If you want to sing, then sing. If you want to act, then act. Crossing the road between the two will cause great career disasters. For instance, did any new Brittney Spears albums come out after this movie was released? My point exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good laugh!","review":"I must admitt the only reason my friend I saw this movie was for a good laugh. And boy did we get a good laugh. During emotional times we could not help but laugh. Lucky for us so did everyone else, except for those \\"Brittany is the best\\" wannabes. The movie seemed to last forever. Brittany is done with high school, Brittany is in a car, Brittany sings, Brittany has sex, and then she sings again. Sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen video gone pg-13 (because it is).I give this movie a one for poor acting and a dumb plot; Five stars for all the middle school boyfriends and girlfriends, and a great laugh. Only see this movie if you find Brittany really hot, or you wannabe Brittany. Otherwise, skip spending your [price]."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't what i expected","review":"After seeing mandy moore, another pop singer, have a starring role in a WALK TO REMEMBER...i was excited to see britney spears with her own in CROSSROADS. i went to watch it with a friend and the outcome...big disappointment. for some reason, the storyline was weak. it was more of a mockery. i think it would've been a better if the characters had more depth...and the drama was all rushed. You didn't have time to develop feelings for the characters. if you want a more recent teen movie that will move you, i highly recommen A WALK TO REMEMBER. NOW THAT MOVIE IS A TEARJERKER. Mandy Moore does a good job by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO SAY?","review":"I'm so glad that people have enough sense to see how [bad] this is.Britney Spears can't sing so what made her think that she can act!

If any REAL actors were to be in this film, their careers would plummet big time. The movie is quite unrealistic and Britney is seen dancing in her bra and panties within the first ten minutes of the film and then again at the prom!! The DVD specials were boring, so I just turned it off! Please, don't count on seeing Zoe Saldana, Taryn Manning and ESPECIALLY Britney in any movies soon. I didn't like it.

Sellout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen!","review":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It's enough to make you snooze during it! The plot just made me sick, and you can tell that they just threw very unrealistic things it in without even thinking about it or using common sense just to push the movie on, and basically forgetting about a plot. I could have made this movie when I was 8 years old. I give it two thumbs down, and if I had any more thumbs i'd put those down too. This movie really only appeals to 13 year old girls. So choose the right road when you think about seeing crossroads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of warning for parents","review":"This movie has quite a few problems, not the least of which is confusion over what's it's core audience will be. the movie deals with very adult issues (including sex and underage drinking), but because Britney Spear's main audience is preteens or people not much older this movie should be handled with caution.Next the british press has already reviewed the film and there reviews are iffy at best. Everything from the plot to the aforementioned star's acting ability have been attacked, for that matter it is also difficult to find any review with something positive about the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"Ouch! That was the sound of my jaw hitting the floor over Britney Spears feeble attempt at acting. Somebody should tell her to stick to lip-syncing and dancing. But don't let her sing .... because SHE CAN'T SING! I've heard better noises from a fatally wounded rhino in the wild.I admit I never actually watched most of this, I couldn't get past the first few moments. YES, she's pretty. YES, she can dance. But those are NOT excuses to let her make a movie. She is one of the most prolific examples of how MTV is ruining the lives of modern youth by stuffing no talent pretty faces down our throats.

It is like one huge commercial!! No, seriously. Pepsi, Wet Seal and Brit's record company all got together and tried to think of the best way to exploit Britney and her movie. Whoa, it was weird. Oh well, she is hot, but the movie is utterly embarassing to intelligent humans.I have a feeling the only kids who will enjoy this are the ones who saw \\"Pearl Harbor\\" 65 times!!!!

The plot first off is weak, so it might not be all of Britneys fault. Although, she does not add anything to this film. She should stick to music..well she should stick to being half naked because she acts about as well as she sings...BAD! This is supposed to be a coming of age chick flick for teens, however I have a feeling it is only liked by hardcore pop music fans that are 12 since nobody over that age is really a pop fan. Other than them, this film should have no fans and the fact it has 4 1/2 stars makes me sick. I feel sick that I have to actually rate it 1 star, 0 stars better desribes this film.

Sometimes Britney came off very convincing and other times it seemed as though she was trying way too hard, especially in the dramatic scenes.Some of the things that occured seemed a little unrealistic and only happened because it was a Britney Spears movie (i.e. the bar scene). I think that Britney should have left her singing and skin-bearing persona at the door and really tried to delve into the character of Lucy. We hear Britney on the radio all the time, we don't need to hear her singing in a movie as well.Fans of Britney Spears will love this movie because there's plenty of her performing and being sweet and innocent. Others, however, will probably want to skip this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It's Britney Spears acting, what can I say? Basically, this movie serves as a vehicle for Spears to take her clothes off. I mean, the first glance we get of her, she's lip-synching in her bra and underwear. Where did Daddy's good little girl, as she supposedly is in the film, get the sexy pink lingerie she proudly models when she has sex for the first time with her nerdy boyfriend?All in all, if your a Britney fan, you'll definetly like this as it consist of her jumping around in no clothes and warbling like a duck as she usually does."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies i have ever seen","review":"this movie is BAD!!!!!!!!!! because it is unrealsitic and britney cannot act maddona is a better actress than she is.

It's suppossed to be a road trip and instead you are given miscarriages and date rape and parental rejection. Geesh, lighten up a little Brit!

I am only reviewing this in an attempt to bring the average number of stars down. I don't know how anyone can like this movie! I mean Britney Spears's inability to stay in character throughout the whole movie was really obvious and annoying. I don't know how anyone can think that this movie teaches morals. I mean, it's not at all realistic that a girl can go off and get in a car with a strange man without being taken advantage of or killed. And that whole premaritial sex thing...But it isn't only the immorality of the movie, but the annoyingly predictable plot that made it so awful. It was the stupidest movie I've ever seen.Oh, and that part when Britney reads her insightful poetry and it's her song lyrics was so stupid that I couldn't help but laughing out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than nothing","review":"This movie was a waste of time, energy, and money. It should never have been released. Britney may have played a silly young receptionist on a recent tv episode and appeared to do well but that is also a back to back comparison of insane britney and a step back up for her. I'm glad she's doing better, but let's face it, the girl can't sing worth a damn and she certainly could not act her way out of a paper bag when Crossroads was made. She might do better now in an insipid role like the \\"Mother\\" episode. I bought Crossroads from an amazon seller several years ago for 1 cent plus shipping, and it was a waste of the 1 cent and certainly of the shipping. I tried to give it away but nobody would take it so I finally tossed it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Were the Critics in the Bathroom?","review":"I saw Crossroads earlier this evening and I thought it was a great movie. Not THE Best I've seen but it was captivating and I plan on purchasing the DVD when it comes out. The plot is great. Not too cheesy or that much predictable but it expresses a great message. Britney does an okay job. She's a fine actress but I feel that she would have a hard time playing a charachter that doesn't ressemble the real-life Britney. I say this becuase her charachter, Lucy, is a lot like Britney in lots of ways. The rest of the cast is great. Almost all the characters are memorable in some way. I heard trash from the critics about this movie and I disagree. Granted it won't win an oscar but I feel it's worth your money. I give Crossroads four stars becuase I being a teenage male feel that most other guys my age would'nt get the full potential of the movie. At the theater there were a lot of young girls but don't let that stop you. I feel anyone get SOMETHING out of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give her a break!","review":"Alright, I, first off, did not want to see this movie because Britney Spears was in it. When I finally did go to see it, it was only because I thought the story line looked relativly interesting and I could handle Spears for 70 minutes. The movie was actually rather good. I liked the plot better than I thought I would and Britney was actually quite a good actress in her debut. The only part I thought was uncalled for and very obvious was that Britney Spears spent half of the movie or more half dressed. That was ridiculous. But other than that, it was a good movie and the PG-13 rating is a little high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney does it again","review":"Britney Spears is as cut as a button. And her new movie Crossroads is one of the greatest stories ever told. It is a tale of love, ambition, friendship, hardship and family, and Britney's acting abilities are the stuff of legend.

But once the movie started I was very syrprised that this movie was quite serious and that Britney Spears is actually a pretty good actress! She's not excellent, but I am impressed that she has a some talent. The other acotrs were very good also. Altogether, I thought this movie was very funny, and serious at some times, too. I would reccommend any Britney fan to go, and even if you're not a Britney fan, everyone would like something about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I'll admit the only reason I watched this movie is because I wanted to see if Britney was going to actually act or if they were just throwing her in a movie to make some quick bucks. And believe it or not I was shocked, she wasn't too bad! Nor was the story or the supporting cast. Although this is definately a teenaged movie, the kids will naturally LOVE IT because of ms Spears, likeise many will boycott it but like her or not this is a decent movie with or with out her.I do have to say though, it is rather cheezy and a bit unneccisary for her role to be that of an aspiring singer, any other profession would have probably been better and definately have taken the extra monterey jack flavor off the film, yet it still managed to keep my attention and interest right up until the credits!Watch it, I highly doubt you'll be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ALL AROUND GOOD MOVIE","review":"\\"CROSSROADS\\", featuring mega pop star, Britney Spears was actually a good movie.

Mandy Moore does a GREAT Job in that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not only does britney stink in singing but also in acting","review":"crossroads is one of the most boring movies i've ever seen and the most annoying part is singing in the car all the time.britney has no expressions in her face and is a horrible actress ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This loyal fan doesn't like Crossroads.","review":"I'm a loyal fan of Britney's since Baby One More Time, and I do not like this movie. It is boring, cheesy, and talks down to her fans. Far from Mandy Moore's A Walk to Remember, which was worth, well, remembering."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must admit it was...","review":"soooo good! if you are a teen/preeten who just wants to watch a nice happy ending movie you will love it. if you want a movie with morals and stuff like that this is not the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW, HOT, FUNNY, & A GOTTA SEE DVD!!!","review":"crossroads the movie is one of the best dvd's around!!! on the dvd it contains more than 3 hours of new & exciting footage!!! like britney spears music videos, 7 never seen before sences, \\"the making\\", and so much more!! you just have to buy it!! it's the perfect movie. it has laughing, crying, fighting, fliting, romance, singing, dancing, fasion, heartbreaks, and so much more! (in this movie anyway) i'm telling you it's a gotta see dvd!!! ... i rate it 5+ stars!!!!!!!! wow!! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie...","review":"This movie, is well...not good at all. I think Britney is okay and all, but she should have not agreed to do this movie. She's not a bad actress, but this movie is SOO typical. Imagine all the typical movie concepts, (prom night, road trips, a shy girl liking a \\"rebel\\" dude), and you get Crossroads. I do not recommend this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, less than one star","review":"...This movie isn't apropiate for anyone, and all it's about the things you need to stay away from, likehow its \\"uncool\\" to still be a virgin before you're married, getting drunk, and dating guys you hardley know. Moms, don't let your kids see this movie no matter how old they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Attrocity of Gargantuan Proportions","review":"We all know that singers(yes I use that word lightly here) should not make movies. After seeing Glitter with Mariah Carey I was positve that there could not be a worse movie made. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Crossroads stands for everything that is wrong with our country and this world. All I could wish for the entire movie was a Thelma and Louise ending of driving off the cliff in a convertible. This wish first occurred during the opening credits. I was even willing to sacrifice myself and drive the car off for them because then my children and future grandchildren would never have to hear Britney Spear's squeaky voice that sounds more like an Amazon Red headed parrot in heat than a millionaire pop star. Please people, do not buy this movie. The only reason to buy it would be to collect every copy and burn them all in hopes that Crossroads could be erased from our memories and DVD players forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be the worst piece of cinematic trite I have ever seen!!","review":"First of all I want to say that I have been a Britney Spears fan from before she became god's gift to pop music, so my view is fairly objective. Secondly, if I could give this film 0 stars, I would. The acting in this film is deplorable, the characters are a bunch of talking heads, and the story is far past the point of ridiculous. Britney and Anson Mount have zero chemistry in the love scene in the film. Perhaps the best part of the movie is in the beginning when virginal Lucy (Britney's character) and the scared high school boy (obviously also a virgin) who wanted to sleep with her after the prom were fumbling around in a hotel bedroom. At least that part came off as funny, because the rest of the film was trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This video removed my soul. I was once human, but now I have become something... less than I was. I wish I could remember what is is like to be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheese anyone?","review":"I went to go see this movie because, to be completely honest, I was curious. After Justin Timberlake's HORRIFYING stab at acting, I had wondered if Britney would follow suit.Her preformance wasn't as Vomit-inducing as Justin's, and I give her credit because this was probably her first real stab at acting. BUT MY GOD. THAT STORY LINE!!! I got out of the theatre with I thought: \\"I just paid [money] to see a 2hr after-school special. what a rip. oh well, at least Anson Mount is a hottie.\\"Given that this is Britney's first major role in a movie and that I wasn't expecting much to begin with (b/c of precedence set by Justin), I decided to cut her some slack. Not everyone is an actor, but with a little work (and a better story line, preferrably one she doesn't come up with) I think that Britney can become decent actor.Britney Spears get two stars for her valiant (yet VERY cheesy) movie acting debut, and one star for Anson because of above mentioned reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"RETARTED","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen... britney spears is the worst actress I have ever seen. It could have been a beautiful movie about great female relationships, but Britney Spears spoiled it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy excuse for a movie","review":"honestly, if it weren't for the \\"starring Britney Spears\\"-thing, i don't think this movie would even be known. britney is not very much gifted with acting talent. i think she should just stick to singing. and what's with the three of them sitting together like telling the whole story. i mean, it does kinda throws the climax for movies. there wasn't really anything in the story that'd make you think or make guesses as to what could have or would have happened. the story was totally predictable owing it to that revelations the stars did. the only thing i liked about this movie was that it was shown for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money (and talent?)","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I was on an airplane, flying down to Mexico. The second time, I saw it on an airplane, flying back. It was painful --- both ways.I was surprised that Britney Spears can act. She's not that bad, really. I was also surprised that the filmmakers put the cheesecake right up front --- the movie begins with two scenes of Britney dancing in her underwear and wearing lingerie for her boyfriend (Warren Cheswick). After that, the movie goes downhill fast. There's not much of a plot, Britney's co-stars can't act at all, and the climax is a strange combination of unbelievable and predictable. I guess you shouldn't hope for more than this, but I did. If Britney Spears is so famous, why can't she star in a smart, entertaining, GOOD movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it is always smart to focus on what you do best","review":"Britney is a great singer. I only hope she'd keep to her singing, and not dabble into something that can only detract from her brilliant career.This movie is a waste of precious time. The story is a flop, and the acting is way too predictable. If you don't have better things to do with both your time and money, or if you are a die-hard fan of Britney's, you may not mind this tripe called a movie. For the rest of us however, we'll have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Argh! I hated this movie! It was like a long bad soap opera that wouldn't finish! Maybe younger children would like it, but I advise you NOT to buy it...or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece of ...","review":"Don't even ask me what possessed me to rent this movie. Everybody and everything in this movie was horrible. It reminded me of Britney herself- a piece of fake ditzy junk. I recommend that you do not even waste 1 and a half hours of your life on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hm hm hm","review":"Went to see the movie here in Denmark with my daughter. Acting - was a bit on \\"thin ice\\" but if you put all the \\"pop\\" movies in to one hat (Spice Girls, Madonna, and others) pick one and you have seen them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG!","review":"There's a reason why aspirins exist.After seeing this (I had nothing better to do), I reached for a bottle of Tylenol.I thought that this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've never liked Britney Spears, and I never will, and seeing this movie made it even worse! She can't act at all, and the story line lacked...well, everything. Personally, she needs to stick to something she's good at, and it's definitely not acting and singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy dialog, bad acting.","review":"I don't blame the actors for the bad acting...they didn't have a good script to work with. This movie looked sort of cute and it started off sort of cute, but ended up being a dud. It was about the worst movie I saw this year...it's a close runner with Vanilla Sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Acting ... Predictable","review":"Everyone knew it would happen.Britney Spears is an actress , or at least tries to be.Mariah Carrey,Lance Bass,Joey Fatone, and Mandy Moore have all done it and failed.With the exception of the wonderful and talented Mandy Moore.Leave it Brit to play a goody-two shoes then lose her virginity to an ex-con.Does she know how old her fans are? My sister is 6!!! I thought A Walk To Remember was much better and Mandy Moore is a better singer and actress than Britney Spears .The only reason Brit sells more CD's is that she shows off her chest and stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be no stars","review":"Not even schmaltz. Absolute trite crap-ola. Insults the intelligence of any teenager with more than 2 brain cells. Also does a disservice to one of Joan Jett's best songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite","review":"I love you girl but britney cant act!!! this sript is horrible and she acting is worse just lets put this in the back of the shef and forget it ever happened...please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney at her best!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Britney proves that she can act and isn't a ditsy southerner. She is amazingly talented and I know she'll be around forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a really cute movie. And as in other reviews I didn't think the acting was that bad. Some people have to realize Britney isn't an actor she is a singer. So you can't compare Britney's acting to some like Kirsten Dunst, or Julia Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Doll in the movie","review":"Britney looks more like a Barbie Doll in the movie.. pretty, pretty and pretty still. And that's about all you are getting from the movie. It is rather obvious that this movie is meant for all her fans who strongly believe in everything she does. The movie has such a poor storyline that nothing else makes the movie more interesting than keeping one wondering what a lower budget this movie is all about. Britney is so talented in the movie that she can sing out the whole song/music before she has a chance to finish listening to what that guy has composed the tune for her using her written poems... utterly unconvincing.I like Britney... but I have to confess that this is really a turkey movie with no talent acting and poor storyline in it. Go for her \`Live from Las Vegas', which is much more entertaining than this.. this is what she does best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poo = Crossroads","review":"I saw two guys kissing once in the park, that was the gayest thing I had ever seen.....Until I saw CrossRoads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Chick-Flick","review":"This movie was awful. I only saw it because my girlfriend made me go with her. I knew this movie would be bad, but I didn't know it would be god-awful. I was so bored though the entire thing, and it was like watching a soap opera but with more scantily clad cast members. Don't waste your time or money watching this ...! In fact, I will sum up the entire movie for you right now: Britney Spears dancing around in small clothing and occasionally whining. There. Now you don't have to torture yourself any further by seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"I went to go see Crossroads the weekend it came out. I was coming in the movie with an open mind because I have heard good and bad things about this move. A bunch of my friends went to see it with me and we were all disappointed. Crossroads was such a boring movie!!! It is really short and doesn't have any plot. You can just watch the first 10 minutes of it and predict the rest of the movie. Most importantly their was no climax. Why waste time and money on a movie that has no twist??? This was one of the wrost movies I have seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I can't say because after I bought it I found out I can't watch it on my iPad. Really made me mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"Why is this so expensive?! I don't think that this movie is worth $50.00 at all. Yes, This just crazy, why would anybod want to buy a two hour movie that is over $20. I am actually extremely disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"unintentually humorous","review":"I would have given the book 1 star, except all the implausibilities & mistakes started making me laugh. The main characters are always making such idiotic choices that it's a wonder they're still alive. And not just because there's a killer on the loose.To name one thing out of many: what kind of FBI office doesn't have field people on call, even on Thanksgiving? The little museum is staffed that day, but FBI field agents can't be brought in?? And how does the Thanksgiving turkey get thawed instantly?I MUST add one quote: \\"It's like finding a straw in a haystack,\\" Cortez said tersely as he stared intently ahead. If you remove the seed head from hay, you get straw, so it's not difficult at all, is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Sunrise","review":"I loved this book from A-Z, it has it all, suspense, love, thrills. It lacks the usual trite phrases which is what I loved best. It's a story that I will read again. A long time ago I read the first book about the two main characters, it's too bad I don't remember the title, I'd read it again. Loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well researched!","review":"The romance of this was fairly well. But this writer usually has her hero worry about the age difference. She is early twenties. If he has been in the military at the end of the Vietnam war, he would probably be in his late 40's. Also, real FBI agents don't get lay people that involved in an ongoing case, and almost get them killed, for romance sake. And, if you are out in the snow for that long, in such flimsy attire, you won't instantly be interested in romance, and worry about going to a crime scene! And anyone who is being stalked by a killer, who goes out alone to prune roses, which do not bloom in winter anyway, is an absolute moron! I adore romance thrown in with a good police procedural, but only if it is believeable and well researched.As another reviewer said about a previous novel by this writer - please, Ms Palmer! Find a different formula. They break up, she gets hurt, he comes running - same old, same old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Diana...","review":"'Before Sunrise' was, sadly, quite a disappointment. I've read a lot of Diana Palmer's books and usually I love the formulaic tough, slightly misogynist man vs. younger, sometimes TSTL but gusty woman. This one, however, I had to force myself to finish. These two were made out of cardboard, no depth whatsoever. I think perhaps someone forgot to 'insert personality traits HERE'. Diana... time to fire your assistant cos s/he's doing a faff job and get yourself a good one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to have been sitting around ...","review":"Waiting to be published since the mid 1990s. The problem is that this book starts in 1994, and finishes up 3 years later (in 1997). Which could explain the discrepancy between the male lead's stated age and the age he should be if this was set in 2005. Anyway, the issues I have with this book is much like those put forth by other readers: it's dated, formulaic, and just ridiculous in parts. A timepass read, but look into JD Robb, Patricia Cornwell, or Kathy Reichs for a \\"police procedural with romance\\", not Diana Palmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got my money back!","review":"A good friend of mine (NOT!) told me what a good writer Ms. Palmer is a few years ago. I read one or two of the small paperbacks. They were ok. But this one! Give me a break. A agree with another reviewer. This guy is too yound to have been a soldier in Vietnam. Do the math! And the heroine! What a wimp. And anybody that thinks this novel is a \\"good police procedural\\" combined with romance has never read authors like J.D. Robb or Patricial Cornwell. The bookstore clerk told me she had never know anyone to bring one of this author's novels back for a refund. First time for everything. If I ever read one again, it will be paperback, and used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by the positive reviews","review":"This book covers all the basic fabric painting techniques, but the resulting fabrics are muddy looking and uninspired.

You have all varieties of pop in these beautiful love songs, sure track 9 is a little stalking like but what 80s, first half 90s love songs aren't? His compilations (volume 1 & 2) with the london orchestra are wonderful but here are the roots of those old hits. This cd and Los Hijos Del Sol are my favorite ones. They have the most lovely, heart broken songs of his career. How to deal with all the facets of love, relationships, lost ones, ect... I love all his cds, he do great work writing love songs.

This book is by far the biggest disappointment I have made in the purchasing of published materials in the last 6-7 years. The photos being presented for examples with which to draw inspiration feel and appear as though they are about 30 years in the past. I applaud the book for its safe use of babies as models. There aren't any ideas in the book that would cause a fauxtog to endanger a child by doing something stupid in the name of copy-catting the work a professional spent hours accomplishing in photoshop. This book is severely outdated, save your money and buy a book on lighting or a new tripod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Paper!","review":"This book is horrible! Has nothing interesting in it. It's more like an scrapbook of the author's daughter. No useful tips besides what most people already know: make use of natural light and avoid flash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst album Richard Thompson ever made","review":"I personally think there is no real defending this album. Rt is right that this is a flat out bad album. Restless Highway sounds good at first but it really is a poorly constructed song. Don't Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart is a good song but not on this release. The band that backs Thompson up here is more of a country-rock band which does not fit at all. Plus, there is a lot of filler. Sweet Surrender, Layla and Pavanne are all throwaways. The only song of any significance is House of Cards and by the time it arrives, one has given up on the album entirely.Overall, this felt like a quickly rushed album that really doesn't need to be heard except for die-hard Thompson fans (like the ones reading this review). This release can be found on cassette but don't expect much. I guess no artist can be perfect as, in my opinion, this is the only flat out bad album he ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisters of Mercy Who?","review":"I'm a huge Sisters of Mercy fan and surprisingly never had exposure to Xymox or Clan of Xymox. I'm pleasantly pleased with their gothic sound and vocal talent. A Peter Murphy sounding lead singer! Just awesome! I'm seeing Clan of Xymox in Philadelphia in October and hope to memorize every song before the show. If anybody has seen them, let me know what to expect. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"why goth sucks","review":"Once upon a time, Clan of Xymox used to be a unique and interesting dark electro-pop band; now they're satisfied with sounding like every other two-bit goth band out there [if you'd have told me that most of these songs were by Love Like Blood, I'd have believed it]. The lead singer has such a wonderful voice. It's a shame he feels he needs to hide it behind the requisite Andrew Eldritch growl. This is the reason goth sucks: yes, Bauhaus was a good band; yes, Sisters of Mercy was a good band; but there can be so much *more*, and there used to be, at least, in Clan of Xymox. When every new band only strives for mediocrity and knocking off one or two good bands from fifteen or twenty years ago, there's something wrong with the genre. Can you say stagnation, boys and girls?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I think the way Ashleigh treated her pony was dreadful. And why is she so excited about getting a horse?

I am now on book 5 and all of the stories so far a good,light romantic stories. They are not very racey. The love scenes are short and sweet for the most part. Nothing erotic in this series. The characters are very good. Not just the main characters but all of them.The nice thing is some of the characters show up in the other books in a very inventive way. Some of the characters turn out to be the main person in the next book. Good writing I guess you would say. So far I have really enjoyed the stories and each one has had a good and differnt plot. I am used to reading Berrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more sexual romance.

With Bryce, you produce wonderful landscape in no time. But when you want better control on the software, you need more. This book takes you a lot further than the basic manual. Not just by its comparison of Mac/Win behavior, but by its numerous advises, tests, things to look at, and its simple, entertaining language.

After reading a chapter, I wonder, \\"what is this chapter about?\\"Don't buy this book--the only reason that I bought this book is because we use this text book in our class.

The formula are listed at the end of the book, but their implementation isn't always clear from reading the book.The book also makes you look up a lot of values on tables for the equations .... It's a bit of a pain.The Solutions manual, however, was conceived in the eye of the PChem Devil. The manual features wanton plug and chug of equations, without showing which equations to use.

Standard physical chemistry textbooks I looked at, such as Atkins, did not cover the biologically relevant topics I was interetsed in.This book contains just the right depth for a reference in biophysical chemistry. The concepts are always presented with biological applications in mind. The topics coveredare exactly what I was looking for, including thermodynamics, kinetcs, quantum chemistry and the theory behind the main biophysical techniques,I was originally intending to buy the 3 volume Cantor and Schimmel series, but I have found that this book gives me everything I need for a much lower price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to buy suplementary text","review":"This book is packed with information!!!... now good luck trying to sort through it all.

So boring. One of the new mixes of Ultra Nate adds some vocal flavor, and finally, much later on, He Gives More lures you into thinking the party has finally begun. On the brightside, this Billboard Dance Chart club hit runs over 7 minutes. Then, to put a club anthem like Joint Is Jumpin on here in a 4 minute dub medley with another track just goes to show how badly they missed the mark here.

This album is SOOOO incredibly boring and dull and I can not get into to it, and its supposed to be best of the H albums. Today I tried, for the third time to get this album to click, but turned it off in the middle of the 7th song. I can not make it from beginning to end, no matter how hard I try.You would think the whole band left when Fish did, since this sounds nothing like Fish-era. There's no energy, or charisma or balls. Its so bland, passive and wimpy. I seriously think I hate this album, but that is just my personal opinion. I know a lot of people love this album and I respect that. I just wish I could be one of them. I love Fish-era Marillion passionately and its a true Prog crime that he only had 4 albums with the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marillion's most ambitious and emotional album to date","review":"I found out about this by simply seeing it is a local music store. As I regret to say, I didn't buy the album when I saw it. I just looked at it and thought \\"What a cool looking cover!\\" At that point in time I just starting to get into Marillion, so I neglected to buy it. I finally ordered this album online, and needless to say I am happy I did. This album is beautiful and emotional. It is a challenge to listen to if you have a patience level of -30. As Marillion keyboardist Mark Kelly said \\"You must listen to this album in its' entirity. It's not a sound bite record with a collection of nice little ditties.\\" This album is dark and symphonic. One of the single most emotional albums I have ever heard. Oh...and Steve Rothery (Marillion's guitarist) shocked the hell out of me with his virtuosity. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits like a brick.","review":"This album is an amazingly potent description of the alienation brought on by modern life. Hypocrisy, child abuse, and the difficulties of connecting emotionally after enduring all of that are brilliantly portrayed in the lyrics. The music sweeps from one track to another in true concept-album style. Especially impressive is the band's command of the energy of the music- soft, mellodic passages give way to crashing chords at exactly the right time to match the emotional progression of the songs.Although I haven't heard Marillion.com yet, this is easily the best work they've done prior to that album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals sink this one.","review":"This is the most progressive recording by Marillion since Fish's departure. In spite of the considerable talents of the musicians within the band this recording suffers considerably due to the poor performance of Steve Hogarth the vocalist. When he restrains himself his vocals are listenable but seem out of place within the context of prog-rock. When he cuts loose he is in danger of sounding a fair bit like the Jon Bon Jovi's of the world. He over-emotes and leaves the music sounded as dated as an 80's era hair band. Marillion really need to consider a change in the vocalist's chair. Hogarth just doesn't cut it. Return to Fish era Marillion or turn to the Flower Kings or Transatlantic. Save your money and give this one a pass..Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"This CD actually caused me to be embarassed to be a Marillion fan.

I'm a huge Marillion fan, especially the Steve Hogarth era. I absolutely could not get into this CD. It's slow, momotonous, never picks up.

It is just boring. It is hard to believe that with all of the great unknown prog bands that Marillion is one of the more known ones. Lesser known prog bands like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard blow them out of the water. Do not waste your money on this unless you want music to put you to sleep. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I give Marillion credit for trying to keep the prog name alive.

This is my first exposure to Marillion and I had no idea what to expect. The band is very talented and the production is so slick that no one instrument really stands out. Please know that I liked what I heard right away, but I just could not select a category to put this band into and I still don't. It's progressive and it rocks but even if you turn up the volume it doesn;t really rock very hard. It's like soft rock or something. Anyway whatever it is, I am going to buy some more of it because it is \\"soothing\\" and \\"melodic\\" and it makes me feel good.

Thanks Marillion! - Ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta have it!","review":"I cannot believe only one previous reviewer. This is an excellent two cd set, the sound is excellent although the bottom end sometimes pushes my speakers to their limit. You have to listen to this cd in one sitting as it is too adictive to get up and leave unfinished. I can't explain why I keep playing this work but there are moments that you can't get out of your head. This is IMHO one of Marillions best and if any other band produced a cd of this calibre I would have rated a five.

It's a concept-album, meaning that the album has a central theme. In the case of Brave, it's a girl walking on a suspension bridge (which wasn't allowed). When the police picked her up, she refused to speak. All songs on the album have a reference to this story. The album's mood is dark and highly emotional. Most fans agree that this is their best album, and Marillion's Mark Kelly admits that the song 'The Great Escape' is \\"the best thing we've done so far\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have...","review":"All these reviews point to many aspects of this album...good or bad. Plain and simple, this album is a triumph. Musically, it is deeply textured and diverse, creating an atmosphere of sound that paints a vivid backdrop for the theme. Vocally, Hogarth hits home. He delivers the lyrical content with a true balance of emotion and power. There are some parts that could be removed without missing them...but not enough to detract from the over all strenght of the album. If you didn't see it in the initial Marillion albums with Hogarth, then this album, by far, punctuates the fact that this band is capable of so much more, leaving Fish behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The progressive rock masterpiece of the 90's","review":"In the 70's you had Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\", Genesis' \\"Lamb lies down on Broadway\\", Pink Floyd's \\"The wall\\"... in the 90's we have Marillion's \\"Brave\\". 70 minutes of outstanding rock, ballads, jazz, even gaelic at the beginning of \\"Brave\\". My favourite now is \\"Paper lies\\", but tomorrow I'll probably change my mind. The finest moment, when H sings \\"I was terrified most of the time...\\". If you are tired of always hearing the same song (how boring is grunge and post-grunge!), try this. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD.. poor quality control","review":"I really like this CD, have been a fan of Marillion for a long time. But EMI did a poor job on quality control when it came to the liner notes. The covers (front and back, and inside front and back) are correct, but the inside pages containing the lyrics or not for Brave, they are for Holidays in Eden. I thought this was a fluke.. but got a second one and it had the same problem. Not sure ow wide spread this problem is, I have been unable to get an answer. So if not having the proper liner notes is not a problem get this one..if not having the proper liner notes is a problem beware when ordering. But get this if you are a Marillion fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant: yes, immediately obvious: no","review":"It's been said before but it bears repeating again- this album takes time but it's worth the effort. At first I could only get thru the first half and then I fell asleep or lost interest. Months and months went by before I decided to give it another try since I appreciate the band so much. A few more spins and WOW!! It all came together- the drama, the fury, the mystery and the pure awesomness of it all. It's a ride. You dont just listen to this album, you experience it, and I think that's what takes getting used to. This album gets inside my blood, I see now it is a VERY special album.

The story, told from the perspectives of a few instead of many would of been more effective. 2) Random violence that, although building depth in characters, was yucky to read through. 3) The sexual relationship between the Dragon Lord and his male singer was weird for me.

Sandy's singing is mesmerizing to say the least. (Warning: Bold statements follow.) This single song is Brit folk rock's finest moment. This song set the vibe for Liege and Lief, which is Brit folk rock's masterpiece.

Far from apologizing for his directness, he would go on to make yet another Classic album (\\"I Ain't Marching Anymore\\") which would be even more direct than this one. \\"All the News That's Fit to Sing\\" is a Masterpiece and belongs in the collection of every music fan worthy of the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless look at a turbulent time in our history","review":"Ochs wit and sensitivity exceeds that of his contemporaries.

Although more conventional stylistically than Dos Passos's revolutionary montage, Angel Pavement shares with that work a rich and engaging realism. Read it, and you will *be* in 1930s London, following the lives of a group of employees of a veneer and furniture inlay business. The cast of characters is ordinary, yet fascinating; their work and what happens to them isn't all that unusual, either, yet you *will* care. Priestley shows myriad skills here: His ear for dialogue, including dialects, is impeccable; his descriptive powers, making use not only of sights but sounds and smells to create a scene, are keen; and he writes with an effortless and pleasing style.

The funny thing about this book is how many of the \\"before\\" drawings, as inept as they are, are better than the slick easy cheesy \\"after\\" drawings.

The transformation of students' drawings in the class were awesome. It was incredible for an instructor to see.The information helps a skilled artist understand why they can do what they do and, in many cases, how to make the transfer to the right brain thinking happen faster.

I always enjoy reading about my hobbies, when I can find thoughtful points of view that go beyond how-to guides. I enjoyed the book, in that way. Also, Dr. Edwards offers practical exercises -- not that they are necessarily unique to this book -- that I found helpful. On the other hand, some of the underlying philosophy is... well, a little goofy. For example, one of the experts she cites repeatedly, professor Charles Tart, is best known as a proponent of the \\"sciences\\" of the paranormal (ESP, psychic communication, near-death experiences, and so on).

When they do I immediately recommend they try reading this book. I find it's a book which is very accessible for people with no background in drawing or painting.

For reference and practice again the exercises.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a Different Book!","review":"When the first book came out many years ago I was extremely excited, and actually wrote my senior thesis for my Art Education degree about the right/left brain theory. I used the material from the first book to instruct the kids in my classes when I began to teach. Then I paid a lot of money to go see Betty Edwards give a lecture. I was disappointed, turned off, and my whole image of Ms. Edwards was crushed. Now the new book...my true opinion is that she is trying to reinvent the material to make a few more bucks. This book has some viable exercises, and would be fine for the non-drawing person who needs some direction. However, there are a lot of other books (like The Natural Way to Draw) that are a whole lot better. Betty Edwards is not God's gift to learning how to draw...practice and determination are. My advice? Get a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new drawing on the right side of the brain","review":"totally completely disappointed...over 300 pages of psychology...very little instruction in technique...very few samples that were large enough to actually see...if i hadn't gotten a great price and if i wouldn't have to pay postage...again...i'd return it...disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for people who REALLY can't draw","review":"I'm sure this book might help some. I was under a different impression when I bought this book, I expected more, some excersizes for more advanced artists and not just for beginners, but this book is strictly for those who simply can not draw. This book just wasn't for me and so I found it unhelpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drawing Instruction","review":"The book is a terrific step-by-step instruction on drawing. The exercises were very useful and built confidence. The book shows that drawing is a skill that can be learned with the proper instruction. The book was easy to read and understand. You should purchase the workbook, VCR tape and other materials to maximize the benefits of the program. I liked the book so much that I bought another book by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book......","review":"wow...First I just wanted some book to improve my drawing skills and after buying this i just cant imagine the way i improved my skills thanks to Dr.Edwards and her team for such a wonderful creation.This is just like a crah course which has changed my skills so rapidly and the examples given are so good that a beginner can also understand what drawing is all about and how to use the rght hand part of the brain in a proper way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ac","review":"The exercises provided in this book will teach you how to draw accurately from life. They are flawless. Both succinct, and supportive, Betty Edwards provides an excellent, solid bedrock of technique for you to simply sit down and draw exactly what is in front of you. Be it a still life or a life model, the techniques explained in this book are there for you to utilize.This book has nothing whatsoever to do with creativity. It concerns itself with realistic life drawing - the foundation of any visual creative endeavor.The triumph of this book is not that it contains any new revelation. Indeed, much of what is taught can be found in The Natural Way to Draw by Kim Nocolades. The triumph of this book is that it simply teaches it in a better, more experienced way - with more clarity and brevity. This book knows how to \\"Teach\\" drawing from life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good techniques, but must skip the lengthy explanations","review":"The techniques, tips and basic explanations are great. Amazingly, you can teach yourself to significantly improve your drawing just by reading this book. On that account, I recommend it. However, I could do without the lengthy explanations (an entire chapter in one instance) justifying the switching from left-to-right brain teaching method. They are written as if Edwards had to justify her method to the academic, peer-reviewing audience, whereas most people buying this book do not fall into that category. The method is basic and easily understood, and the repeated explanations become annoying. I ended up skipping several sections and just going from exercise to exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawing","review":"Having given up finding someone with the time to collaborate with the children's books I'd like to write for possible publication, I decided to take a beginning drawing class at the Adult school. Our talented/kind/patient teacher recommended this book. It has been very helpful to me. I never in a million years would have believed that drawing was in my future, but it is and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience garbage","review":"I'll keep this short. The exercises in this book are similar to what you'd encounter in a beginner's drawing course. They emphasize drawing from SIGHT rather than KNOWLEDGE, a counterintuitive but essential step in learning. Drawing what you \\"see\\" is Edward's main point.My problem with Edwards is in the way she uses pseudoscience bunk to establish her voice. The left-brain/right-brain notion is outdated and has little to do with making art. Yet this garbage makes the bulk of Edward's text. Her attempts to tie her theory with the exercises are embarrassing. I just can't read her book with a straight face.If you are a beginner looking for a kick start guide, try \\"Keys to Drawing\\" by Bert Dodson. It's to the point and free of the psychological nonsense Edwards loves so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"FISH OR CUT BAIT.","review":"I agree with the author on most points, but she wastes too much time indoctrinating converts with her nifty science of brain processing.I'm impatient with authors who inflate and bloat their books to reach a specific page count publishers prefer. The essential information gets buried in the unnecessary noise. Make it lean and mean and use the extra pages for a coloring book of the book's salient points."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best basic textbook of visual arts available ... period!","review":"I used this book in a high school art class 20 years ago and bought the updated version recently when I picked up the pencil again after all these years. It the best basic manual ever written as far as I know. Once you work thru this book you are ready to attack advanced sketching, colored pencil, watercolor, pastel ... anything! If you combine this manual with media-specific books you could essentially become at least a good hobbiest in any media, perhaps more, depending on your potential. I went from this book to subject-specific sketching manuals, then to watercolors and am quickly regaining proficiency after a VERY long layoff. What you'll learn from this text is applicable to any visual art form. I wonder how many of these things have sold? Millions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it. :B","review":"I started reading this book from a paperback at my local library and I enjoyed it enough to buy it on my kindle. Although if you're really trying to improve you're artwork I suggest you get the \\"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain Workbook\\" as it focuses directly on the excersises and less on science and psychology. Which is interesting but examined overly in detail in the main book and may bore some. Also, one of the first excersises calls for a bit of tracing which doesn't work on kindle, whoops!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"My college art instructor tried to tell his class about drawing on the right side of the brain but he could not explain it nearly as well as this book does. The exercises contained in the book are very helpful to art students."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone and everyone","review":"The original \\"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\\" was my text book for high school art class. I've gone through the whole book twice and since used it in teaching others to draw. It is an excellent book for all levels of skill, if you feel that you can't draw or if you have natural talent. The step-by-step instruction and exercises are clear and well researched. This book has been tested and used, and it theories and methods are sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this product","review":"I ordered this after reading it can help someone get off caffeine.

I would recommend this series to anyone who has a love of history or someone who is open to ideas of the people in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bones","review":"I bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences, instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go. Very aggravating, then oh yes, this is by the way, where we were, toodle oo on the next tale, or a portion of it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch cable!!","review":"I have worked in the 'Osteoarchaeology' field for nearly 10 years and I when I bought this book I did not expect to be reading a novel type book. Books like this are dramatised on frequently watched cable/network tv - I live in Ireland! I have used other books by the author and found them invaluable, but not this.....an ok read but dreadful reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I hoped.","review":"This book starts out interesting enough with a murder case, but the conclusion of that case was never established and the following chapters deal with other cases that are equally incompletely resolved. The chapters that deal with how to distinguish human bones from animal, how to differentiate between the races and sexes are better but the detail he goes into is very slight. This book didn't live up to billing. In comparison, the novel \\"Deja Dead\\" (by: Patricia Cromwell) was much better in providing a window into forensic anthropology due to the beautiful details that she used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realstic approach to Forensic Anthropology","review":"This is a fantastic read. I had to read it for a class and enjoyed it very much. This is not a reference book, but rather a book geared toward the \\"armchair\\" forensic anthropologist. Ubelaker does a great job at incorporating his personal experiences with forensic method in a way that is not disturbing or as graphic as it could be. Anyone who has seen any of the television shows where forensics is used would probably enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a memoir","review":"Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be cautious","review":"I have always had excellent service with amazon, but with this product it continues to read region error.

I bought the LP when it first came out in the late 80s then upgraded to the CD when the vinyl was worn out. High energy dance music (good for listening to while cleaning the house!). I just love these classic soukous, which start out slow then pick up the tempo about 1/2 through the cut, i.e. when the percussionist, lead and rhythm guitarists launch into the \\"seben\\". Amour Fou and Bayembi are nice long tracks which just soar. You will, too. Diblo \\"diamond fingers\\" Dibala's arpeggio style solos have never been better. Astounding speed, accuracy, and sensitivity on the frets. I get a kick out of Kanda when he stands back during the solos and shouts encouragement. I read somewhere that he asked Diblo to slow down during the recording session!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful listening music","review":"we've enjoyed this album and recommend it to anyone seeking beautiful relaxing romantic music. wonderful selection of songs, all winners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best toy for your buck!","review":"I bought this cd player for my daughter for Christmas this year and buy Mon. evening the tab to keep the lid closed had already broken.

I'd like to put this in musical or poetic terms, but they just don't do justice. If you haven't experienced Nick Drake, your life is not yet complete.If you're just starting out on your collection, save yourself some time and money and just buy the boxed set. It's everything he ever recorded, which you'll eventually buy anyway, and this way you get a nice box and a book with lyrics.

I even read his biography (although I wish the author could have found more people that actually knew anything about Drake's life). It makes me happy that so many people have written their own reviews for the Fruit Tree collection. He is great, isn't he? We're lucky his music is still around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Class RCA Tools","review":"Denise Robitaille's book is of great value to anyone in search of a guide for determining true root cause.

I have most of his movies (especially the westerns) on VHS or DVD. I believe that he epitomizes the cowboy (and perhaps the American) persona and spirit. Having said this..I hated this movie. I found the characters plastic, the story flawed and predictable, and the history atrocious...I'll admit that many of the JW movies have their warts, especially one of my favorites, \\"BIG JAKE,\\" but what they lack in polish, story and even \\"good\\" acting is usually more than compensated-for by the \\"true grit\\"(pun intended) of Wayne's performance. Not here...he is generally sidelined throughout this movie as sort of a community patriarch and observer..his performance just doesn't overcome the poor acting and storyline of this movie.

He did take the dvd to his friends place to have him play it on his DVD player and it would not play there either. I don't know whether to believe him or not. He took it to Fred Myers in WA they tried playing it and it wouldn't. According to him there are no scratches or smudges on the disk.

But this may be one of his worst. The Duke had a maddening habit of surrounding himself with bad actors. But often the movie was good enough to overcome this fault. This one is not. The music is flat out horrible, almost funny it's so bad, and the script is rediculous. It is historically inaccurate, and if you are going to make a movie with real charactors in it, then this is not a minor fault. The only good things in the movie are Ben Johnson and the Duke himself. Truly one of his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One","review":"I get a charge out of this album. After the departure of the great Sandy Denny, Fairport continued their concentration on British roots music. Even the original numbers here sound like traditional tunes.

Of course, it just a \\"best of\\" and the purists would say that one should get Sheila's complete works--I have no definitive opinion on the subject, owning just this CD of hers. Like another reviewer said it, it is technically perfect (Peter Gabriel is the man behind the \\"Real World\\" label), but also an artistic wonder.It is a beautiful work of art because it was inspired by what matters the most in life: love. Sheila is so sensitive that, to her, \\"Love is an Ocean.\\"One of my very best CDs, along with Sinead O'Connor's \\"I do not want what I haven't got.\\" If you like \\"a capella\\" songs, there is a great one on \\"Moonsung.\\" There are connections from here to Sinead O'Connor and even to Barbara Hendricks's \\"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child[1].\\"[1] from \\"Sacred Songs\\" [..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing experience","review":"when I first purchased this CD, I was a little dissappointed because it was not the type of Indian music I was expecting. However, I gave it a chance and it's amazing. Sheila Chandra's voice is extremely soothing. There is an eclectic mix of her Indian and British roots. Song number 9 on this CD is a perfect example; there is a mix of traditional Latin and Hindi in the lyrics. This is truly a beautiful CD to fall asleep to or to just relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped for","review":"I recently discovered Shelia Chandra's music on her \\"Quiet\\" album, and was riveted by her mesmerizing lyrical talents and the meditative quality of the music she created. I then purchased Roots And Wings, and was equally pleased with the more varied tracks, but the same hauntingly beautiful lyrical quality and fascinating use of non-word 'bols'. So in my eagerness to add to my Shelia Chandra library, I ordered \\"Moonsung\\", and was terribly disappointed. Insteaded of hauntingly beautiful, I found it to be just haunting. Granted, this is a totally different style than the 2 aforementioned albums, but it did not give me the same peaceful, energized feeling...intead it just left me annoyed and depressed. Not my cup of tea, but perhaps others would like it. I recommend you listen to the clips before purchasing, since not all albums from the same artist will contain the same style of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZzzzzzzzzz","review":"First let me say I agree with some of the reviewers here that this lady's voice is phenomenal, totally beautiful. But this is music to meditate by, booooring is putting it lightly. A good comparison would be like Enya, but without any \\"pep\\" whatsoever, totally flat. Add to that the fact that most of the tracks are basically acappella, which makes it even more unbearable.

Certainly a good book to inspire an RPG session (or campaign).In summary I would say that this is a decent book, worth reading if you have some spare time and plan to read the rest of the Warlock series.

Atomic Diplomacy is the belief the bombs were used to scare the Soviets and not to end the war.This theory is garbage because it ignores the evidence. The evidence is overwhelming that Truman used the bomb to end the war and prevent further casaulties. Truman's memoirs, Truman biographers, WWII historians, all know this to be true.

I never particularly liked the albums where the Ventures only covered the various hits of the day, without any underlying theme or concept. Stylistically, the songs are all over the place. \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" starts the album off on a strong note, and compares favorably to the jazzy version of the song by Deodato. On the other hand, \\"Oh Babe, What Would You Say\\" is embarrassingly bad. The rest of the songs fall somewhere in-between. The biggest weakness of the album is the fact that there are no original instrumentals included. Some critics fail to note that members of the Ventures have written many instrumentals over the years. \\"Only Hits\\" reinforces the misconception that the Ventures are only a cover band.

It almost felt like several authors were writing as one and I was getting bits and pieces of different people's imagination. I think I would have enjoyed this book much more if it would have been free flowing rather than choppy.I never could connect with any characters simply because the author didn't *open them up enough* for me. The only character that seemed real, in my opinion, was the father.There was way too much drama in this one family and I didn't feel it touched on the proper (realistic) emotions that your average person feels during these situations.

This is one of those, and though I don't find it quite as good as Miles (who is, anyway?) I appreciate it for its lush melodies and perfect arrangements. It is very well made, and though it occasionally skirts muzak territory, it avoids it by virtue of Wes's octave-heavy guitar work. I heard somewhere that Wes and company kind of sort of helped create the muzak genre, and I would say that that might be true, unfortunately.

Some Jeeps may be different, but on mine this would have left very little material actually supporting the load of the track bar, which has a rather important job of keeping the axle centered under the vehicle. I opted to install one of these Skyjacker brackets instead, and it worked as intended to re-center my track bar. On a higher lift like mine a better option would be an aftermarket track bar, ideally with a double shear bracket, for more strength and to allow more axle articulation- but this is working fine until I can afford the upgrade.

Ms. Edmondson has done an excellent job of illustrating how it is we lose track of ourselves and what can happen to us if we have not planned properly for when we are no longer working. She offers insightful thoughts on assessing our current situation and explains the steps which need to be taken in order to make disconnecting from the workplace a smooth and rewarding life transition. Expertly reminding us of what is truly important, Ms. Edmondson provides a set of useful tools to help us rebalance our lives and live intentionally, and well.

It is a great read and I highly recommend it to those intereded in France, the French Revolution of Victor Hugo and his brillant style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!!!","review":"SO DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON. VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO READ...........AND GUESS WHAT, APPEARS TO BE AN ABRIDGED VERSION."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest novels ever written!","review":"Victor Hugo is my all-time-favorite novelist. Les Miserables, The Hunchback of Nolte Dame, and Ninety-Three are his three best and my top three favorites. Read Ninety-Three for a real treat. His characters are giants, heroes! Nobody but nobody can out-do Hugo on plot construction. Ninety-Three is an excellent introduction to Hugo. Just witness the way he takes such seemingly disparate stories and blends them into one of the greatest climaxes in all of literature. This is one of those edge-of-your-seat, can't-put-it-down novels that will keep you up late at night. I just can't recomment it high enough!Mike Porter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat Post!","review":"I was very happy when I got this seat post in the mail!!

Although the on-off button and volume controls were loads of fun for him, he did not enjoy the toy at all. He was unabe to get most of the object's attached sounds to work, and was unenthusiastic about the reading \\"voice\\". He would turn it off and instead ask me to read to him with out the distraction of the toy. I am taking it to the resale store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, poor product","review":"If your child is a leapfrog button pushing kid, SKIP THIS TOY!!!! Who had the bright idea of the sound and on/off being green buttons on a white field right on the front?????? All she wants to do is push the buttons!!!! Once she turns it off I have to reset it with the green go circle on the side of the page, etc. She did not care about it at, then she wanted to just rip the books off. She is strong but can not trigger the page noises. The toy is just a dud. Buy the 2 leapfrog movies instead, those are great. All I do with this toy is scold her not to rip on the books or push the buttons. No fun for either of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"could be better","review":"There is no reason why Leapfrog couldn't make these books at least bilingual if not even multilingual. Any parent can read a book to their child in one language; this product should offer something more.

Otherwise I will not be investing in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it sounds","review":"While I was Toys r us there were Leap Frog representatives pushing this product and how great it is. My twins just want to push the on off button. This button should be in the back. Also the pages of the book should not be made out of paper (that is why this age group uses board books). I am going to try to return this product ot Toys r us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a liitle touch","review":"I bought the Little Touch leap pad system for my 2 year old daughter.

For now, my 13-month old is more interested in pushing the on/off and volume control buttons. We have been unable to get through a whole book because of this. If I cover the buttons with my hand, he just gets mad and screams and then has no patience to play with the book. Maybe I just have an active boy, or maybe this is not age-appropriate. Kids today are technology driven and if there is a button to push, they will find it. Future re-design should put the power and volume controls well out of sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for a book instead","review":"While the Little Touch is certainly a nice product, it requires significant parent involvement and does not seem to hold the attention of a toddler (<18mo)nearly as well as a traditional book. The pad is not sensitive enough to a young child's touch and the books are somewhat flimsy. I recommend taking the $... you would spend on this platform and the accompanying software and ordering a bunch of \\"old fashion\\" books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok toy but not within the age guidelines","review":"We bought this toy for our son when he was 8 months old. Leap Frog has on the box that this is for 6-36 months. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY FOR AN INFANT! As usual for Leap Frog they have made a great product but have rated it for too young an age. Yeah, it makes noise but thats it and unfortunatley thats not enough to keep our sons attention even with us trying to make a big deal out of it. He just tries to crawl off our lap. I think one reason that he is so disinterested in this toy is that he cannot interact with it. The touch pad isn't sensitive enough for little fingers. You really have to push hard and you have to press exactly on the object which is hard for an 8 month old, especially when it is asking him to press the red triangle. I do think that he will enjoy this in about another year though so for now we have put it up in his closet and are just sticking to the board books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too busy turning it off and on...","review":"I bought this for my daughter who is 1 1/2 for Christmas last year and haven't been able to get through the book yet.

He has had it since 12 months and is now 22 months, and does nothing but pull the books out of the game because they come out so easily... They should be pages made of hard plastic that cannot come out once you put them in. Then the cards were a joke. Too floppy and flimsy. He also pulls the cartridges out.

We bought if for our 10-months old son because he loves books. This toy is definetely not age-appropriate for him even if an adult plays with him--the 'touch' does not work, its hard to press even for a grown-up, the pages are flimsy and he is jamming and tearing them, so there goes this toy in the closet for a long time since my baby is not able to play with it. LeapFrog should either adjust the 'touch' or the recommended age. This toy should be recommended starting approximately 18 months of age. Two thumbs down..."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't be confused with My first LeapPad","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I believe some this item is being confused with My first LeapPad, which is more suited for an older toddler.

This toy, Little Touch LeapPad is different and more suited for younger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"A toy for older kids","review":"We just bought Little touch leap pad for our 8 months old. All that I can say is that I do not see why the company was allowed to market this toy with a 6-36 months age range. Even 8 months is way too early. Number one, I thought that the toy will actually be geared for a baby and will have a lot of music and songs. That is not the case. It is largely based on the book asking you to press on a certain button (and you have to press pretty hard!) and also asking for example to find pairs of things, or point to a blue colored piece of clothing, etc. All that on the \\"first\\" setting. How would you imagine a baby doing that? This toy is definitely for older children, in my opinion at least a 2 year old. I think just reading baby books so far will be much more beneficial for a baby. For us Little touch leap pad was a waste of money and we are taking ours back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I purchased this toy for my then 14 month old(shes 16 months now) I thought it would be a fun activity to do duringthe day with the nanny. Needless to say we were VERY disappointed!first of all the Snap in book comes offtoo easily, however i find the pages of the book to be quite sturdy. Also the tabs on the activity cards are too short and dont stay in place .When my daughter tries to press on the bookto hear a sound she CANT PRESS HARD ENOUGH, and she gets upset and frustrated& starts just punching and banging on it.Also the ON/OFF and volume buttons should be hidden in the back of the toy because the most fun my daughter hasis pressing those two buttons. Dont get this for Christmas, just wait for the child to get older and get the regular leap pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a Leap Pad product - kinda disappointed","review":"I got this for my son who is 22 months old to help keep him busy in the car. I must say I'm rather disappointed.One of the problems we had was the on and off button is too easy for little ones to access and operate and when the system gets turned off and then back on YOU must then restart up the system.And, as easy as the on and off button is to operate - the opposite must be said for the use of the pages. Most of the time my son hits things on the page and gets no response and after a few tries ends up in his frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$$","review":"The concept of this product is great. However, it is too hard for a smaller child to use. Ex: you have to press the green \\"go\\" button everytime you turn a page...my two year old doesn't do that and it completely messes up the purpose of the game. He will be on a page of \\"blue\\" pictures but since he didn't press \\"go\\", the page is telling him that the pictures are \\"red\\" because it is still on the page from before. If I use it with him it works great, but he cannot play with it by himself. We purchased this as a toy for the car because we travel frequently, but it is of no use to us in the car. If LeapFrog could improve on the \\"green go\\" button, it would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Touch Leap Pad","review":"I am disappointed that I have to even give this one star! If you do not push the exact part of the page with a certain amount of pressure it does not work. Other people are saying this is too difficult for a child of this age.

She is now 2 years old and still would much rather read real books w/ me or bang on the on/off button and then put the toy away. I am surprised that any parent would rather use an electronic toy vs's sitting down with good old fashion (and inexpensive) books! It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age appropriate.","review":"My son received this toy from Grandma for Christmas. He was 8 months old. He showed no interest in it. Once a month since then, I have brought it out and used it with him. He could care less. Being an early childhood education major, my advice is to buy the real book, sit down with yoru child, and read it yourself. You can make you own games and songs based on the stories. It makes the time spent more meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I love most of the Leap Forg toys but this is the worst. We bought this about 4-5 months ago when my daughter was 13-14 months old and although she found it interesting she was drawn to the on/off button and the volume button which is very obvious and big. So most of the time, even when we are just starting in on a book she starts with the on/off constantly! She is 19 months now and still this interests her more than anything. She operates 90% of her toys by herself but this is not one that she could because of the &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; button mentioned by another reviewer. You have to hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn the page or want to use the page on the opposite side which is very annoying for me even. I think even in a year when she will be able to do that by herself she would get bored with it very easily and just move on to something else. I say wait until they are ready for the step-up version Leap Pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a disappointment","review":"this seems like a marvelous toy, but we have been quite disappointed in it. My son received it last Christmas and it has never been a big hit. it is just too difficult for a child under 3 to understand the concepts of changing settings, pressing the \\"go\\" circle each time you turn the page and of course little hands are going to pull the story book cards out. frankly, likes his Clifford the Big Red Dog regular books much better. Think very seriously before you invest, because of course it only comes with one book. wish we has skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for 15 month old","review":"It is too hard for my son to push on the page (especially in the middle).

Now, even at 21 months, she finds it difficult to press. The cartridge is easily removable, so most of the time, she just takes it out and presses the on off switch. Its fun, only when I press the pictures on the book, so that they make sound. It can't be called little touch - its better being called mummy touch leappad.. The product has not lived up to the expectation. My friend bought it, and her baby also is not enjoying it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think again...","review":"The idea for this product is great.

Well, take that feeling and apply it towards education and the result is this toy. Besides having terribly difficult areas to push on the page, the thing wants your child to answer the question NOW NOW NOW DOITDOITDOIT PRESS IT NOW. The only shared experience this will give between parent and child is aggravation. Actually sitting down and reading a book with your child and asking simple context questions is more relaxing, rewarding, and cheaper than this totally useless (and expensive) piece of garbage. (And I do agree with one of the previous reviewers in saying the only redeeming quality in this thing is that it is durable, which is good, since the common reaction to it seems to be wanting to throw it across the room.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good toy but what were they thinking!!!","review":"We love the leap Frog toys we bought this for our 2 year old son thinking he could use it in the car or mommy and me time but I was so wrong all he wants to do is turn it off and on they really need to put the botton in another place so it is not right out infront of the child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd think","review":"Although the idea of this toy is a great one it really isn't designed for young children. It advertises for babies and toddlers, however, this is not the case once you get it home. The trick to getting the pages to coordinate with the vocal reader is to make sure that the GO button is pushed when you turn the page. The button is located to the side of each page, however, anyone who can teach a busy child to touch that button (and hard enough) every time they turn the page has my vote for parent of the year. What ends up happening is that the child keeps turning pages, but the sounds do not follow along and suddenly your child is pointing at a dog and the voice is saying --Great that's the color blue!-- They could have done a better job with this one.I brought it back the next day....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I bought this item for my daughters first birthday and what a DISAPPOINTMENT! The on and off buttons are in the absolute worst place on top and in the front. What baby doesn't like to push buttons?!?! So she is constantley turning it on and off.

Also, the touch pages are hard for her as you need to push it right on the \\"sensitive part of the picture\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We have many Leap Frog products that we are happy with but this isn't one of them. It is to hard for a child to follow or interact with. You have to hold the pages down to keep young hands from turning to the wrong page.

We both get much more out of siting down and reading a book the old fashion way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Waste Of Money","review":"we recieved this toy as a gift for our 6 month old daughter. What a waste! It is impossible for her to use it on her own. It requires direct firm preassure placed exactly on the censors. I had a hard time getting it to respond!

It brings nothing but frusturation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I bought this for my son for christmas when he was 14 months old. He never really liked it. You have to push the pages to hard for them to say anything. my son is now 2 and he still cant really get them to say anything.

Unfortunately, the only \\"button\\" on this toy is the On/Off and Volume button. As for the rest of the \\"touch\\" features, it requires a very strong touch to get any results. I do not recommend this toy for a toddler...it's not a play on your own type toy...it requires an adult to press the leappad and get the story moving.

My 1 yr. old has had the LittleTouch LeapPad since he was 6 mos. and although the stories are cute and fun, the books themselves are no good. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they made these. They are flimsy paper books for babies! Babies who like to chew, crinkle, tear, and drool on to say the least. I wish they would consider atleast laminating the pages. So if your baby doesn't grab at anything then this toy is great for you, otherwise its not!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but does not work for babies","review":"I bought it for my daughter when she was 10 months old. Initially, she was always able to take the activity cards and the book out of it. So, I put it away for a while and then took it out again when she turned one. Now, she can even take the cartridge out. She loves books and spends much time of the day flipping through picture books or asking me to read them to her. This toy is a great idea but I can't get her to use it the way its supposed to be used. She keeps on wanting to flip pages and gets impatient because the narration doesn't follow her. I thought that may be the powertouch system from Fisher Price may be better for her, but I just saw that it also has bad reviews. I guess, I just need to keep reading to her myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money!!!","review":"Who was stupid enough to make the pages so thin and easily rippable for such little ones???

By then my son is ready to turn the page.My son is not really interested in this toy. I expect as he gets older he may like it better.As far as using it for a younger child as a way to read books, I think it is much more beneficial for them to hear your voice then to use something like this.Save your $$ and get him one of the other Leap Frog toys when he is older!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the money on real books!","review":"Reading with any toddler is an activity that parents and kids should do together. At this age, \\"reading\\" is all about pointing, asking questions and finding items in the pictures. This product attempts to take the parents' place in that equation and fails miserably. It simply can't interact with a child in a truly productive way and actually inhibits a parent's attempts to join-in by interrupting with questions and instructions that very quickly become repetative and irritating. This was chosen as a gift by my eighteen-month-old's grandparents because she truly adores reading books, but unfortunately there is no real carry through. It is so frustrating to see her stare blankly at this product as it jingles away. The only features she truly likes are the on/off button and the volume button, which were poorly placed on the front of the toy, given the target age group. Please please, spend your money on real books instead -- a much better investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 6month olds","review":"We saw this and thought, \\"how neat, we can get our 6month old interested in reading and it will be a cool sharing time\\". We were naive. Our 6month old, and now 10month old, just doesn't get the interactive book thing yet. She is however very interested in pulling the book off the LeapPad and putting it in her mouth. She also likes to bang the LeapPad with other toys. My recommendation: wait on buying this item. It's just not for 6-12 month olds, no matter what the box says."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A BABY!!!","review":"Our eighteen month old RIPPED the pages on these books!

However, our little guys loves sitting with us and playing with these books. At first, it was just the sounds, but now he is starting to follow the stories. It is not a substitute for reading time, but it is a wonderful interactive toy. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that we occasionally find it hard to push in exactly the right place.

I was so excited because I thought it was the cutest thing and couldn't wait to sit with her and read and listen to the stories. Well, now 6 months later, we have yet to 'enjoy' this book. The on/off switch and volume buttons being on the top is not a smart idea--these are the only part of the book my daughter even cares about! Each time, I'd try to sit with her and look at the book, I would turn it on and pick my setting (there are 3 options) and then her little hand would go up and push the on/off button and I'd hear the thing say \\"Bye-Bye\\"--talk about frustrating! I am hoping that when she gets older, she can enjoy this but for now, it sits in her toy box until she drags it out and flips through the pages and turns it on and off.I truly wish I had returned it and gotten something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Loves it!","review":"My daughter received this as a gift from her Grandfather for her first birthday- and she loves it.We opened it early (her birthday is tomorrow) and she has absolutely no problem touching the pictures and playing with it. She loves the music setting, and also enjoys having her Father and I read the books to her. She even enjoys looking at it with her 4 year old sister. I am giving this 4 stars, because of the on/off button being on the front. She loves to push it on and off, but once we start reading the story, it's not a problem. Parents should realize that even though it says 6+ months, you do still need to help with the toy .The point of the toy is to help you introduce reading to your child, along with music and simple games-not to teach your child for you.

She pushes and pushes and nothing. I have to push very hard for anything to make a sound. This is ONLY a parent/child electronic book.

He pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects. However he also is fascinated by the slot where the sound card is inserted.

She remembers to push \\"Go\\" a lot of the times when she turns the pages. She loves the ABC song coming from the Leap Frog \\"radio\\". I highly recommend buying the \\"Animal World\\" Software also. If you are lucky, your Leap Pad will come with a bonus \\"Puzzle\\" like mine did. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because you do have to push \\"Go\\" to activate each page and hopefully, I won't lose the software cartridges that come with each of the different books. I am impressed, however, that the pages have been standing up to her attempts to tear the book for the past month."},{"rating":"1","title":"We like regular books better","review":"My daughter is 20 months old and has always loved books, so it seemed like the perfect Christmas gift. Unfortunately it hasn't been a good toy because she wants to turn the pages and it's pretty easy to take the book straight out of the Leap Pad.

I'd suggest just getting some \\"old fashioned\\" children's books and go with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I bought this when I found it packaged with the Lulu Letter Spinning Spider. Unfortunately, my daughter doesn't care for the system itself. She knows where the button is to turn it on and off so she does that a few times. Sometimes you have to pull around at the book to be able to press and get a sound to come which is a pain. You'd think it would have been made better to allow no flaws with touching the images on the book. I was actually disapointed with the product and bought a few books with it. My daughter is almost 2 so maybe later she'll take more interest in it. For now, she sticks with regular books.UPDATE: I deleted and am reposting my review with fewer stars. As we have had this since Christmas, it has stayed in a box since purchase. My daughter has no interest in this at all. I should have just bought the lulu spinning spider on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for little hands","review":"I give this unit four stars because even though I find the touch sensor a little unsensative, my son was able to drop it a few times without it breaking and learned he had to add quite a bit of pressure to the unit for it to respond. The books are great for them to get interactive as, my baby son wanted to handle the older kids my first leap pad, leapster and leap pad before his little time. I am so shocked he keeps saying I want to play with the leapster. But atleast when I bring out the lion book for him he enjoys using his little touch pad. But it is good for kids two and under to keep them entertained when they are not quite ready for the big kids units. Just encourage and say bring me your big boy/girls book. They will feel quite big. and learn a thing or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"All my daughter does is turn it off and on","review":"My 18 month old daughter all it does with it it's turn it off and on. You have to start all over again once it's turned off, so it is very anoying!!!!!!!They shuold have not left the on/off button so visible for the children. It is very irritating. You have to be with your child at all times while playing with it, because it makes them frustrating not to be able to star it again once they turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a happy mommy","review":"I bought this product for my son when he was nine months old. The box says ages 6-36 months, WRONG. What were they thinking making those paper pages. I don't know about anyone else but my son likes to tear pages and try to eat them. Isn't that why they make board books for infants. I was one of the unfortunate ones and like so many others trusted leap frog so I threw the box away. So we still have this worthless toy ( my son is now 15 months) I don't think we have touch it since. The only ok thing about this product is the activity cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to operate","review":"I bought this for my son's 1st birthday because I thought it would be a great educational toy. I found it to be very hard to operate. It took alot of pressure to push the buttons. I would think if a 6 month old is suppose to be able to operate it, then the touch pad would work with a feather touch. You really have to press hard to get it to respond. Also, as other have said, the books are paper. My 1 year old will destroy it in a heart beat. Needless to say, I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an active child!","review":"We received this as a Christmas gift and were very dissapointed. We have an active 14 month old and he was not impressed with this. The story can only be told by pushing \\"GO\\" on each page and did not move quickly enough for him. I think we will stick with good old board books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The manufacturer's description of this product is VERY misleading as it suggests use by infants as young as six months old.My son is fifteen months old, and still not interested in this toy. For us it was a complete waste of money. Our money was much better spent on the Leap Frog table - which he loves and is very well designed for toddlers.The pages are too flimsy - and should be boardbook-style to be used by such young children, as when they try to turn the page, it is more likely to bend or crumple than turn. We read stories to our son every night - which he loves - and he turns the pages on all his board books and points to the pictures.The buttons are quite hard to activate on the page - and not designed with very small children in mind.I think my son might like this when he is much older - but not for now. Right now, he just likes to bang on it, rip the book apart, and pull off the cushion on the back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult toy","review":"I was really excited about this learning toy. But I have been so frustrated that my son spends the entire time hitting the ON/OFF button. He loves books, but doesn't translate that love into using this toy. I think that the idea is good, but maybe the concept is just to far beyond this age group. There is nothing I can do with it beyond listening to the on/off music and voice over and over. Really, there is better value in a regular book that you go through with your toddler. If this product was to receive a better rating, then they need to put the on/off in the back where it can be disguised. I've been so put off that I don't know if I'd give any of their other products a try, or if I'd just waste my money again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for 18 months to 24 months","review":"I wish I had seen these other reviews before I purchased this product.

Im going to look for a book that senses when the page is turned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Touch Leap Pad","review":"My two year old loves this item. It encourages her to want to read and have story time. I like this item but wish it had some storage compartment on it to hold more books and cartridges. I also wish the books were made with a more heavy duty paper but the stories are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can wait for 1st Leap Pad","review":"We bought this for our son at 6-months and then it it was nice because it was great for story time to hear music and soundscapes. However, it was no more fun (or animated) than when we read our paper books with lots of sound effects. Now he's 16-months and only turns it on and off because the touch pad is too difficult to activate for little fingers. His favorite book to hear is \\"Mr. Brown can Moo can You\\". This is a great book with lots of sounds but my son can't get it to work on his own. So this toy is only good when I am playing with him. In that case, I prefer to cuddle up with a good old fashioned hard bound Mr Brown and make my own \\"Moo\\". I should have waited for the other leap pads. I hear they're great."},{"rating":"1","title":"no interest","review":"My son has had this since he was 6 months old - now he is 17 months old and has never had any interest in it. He loves books but not this. Would rather just get $35 worth of books you can use for years and years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed in Quality...","review":"First off, my son (2 years old) could easily bend the pages (not designed for the age group they say). Also, the power button is in an easy access area for little fingers, I think he had more fun turning it off and on then anything else. I also found pushing the items was actually quite difficult for his little fingers. But to top off my BAD experience, my son dropped the Little Touch LeapPad on the floor (as toddlers will often do) and now the volume is VERY hard to hear and does not turn up. I emailed Leapfrog regarding this problem as well as calling them, I never received a reply, the toy is now in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents MUST play!","review":"This toy has the potential to be an excellent learning tool. The picture portrays a child playing/reading by herself, however, this just can't happen. It is too difficult for a child to determine which thing to push and the order to push things. It requires a great deal of patience... many times not a good option for a baby! The durability is less than desired. One minute with a baby alone and the pages are wrinkled or torn. I love to read with my son, but if you are looking for something to leave your child with, this is NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"My son was given this toy as a gift for his first birthday. I rated it the lowest that the site would allow but it really deserves zero stars. I can't see how this toy is made for 12 month old children none the less for 6 month olds. The books are made of regular paper which means my son can look but not touch. It seems to me that toys should be created to be child friendly yet this toy is anyhting but. It is difficult for little ones to use and as I mentioned the books rip very easily. The add on books are arrroximately 10.00 and certainly not worth the money. When I initially unwrapped this gift I was very excited about building an entire library of add on books until I opened the box and realized this item is a piece of garbage. I tried to return the item but without a gift reciept toys r us will not take it back. I would not be surprised if this item was discontinued very soon as for us it is sitting in my garage on a shelf collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I LOVE Leap Frog products. I have 2 older children and have always found Leap frog products to be wonderful educational tools. When my little one turned 1 I put this on the top of my wish list without hesitation. I was wrong. I can't believe that Leap frog is the maker of this toy. You can not touch anywhere on the screen accept the small, pencil size area to make it work. When my little girl tried to \\"help\\" mommy and touch the book as well it would take us to a page some where else. The toys is not child friendly. The box also says that the pages are for young children... does the writer of these words have children as my daughter would have them in pieces in a matter of minutes. Need less to say I returned the toy today. I wouldn't waste my money or time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for babies","review":"My 12 month old gets extremely excited when I bring this toy out for her, as she loves books and music, but SHE wants to turn the pages and the whole concept is just over her head. Maybe if the pages were more durable it would help but I think this is a toy that we will keep on the shelf for the most part until she is a bit older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but hard to push for my daughter","review":"When this 1st came out I was so excited, I purchased all 6 of the additional books sets and couldn't wait for my daughter to be old enough to play with it! Well, now that my daughter is old enough, I'm really disappointed. You have to press down really hard to get the areas you want to work. So hard I can't imagine a young toddler being able to do so. It frustrates my daughter so much that she now just grabs my hand and puts it to the picture she wants me to press down on. As all toddlers do, she loves to turn the book on and off. Not good for this since it looses all information on what level you are on and you must push the green go circle on every page, needless to say the only thing my daughter can do is turn the book on and off! The books are cute and have a lot of neat sounds and saying, it's just right now this just absolutely frustrates my daughter! We are much happier with Mattel's Learn Through Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucked","review":"This thing is the worst toy EVER invented. I wanna teach my kid how to read by myself instead of watching her by herself. She had nightmares for 8 WEEKS over that thing! NEVER BUY THIS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"My daughter received this as a gift when she was 15 months old. At the time I didn't know if she was too old for it or too young because all she wanted to do was take the book off or push the on/off button on the leap pad. She didn't want me to do the button pushing for her, but she wasn't able to do it herself. She prefered to look at and have me read her the books all by themselves when they were out of the leap pad. She is now 2 years old and she took it out of the closet the other day. I had to listen to the on/off button say \\"bye bye\\" over and over and over. She put a book in but not the right cartridge. This frusterated her but she didn't want me to do it for her. The toy has again been pushed to the side. I hope she will like it again when she is older so it won't be a complete waste. I suggest....read to your kids, this thing is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, yeah, it's an ok, but spendy tool.","review":"I agree with many of the other reviews. My 21 month old only pushes the on off. When I get it out he asks for other books. I am starting to try in with my 6 month old, though so maybe she will get the idea of it sooner. It's quite an initial investment and new books are about 13 dollars. Also, now it comes in pink and blue so if you are color trendy, you may have to have two if you have a boy and girl!! Also, Leap needs to MOVE the on/off button to the back and make it a switch. This is the most dissapointing of all my Leap toys, and I can't wait for my son to \\"graduate\\" to the next pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i thought it be.","review":"I thought this item was cool cause it was for the youngsters. BUt my son is 16months old and all he wants to do is press that on/off botton and rip the pages out. So i would probably be for 3 and older. i wish i woudl of thought of that before i baught it. it was a good thought"},{"rating":"1","title":"too difficult to use for young toddlers","review":"My son got this as a Christmas gift at 18 mos. - a great concept, but waaay too difficult for that age. My 3 year old daughter enjoyed it more. The touch pad is slow to respond or nonresponsive unless you tap it just right. I know this is marketed as the beginning Leap Pad for the youngest of toddlers, but it's better to wait and get My First Leappad for 3 year olds and up, a much better toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I got this Leapad for my 18 month old. Because she loves reading and me reading to her, I thought this would be great. When we sit down to use the leapad she trys to sit on it. I think she likes the little pillow because she turns the toy over and sits on this side too. The go button must be pushed when turning the page, but my little one hardly lets me help and turn the page. She does however enjoy the cards that come with the toy defining numbers, colors, etc. I use them without the leapad and read to her myself. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interested!!","review":"I bought the LeapFrog Little Touch Pad for my son when he was 18 months. He showed NO interest in anything except for turning the touch pad on and off. The on/off button is right on the front of the machine and in perfect reach for them. If LeapFrog were smarter, they would have made the on/off a switch on the side or the back, but no...right there on the front in bright green. He could have cared less about listening to the story or pressing the green go circle on each page. (which are hard for them to press on their own) I just sold mine on ebay for alot less. Save your money. Its a nice idea, they just dont have the attention span at that age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age appropriate","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 6 mos. old. He had absolutely no interest in it. At 20 mos. he has some interest but only to turn the on/off switch to hear 'bye bye' or try and tear out the pages. It requires you to press hard on the characters to hear anything, which is not within his patience or strength level. I will put this away for another 6 mos. and try again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My nephew didn't use it at first, was a little too young for it and just liked to chew on it.

Really good price too.THanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!","review":"I bought this for my 9 month ols son, along with most of the books out at that time. It was awesome. It kept him entertained and learning at the same time. I was able to use it as a reinforcement to what I was teaching him already (shapes, colors, letters, etc). By the age of two, we moved to the next stage (My first leadpad) because he had mastered the books and mechanics of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for babies","review":"As a Mom and reading teacher I bought this for my baby with high hopes of fun interactive reading time shared with my child. I was very upset when I actually used this toy with my child. The books are too long and flimsy and the toy is too hard to operate for a baby/young toddler. Do not even bother with this toy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age appropriate","review":"My 14 month old daughter cannot use this toy alone and even with my assistance doesn't hold her attention. My daughter is very bright and loves books & puzzles. We received this as a gift and I thought she might like it. She doesn't. The puzzle is okay but the books are terrible! The pages are EASY TO RIP, despite the manufacturer's claim that they are tear resistant. The absolute worst part has to be the books, in fact. The buttons are just pictures on each page and you have to press them for the machine to recognize that you are on that page. Trust me, your child isn't going to understand that concept for quite some time! My daughter loves to just flip the pages, and as such, the machine cannot keep up. The books are flimsy and the machine is too big.I do not recommend this TOY or as the manufacturer says \\"educational tool.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 month old enjoys this interactive toy","review":"I got the LittleTouch LeapPad for my 5 month old for Christmas. I think it's a great interactive toy. I've been reading books to my daughter since she was in utero and she really enjoys this new musical/talking book. The packaging specifically advises that this product is meant for parent/child interaction and not necessarily for the child to use it by themselves. I disagree with the negative reviews on this product. I love it! My daughter loves music and brightly illustrated books and this product has both. Of course, I sit there with her in my lap and we read through the story together. She loves to run her hands over the childproof pages and look at the illustrations. She doesn't get much comprehension out of the story yet since she's only 5 months, but she does throughly enjoy this new toy. I think it's great how it \\"grows\\" with your child with the 3 different levels depending on your childs development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"Maybe my little girl is too little for this yet - she is 11 mos. However, it should have entered my mind that she couldn't do this on her own. It will only work to some degree when I do it with her. However, it is frustrating for me because she only wants to rip at the pages. Maybe it would be better if they made it of the thick book type pages (cardboard) and put the sensors inside. I wish i had bought something else - I just remembered that my nephew had loved leap stuff- and my daughter loves her lily doll, but I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too complicated","review":"The books are not fixed, the sheet overlays rise up because they are bent in the middle, have to 'touch lightbulb' then 'touch start' to play then if the child hits either one of these 2 it stops. I bought this for my son's 1 yr birthday and turns 3 this week, he hasn't played with it for more than 5 minutes ever. I keep it hoping he will like it sometime. He's a very bright child but would rather take the book off the pad and \\"read\\" it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This is a toy we never play with! My daughter received this for Christmas last year when she was 1 1/2 years old. Now, at 2 1/2 she is still not strong enough to push the pictures to make the sounds. She pushes the on/off button a few times and tosses it aside. Keep your money and stick to good old fashioned books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children","review":"I got the leappad with the pen for my older son and this one for my then 20 month old son. My 20 month old plays computer games all the time so I figured he'd love this - it's portable. Unfortunately, as many people have mentioned, the buttons were too hard to push - except for the on/off button which was the only thing played with. I made the mistake of waiting to take it back thinking maybe he'll enjoy it more when he got older and it was easier to push. Now I'm stuck with it and my two boys fight over the pad with the pen because it is much easier to use. The extra stars are for duribility - Every time I try to give to my son he throws it on the floor and the thing still works."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 month old frustration","review":"I did not expect my 7 month old to sit alone on the floor and play with this leap pad. I did expect the system to respond to her touch, it does not. My 3 year old has a my first leap pad that she really loves and has enjoyed playing with this first touch but my 7 month old only wants to bang on it and chew on the book pages. We have also had trouble keeping the cards in place. We have switched back to reading board books in mommys lap. This First Touch Leap Pad is a good idea it just needs a little more tweaking. I think the learning drum by leapfrog would be a better item for 6-18 month olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We recently bought this for our 16 month old, and according to the package he should have no problem operating it. That is not the case however. He cannot push the screen hard enough to make it do anything, then gets frustrated and starts beating on it (which by the way still does nothing). We were very disappointed with this. We are taking it back today to get him the Fisher Price equivalent, at least that has Sesame Street cartridges he will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked like fun but...","review":"We got this for my son when he was about 18 months. He is now about to turn 3. Over the last year I have pulled this toy out and tried to spark his interest in it, but it doesn't grab his attention. The only thing he wants to do with it is hit the buttons - isn't that what buttons are there for? I'd recommend a toy that is meant to be PLAYED with, particularly for boys who love to press buttons. :)Also, I found that even when I would try it myself, I'd get aggravated when the sounds didn't match up with what I touched. If you don't do the correct \\"set up\\" when you insert a new book then it gets all screwed up. By that time your little one has already moved on.We have Baby Tad and still like to play with him, and will probably get the real Leap Pad -- it's nothing against LeapFrog, I think their products are great. This one just doesn't happen to be very practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly made","review":"I have to agree with most of the parents here. I bought this product when my son was around 7 months and he didn't take ANY interest in it and still doesn't now. he likes to listen to me read to him from other books and even turn the pages (he's 1 now), but this one just doesn't hold his attention. I believe the pages should be heavier (a 6 month old can not turn flimsy pages!) the buttons have to be pushed pretty hard as well and small hands can't do that either. leap frog seriously needs to work on this product and offer a call back or refund on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 month old isnt impressed..","review":"My daughter recieved this for Christmas and since she loves books I thought it would be a big hit, but I was quickly disappointed. As many of the other posts the pages arent that sensitive and her little fingers dont seem to activate it so I always find myself tapping behind her to get it to work, thus she is not enthused for very long.The books are not well made at all, we paid $12.99 for each extra book and it consist basically of a plastic spiral binding and flimsy pages. They claim the pages are drool and tear resistant, but that claim is false. My daughter tore 2 pages just trying to turn them.In my opinion for the price of the books you are better off going to Barnes and Noble and buying interactive story books with the old fashioned push button and speaker system attached to the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a nice thought","review":"The thought of this toy is great my daughter, 1 year old, and I could interact with the book and have fun. Well all she want to do is press the on and off button. Also it is very awkward to use.

The screen was always very hard to press. My daughter was never interested in the narratives provided nor in following the \\"script\\". She did like turning the off/on button as a previous reviewer mentioned.

They are a little impatient at times with it and will turn the pages really quickly, but for the most part they play with the books and puzzles that go with this system and get really excited when it comes out. They can already get it to make noises, but I do have to agree that it is kinda difficult for them to do it by themselves. It is definitely a toy to play with them (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars). My boys are rough with the pages and have never torn any of them. My one wish for this toy is that the books would be harder to take out. My boys love to take the books off constantly, but if the pages don't match up, they can't push the pictures. But, that is pretty much the only major change that I would make to this otherwise great system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't realize pages would tear...","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was 18 months. I should have looked more closely before I bought it because I didn't realize the pages were paper. I just assumed they were laminated or plastic. She tore one page out within a couple days. She is now 2 and all the pages are all wrinkled up.I really really can't stand how long this thing takes to turn off. And being totally honest, comparing this to even her loudest toys, this one drives me the most nuts because it stays on forever. Ok, maybe 2 minutes, but seems like forever, especially when I have to come over and hold the off button myself, which has to be held down way longer than my daughter ever would.This toy is a good idea in theory, but I think they are just too young for it. It was way too expensive, and too fragile for this age group. I say just use board books until they are old enough for the more mature book readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressed","review":"We bought this for my 1 year old daughter, she is now 2 1/2 and still doesn't like it.

It's too hard for a child to press through the pages to activate the sounds so I have to do it. He wants to do it, but gets frustrated when he can't make the sounds come on. The stories and sounds are not interesting enough to keep him even mildly entertained. The most entertainment he gets from this toy is turning the on/off button on and off over and over and adjusting the volume level over and over. Was a nice idea, but it just doesn't work. I consider the money I spent on the toy and all the cartridges to be a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"My 10 month old son loves to sit and 'read' with me.

I'm hoping he will find it more interesting in a month or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best product","review":"We got this a gift for my 15 mth old son and I can't wait to return it.

She still only wants to turn the pages which I fear will tear very soon. In fairness however 'Lets get busy baby' has sparked more interest than the cartridge that came with the Little Touch.

I have tried several times to get him interested several times but he just does not understand the consept of hitting the go button and then touching each thing to get it to say something, the most progress we have had was him standing on it.

I've even tried holding her finger and pushing down, but you still have to push so hard that I'm afraid I'm going to sprain the tip of her finger.

This item may interest him in another year, but all he wants to do is pull the pages out for now. I do not agree with the age range Leap Frog is placing on it. For the cost of their products, they should do a better job of directing parents to toys that will actually be of interst at certain ages so that product loyalty will happen. I would never buy another Leap Frog item at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to just reading a plain book?","review":"what happened to just reading a plain book to your children? is that not enough these days? is that not enough interaction with your child? i must admit, my child was more interested in the box it came in than the actual product. i think technology is going too far concerning children and marketing and with over-stimulation. i was not surprised to learn that the pages for the books that go with the leap frog leap pad were coated with a special 'tear resistant substance'. what does that mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad buy","review":"My baby girl received this as a Christmas gift, she is now 8 months old.

He occasionally plays with the on/off button, and that's it. He doesn't care much for the book that came with it, or to learn how to work the device. He just walks away and looks through a Dr. Seuss book instead. This much money can be better spent on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated for Age Set","review":"Although I agree with some reviews that this is a toy meant for parent and child to play with together, even sitting next to my 2-year-old cannot stop him from hitting the on/off button throughout. On other toys, this is not an issue, but with this toy, it is a THREE step sequential process in order to return to the card or book we are using! Try telling a toddler he has to push \\"on\\" - then \\"go\\" - then \\"lightbulb\\" in order to get started. Or, that he has to push \\"go\\" EVERY time he turns the page; or that he has to hit \\"adjust setting\\" if he wants to hear sounds or narration. I've been working with him a lot, and do some of the steps so he can see, but inevitably he gets frustrated that he can't just play along and have things happen the way he expects.

Like the rest have said, it's too difficult for them to use on their own until at least age three(then the stories/activities are too immature). Now if one child uses it, the others come & want to press the buttons. So frequently they aren't getting anything out of it since there is no cause & effect since three kids are pressing who know what at what time. Then often they somehow get on the wrong page & nothing makes sense. My take is: when I spend time with my kids. it will be reading them a book, not trying to fend off three sets of little hands all wanting to push buttons at the same time.

She is just starting to learn to do things on her own, so she hates having me turn the pages for her!She doesn't know where to press to make sounds or anything.

We haven't had any problems with screen sensitivity and I think this toy is a great learning tool when accompanied with parental guidance.The extra books we have for her teaches colors, pretend play, international languages, and so much more. I love the fact that this toy spans over so many stages in their development.The only \\"problem\\" I have with it is that the pages are thin and we all know how rough tiny fingers can be with things.The pluses far outweight the minuses though, and I'd recommend this time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"We received this toy as a gift...the book's pages are made of paper, so they wrinkle easily and ruin the book.

That being said this one needs work. It's not very intuitive and as everyone has already mentioned, the on/off button is within reach of little hands that think that is the main entertainment function! The pages are made of a material that is harder to tear, but can tear nonetheless.The functionality of it is a little confusing, and in my case, my pad had technical issues that made it even more frustrating!I returned the pad and the extra book I bought. Disappointing, but one product out of countless many that isn't a winner is alright with me! I am still a loyal Leapfrog customer! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful of color!","review":"Wonderful toy but be careful, it is gender specific...they have pink ones and blue ones, but do not advertise it in the stores.

I'd alway heard great things about Leap Frog, so I disregarded the compaints. I was wrong. The volume and power buttons being on the front were a major distraction. My daughter continuously wanted to play with these buttons instead of the books. She still doesn't understand that she has to push the go button each time she turns a page. She gets very frustrated with this toy when I try to get her to play with it correctly. It is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say","review":"I bought this for my son on his 1st b/day.

It is difficult for him to push the pad hard enough to get a reaction. Only the on/off button seems suited for baby use. A friend and her 18 month old tried it also - I was desperate to give it away - and they refused it for different, equally problematic reasons. My son loves board books and being read to but he has no interest in this. Since then I have tried to give it away to other moms, but all of them agree that it's highly user unfriendly and don't want to waste time with it. I guess my son will continue using it as a stepping stool to reach objects on his toy shelf. It's a waste of money. The Leap Frog company should be held accountable for their slick and misleading marketing of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO hard for the age range","review":"... A toy sold for 6month olds should not require 3 steps to start it and the keys are way too hard to for them to push. They get frustrated when not able to turn the pages and have the toy work. Not to mention the on/off switch which is fun to play with but you have to restart the toy with three steps everytime they turn it off. The system does not have an auto shut off if not played with. The pages are not durable enough for 6 month olds. Good toy for a 3 year old but not the ages they advertise. And I do sit a read to my child but it is hard for me to get it to work!! ANd they should have time to explore toys themselves, not be spoon fed all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"leap start","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old for Christmas. She has yet to play with it. Every time I get it out for her she would rather tear it up than actually listen to it. I think that this would be a very good toy for 1 year and up, but not6 months and up. The leap frog system is a very good idea,my son got his for his third birthday and hasn't put it down, I just think that they need to put older age requirements on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I read the reviews first!","review":"I bought this a few months ago for my now 10 month old daughter. How is she ever going to be able to push the buttons, it's so difficult! The sound quality is not that great either. I thought maybe it was just me, but I see other have the same problem. It's to late for me to take it back. The box is long gone, and I didn't open it for about 3 months after I bought it.I'm really dissappointed, I thought with this being a leapfrog product it would be great, that's why I didn't read the reviews first, I was so excited when I saw it in the store that I just bought it. My daughter loves things that she can interact with, but she can't push the pad hard enough for anything to happen. Actually the only thing we use is the animal page and the xylaphone page and she tries climbing all over it and gets lucky when she's leaning on it to make something happen.I wish I would have read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not like it at all!!!","review":"This is a piece of junk and a waste of money.

My husband and I thought the toy was really neat. My daughter did not. She flips the pages so fast you can't keep up and the off button is too tempting.

At this point, she finds the toy to be a complete bore and would much prefer to have us read her a normal book than to follow along with the LeapPad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad customer service","review":"My son received the Leap Frog Walker. The item came without leg support. I called customer service was told it would take 10 -15 days to get. Asked for supervisor. He said will be sent UPS ground most likely 4 - 5 days. I told him for severely developmentally delayed 12 month old and I need in my home for 3 days. Asked if he could ship priority, NOT over night, to get here. I was told he couldn't be responsible for an item bought from the store! The package was not tampered with, and when I told him that his attitude was rude / negative. I asked if he could help me, maybe he could send a donation to our town's new autism center. He said No - we already make other donations. This company does NOT promptly try to fix a problem. Even when I told him I would tell others of their poor customer service, which I am now doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for a 1 year old","review":"We bought this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas along with a bunch of books and the carry case.

We sit with her on my lap and play with it together. I have to hit some of the buttons for her, but she enjoys hearing the music and sounds, playing with the pages, and banging on it which will activate some of the sounds. I'm sure as she grows older her pressing the pictures will become more deliberate. Even though she doesn't do the stories in order and still needs some help to play with this toy, she is still having fun and enjoying it, and that's what counts. This is a toy that will grow with her as she gets older.I've also found that pressing and holding for a few seconds activates the sounds more easily than tapping. If you tap you have to hit the pictures pretty hard and it would be hard for a little one to do, but if you just press it's much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little fingers can't push hard enough!","review":"I'm a big fan of Leapfrog toys, but this one was disappointing. Little fingers cannot push hard enough to activate the books. We didn't get much use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work.","review":"I really like the leap pad products for my children. However, this one needs allot of work. The pages are really flimsy and is difficult to operate. My 18 month old toddler wanted just to push the on/off button. They need to make several adjusments to this item. It was hard even for me to push the touch system. I am hoping that they will change this item around to be more user friendly to the specified age group. It is a greatidea but poorly made. The touch is nice and should be more sensitive or have less pages, or something to the fact that they don't have to pound on the pad to get a response. I know leap pad can do better. We took this item back to the store ASAP! The pillow in the back is a nice idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for the kids and parents","review":"We were very excited about this product, but due to following things returned it.1. The touch does not work, you have to push the finger for it to work2. The ON-OFF button is in front and \\"fun\\" for the kids, so they tend to press that more often.3. To start on the next page the kid has to tap on \\"Go\\", not intutive for 15 month old.4. The paper book is easy to tear-off.May be we will wait for LeapFrog to fix some of these problems, or better wait for our son to grow and use \\"My First LeapPad\\" instead of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning is a Joy!","review":"When I first tried the LittleTouch I was mesmerized with the stories and songs. So was my lttle girl. The animation is so original and the music is easy to remember. I love the positive spin the child hears when an error is made and there is every encouragement given to try and try to do better. The size is good for little hands and easy to use for a little one. This is a great introduction to music, and the best way for a child to grow up learning to love learning. It is easy to keep their interest because of the movement and the color and the sound competing for attention in such a fun filled way. I love Leap Frog and just know I'm doing to best for my children when I see them using the Leap Pad and now the LittleTouch LeapPad on their own. Thanks for making toys that challenge children's minds and let then enjoy doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking it Back","review":"We have a three year old son with special needs, and we asked my mom to buy this for his birthday. We are taking it back, however, because it is VERY hard to push and get a response. I thought it would be great because he would get a musical/verbal response from pushing on the right object, etc. But, instead I even got frustrated playing with it. I, too, love Leap Frog and can't believe they produced such a poorly made toy. I called Leap Frog, and they said to exchange it because it shouldn't be that hard to push, and there must be something wrong with ours. After reading the reviews, though, we are getting our money back because it sounds like everyone is having the same problem. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Touch Leap Pad, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways....","review":"My husband bought this for our daughter, thinking it would be a fun, interactive toy for her to play with. Well, it's not. It's a great concept, but give it to a toddler to test drive. The directions are tough for a child to follow - certain keys have to be hit in certain sequences - and it really is nothing more than an exercise in frustration for her, and for anyone trying to show the child how to use it! I'd rather we spent the money on some good books or simple wooden toys, which encourage all the skills the Little Touch Leap Pad is designed to foster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made with a Baby in Mind!!!","review":"Although the this toy sounds like it would be great. It's not! First the book has paper pages. Not the shiny coated paper, but regular thin paper that will easily rip. But the part that gets me the most is the age range is all wrong. In order to make this work, you have to push 2 different buttons on seperate pages so that the leap pad knows what page your on. My toddler sure doesn't understand that. Plus you have to push really hard to make the book respond. I have a 10 month old and a 2 year old who both get so frustrated with it. The 10 month old becuase she can't make it work, and thhe 2 year because when he touches things, it always says the wrong thing because he didn't press the 2 bottons first every time you turn the page. I can see a 3 year old playing with this maybe, but the 6 month-2 year age recemendation is all wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun","review":"I bought this toy for my daughters first birthday plus 2 more books and cartridges. I am at a loss trying to figure out how to get her to play with it and not crumple the pages. She will sit still longer to play with a board book than the LeapPad. I hope she grows into but I don't think six month olds to one year olds can really get any real use of this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for over 18 months","review":"This is fun to play with your child who is in the button pushing stage (mine hit that at 21 months). Mine loves all the noises and things to look at. I am going to add some software at the point to add some variety. This was a gift received at the 1st birthday, but my kid has not really played with it until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and Impossible to Operate By Age Range Suggested","review":"We bought this for my daughter last year for her first birthday. She'll be two soon and pretty much the only things she can operate on her own are the on/off switch and the flat cards that accompany the books (only after I push the \\"Green Go Circle\\" and then the \\"Lightbulb\\" on the other side of the page to get it going for her).As for the books, if you don't touch the \\"Green Go Circle\\" every time you turn a page the Leap Pad has no idea what page you're on and will respond to the page it thinks you're on. So, in my daughter's case, she flips the pages randomly and comes up with some strange results.This product was a great concept but obviously not designed or tested with real world kids in mind. I don't know about anybody else's toddler, but it's a rare day when she will sit down with me and let me \\"lead\\" her through a toy as you have to do with this one to get it to work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"We bought the Little Touch for my 11 month old, and of course he wasn't impressed with the story, he wanted to tear up the books. My main problem is that our books don't fit into the console. Every one of them except the book that came with the product fall out. It is very hard to have story time with him and he can literally pull the story out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I was surprised how flimsy the pages were and easy to cease and fold. My son got it for his 1st birthday and by his 2nd birthday used it probably a total of 10 or less times.

My daughter is 16-months-old and loves books so I figured this would be perfect for her. Wrong! The On/Off switch is right on the front, so she kept turning it on and off. Once it turns off, the settings reset to the lowest level. We want to use it at the higher level, which asks questions about the pictures. So every time she turned it off, I had to go ahead and reprogram the thing! Plus, the books are made of very flimsy material.I ended up taking it back. What a shame! I'll keep watching for a redesign. I can't imagine the LeapFrog folks won't fix these very simple and very silly problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy is a bit complicated for an active toddler","review":"We bought this toy for my son at 16 months, and he still is not interested in much else than turning it off and on. I'm sure it will be better used later. For those parents having trouble pushing the buttons, The toy comes with a lot of activity cards that are installed behind the book. You have to remove the cards behind the book before it works easily. I didn't know about them either, and the buttons were tough for me to push. Now they are easier to push and if my son gets into it, I think he will learn to push the buttons too."},{"rating":"1","title":"no battery shut off","review":"my 15 month old is too young to push the buttons in the book ... but he does love to push the on/off button.for some reason, in the 21st century ... they created a toy without an automatic battery shut-off.

The batteries went dead the first time within a week .... the second time we didn't bother to replace them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for one-on-one time","review":"I bought this toy so my son & I could have something to look at together and talk about. He is 14 months old and will sit in my lap for about 10 minutes while we look at the pictures and touch them to activate the sounds, which he enjoys. This is definitely not a toy that he will sit alone and play with, and my only complaint is that the on/off button is on the front so sometimes he'll keept turning it on and off. Otherwise, it's a nice tool for us to use together to talk about colors, animals, and numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating!","review":"My child is 16 months old and the biggest problem I see with this device is that the on / off button is too fun! She would rather touch that buttion than anything else. I feel as if I have wasted my money but I will try it again in a few months. ( I feel Leap Frog could of made a switch on the side.) My advice...buy when your child is 6 months so they can have fun with your interactions...or wait til your child is 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very impressed by the presentation of this item online so I bought this system for my daughter when she was around 6 months old.

The most fun she has is trying to rip the pages out (which by the way are flimsy like many others have said). We think the idea is great, and I think she'll enjoy using a toy like this at 2yrs old, but at that point I would rather buy the Powertouch by Mattel. On the Powertouch, she will be able to push the buttons on her own (not so w/ the little touch since it requires a firm hand) and she will be able to follow the story since the powertouch recognizes which page the child is on. (Yipee, no green GO button!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Your money is better spent on regular books instead of this electronic gizmo. You have to press hard to get any of the pictures to make a noise so a child will have a hard time using this without an adult. I bought this for my 1yr old daughter, and my niece (3ys) and nephew (4yrs) also played with it. They all got bored easily. It was never something they took out to play with, it was done with my encouragement to try to get my money's worth. I ended up selling it at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor design","review":"My 17 month old son is very interested in this toy when he sees me playing with it, but he only wants to push the on/off button and volume because it's the only part of the toy that actually does anything when he pushes it. The touch pad doesn't work because he doesn't push it hard enough. As is, the toy is useless. If they would hide the on/off and volume buttons and make the touch pad more sensitive, then the toy would be something that my son would love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy board books instead","review":"I am really dissappointed with this toy. I bought this toy for my 13 month son at Christmas. We no longer play with it because he can't hit the buttons hard enough to make anything happen and the books are only made of paper so they rip very easy. You would think they would have made the pages laminated so they would be more durable for the little hands that touch it. This may be good for little ones who don't touch or for bigger kids who know how to sit nicely and read. Definitely not for an active 1 year old who still chews books."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible learning tool!","review":"I purchased this toy for my 22 month-old son for Christmas, and I cannot wait to return it to the store! I have to agree with the reviews preceeding mine about the on/off switch. It is a magnet for little hands - as is the volume button. Once you get passed that, then there's the \\"go\\" button that you have to push on each page so the story will match the illustrations. It took my husband and I a while to figure that out and we're smart people! It is not a toy designed for the age group it specifies (6-36 months). Perhaps on the older end of that range but overall, I found it very confusing and uninteresting to my son. Like others have said, read a book to your child instead. It's cheaper and much simpler. After searching all over for this gadget during the holidays and finally finding it, I am thoroughly disappointed! What a waste of money. This toy needs alot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a book instead!","review":"I was very excited about this product for my 18-mt. old son and purchased the LeapPad and all the books that were available at the time. My son is now 2 1/2 and STILL doesn't really play with it. What an frustrating toy! The On/Off button on the front of the machine is a toddler-magnet and the attraction becomes one of turning it on and off, etc. You have to press hard to get the noises to activate and it's frustrating to have to press the \\"GO\\" button every time a page is turned. It confuses a kid when they turn the page and the sounds don't match the pictures.This is supposed to be an interactive product, designed to be used with parent and child together. However, this is NOT a necessary purchase. If you want an interactive activity, read a book and make noises. We as a society have convinced ourselves that electronic toys are educational. Seriously, your child will have more fun and you'll enjoy it more when you read a book TOGETHER. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm selling this in a garage sale...","review":"Perhaps those that have reported better experiences have a version that has been fixed, I bought ours over a year ago when they first came out and from the first time we used it, I hated it. It really was difficult for even me to get the thing to do anything with my finger. The tip of my finger would turn white! My now 2 year old still can't get it to work for her all the time when she pushes the pages. I think the pages are too thick or something. I'm planning on selling mine. I only have 3 books, but I'm not wasting anymore money on this toy. I'm moving on to the My First Leap Pad, my daughter will enjoy that one much more and I might as well have gotten that one when she was one since I'm the one doing all the work anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD FOR 6-9 MONTHS","review":"My son was more interested in ripping the papers than looking at the book. I babely let him touch it because the sheets are so thin. Even though it has that padding for your lap it was still pretty difficult to hold while I read to my son. THis book is for toddlers, not for infants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I wish I had read some of these reviews before I purchased this for my 15 month-old. I can hardly press hard enough on the pictures to make it work. And she certainly can't. The on/off button is the only thing she cares about, and that keeps her attention for about 5 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"LeapFrog could've done better!","review":"I bought this for my 12 month old son. I was soooooo excited about this toy, and thought it would provide hours of mommy and me time. Boy was I wrong! The on/off button should be on the the back, that's all my son wants to do, turn it on and off, the pages are somewhat flimsy, and wrinkle easily. It is not suitable for a 12 month old, perhaps a 18 month old, 12 months is just too young to grasp the concept. I wish I would've thrown away the box, or that thing would be returned to the store! I would NOT recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fast reading methodology","review":"This is a must read before launching in other speed reading books.

There is practically no information here that someone who is aware of Bruce Haack would not already be aware of. The commentary from modern day musicians on Haack's work is pretty far from insightful too - they mostly go on like stoned retards about how \\"messed up\\" and \\"trippy\\" his kids stuff was. Despite this fact, the film completely omits the fact that Haack had a drug problem himself and that it contributed to the heart failure that caused his death. Perhaps this is because there was too much enthusiasm for drugs from everyone involved here to risk portraying them in a negative light. There is some great archival footage of Bruce Haack's television appearances here, but it is cut short. I would much rather have had a DVD of his complete television work, including the commercials he scored, rather than this fluffy mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spider-Man 2 for kidz!","review":"Seeing the screenshots, videos, and general art direction of this game got me quite excited. What I was expecting was an update to Spider-Man 2 with cel shaded graphics and new moves/secrets/characters/etc.What it boils down to is a very short and repetitive experience with little to no replay value unless you like looking for little tokens in a huge, ugly city. If you're expecting the fine tuned controls and moves from Spider-Man 2, you'll be disappointed. You can do anything from the very start of the game, and it's very little.I wouldn't even recommend this as a time waster, it's just an excuse for Activision to rake in some cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Spider-man review 02:","review":"I am a big spider-man fan.

Make sure to remove the plastic cover over the ink outlet at the bottom of the cartridge (something you don't have to do with the Brother brand cartridges)so the ink can come out! : The print-outs are of acceptable quality.

What PF is is a tour thru the World of Sensuality & Sexuality in a very provocitive way. It is a very seductive album with nice pulsating rhythms and ethreal voices. PF goes from a nice slow pulse to a mild techno like beat that does not overwhelm the listener but envelops them in the journey. This is a fun and sexy cd to listen to. Yeah its one of those albums you can put on when you and your sweetie are alone with lights out & candles lit. Just listen to the backrounds in this CD and youll know what I mean. Unfortunately its a rare item to snag these days but if you have an oppertunity to get this- DO SO!!! Highly Reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT enigma!!!!!","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Portland below. I found this CD through a link from enigma, and, also being a HUGE enigma fan, am constantly looking for similar \\"bands\\". Pleasure Force comes no way near. I would like to re-state what he has already said. This is a cheap and tacky attempt at enigma - I just wish someone had written this before I bought it. The music itself would not be that bad if it were not attempting to be suductive. This lacks darkness and mystery, and the songs come across as cheesy and silly, complete with hilarious grunting noises and the ludicrous, childish repetiton of words like \\"sex\\" and \\"feel it\\", etc. This is definately not the soothing, sensual and lustful creation which it is attempting to be. If you want that, buy any of the three enigma albums. Not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak attempt at Enigma","review":"Being an Enigma fan I am always looking for an artist with like sounds. I always wondered why no other performers tried to emulate this sound. When searching through Amazon I stumbled upon the \\"If you like .....\\" area. I took a chance and ordered Pleasure Force. A big mistake on my part. I concider this purchase to be one of the worst CD's in my entire collection. I wrote this review with the intent to save others the same fate. My free advice to you would be if you want Enigma, buy Enigma. There is no substitute. Sorry PF fans.

What facinates me most about these and others like it is that they sell, ... and sell a lot... and unlike this books' subject matter ... THAT is truly fascinating. (...) These books exploit and reinforce the short attention span/quick fix mentallity of those who read them while all the time purporting to arm their readers with the very principles they are destroying.In very simple analagy, it is like telling us that only hard work pays big dividends, and then asking for big dividends for having told us that hard work pays big dividends. If we hand over the money, we invalidate the very principle for which we are handing over the money. The joke really is on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book was neither entertaining nor insightful. It tried unsuccessfully to use mice and cheese as an analogy to life's bigger challenges. As other readers have stated, the authors trivialized a very serious subject and thus neglected the deeper issues surrounding life's changes.

I feel sorry for all of those who had to read this thing in a corporate or motivational environment. This book is so insulting, now you know what your management or leadership really thinks about you. They think you are an idiot.

Its another exapmle of someone operating on the time tested principal of \\"if you want to adress corporate types and get them to understand anything, you must speak to them like kindergardeners\\". The concepts in this book are so basic, that if you are the type of person that found some sort of personal revalation in this book, then you have much larger problems to deal with than facing change.

Now THAT is recommended reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese Management","review":"Who Moved My Cheese is one of the most puerile, patronising books it has ever been my misfortune to read. The basic premise is that all change is good, and that clinging onto old attitudes is bad, without taking into account that some old attitudes and behavioural patterns are based on sound experience and expertise. It appears, in style, to be aimed at five year olds, and is very poorly written. A typical load of managerial claptrap forced on employees to brainwash them into thinking that change management is always good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Baloney","review":"If the author truly wanted to help people in the workplace, he/she would have written a book about effectively managing change, with quitting your current workplace a last resort. This book should be titled, \\"We Can't Fire You, So Why Don't You Just Quit.\\" This is indeed a book that assists corporations in shoving excess personnel off the cliff so they are no longer their problem. To be an effective employee you have to be an obedient non-thinking mouse? Sheesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small in size but large on insight.","review":"This small book is great reading.

If it aint broken don't fix it.If the person has \\"his cheese\\" taken away, sure its time to move on and look for \\"new cheese\\" But from a business prespective, how many times have you seen new management come in and screw things up.

Two mice sniff out the cheese in the maze of life, one elfkin human refuses to look elsewhere when it runs out, the other finally takes a risk by doing so. I agree it's a stretch to call this a book. It is a quick and easy read even for a \\"look-say\\" reader. If you feel compelled to read this go to the local bookstore and read in it the aisle. You would get more entertainment and a greater life lesson in value from lighting the cash this book costs on fire and contemplating what you've done while watching it burn. This is by the wrong half of the One Minute Manager writing team. If like me, you are in need of directed \\"self-help,\\" skip this pablum and read something with useful application advice like, Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't move cheese for me","review":"It's a good little story, but it's too black and white.

The concept is phenomenol, accept change and move on. I found \\"Oh The Places You'll Go\\" by Dr. Seuss to be a much more fulfilling book. Again, if you are trying to motivate a child--or possibly a teen, this is a great book, but as an adult, I only found this book mildly entertaining. I'm sure the author took his cheese and laughed his way all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Why is this cheese being moved so much?\\"","review":"The reviewers who ask, \\"Why is this cheese being moved so much?\\", are the very people for whom this book was written, and they just don't know it. Bad things happen, so why waste your time asking \\"why\\"? It is best to be ready and just \\"get on with it\\". If you don't like the cheese being moved all the time by the \\"higher ups\\", have the guts to quit and find other work. The bad news is you will find the same problem at your next job.

I enjoyed the story itself and could see my self rather clearly in one of the characters. I thought the introduction was a bit long. I think the reason the the book is so widely appreciated is because the author knew that you have every spectrum of employee in your average company, from those with a Ph.D. all the way to those who did not graduate High School. In order to speak to a wide audience, you must put it into terms for everyone's consumption. This book may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that change is a regular ingredient in our lives that we must come to grips with.

Anyone looking for insight and guidance out of this odd parable will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense for the masses","review":"This book focuses on the simple notion of embracing and expecting changes in our lifes or risk unhappiness. The analogy used to convey the book's message, albeit effective, was a little childish.

The authors must have owned the publishing company. Having worked in the field of change management for years (I am not telling how many) I can tell you that keeping it simple is very important, however what these authors did to the topic makes it seem WAY too simple. If you want a god change management book that has at least 1 ounce of meat to it, I recommend Todd Jick's Managing Change, or Leading Strategic Change by Dave Hanna, or even Chris Argyris's Integrating the Individual and Organization, which is one of my favorites.

The authors co-wrote \\"The One Minute Manager.\\" This should give you a hint--they only have about 30 seconds of sound advice each."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about power","review":"When you write a book on why those WITHOUT power should be accepting of any treatment by those WITH power, you're guaranteed to sell millions of copies of said book to those WITH power. It's little wonder that managers, CEOs, teachers, and pretty much anyone with authority over others praises this book. It gives them a moral blank cheque, and condemns anyone NOT in a position of power for even questioning, to say nothing of failing to conform.If you want a crash course in what's wrong with humanity, read this book. The fact that there are people in this world who read and agree with it is horrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok story stretched (thin) into a book","review":"What was probably a decent (if somewhat cutesy) analogous tale about not only embracing change, but creating it -- was stretched and pulled to its breaking point. This is a tale that does not warrant being bound into a book -- a pamphlet, maybe, but not a book.Not only is the type HUGE, but there is a sidebar-type note written on a block of cheese on practically every other page. The contents of this cheese-wedge are trite at best, insulting to the intelligence at worst.This is a story that should be told, not sold, especially not if selling it involves adding 20 extra pages of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book!","review":"If you are a manager who wants to be excused for his/her bad decisions by disguising them as \\"change\\" that \\"just happens,\\" this is the book you should make mandatory reading for your employees.That's how a lot of corporate America works, after all: companies do not make mistakes, it's the employees who cannot adapt to \\"change.\\"Oh, I almost forgot. Make sure that you are managing a bunch of intellectually challenged individuals, because any person of average intelligence will find this book very insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Father Knows Best\\" for business","review":"This book is tained for me because when I first read it I worked for a company who did not value their employees. There was a lot of restructuring going onand the \\"grunts\\" were nervous and anticipated things getting worse and worse. Suddenly this magical book appeared, everyone was forced to read it & later watch the movie. Changes did happen and people continued to be unhappy. I no longer work there.This book is management PROPAGANDA. \\"Father knows best\\" for business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please.....","review":"The idea that change is inescapable is nothing new. Just ask the Buddha....... What is insulting is to have it suggested that I just accept change at face value, without looking to see if the change has any merit in the first place. Change for change's sake is a waste of time, resources, and stress that could otherwise be used more effectively elsewhere. And to have managers try to use this as a way to manipulate their workers is a shame--the idea being, \\"Accept this change without question, or risk being seen as not being a 'team player'\\". Or worse, \\"You're not thinking outside of the box, using a new paradigm\\" (God, that is so cliche and simplistic.) It gets old hearing, \\"Change is good......change is our friend......do not question.....\\" George Orwell was right. Save your money, friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, folks; this one is just ok.","review":"Very much skewed to the corporate mentality, I read it in a support group for adults \\"newly alone\\" thru death and divorce. Admittedly, my perspective is probably not the one for which the book was written, so take my lack of rabid enthusiasm with a grain of salt. I object strongly to the two \\"mice\\" and their stereotypical characterizations. Hey, move your own cheese. If I had known what it was about (ones persective on change and challenges is what makes the difference), I wouldn't have schlogged thru it. Rave reviews? Sorry, folks; this one is just ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Was Hit Over the Head with a Block of Cheese at Birth?","review":"This book is a pure, unadulterated waste of money. It is targeted at brain-washing the hapless minions that are unfortunate enough to work under the \\"guidance\\" of one of this book's fans. Save your money. Here is the summary: \\"Sure your job stinks - you have to do whatever we say! And, by the way, your job dissatisfaction is only PARTIALLY due to the constant reorganizations foisted upon you by management attempting to obfuscate failures. Since you have no choice in the matter, get used to us moving the cheese just as you are closing in on your precious sales target/performance objective/other personal success metric!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Should this have been for children?","review":"Acclaimed as a thought provoking way to get you to look at your attitude towards change. It came off as a condesending children's book. It wanted you to identify with a character when really it was telling you who you should be by only developing one character. And, for it to think that we are not at sometimes all of the characters at once, is silly. It was shallow to imply that the mice found the cheese because of their instinct and took off without overthinking. The author never explored the dangers of mouse traps.For a more grown up read, try Managing Personal Change by Hyrum W. Smith (Reader), Stephen R. Covey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is inevitable in life","review":"Who Moved My Cheese is a well thought out, but practical written book.Change is inevitable in life and when it is time to change, you need to be prepared for it and take action. That is what the mice did, sprung into action when they went into the maze to get the cheese that had been there every day. The mice went to get their cheese only to find out that the cheese had been moved. They quickly put back on their jogging sutis and running shoes that they hung up, to find more cheese. However, the little people also found that when they went to get their cheese had been moved,analyzed the situation too long that they almost starved.The jist of the story is what ever your cheese is, don't be too analytical that you can't do what you need to make it happen for yourself.I really enjoyed the book, I believe everyone should read this book who is and is not comfortable with change. They will learn alot of great techniques and philosophical ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for the hopelessly lost","review":"If you're big headed like me and think you have most things figured out you're going to find that this book is simply too simple to be beneficial. Nothing new and nothing really beneficial in this book unless you're hopelessly lost in which case, don't bother reading it, you're hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Moved My Cheese","review":"While I wasn't interested at all in reading this book, it is something that I'm glad I did. Told as an 'fairy tale' it has real life implications and helps to show how difficult or liberating change can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew cheese could be so meaningful!?","review":"If you are facing a change in your life or if you are starting to feel that you need a change in your life then you have got to read this book. It is a simple story with a profound moral. If you have been resistant to change or afraid of change, you will see yourself in the pages of this book. It is an easy read, you will finish it in an hour so don't pay too much for it, buy used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, quick read","review":"This book is simply wonderful. It is a quick, entertaining read that is straight to the point while being very relatable as well. I was assigned this book as part of a class assignment, and had been told about it over the years by several people. I finally picked it up to read it and read it in one sitting. I highly recommend it to everyone, figure out which character you are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"45 Minutes of Your Life You'll Never Have Back","review":"This book is complete tripe. It was required reading for my office because my boss went to a seminar where 1/2 the people there said it \\"changed their life\\".If you want a book that will \\"change your life\\", try reading the works of John Stuart Mill or Nietszche. Read the works of Jalaluddin Rumi. Or try reading The Qu'ran, The Torah, The Bible, or The Baghavad Gita. Or even better, read _The Star-Bellied Sneetches_ by Dr. Seuss. The message is infinitely wiser and the book won't insult your intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Instead, borrow the book from one of the thousands (millions?) who were either gullible or dutiful enough to buy it, spend 20-30 minutes reading it, then take the money you would have spent on the book and buy the parody, \\"Who Cut the Cheese?\\", by Stilton Jarlsberg. A backdrop against which to enjoy the parody is the only good reason to read this book, unless you NEED to have the obvious pointed out to you in a mixture of inane platitudes and 5th grade English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so amazing","review":"Under certain circumstances, this book is helpfull, such as in personal relationships, tragedy, disaster, etc, but this books advice can be summed up pretty well in one sentence:Get over it, and get on with your life.But, in the context of someone making profit or gaining power by change, this book is dangerous. Unquestioning acceptence of change encourages unethical behavior on the part of those who orchestrate change. It could even be argued that it is unethical to encourage blind acceptace of such changes. One only needs to look at history or read the news to see this pattern emerge. Enron comes to mind. So do most political dictatorships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cut My Health Benefits?","review":"I could've saved a lot of paper and written this \\"parable\\" using five words: \\"[stuff] happens, deal with it\\". Don't ask questions, don't think creatively, just put on your little running shoes and join the rat race. If someone cuts your benefits, your pay, your job, don't ask \\"Why\\" -- it's probably your fault anyhow. Just deal with it.This book implies that we are better off blindly following our animal instincts or the directives of others (\\"Two Blind Mice\\"?) rather than using our reasoned intellect. As \\"suggested\\" reading in a workplace, this book will do nothing more than foster resentment amoungst the thinking masses.And to the manager who \\"suggested\\" I read this, I plan to \\"suggest\\" she read Dostoyevsky's \\"Notes From Underground\\" or Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" for a more thoughtful depiction of man's relationship with the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile drivel for the weak-minded","review":"This book is so lame, tedious and insulting that if your employer forces you to read it - I would strongly suggest you go in search of better cheese. I don't know what sort of person is so naive as to need the 'advice' and 'lessons' that this book supposedly teaches, but I weep for us all if there are people who can genuinely learn something from this garbage.The writing style, storyline and basic analogy are fit only for ten year olds. It might be a good read for a rotten child who is having trouble coming to terms with the basic unfairness of life, but no semi-intelligent adult should be subjected to it.The fact that this book has enjoyed so much success is a sad sign of the dismal condition of our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame and condescending look at the obvious","review":"This book is being passed around in order to brainwash employees not to think for themselves or to speak out against unfair or disruptive processes and procedures that management may ineptly impose upon those employees. It is trite and inappropriate and conveys the worst sentimentality of all regarding typical top-down patronizing behaviour. I assisted a company to become acquired and this was passed around as a panacea to people working with the company who had very real and pertinent questions that were not being answered. Perfect for hypocrites in human resources and others who earn their living by lying to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra-Simplistic Basics at a High Price","review":"This book can easily be read in 20 minutes while say, browsing in your favorite bookstore. Then you can save your money to buy a real book. The \\"story\\" is crude, uninteresting and poorly told. It's written to illustrate the points the author wants to make about embracing change. It's hard to believe that people will shell out alot of money to read what should be a chapter in a book or could stand alone as a magazine article. Overall, it did serve as a very quick and very very basic reminder about anticipating change in life, but don't waste your money buying it, just read it in a bookstore and buy something else you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good metaphore for chnage, but...","review":"The two mice and two little people characters of this book show good metaphores for change. However, the story and the premise needs more to be practical in the business world today. After you have read this book, you do feel \\"comforted\\" that there are individuals like you, but the issue is that the change that happend to YOU is very unique, and this book does not deal with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and fluffy","review":"Not quite as deep and meaningful as a lot of people would lead you to believe it is. If you're down with not getting yourself into a rut and dealing with change then the underlying message in this book will leave you thinking,\\"that's it\\"?I'm sure the message would be eye opening for some, but it's tough to believe that it will help people who have been working for more then a couple of years in the corporate world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz -- Great cure for insomniacs","review":"Dull with a capital D. Five minutes of plot squeezed into just thirty minutes of reading. What was originally used as a 5-minute icebreaker on the speaker circuit has now been stretched to the breaking point.What was he thinking? This book is an oxymoron. If you are among the audience for which this book is intended, then you can't possibly like it. On the other hand, if you like to watch those bonehead movies made from SNL skit plots, you'll probably love this, too.I wish I had waited for the abridged edition. It will be two paragraphs, max. (Really!) BTW, I highly recommend the One Minute Manager, but this one is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, but failed","review":"I tried to read this book. My boss, Luanne, thought it would be an excellent help to the morale of her department, and forced all of us to read the novel, after swearing up and down about how wonderful it was. Of course, we read it, fearing the consenquences. At least, I tried to. I found this book lackwitted, uninspired, and utterly insipid. As a allogorical self-help book, I felt as though I was being force-fed a dish meant for a five year old. The characters are \\"cheesy\\" and of course limited. I found it a bland read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Moved My Twenty Bucks?","review":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" has the depth of a high school pep rally. It does nothing more than present the obvious in an oversimplistic parable which fails to address the deeper social and psychological problems created when change occurs outside the control of those most affected. The suggestion that once the cheese is moved all one need do is follow the trail to a new and better supply is and insult to the thousands of people whose lives have been turned upside down by uncaring corporations which make their changes based solely on the overriding principle of enhanced profits. This book would be better titled \\"Who Moved My Twenty Bucks?\\" as it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This literary classic smells of Gorgonzola","review":"My boss forced me and others to read this marvel of literature to pave the way for a new 'exciting' (why are management techniques always veiled in excitement?) policy at a luxury menswear store. It reflects his intelligence and character. I am not exagerating when I claim that this book embarasses its author and insults the reader with the most banal statements since Cathy Lee. The reason the cheese was moved is because it started to smell! Who cut the Cheese is what I asked when I finished this masterpiece. If you're thinking of having your employees read it, it's guaranteed to make them hate you and ridicule you. The subject of change requires thoughtful insight not childish tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Pricey book, Small Cheap Advice","review":"I can't believe this book has become the hit that it has. It is an oversimplified manual on how to deal with change in the workplace. The author ASSUMES that your problem is having become complacent and arrogant... feeling that the world owes you something. An assumption that is not always correct! Take a minute, think about your situation and how you could have seen it coming, and the best way to move on. There, now you've gotten the whole gist of the book... without paying for it! My boss laid these on several people's desks... maybe that should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Corporate Mind Control Propaganda","review":"This is a best seller? I suppose it gained that status because large corporations put in orders for thousands of copies and gave them to their employees, or required that employees buy the book. Sniff and Scurry represent the mindless blue-collar laborers who, when their jobs are eliminated and sent to a third-world country where labor is cheap, have no choice but to sniff out new employment if they can, no questions asked. Hem and Haw represent the more \\"mindful\\" middle management corps who are supposed to swallow anything the all-powerful cheese movers tell them. I was insulted by this book and I hope that workers see through its propaganda. Not all change is needful and good, especially when it is imposed upon us for the self-serving purposes of mindless and heartless corporations. Wake up! And refuse to eat this moldy cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Who Cut the Cheese?\\" because this one stinks!","review":"Some sharp marketing kid fresh out of college gets 5 stars for figuring out how to sucker businesses into buying this piece of trash in bulk. My company held a contest to get us to read this pathetic excuse for a management/self-help book. Halfway through the book I fell asleep because Dr. Johnson managed to write in monotone and drag out what should have been a more effective story. The big print and big margins should have been a big clue that this book was a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuinely Insulting...","review":"Genuinely insulting to the independent thinker. Yeah I know, it's been said countless times but I felt the need to reinforce that notion. If you're someone that's more comfortable being a follower and having your life and work environment structured for you then you're more likely to enjoy this book and find something meaningful in it. If you're someone that uses logic and reason to guide your decisions then don't waste your time or money on this rehashed brainwashing manual. This is a book written for unquestioning, mindless followers, not a book for leaders. But a tool that leaders would use to try and control their subordinates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome Back to 3rd grade","review":"very simple reading and possibly an effective starter book for those who have not been in position to require any motivational skills. the book, however insults the intelligence of those who are the least bit aware of ethical business practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, kinda basic","review":"This book is basically a parable that can be read in about 20 minutes at the local bookstore cafe. Yes, the moral of the story is important, but you don't really learn anything new.

This little story however shows how easy it is to get stuck in a rut and ways we often deal with it. The fun way the message is conveyed gives you a mantra to remember change isn't bad or good it's all in how you deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Surprised!","review":"I am surprised that more people are not raving about this simple book that uses simple concepts that can be so amazingly powerful. Recognizing how we deal with change, and really understanding what that means in our lives, can be one of the most powerfully moving experiences, and life altering events.I was so impressed with it at work, I made my whole extended family (even those in Iran) read it. They all enjoyed it, and some even made significant changes in how they look at their lives as a result.How do you handle change, and what can that mean for you? Read the book and find out - and share it with friends and family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and Valuable --- but Potentially Dangerous","review":"I never intended to even pick this book up. The title didn't particularly interest me. But it turned out to be an appealing little story, and a useful little handbook for dealing with change management at all levels and in all aspects of life. Normally, I deem books like this condescending, but the story here is so typical and essential, I thought that it could actually be effective --- especially for those in upper management, whose comprehension levels are usually somewhat limited. My fear, though, is that the book might do no more than serve as a downsizing handbook for upper management. Nonetheless, there is value to be gained from the story --- value that can help one deal with any kind of change, be it job-related or in one's personal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple yes, effective yes","review":"Yes, this book is simple and short (I read it in less than one hour). Does that mean it's not effective? NO. As I was reading this book the quote \\"what would you be doing if you were not afraid\\" hit me like a ton of bricks. Think about it, how would you be living and loving if you were fearless? Probably not the way you are living now, right? My only complaint about the book is that it somewhat indicated that workers in the work force need to be more flexible. True, but my experience with corporate America has always been that upper management in America needs to be more flexible and not so content to say \\"but, we've always done it this way\\" when asked why are we doing something that doesn't make sense or is not cost effective. The book is worth reading whether you are having problems keeping up with the changes in your workplace or home. It would make a great gift for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great 30 minute read to get you thinking!","review":"This book is a great quick read that actually gets you thinking about your priorities in life. I would highly recommend it to anyone in one of life's little ruts!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The advice is good but...","review":"The childish writing style gets old very quickly. If you're smart you can learn from a lot of different sources. I don't want to say there is nothing to be learned here. It's just that you can see the destination of this book long before you get there. And it's not a long book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, stupid, obvious","review":"This book spread through my office like chicken pox in a nursery school. I'm still looking for the moron who brought it in. The only thing interesting about this book is the way the author manages to bore and insult your intelligence at the same time. My advice, don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Moved My Cheese","review":"It is a shame there's not a \\"no star\\" rating for a book like this. In all my years in business I have never read a book with so little to offer. Not only is it written for the third grader, it is packed with such infantile and hackneyed platitudes that it's demeaning to the serious reader.If this is considered a\\"hot\\" business book, the future of our business community is in serious trouble.Try writing a book that challenges the mind, not one that numbs it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese Whiz","review":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" is a follow-up story, a part two if you will, to the author's first inspirational novel \\"Who Cut the Cheese?\\" Both stories stink just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read......if you're five.","review":"This book is insulting in its simplicity. Clearly the authors (and much of corporate America, apparently) believe the common worker to be so simple minded that it's impossible to write too beneath them. Talk about dumbing down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"who cares where the cheese went","review":"I was given a copy of this book several years ago by someone who enjoyed this book. I, however, found it mundane! I didn't have the perspective of hem/haw or the mice. I just wanted trash that maze after reading page after page of the stuff. Life is always \\"throwing curveballs\\" and this dinky book just made me hostile and annoyed. There just aren't simple solutions for big problems, we are way more complex than rats in a maze. If everything was as simple as the \\"metaphorical maze\\". Empty book for me, if it \\"helped\\" anyone, so be it. It only takes an hour to read it.

It is an engaging fairy tale, but it ends there. It tells everyone what they already know, and then suggests that if they want to survive (find cheese), they will need to be willing to change. Well OK, that's fair. But when you start to look at how do you get people to change, how do you engage senior leaders to make change happen - the tumbleweeds start blowing by. I am sorry, but people do not want to change, and reading a book doesn't do it. To change requires leadership, engagement, ownership and collective communication. This book addresses only part of this. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little reminder can't hurt...","review":"I agree with those who have given this book a poor review, in that, there really is nothing in it that you don't already know. However, I disagree that it is a waste of time to read. It is very easy in today's busy world to forget what you already know -- and that is that change happens. Yes, change happens every day and we are constantly dealing with it. However, sometimes it is easy to get stuck in a rut and resist change. If being conscious of a problem is half the battle, then how can this book be all bad? It definitely raises your awareness of how change affects all of us and provides simple ways to deal with it. I won't say it's the best book I've ever read, but it's definitely worth the 30 minutes it will take you to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A profound little book","review":"This book is an allegory set in a maze where two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two small people, Hem and Haw, go to find their cheese. One day the cheese is missing and that causes differing problems for the four creatures, depending on their personalities. This book takes some heavy-duty themes and puts them in a light context. In less than 100 pages the author brings up concepts such as values, entitlement, fear of failure, being proactive and the whole idea of leaving your comfort zone and venturing forth in new directions. There are many longer books that try to make a lot of points and do it in a much less effective way than this little gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but effective","review":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" first came to my attention from the animated video. So often we know what to do, but for some reason we don't do it. The format of this simple story, helps to make the ideas and principles come alive in a way that's easy to digest. For those reviewers who find it too simplistic, they could check out \\"Unlimited Power\\" by Tony Robbins, and \\"Anatomy of Success\\" by Ronald Kaufman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eyeopener","review":"I read this book while on a plane from BWI to Moline, Ill. It helped me open up my eyes to what I want out of life and has motivated me to start acting upon it. I encouraged my husband to read it.

In my opinion, move the cheese -- it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sniffy, scurry, hem or haw?","review":"Actually, none of the above, but I'm afraid that after people read this they will want to name me as one. While the message is simple and important (be ready and able to change), we all cannot be measured so narrowly. We have all been given the gifts of various emotions (including fear), spirituality and rationality to use in our decision making process. It defies logic that we would \\"strip\\" ourselves of these gifts and make such simplistic conclusions.What I fear even more is someone concluding that I must be a \\"hem\\" or a \\"haw\\" if I don't find this book as inspirational and motivational as the author said I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yawn","review":"This one wasn't as good as I expected, but I'm sure that's only because I've already read so many of these kinds of books about change.

In today's fast moving world, change happens constantly in both our personal and professional lives.

If you do not wish to read the book, simply take note of 7 rules of change that books is trying to address: change happens, anticipate change, monitor change, adapt to change quickly, change, enjoy change and be ready to change quickly and enjoy it again & again.

And just in case you don't Get The Message of any section, there's a left hand page cheese illustration with THE MORAL MESSAGE SPELLED OUT FOR YOU! And then, in case you didn't really understand the whole story (!), there's a kind of sitcom after-the-last-ad-break scenario where Ordinary People Like You And Me apply the messages to their own situations. I don't think 'It's Amazing' as most internet reviewers do, I feel amazingly depressed that this kind of psychobabble is purported to be Deep and Meaningful.

(As did everyone else working there) The only good thing I can say about it is that it's short, which makes it easier to choke down its vapid aphorisms and do-as-you're-told attitude. What little respect I had for our CEO evaporated upon reading this book. Fortunately, I no longer work at that company, nor does anyone else who was there when copies of this book were distributed. Our cheese was moved, as it were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I won't hash all that other previous reviewers who also gave it 1 star have already said.

I've seen the unfortunate results of a manager who adopted this book as his personnal philosophy. He found it easier to keep making changes because he thrived working in a chaotic environment. The result was the destruction of what had been a very efficient team. People packed their bags and left taking valuable experience and corporate knowledge with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredibly bad book.","review":"This one of those horrible books that you can't believe that anyone has the audacity to give 5 stars. I can't see how anyone could like this horrible, simplistic, annoying book. It basically comes down to don't mope about bad stuff that happens, just get on with your life. That's it. Not a terrible message in a certain context, but what happened to grieving time, coping, reflection? Learning from our mistakes, analyzing the situation. Instead it advocates simple reactionary behavior without contemplation or strategy. Complete and total garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not easy being this cheesy!","review":"Obviously the author found his cheese. Only he didn't eat it, he packaged it up and sold it to the \\"littlepeople.\\" The first thing I noticed when reading this book was that it has built-in defense mechanisms. People who disagree w/ this cheez are not \\"adapting,\\" don't want to \\"learn,\\" and are dubbed \\"Hems\\" just bcz they're not buying what he's selling. If you had any confidence in your message, why get so defensive only four pages in? I also agree .... that this book is a plus for management bcz it lets them believe that they are only moving cheese which is actually good for people and really not shafting anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who hate to read","review":"This is a 20 minute read with a 1-minute message. If you keep on doing what you're doing, you'll keep on getting what you've got. What's remarkable is the list price of this book. Considering the size of the type and brevity of the story, a very overpriced pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolves in Monks Clothing","review":"The cheese is desire, we are all in a maze called life chasing the cheese. True. And we all need to realize that change is the one certainty. We are happiest when we let go of clinging to our idea of cheese and live in reality, truly living genuine, open lives. (You have just read the book- dont bother buying it.) What makes me ill is that all this simplicity and truth seems to be a corporate way of saying that you had better buck up and have a good attitude because all Hem's are history. Insult to injury, it really IS written at about a 3rd grade reading level. \\"See Spot run!\\" can be life changing, too... if it is the first book you have ever read about dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition and suprising a good book.","review":"The book was in great condition when I got it, and I couldn't put it down. A pretty educational book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"A very simplistic and unrealistic view of embracing change. It will never reach those who really need it because they will fail to see themselves. In the harsh reality of the business world, this has little use. Maybe managers need to stop handing it out right before they downsize and realize they are not fooling anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insultingly simplistic homily about change in life","review":"\\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" makes its point - that we tend to be paralyzed with fear without justification over change - in its first two pages, then beats us unmercifully with it for another ninety-six. The gift of this book from a superior or coworker is tantamount to receiving a bottle of Scope anonymously. Save the 45 minutes you would spend reading this, update your resume, and get a new job. You got the same lesson, and didn't feel as if you'd just read \\"Winnie The Pooh Loses His Honey\\", which would no doubt be just as useful and not quite as insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Except that we're not lab mice, and you're no psychologist.","review":"The premise of this allegory is fundamentally flawed. We're not lab mice in this rat race, but we are being experimented upon. As the pay gap widens, this book is a brainwashing tool to try to convince us that not only is this okay, but we're bad mice if we don't embrace change which sells us short.They didn't move the cheese, they stole the cheese and are giving us garbage.As I write this note, this review has been up for a while and 82 people have voted on it so far, 48 finding it helpful. Excellent. I'd like to add that most of the people purchasing this book are actually corporations or managers to give as 'gifts' to the little mice who work for them. A present to give in exchange might be something by Howard Zinn perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As insightful as an episode of Full House","review":"I can not understand how anyone over the age of 5 would find any merit in this trite, insipid story. Read \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" and save yourself some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this \\"book\\"","review":"This is, by far, the most idiotic book I have ever read. It is hyped up as a book on dealing with change. So, I am sorry to say that I even bought copies for friends who are going through some difficult life changes. To my disappointment, the book attempts to promote blind conformance to change, regardless of whether it is a good change or a bad one, or whether it violates your values or not. It fully insults your intelligence and attempts to strip you from qualities like loyalty, dedication, or critical thinking. Just think! USA would not exist if Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and others just said \\"Oh, well! The British just moved our cheese. We just have to move with the cheese.\\" Really, the book is such a waste of money, time, and paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Moved His Common Sense?","review":"This book is about 100 pages of common sense mixed with a story on the reading level of a 3rd grader, perhaps lower. I'll now save you the time and money this book demands from you, be ready for change. There you go. The writing is simplistic, the points are all common sense wrapped around cheese analogies, and the author spends 20% of the book shilling his own story, which you just read. Avoid this book at all costs. It is yet another example of \\"literature\\" that corporations look to for a quick fix to their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese Flavoured Opium for the Little People","review":"The contempt and hate the American CEO class has for it's workforce (the little people) is the real theme of this book.It's frightening and depressing that so many managers bought it (allegedly by the crateload in some cases) and gave it to their employees, and forced them to read it.In corporate America, 'change' is often a euphemism for 'mass layoff' which makes this little book even more sinister. One of many questions it fails to answer is 'What if the cheese has moved to India?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story!","review":"Good short story. There's something for everyone yet some do not see themselves in it at all. It can be very personal and can also be very general.

I wanted to find out and then why someone would want to take another mans cheese? I know that I like Gouda. It tastes great and leaves no greasy after stains. Anyway if you need help for life et. al. This book attempts to show you how. Still needs more about cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Face the identification crisis with this book.","review":"This book really forced me to look at myself and choose which character I really could identify with.

But it is a great start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My worst lunch break ever","review":"I just read 'Who moved my cheese' over my lunch break by request of my HOD. I have never read anything that insulted my intelligence more than this. I can't believe that people in managerial positions would get anything out of this. How anyone could even get to a position of any authority, without already understanding the ideas put across in this book is beyond me.My advice to anyone thinking of buying this book, is to go and buy a pound of good sharp cheddar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate propaganda","review":"While there are genuine parts in this book which can be used in our personal lives, the book is totally corporate propaganda.It is meant for us to be happy to run around aimlessly at the whim of our corporate and government masters who have the rights to alter our lives in anyway they see fit. Also, to remember that if you complain about this, you will negatively influence others, and don't help, care or unite others (unionize), they had their chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Book!","review":"The moral of the cheese story can be summarized in one phrase --\\"change is good.\\" Even idoits should know this. I felt like this book was written for a five year old. If the book had used the standard size font, it would only consist of 5 pages. No book has annoyed me as much as this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese or moldy cheetohs?","review":"I guess this book would have been useful to me when I was 19 and struggling with learning to adjust to being responsible for myself away from my parents. However, I believe that even then I would have been insulted at the simplistic language and imagery.Ironies abound, though. This book was handed out to our staff, I suppose, help us prepare for imminent changes in our daily processes. The new procedures had been a year in the making at that point...only technological bugs were left to resolve. Another year went by, with the implementation seemingly no closer. In light of drastically changed economics, including 20% staff reductions, a higher level of management decided the new process was technology for technology's sake and not cost-effective enough to pursue any further. I don't know if those in charge of the project were given a copy of the book when they were told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me","review":"This is considered a No. 1 business best seller?

Don't waste your time, or your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese souffle--a lot of hot air, little to say","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. Though the story/ parable is okay to good, it is made tedious and tiresome by its redundancy. It could have been told more powerfully and effectively in a third of the pages. The formatting/ layout for this book was also done poorly. If I were you I would \\"Sniff\\" out something else and \\"Scurry\\" to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY AUDIO","review":"This is a MUST for middle managers reading list.This is a quick read and is easy to get through. That is reason enought to buy a self help book these days. It will not change over time so feel good about buying a used copy.Do not let the cheesy title sway you- this is a story with a great message to all middle managers- change with the flow of business or starve. Don't worry- the writer delivers his message with alot more than tact we have.

The book is in excellent condition, received in appropiate time and the transaction went smooth. I love it! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with Change","review":"I enjoyed reading the book and being able to apply the four characters to my life. Sniff and Scurry are able to adapt to change while Hem and Haw have a more difficult time. In fact, it is not clear as to whether Hem ever does adapt to change.The old saying that the only thing for sure is that nothing stays the same, is so true but most of us including myself have a tendency to never expect change even though it is inevitable.We need to \\"sniff\\" our surroundings in order to anticipate the change and thus not be taken totally by surprise when possible.I enjoy self-discovery books, but sometimes they are very \\"deep\\" and difficult to complete. This book is light and yet can impact life changing attitudes and can be picked up at any time if a \\"refresher\\" on acceptance of change is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ways to Make Change Work for You, Not Against!","review":"As an author and seminar trainer for the last 20 years on life strategies, I know that nothing creates change in people as much as a story, especially one entwined with self-help concepts. Spencer Johnson's simple book is filled with important advice that not only can be used in the workplace, but in everyone's personal life as well. \\"Who Stole My Cheese,\\" shows you how to think differently and to accept change and problems as inevitable... that all your obstacles are gifts for new growth and beginnings. This book is necessary and important for everyone in our ever-changing world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual cheesey stuff","review":"This is a typical meaningless self improvement book. We were forced to read it at a previous company. Basically if you think you are so bad you really need help from this book I would give up now and head for the nearest cliff. I much prefer the parody \\"Who cut my cheese\\" by Stilton Jarlsberg - a much more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and simplistic","review":"A big disappointment! The author tried to use a metaphor to explain how to deal with change in life but I didn't see any explanations in this book, just a shallow story. The message he tried to convey could have been written like this : 'Accept change or else', no need to read the book to understand that. I don't understand all the hype around this book, I certainly don't recommand it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0 stars","review":"Here is a summary of all the useful information contained in this book:ADAPT!Is there anyone in the world who doesn't know this? Are we so dumb and shallow that we can only digest it in (bad) fairy tale form? Was it really necessary to add such gems of insight as: \\"Imagining myself enjoying new cheese even before I find it, leads me to it\\"? No, no and no. Avoid this rancid cheese at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for managers","review":"This is a book written for company managers to make them feel good about themselves when they are making unthought-out changes that drastically affect employees. Now they can say \\"Here, read this book. It will help.\\" The book says that if you have low intellegence, no loyalty, don't think, and have no ethics, you will be happy and aimlessly move from job to job. If you have any of these qualities, you will be miserable. The only way I can see this book being so successful, is that managers buy them by the hundreds. It is not worth the paper it was written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This book is about accepting change but not how to embrace it. It is a very easy book to read because it is a story format. This book did not help me deal with change in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Don't buy this book. There are no great insights to be gained. The only point in the book is that things change, accept this fact and be positive. The parable is a gimmick.There is one amusing aspect of the book where the author attempts to diffuse criticism by presenting a discussion in which one character says he already understands the theme of the book and found the book unnecessary. The other characters in the discussion then laugh at the naysayer as being unable to accept change.I'll buy the naysayer a beer anytime. The mocking characters are all so naive and sheltered as to be insufferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Entertaining","review":"Yes, this book is somewhat over simplified, but as an instructor at a technical college, I constantly encounter people who are so afraid of change that they won't leave school or their minimum wage job to move on to better \\"cheese.\\" I have found that those most resistant to change are those who are in the middle of change and can't cope with it. Take a lesson from Haw and learn to laugh at yourself, you'll find you cope much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Afterword","review":"Because this book is being used by \\"... many corporations, governmental agencies, the military, small businesses, hospitals, churches and schools...\\", I wish that Dr. Johnson had put in an afterword for managers in his little fable. You see, some employees have been so abused in some previous situation that they aren't just afraid of change, they're too traumatized to believe that a change could be for the better. I'm disappointed that a medical doctor didn't think to include some symptoms to look for to help differentiate a formerly abused employee from a mere Hem. It would have been even more helpful if he had included sound medical advice on where to seek help for formerly abused employees. As for the story itself, if others find it helpful, good luck to them. I found the style annoyingly condescending, particularly from an author whom I do not consider to have thought things through before he wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simplistic outlook on life.","review":"This is an amazing little book if you read it with an open mind. The book is about change and what happens to those of us who are not willing to change. I think a lot of people who rated this book so low did not see the hidden message. Give the book a chance. It only takes about an hour to read and maybe it might change your perspective on a few issues as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Motivator for Life's Little Changes","review":"I have many things going on in my life: I work full time as a network admin for a large fortune 500 company, I own two businesses on the side and run a worldwide women's organization, I belong to several professional associations, and I have a husband and just found out I was 9 weeks pregnant. Talk about change! After reading this book, which was given to me from a client when I moved from Hawaii to New Mexico, I was smiling from ear to ear. Change is so frequent in my life that the best way for me to deal with it is to learn from Hem, Haw, Sniff and Scurry and motior change and grow with it. I loved this little book. It was so great that I will order several copies for co-workers, executives, and my organization members. I highly recommend this short, but highly effective book. Thank you Dr. Spencer Johnson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very superfacial book","review":"The only thing creative of this book is its attractive title. There is no substance in its content. The author kept repeating a few obvious points in the book. Not recommneded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Profiund Allegory","review":"This simple tale of \\"mice and men\\" highlights four views on life and how each will bring you to a result. Some are successful and others are not. The allegory speaks to each of us because we are at times all of these characters. Worth a read. Simple quick and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallest book that I've ever read","review":"This is the smallest book that I've ever read. However, it made me to do a lot of inward thinking. I realized that I was starving my long-term goals & objectives. There were several changes that happened in my life after I read this book (I read this book 2 years ago). I enrolled and completed my MBA degree, I switched jobs, I joined Toastmasters, I became more disciplined in preparing myself for my long-term goals/objectives.The authors have conveyed a 'heavy concept' using a 'light & simple story'. This book is easy to understand and can be read in a few hours.This book is a must to read for anyone who thinks that they are contended with their current life/job."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy and Informative Read","review":"I thought that Johnson did a great job turning a clever little parable of mice and \\"little people\\" into a very easy read that also incorporated useful lessons in the real world. You can apply it to all walks of life, and people of all ages and places in their lives should be able to related to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..","review":"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a great leadership class I attended. I must admit I was very disappointed.I get the point, I understand people resist change, but while the message is good - I found the alliteration lacking and boring.I really don't understand all the buzz surrounding this book/series, unless it just stems from a bunch of paradigm loving management that either didn't read the book, or didn't want to be seen as not having understood it, so they pile on the bandwagon so it looks like they're in the know. (a la Dilbert's Pointy-Haired Boss).Sorry, but it's over priced and lacking in useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here is what this book should be named","review":"The book is ok as long as you understand that it's used by management to get people to quickly swallow what is feed to them. In fact this book is great under two conditions. First: If your your own boss responsible for your companys direction, then it is great to think this way as you react to market conditions. Second: If you are an employee and your willing to quickly fall into step and eat whatever your boss wants to feed you. From the employees point of view it should have been titled. READ THIS BECAUSE I MOVED YOUR CHEESE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imperative life lesson for those open to it","review":"I think the negative reviews come from people who are sitting in an empty room waiting for their cheese to come back. Because people who make themselves open to change move with their cheese and find the positive in doing so.It's a great book, and the concepts have helped me deal with change in all aspects of life. Not just work related change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give out this book and think you have communicated","review":"Having thought about what happened when this book was given out to my workgroup...This book should not be given to a group. It will have unpredictable results, which you can see by sampling the reviews.Some employees will like the cuteness of the presentation; some will be deeply insulted by the tone and presentation.Those who actually read it will have one of two reactions......one group will see it as positive advice to stop ignoring change. (Of course, they may decide to change jobs, perhaps not be the desired result.)...another group will focus on the negative passage near the end which says that if they don't change they will be fired. (Again, perhaps not the intended message.)If you as a manager have a message to give to a preson or a group, give it clearly and directly.Don't give out this book and think you have communicated or motivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves 0 stars","review":"I have a general rule when it comes to books. Anything sold at FedEX isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Who Moved My Cheese is sold at FedEX. The book is perfect for less-than-intelligent managers who want to justify their latest round of layoffs to their employees by simply saying \\"well, you should get back on your feet\\".This book illustrates the anti-intellectual and shameful practices of corporatism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this tripe","review":"I give this book one star only because Amazon won't let it go to zero stars. It is a simplistic insult to my intelligence, being written at maybe the 5th grade level. The author takes an entire book to explain a premise that can be summed up in one, maybe two, paragraphs. I agree with a prior review in that it is disturbing that so many people consider this such an excellent book on management. I believe its popularity illustrates some of the current problems with our business community. (by the way, a couple of our company's managers who think this book is brilliant also don't think that the Dilbert comic strip is humorous)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load!

This rag is often passed around offices by middle managers who have no idea how to manage in the first place.Insulting to anyone with an I.Q. over 10. Obvious messages. A trite (and flawed) allegory. Useless for actually fixing what is wrong in many offices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Moved Johnson's Cheese?","review":"I just finished reading this title, and must say I am disappointed. I've read other titles by Spencer Johnson, and always have been impressed. When I read this book however, I wondered why the sudden change? Someone has moved MY cheese of the enjoyable writings of this author!There are far better books on adapting to change and taking risks than this title. Save your money -- look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice little book -could damage morale if not used properly","review":"The book introduces the concepts of change in a simple, somewhat easy to digest form. Some can absorb the parable and use the information for personal change while others will be horribly insulted and offended by its potential Orwellian undertones. If your company uses this book as a an instrument for change be very carefull to do your homework as this book is an introduction to change, not an end all authoritative source. If misused or badly implemented, you will sow a silent distrust in employees that can never be repaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy.","review":"I hate change. It is my biggest weakness.When I was recommended to read \`Who Moved My Cheese,' I was looking for a thick, hard cover book with gold wordings and a dark background in the self-improvement section. But it turned out to be the exact opposite. With a book so thin and words written in font size 16 (I think), I wondered if I could get anything out of it. And I'm still wondering if I did.A childlike story that gets its point across, it's easy for the reader to grasps the importance of embracing change. I think Dr. Johnson was going for a simple story with a huge impact. The discussion part at the end of the book helps the reader understand better by applying real scenarios we go through everyday in our personal and work life.When I was done with the final page, I agreed with Dr. Johnson wholeheartedly. I understood the story and the dangers of resisting change. But so what? We all know that. It just wasn't inspiring and motivating enough for a stubborn mule like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more cheese please!","review":"I was forced to read this book for a company I worked for that was thoroughly embracing the whole concept.

After I read it, I think the story is interesting, easy to understand and meaningful. First, there are not so many difficult words in it and there are a few pages that have been printed on some special sentences, these sentences can attract me to read the story continuously, I like these sentences very much. Second, I think this story is meaningful because it can tell us the right attitude of doing things. If we get fiasco or some terrible things are happened on us, we should not wait someone to help us or blame it, we should go ahead to find out the solution. I think this can encourage people to brace up again and have a meaningful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic beyond belief","review":"The ideas in this book could have been expressed in a paragraph and even then they would not have been worth the time to read them.

How does stuff like this even get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese (money) robber...","review":"The moral of this book reiterates what is already commonsense for most people, which is life sometimes changes unexpectedly. Obviously some people deal with change better than others, but the sheer overly simplistic tone of this book made it agonizing to read at points (especially the end). If this book is floating around your office, be weary. In my eyes it's simply corporate propaganda conjured up and deployed to train employees on how to best deal with erratic and continuously changing work environments. In other words, regardless if we (your company) move your cheese: live with it, love it, and move on.Save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This book can be interesting in realizing how some people react to changing situations, but it doesn't provide much insight to those who love change and think it's good to begin with.

I've gone back to read previous chapters that I could barely stand the first time, and still I don't see it. What I read instead if ridiculous nonsense written as if we were all children about why we should be happy that corporations are upending the workplace. That, actually, is an entirely separate issue that can't be dealt with here because the presentation is so stupid that it interferes with what otherwise is an important topic: recognizing and accepting change. In a healthy way. Not as if we were a bunch of mice too dumb to do anything but run down the passage to an unknown fate. There has to be better stuff out there.

My two complainst are: 1) the book is too simplistic and 2)the message could be delivered in a few pages, not in an expensive hardcover with a gigantic font.On the first complaint, the examples may be applicable to black/white situations. Unfortunately, none of my problems qualify in this category (hence why they are issues at all). The book offers some common sense, but little in real life applications.On the second complaint, this book should be a case study in business/marketing 101. The authors & publisher must be making a killing, as it is an overpriced book with a font ridiculously large (how do they get away with this?).

After 3 rows of library shelves full of \\"self-help\\" books, books like this should be short. The company for which I work as a contractor, handed it out as an incentive or encouragement to its employees who are very concerned about the mass layoffs and salary reductions experienced over the last couple of years. So, forgive me, for being turned off by a corporate employer's perception of altruism. Other than that it, is a simple idea, one that everyone should understand and definitely experience. And, it would be nice if it was that simple. Kudo's to the authors and those that believe they are \\"above the principles\\" of this little gem.

The ideas it contains could be covered thoroughly in 5 or 6 pages. The concept is the same one we've seen repeatedly in the past; inform people about a serious, real-world topic through fun and games and they'll learn without even realizing it. The result is a book that is 95% fluff and 5% \\"something-you-can-use\\".That is not to say that there is no audience for this book. If you find that the typical self-help book covering similar subjects is simply too dry to palatte, this book could be beneficial.

With a decline in real wages, a shift in tax burdens, and a federal government *our government* less and less inclined to regulate an increasingly monopolistic private sector, this book stands as insulting bulwark against what should be a popular outcry against increasing economic injustice.Remember, it's o.k. to ask who moved your cheese sometimes, corporate leaders do it all the time when they fuss about government interference through regulation and taxation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently there is a need","review":"This is another study from The University of the Bloody Obvious.

Yes, this book may be a simple story, simply-worded, but is EFFECTIVE in its message.

That, in turn, helps you to face the change and deal with it in a more acceptable fashion. It is a short book and can/should be read in a single sitting. It is not like those business books where the author is full of himself and thinks only he can see the truth. This book is talking about universals - how we react to changes and how we can deal with not being in control of those changes (you know management never asks the folks in the trenches what they think of the changes they've come up with)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too cheesy!","review":"Hyperbolic title and self review. Laughably simplistic (although some will undoubtedly say the simplictiy is what makes it good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Moved My Cheese?","review":"Fabulous. We bought copies for our entire department. It is an excellent tool to start discussions on managing change!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're Making it too Difficult!!!","review":"First I'll say that this is NOT a unique concept but still a quick and easy way to relay a good point which is to not be content and keep looking for ways to improve your life. When confronting a difficult situation in your life, always ask \\"What would you do if you weren't afraid?\\"Second, I'm sorry so many of you are ANGRY at the existence of the book/story. So what if the HR dept makes you read it? It takes 30 minutes out of your life.Third, you either get it or you don't. If you have the capacity of mind to ponder then read the book. If you don't have the ability to ponder, don't buy the book...you won't 'get it' and you'll just be angry like the other people who wanted to actually read a book about cheese and mice with no moral behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your boss gives you this book, watch out!!","review":"\\"I like to give this book out to all my employees before I lay them off. It helps the realize the importance of not resisting change and diverts their energies to infighting among theselves. It also makes me feel less guilty. Whenever I meet someone I poleaxed recently, I think to myself, 'Sure I fired you. But at least you got a parting gift.' This book is like businessmen's Turtle Wax. I heartily recommend that every ruthless corporate raider buy it in bulk before going on a hatchet spree.\\" - from Mason Brown's parody, \\"Who Cut the Cheese\\" available through Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"Dehumanizing, insulting drivel forced upon underlings to justify treating them like pawns rather than human beings. The main characters are forced to react to changes that \\"just happen\\", the lesson being that change happens, and if people (or mice - or, by extension, employees, or the environment, or the economy) get hurt, well, it is nobody's responsibility - certainly not that of the company. The goal is clearly to teach the employee not to question authority, but to accept whatever the company does, and not ask for reasons.The hero of the story reluctantly goes off and leaves his best friend to starve when the cheese disappears. The lesson being, of course, that it is his friend's own fault for not adapting to Change, and he therefore deserves to be abandoned to his fate.The most awful book I have ever been forced to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who priced this book?","review":"Retail for this nursery rhyme is around $.... Give me strength. It's a nice motivational piece that you can read in an hour, but my advice is to let somebody else pay for it as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least not with real money ...","review":"Change for the sake of change ... get used to it? Hmmmm .... sounds more like the free advise I've received from a couple of my X's. Not sure I'd want to pay for that sort of rhetoric again ... at least not with real money.On the other hand, there is a positive message in this pseudo self-help cliche sort of cutzie book, and that is that one can CHOOSE to allow fear to immobilize one's life to a point of seemingly no return.I seriously doubt if this book changed the lives of the fear-slave masses, but if it helped even a single person ... good. Then again I'm somewhat of an eternal optimist, wrapped in a realist, inside a skeptic. ;)MFJLabs"},{"rating":"1","title":"suprise, suprise....","review":"I just ordered this book and I was more then suprised when has arived. The book ofered 96 pages of reading with blocks of letteres big enough to read it from any of Ljubljana scyscrapers. As normal, this one couldn't less more then 40 pages. So I try to put my disappointment away by reading this pile of paper. And it was the same. It statrts very promising, but soon this promise diminished in quite demeaning manner. Maybe this book is just good enough for HS kid. I was expecting book dealing with many ways of changing, specialy with it's practical look. But this was kind of a new-age mambo jambo, which is solving problems in black&white manner. It's a good start but don't expect to much. Try to find new cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cheese sure stinks!","review":"Wildly popular brainwashing tool for use by managers; intended to prevent discontent among the serfs when corporate purges are launched. The book is presented in the form of a cute kiddie story in order to make the displaced servants subconsciously feel that any negative reaction they may have to the changes is petty and childish.If your manager starts passing this book out at meetings, be sure your resume is updated.I normally am opposed to book burning, but in the case of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" I will make an exception. I wish I lived in a world where poison garbage like this was never even thought of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-wonderment","review":"Sometimes you can say a world of difference in a few words. Hats off to Spenser for doing that.If you are grappling with change or decision making in your life, this IS the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful","review":"A surprisingly strong book with an interesting viewpoint. Simplistic at times but quite thoughtful overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of the Future","review":"Who Moved My Cheese is a very influential book that will open your eyes to your personal, as well as business, mistakes. It is short but powerful and very thought provoking. In todays world approach means everything. Sometimes we become complacent which spells death in a rapidly changing world. Spencer Johnson creates a memorable and lasting image to remind us of how to not only deal with change but how to see change comming and move with it. By the end of the book you will know which character represents you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, but it has a message","review":"This is a very small and not overly challenging book with a simplistic message. Underneath the fable of the mice and the men, Johnson is dealing with change: how change can come with little warning, how different people react differently to change, how people prefer to be snug and safe and therefore fear change. The cheese here is an allegory for whatever you may value, be it money, relationships, even just cheese! What happens when your cheese suddenly vanishes and you cannot seem to get it? Do you sit and wait in the hope it will return? Do you try to find out what happened and thereby get hold of some more cheese? The book has a message so do not get put off by the fable format. What seems to be obvious and common sense is not always so in real life and sometimes a silly fable helps like a poke in the ribs. Worth a read but I find the bestseller rankings hard to believe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, thought provoking, could even change your life!","review":"This book will take about an hour of your time. If, however, you take the tasty little tale and apply the principles, it may be one of the best hours you've ever spent. A lot of what is written here will be familiar. What makes it a best-seller is that it has been refashioned into easily remembered concepts through the engaging story of men, mice, and the pursuit of the ever elusive cheese...it's a parable about the importance of change and the need to remain open to new possibilities. Good stuff, simple packaging, accessible and applicable to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing book","review":"It is one of the best books I have ever read. Should be read by everyone. It's like placing a mirror in front of you and daring to look. Sometimes the image isn't that flatering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and spent less than a half hour reading it, but even so I feel I'm on short end of the deal for having spent time on Spencer Johnson's book.The parable at the heart of the book is nonsensical and inconsistent. The characters don't actually portray the qualities ascribed to them, and the conclusions they drawn are both forced and of questionable validity whether applied to a broad or narrow context. Unfortunately the \\"discussion\\" that precedes and follows the parable, which attempts to help link the message to the reader's life, is even worse. The collective result is a painful read that ultimately insults the reader's intelligence. Do not waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Claptrap","review":"I was handed this to read by my manager at a large company that was recently devoured --- er, merged --- by a gigantic corporate empire. I read the first half, then disgustedly scanned the rest, making a mental note to update my resume that night. The message I got: Be a nice little lemming and jump off the cliff with the rest of the wonderful little rodents who follow our leaders blindly until they take mercy on you and let you drown. Thank goodness I didn't have to buy it, but I want those 20 minutes of my life back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About Cheesey . . .","review":"This book obviously began as a newsletter article. A cute story about 4 mice that could be told in three minutes is spread out over 50 pages (with really, really large type to stretch it that far!) bracketed by a spurious story of a high school reunion.Not only do I want my money back, I want compensation for the time I wasted reading the book. The writing is on an eighth grade level, the analogy is simplistic, and the conversation of the friends at the beginning and end of the book (using the term loosely) is stilted at best.I gave it one star becuase there is no way to give it one-half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I listened to the book on CD. The first part of the CD is 15 minutes of hype telling how great the story is going to be. Then when the narration of the story finally begins, I found it to be simplistic to the point of being trite. It is both written and read with a tone that treats the listener like a first-grader. Unfortunately, I learned nothing. Still, for people having problems with change, it may be worthwhile."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-3d400c0e"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/49.md","filePath":"guide/49.md"}'),j={name:"guide/49.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
