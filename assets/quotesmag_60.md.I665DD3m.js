A week ago it started having issues and now the heating elements are no longer working. The oven size is great, but there have always been a few issues with the unit that you just try to look past. The oven rack was always difficult to pull out. I would actually have to hold down the toaster oven in order to pull the rack out to adjust height. Over time the dials seem to be get more difficult to turn and set the correct temperatures. Also, I would never purchase a toaster oven with a bell signal again. After a couple of months you get really annoyed hearing it every time someone decides to have toast. I think this time I'll try a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fairly well, knobs ARE hard to read, broke once","review":"It's pretty, it does most things you want a toaster oven to do.Gripes:1) Knobs are hard to read.2) Mine broke after a couple of years. Thermal fuse inside burned out. Repaired it myself for $5...but this would be game-over for most people.3) Teflon on cooking tray started bubbling/peeling off.4) To call this 'stainless steel' is sort of like cars with 'leather seating surfaces'....the top is SS, the handle and lower front is SS. The sides are silver plastic and the tray and rear are aluminum.The good parts:It tends to work well and you can see what is going on with the light and big glass door.It looks fairly cool and upscale.It's easy to clean.Would I buy another one? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"First off, this is the slowest toaster I have ever used. The \\"ding\\" bell is super annoying at the end of the endless cooking cycle and to top everything off, the thing just stopped working about 1 year and 1 month into my ownership. I would never buy this piece of junk again. (Looks nice though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with DeLonghi","review":"Poor design and workmanship here which is too bad as this manufacturer used to make solid product. Lasted for a bit of time and then the elements went completely. Repairs are unfortunately cost ineffective.Oven / Toast heated unevenly so that you had to spin items around or the rear would be dark and the front underdone.Shiny silver knobs are completely un-readable.Mechanical timer is poorly constructed with a horrendously loud bell.Guess I will buy the cheapest and toss it so it won't hurt so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DeLonghi Experience","review":"We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the lsat time I buy a toaster based on appearance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one!!!!!!","review":"Door advance feature broke after several weeks. Lower heating element broke after six months. Customer service refused to stand behind the product, stating that the warranty was expired. Note to buyer- warranty is one year from time of manufacture- NOT the date you actually receive it as a gift or purchase it. The knobs on the unit are like a child's toy- cheap and plastic. This is a highly disappointing product- I doubt we will buy another Delonghi product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just died.","review":"First, the oven didn't match the picture on the box. The picture was much cooler looking. (I didn't get it from Amazon.) Then, I noticed my second batch of waffles, bagels, or whatever would burn. The setting needs to be adjusted according to how warm it is from use. Finally, it just died for no apparent reason after 6 months of use. I did like the fact that I could fit a small pizza pan inside this oven and I used it a lot until it went to appliance heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for us","review":"I've had this oven for 1 month and I am still very happy with it. The only thing that I wish was different is the timer. It is fairly short and you can't use the oven without setting it up, so when you want to keep something warm, you'd better be around to reset the timer every 10 min!! I bought it online brand new for $25 so I am very happy, but I am not sure I would pay $80 for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design and function","review":"This is really a dreadful product. The three knobs are almost impossible to read, which wouldn't matter if they weren't so unintuitive in their positioning (for example, \\"off\\" is the middle position on one of them), and they need constant fiddling when going from toast to broil to bake. Toasting takes for ever (because the oven is far too high/deep and the elements are miserably inadequate. It has an irritating ticking noise like a bomb about to go off to remind you that you are toasting bread. The broil function is truly pathetic - I left it to heat up for ten minutes and then put it a steak, and the thing just sat there getting warm until I just took it out and fried it. This is infuriating because it's so much worse than the $25 thing I bought at Walgreens a few years ago - they're just coasting on their fancy Italian name and someone needs to call them on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high price tag","review":"I returned this item. Only toasted one side of the bread. Stainless Steel - only the top, sides are plastic. When I read that the knobs were hard to read, I took these comments with a \\"grain of salt\\". Those consumers were not kidding...and I don't wear or need reading glasses! Can't imagine anyone would actually pay over $200 for this item (suggested retail). I guess this consumer is really trying to keep up with the \\"Jones's\\". It's really the name you would be paying for - surely not a quality item from DeLonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product!","review":"Bought this in February of 2007. It Stopped working in March of 2008.Cost is too high for such a poor product. I wouldn't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This thing quit working after about 8 months. It was still under warantee, so I mailed it off (at my expense) to be repaired and it came back working. Now, after just shy of 2 years from the time I purchased it, it quit working AGAIN. I won't be buying this brand ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like everyone else...","review":"We decided to pay a little extra for this toaster becaues it almost perfectly matched the rest of our appliances. And we figured that at this price it would stand the test of time. It did. For exactly 23 months. Today it died. I don't expect things to last forever, but replacing a toaster after two years is just stupid. I mean, it's a wire, heating elements, and a timer. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"We bought this because it looked solid and, even with the plastic, it was pleasant to look at.However, we were sorely disappointed. The toaster timer sounds like a time bomb, and is especially annoying early in the morning. The door did not open easily due to a poorly-designed shelf-sliding mechanism. The toasting took at least 50% longer than with other toaster ovens. However, saving the worst for last, the entire appliance died after nine months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this product","review":"This is the third delonghi toaster oven I have owned and by far the worst. The first two were great and just wore out after years of use. Given this track record we went for a third and right away saw some problems. It takes longer to toast then the earlier versions and after only 8 months of use it stopped heating up at all. Think twice before buying one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Unpacked the toaster. Plugged it in. Didn't work. Had to repack and lug it to the post office for return. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality....poor repair options","review":"Not only is this product over-priced, poorly designed and highly inefficient, but its components are very poor quality. The most recent problem is that the toaster timer mechanism broke...after no more than 3 months of use. When we called DeLonghi, they directed us to a \\"repair center\\" about 20 miles away. Very frustrating. Unfortuntately, I can't recommend any other product, but I'd avoid paying a premium for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the kitchen","review":"I bought this toaster oven at the end of June and I really like it. It makes much better toast than a conventional toaster, so bread comes out perfectly crisp. We've used it to reheat frozen pizza (yes, it does fit a 12-inch), roast corn and peppers, bake fish, melt cheese, slow bake, broil and more. The pull-out tray at the bottom is very easy to clean (no more crumbs collecting like our old toaster). I agree that the dials are slightly hard to read, but it's really no big deal. Overall it's a great product, well designed and worth the price. Plus, as I write it's almost 100 degrees outside -- and the toaster oven does not heat up the kitchen at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Reasons NOT to buy this product","review":"5 good reasons not to buy this over.1. The knobs fall off. All three fell off within the first 6 months of buying and wouldn't stay on, even with glue.2. It takes forever to toast.3. To go from \\"bake\\" to \\"toast\\" mode, you have to adjust two different knobs, and one is easy to forget causing only one side of the bread to toast.... probably why there is another reviewer saying it only toasts on one side.4. The silver on the sides is not Stainless Steel, it is PAINT on plastic, and it bubbles and peels off after some time, about 1 year.5. Finally, after exactly 2 years, the oven just stopped working... totally.If you want an oven that stays together and works and that lasts more than 2 years, do not buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great oven, even fits a pizza :)","review":"We bought this and love it. You can fit a 12 in pizza in it and so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working after a Year","review":"Seems like other people have had the same experience...for no reason the whole thing died shortly after a year. For the price, this is unacceptable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased June 2005, RIP Sept 2007","review":"I must start by saying that our prior Black & Decker toaster ovens lasted more than 5 years, and were still working well when we bought new ones. By the time we got rid of them, they were very unattractive, but we would clean them up and donate them to charity. One of our Black & Deckers might have actually died on us, but we never felt we got a bad deal.We paid about 100$ for the Delonghi, and for that price I do not feel we received good value at 27 months of service. Our expectations are more along the lines of 60 months of service, for less than 100$. As with another recent review, our unit just stopped working spontaneously.The Delonghi is stylish, which does not really matter much to me. It has an excellent removable tray which cleans easily. While it worked, it worked well. If it had lasted even 48 months, I would have been basically satisfied. 60 months and I would have been completely satisfied. 27 months is inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"It takes extremely long to toast things. It is also unnecessarily large.

It does not condition my hair like I thought it would from reading the reviews.

I am so disappointed in the purchase, price and end result of the product that I could shoot myself for such a waste....Don't count on it working for you. :(while the conditioner is thick, it does not offer a silky feeling to your hair. I found my hair hard to untangle and I spent a great deal of time delicately untangling my fine long hair to prevent further damage.I have gotten better results from generic conditioners like Suave than I could ever get from this product.What an incredible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out my hair","review":"Product dried out my hair. I was disappointed since this is organic. I expected it to be better. But, Pantene works better than this and does not dry my hair out. Smell was ok.

It did make my hair look thicker, but dried out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really moisturize","review":"I expect a conditioner to prevent my hair from drying out. This is the first time I've used an organic conditioner. Although the texture is thick like a cream almost, it seems to disappear and have almost no affect when I apply and rinse it off. I then try to compensate by applying more and more, but the texture of my hair is almost the same as if I didn't even use conditioner. I'm trying to be more self conscious about the cosmetic/hygiene products I use but this particular line has been a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not condition problem hair","review":"I have very curly dry hair and needed a conditioner that makes my hair smooth and soft.

As one reviewer said, it feels like nothing and even applying more doesn't help. I was very disappointed in this product. I used it in conjunction with the Avalon Lavender Shampoo. The shampoo is very harsh and seems to strip all natural oils from the hair and scalp. Others are commenting on the great smell - I didn't detect much of a lavender scent. It smells sort of like dog cleansing products."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 months after.. Good improvement!","review":"So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opposite Effect for me","review":"I was very excited about trying the shampoo and conditioner for my thinning hair issue. My hair has been coming out a bit before this but I was completely surprised when using it the first time, SO MUCH of my hair came out in the shower & when I was coming it out afterward that I started crying!!! I skipped washing my hair for one day and then used it again just to see if I was imaginging it. Well I wasn't because it happened again. I went to Ulta and purchased some Nioxin which I've used before and washed my hair with it this morning. Only a little bit of my hair came out...and by little bit, I mean more than the average person but WAY less than when I used the Biotin B-Complex. Im glad it works for some people and hope it works for you.

My hair hasn't retreated any further, but is that due to this product? Probably not. My review is based on the actual product not its claims.I use this conditioner combined with their Biotin B complex Shampoo. I can confirm that my hair feels matty after use, thicker might be an illusion. I like the way that my hair feels after 1-2 days of use. It combs well and I literally spend 1-2 minutes messing with it to get a good look.I highly recommend cycling between the two above and something like Coconut milk Shampoo/conditioner to maintain a balance between Thick/Matted and soft/flexible. I would NOT use this shampoo daily for more than 3 days consecutively, but then again everyones hair is different.

The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4\\" away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I'm unsure if that's due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"super watered down","review":"This conditioner not only seems watered down but it really doesnt do much for my hair either. I have to use a trememdously large amount in order to get any type of actual conditioning feeling in my hair with this...literally 1/4-1/3 of a cup worth. This wouldnt be SO bad if i didnt have super fine and thin hair to begin with and its short so there should be no reason i should have to use this much conditioner. I have used many different organic types of shampoo/conditioner and never have had to use this much. I was really excited to get this conditioner but honestly it is not at all worth the money paid for it.

The Earthsea novels are first rate fantasy, on a par with Tolkien and Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy. The present book is not as good. While the quality of writing is solid, it doesn't approach Le Guin's best work. This book is still attractive by providing interesting information about Earthsea and the stories are entertaining. Le Guin is publishing another Earthsea novel this year and the last story in this book is an apparent bridge to the forthcoming novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting collection","review":"The stories in this collection should be read in the order they appear. In particular, the last story refers back to the first. The stories are of varying length. \\"The Finder\\" is a 106 page novelette. \\"Darkrose and Diamond\\" is 35 pages. \\"The Bones of the Earth\\" is 20 pages. \\"On the High Marsh\\" is 33 pages. The last story, \\"Dragonfly\\" is 69 pages long. The author ends the collection with a 30 page description of Earthsea. The stories are about wizards and witches, good and evil, and involve shape changing, healing magic, finding, fire starting, binding spells, weather magic, etc. Like most collections, everyone will have their favorites, liking some stories better than others. I disagree with the author's statement that you should read her other novels first (the author, of course, is interested in selling copies). This collection stands well on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't help feeling Le Guin dislikes the original trillogy","review":"I could not bring myself to give this book less than 2 stars because Le Guin's writing is as captivating as always. I got absorbed into every story, although I found them to end abruptly - point made; the end. The overall tone of the book seems to be the unmaking, or \\"unmasking\\" of the Earthsea of the trilogy. It seems that Roke was founded by women who were supplanted by fanatical, misogynistic men. Ogion, Ged's master's role in stopping the earthquake is greatly over stated. Credit really belongs to a woman teaching magic forbidden by the men on Roke.The Master Summoner, saved by Ged in The Farthest Shore, takes up the Pelnish Lore - used by the enemy in The Farthest Shore for the purpose of keeping women out of the School of Roke. There is clearly room to improve the role of women in the world of the Earthsea Trilogy, but that is no reason to destroy that world."},{"rating":"2","title":"back in fine form - thank you, Ursula","review":"Like many others, I was disenchanted (sorry) by Tehanu, book 4. However, I'm very pleased by Tales. It's not the resounding, stunning masterpiece that was circumscribed by the first three books, but I am gratified to see that she still can evoke the gentle wonders and richness of the grounded and mysterious world she built in the original trilogy.There's definitely a hint of feminist polemicism in these tales, and it does jar me a bit. I'm fully sympathetic with her goals but it's a delicate art to include in the body of a short story, and sometimes she fails. I won't begrudge her that, though, because it's never heavy-handed, and the luminous joys of Earthsea and LeGuin's transluscent prose are spread equally thru the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Earthsea Cycle","review":"Le Quin is back better than ever with another insight into this wondeful world.

This CD is only seven bucks though, and the softened up version of \\"Pissing in a River\\" is quite awesome and anything the Swarf Sisters do is incredible, so if you love the swarf sisters or a Smith hardcore, get this CD; you can always laugh at the chick doing some stupid faux... kitten act on \\"Because the Night\\" in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Not a complete translation","review":"Indeed, the title of this book is very deceiving, and the previous review didn't comment the fact that this book isn't the complete Man'yoshu, but a selection. Of course, you may say the title numbers the poems, and if you are an expert on the subject, you know that the Man'yoshu has over 4.000, but not everybody has the information, and the subtitle (The Complete Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai Translation) will very quickly lead you to error.That being said, this edition has its virtues. It is a polished and careful translation, with introduction, maps, biographies and nice indexes.

Since I'm not really into drum'n'bass (with the exception of some rather old Aquasky stuff), it was kind of a risk to buy it. Anyhow, I'm really glad I did so. It contains a magical blend of Indian and electronic music, Singh balances on the thin border between earth and space. The sound of the asian instruments is incredible, since Talvin Singh is a professional tabla-player, the technical quality is far beyond average.I like it. A lot. The most bizarre thing is that I keep on doing so, no matter how much I listen to it.Without any doubt a marvellous creation... and you shouldn't doubt a second about buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite dance music but the music flows","review":"I at first thought his latest album was going to be more dance music but I was quite surprised after listening to track samples. Compared to Singh's previous CD Anokha, OK is less dance or techno but the music is fluid and soothing. I liked the tracks I listened to and I think Talvin Singh does a good job of combining classical Indian music w/ Western beats and sounds. What you have to remember is that Anokha is compilation of works done by DJs and mixmasters and OK is totally Singh's work. Sure the music from his new CD may not be Bhangra, but the music still has the beats and rhythm that makes you drawn to the music. So what if it's not Bhangra, there's too much of that lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good CD - 4 and 1/2 stars.","review":"I admit it, I was'nt expecting much, but I got much more than I expected when I listened to \\"OK\\".

It's more mellow than what you might expect from his track \\"jaan\\" which was revelatory for it's melding of east asian music and london drum and bass, with an intelligent edge from a tabla virtuoso, but equally as impressive.

Singh has surpassed his objective of merging classical Indian tabla with modern trip-hop and jungle. Some of the other reviewers have stated that \\"OK\\" fuses two types of music but losing the \\"meaning\\" of classical Indian music. Personally, I think that is a bunch of crap. Granted, music must have some significance, but I believe its main objective is entertainment. This CD is one of the most entertaining that I have ever heard. And, being an Indian myself, I find it very refreshing that there is someone who has the balls to divert from the currently popular style of music.

I like drum and bass. I love tabla. But then, I like mustard and I like mayonnaise, but not on the same sandwich.

This is different from most of related music, cause this guy pulls it off. Inclusion of asian sounds gives it a fresh air, and the power thrown into this cd just makes it so right! Songs as \\"Butterfly\\" or \\"Light\\" mean a reason for having this cd, surely!

Gail Bernstein gives us a compellingly human portrait of a rural family, especially of Haruko, the wife. The book is based on Bernstein's field research in 1974-1975, with an epilogue that is written after her return visit in 1982, and again in 1995. The reader gains an intimate understanding of rural life through the story of this hardworking, observant, and lively woman. Along the way, we also see how ethnographer and hosts come to understand each other. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb.

I love the choice of tracks--some beautiful newer pieces in addition to crisp, lovely interpretations of several favorites (Asturias, La Vida Breve, Concierto de Aranjuez--you know, the ones everyone plays). He also fit in three Charlie Byrd blues tracks that, though not my favorites, work surprisingly well. William's playing is so clean and expressive--melodies ring out clearly, never belabored. Very pleasureful listening. Guess I'll be wearing this one out too...Update: A few years later, I'm still loving the classical tracks but I've got to admit some of those \\"alternative\\" (non-classical) tracks aren't holding up to repeat listening.

Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have tremendous chemistry together, and that is the key to a successful love story. The fantasy aspect of the film doesn't bother me, as long as I can suspend my disbelief. The characters are very well-developed and they feel real. The slow pace helps us get to know the characters and allow us to piece the clues together. There is a mystery in there, too. While an earlier event might foreshadow what is to come later, by no means does it spoil the enjoyment of the movie and its satisfying denouement. Yes, there are plot holes and logical flaws and sometimes the timelines are difficult to follow as the editing becomes confusing, but none of them are fatal.

So I don't really care about the how and why of the 2 year time warp.I think it could have been a great movie if the acting wasn't so terrible. Good movies get under your skin, they draw you in. You feel the laughter and pain of the persons that are portrayed. Good movies can take your breath away from sheer laughter, and can move you to tears, often by simple gestures and \\"under\\"acting instead of over-acting. I mean I saw Reeves breaking down and crying after his father died and I wasn't moved at all. It was superficial, artificial and 1-dimensional. I would have liked this nice story to be played well.

It has all the peppy pacing and snappy ambiance of a funeral dirge. Both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves must have done something to annoy the cameraman, because I have never seen them look so utterly unattractive. The dialogue is stilted and trite, and its delivery is usually in monotones. The closest these two could ever come to generating electricity is by briskly rubbing their stockinged feet over a synthetic rug on a really cold dry day. I was so hoping to like the movie, because I thought the premise was interesting.

Somehow they are able to communicate by letters put in the lake house mailbox, despite the fact that she is living two years in the future from his life. The movie shows scenes of their separate lives, hers as a doctor and his as an architect. Their paths cross in unexpected ways, some planned and some by accident.

Sound familiar? \\"Il Mare\\" was restrained, romantic, tragic, really beautiful, with a bittersweet ending that lingered in the mind long after the movie was over. Despite knowing full well that Hollywood is great at taking brilliant foreign movies and remaking mediocre dumbed down versions of them for American audiences, I still went to see \\"The Lake House.\\" As expected they ruined it. I guess they figured the original Korean ending was not \\"happy enough\\" for US audiences! Whatever.

Without the need to decipher the mystery before the film ended, I was able to enjoy the heartfelt roles of both Kate (Sandra Bullock) and Alex (Keanu Reeves) free from any images of Miss Congeniality or Neo from The Matrix. The mystery surrounding the lake house keeps this story a class above any other drama or romance of late and I do hope we see Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves working together in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love in the Twilight Zone","review":"This movie is a combination of \\"Message in the Bottle\\" and \\"Frequency\\", both very good movies.

However, overall it was a pleasant change from what is usually at the movies. The stars have good chemistry although there isn't enough time to really enjoy it.

The timing doesn't work out at all as far as I can tell. Other than that, though, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of either of the main stars, but they were both pretty good in this movie.Another big disappointment was the Paul McCartney song \\"This Never Happened Before.\\" That must be one of the most lackluster songs I've ever heard, and this is coming from a long-time McCartney fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc doesn't work","review":"I wonder if this is a legitimate DVD because I tried it in two different players and it didn't work no matter what we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful movie; terrible seller","review":"I love this movie!

I will say that they processed the refund quickly, but I think a $3.50 restocking fee on an item of this price is outrageous. Buy the movie--you will love it. Just don't buy it from this seller. I later found the widescreen version from another seller at a lower cost than this inferior version sold for. Trust me, you can do better than buying it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"I usually rent movies before buying them. Did the same with this one. Same feeling as in Speed, great chemistry between them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"going back in time...","review":"Keanu and Bullock, together again... This time it's a romance with a time travel-ish twist: the couple fall in love through correspondence only, and they then realize that they are offset from each other in time by two years. It's the first film in a little while that's made me want to read Jane Austen: Persuasion, in this case. Both characters carry the film well, and they continue to have great chemistry together. The storyline could have fumbled under the weight of its Macguffin, but didn't. Of course, I have a weakness for time-travel type stories, but this film was definitely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEANU AND SANDRA'S TIME TRAVELING ADVENTURE","review":"I had read enough and seen enough about this movie to know what to expect. I admit it could be confusing at times knowing what year I was in, but the movie did a good job of giving you hints to figure it out without having to spell it out across the bottom of the screen (think Sixth Sense). The most obvious was the length of Sandra Bullock's hair. It was longer when she was in the past, and shorter during her current situation.I say keep an open mind and just enjoy this for what it is worth. There are too few \\"feel good\\" movies these days, so I appreciated seeing a movie that wasn't bloody or full of embarassing humor and curse words. I was even enlightened when Sandra asks, \\"What if you lived your whole life and there was no one waiting?\\"So what (or who) are you waiting for? Ignore the critics and see this movie for what it's worth...for what it may be worth to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love knows no time.","review":"After watching the movie Speed, I fell in love with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves movies. So you cant imagine my excitement when I found this movie. This movie completely dug its way into the depths of my heart. The plot was solid and completely pwnsome! (lol). The way the movie played through was completely wonderful. The combined acting talents of both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves delivered this movie in a jewel incrusted platinum platter. The production of this movie was outstanding and the setting they used was completely magical and added more to the romance. The music used in the movie added more imphasis to each scence easily created the mood. Above all else, the way the plot moved along was great. I guess the only thing to do now is read the book and watch the movie again.

I liked the concept of two owners of the same house at different times being able to correspond with each other via the mailbox out in front of the lake house, hence the title of the film. Just that I was frankly a bit put off by how the relationship ended up developing between the two and the lackluster ending.

One does have to suspend their beliefs to some extent in this. The reason for that has to do more with technology. One could look up someone on the net, though even that try isn't always successful. I love the way time moved in this movie and the realizations of people as they realize how they exist in each others time with each other and apart. I love how these two people are there for each other with just a simple letter. They doubt and yet they don't take chances. There are some scenes you can see from a mile away but that doesn't matter. The journey is what matters and this film addresses that splendidly.Relationships of architecture and how it relates to our lives and where live, parents, siblings, loneliness, loved ones are looked at. There are some very funny moments.I am buying this one when it comes out because I love the time aspect as well as the relationship aspects. It was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Film... For people who read","review":"I really loved this story, while my beautiful unromantic wife was bored to death. The plot is slow and methodical, just like some very good books. My only grief with the story was the part that was obvious too soon. Other than that, I felt it was a fulfilling movie well worth the watching. While, we have become used to romance genre films being more or less comedic, this one is not, or tragic, like \\"Somewhere in Time\\", the logical comparison film, \\"Lake House\\" is not that either, it is a melancholy story were the end is happy.This is a story that requires you to both suspend disbelief and think.

I usually really like Sandra Bullock In fact I bought the film because she was in it. But it was big disappointment. The sound was poor, so I put on the subtitles. Though I don't mind fantasy films, this one was a real loser. No ups and downs, just milk-toast plain all the way through.

All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the \\"time-traveling science\\" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable for anyone with a skull-full of mush","review":"Ridiculous, saccharine, marshmallow fluff. Being a resident of Chicago I watched this movie for the exteriors and the interior of my neighborhood bar, The Green Mill. The degree of implausibility makes this one pretty hard to swallow. This director should seriously have his dramatic license revoked. Bullock's forlorn mumbling and Reeves' stilted monologues make this \\"endearing\\" film unendurable. The supporting plots of her mother and his dad do little to buttress this split screen gibberish. I never like to give completely negative reviews so I'll leave you with this. The costumes were very believable and the part of Jack the dog was ably played."},{"rating":"2","title":"...write a song about it and go sing it in San Francisco","review":"I loved the movie.

The sound track is so soothing, I play it all day long, while cooking or just relaxing with a cup of tea.As others have said, don't try to analyze the movie too much.

This movie still confuses me a bit but the writing, acting, and plot is top-notch in every way. The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock is explosive, you truly believe they are in love, too bad they never fell for each other behind the scenes. The premise of the film is Kate (Bullock) lives in the year 2006 and Alex (Reeves) lives in the year 2004 and they develop a deep and powerful relationship but they are living two years apart so how can they be destine to be together, well you just have to see this one to find out.

The side plots were obviously thrown in to add length to the movie and were rather trite. As for Keanu, I don't believe he can act and he should stick to things like The Matrix.However, I gave it 4 stars, because even with the major flaws, I enjoyed it and would watch it again - that being a key rating factor for me. Also, the ending actually came as a surprise to me - I can usually figure those out after the first 5 minutes or so. And the hospital parts of the movie were good.

His last years weren't near as good as the rest of his career, and Dan never won a Super Bowl either, but undeniably during Dan's hot seasons he was the most feared QB ever to play the game. Is Marino the best QB ever to play the game? Maybe not, but when it comes to all-out great passers in the NFL, Marino has to rank high on your list. Beckett's Great Sports Heroes is a good look into Dan's record breaking career. There are some good articles and nice pictures. Nothing really deep into Dan's life here, but Beckett still has produced a good enjoyable read on one of the greatest, those who are fans of Marino like me, and even those who aren't, will find an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mix of footage and storytelling","review":"Overall a good dvd set.

The story of Stephen and his comrades-in-arms in the trenches and tunnels of WWI were intriguing, vivid and well-portrayed. The love story with Isabelle was stilted, not well thought out and frankly boring. The future glimpse of 1978 is even less interesting. Elizabeth's quest for her father's past is brief and dropped as quickly and inexplicably as it is begun. The quest for the past for this part of the story seems to be some sort of faulty segue into her own life which is, of course, in some sort of modern chaos.

The novelty of reading about a war time I have never know much of, the living in trenches and underground tunnels, the love that humans show one for another, even while they hate for reasons beyond themselves or of their own making. 1. Stephen is trapped underground as retreating Germans blow up a tunnel of their own. He works to free himself and tunneler, Jack father to John who dies of diphtheria in England only to be found by Germans. When these men embrace underground in recognition of their common strengths it is also to come up and find the war front has finally moved on and the war over... 2.

Yes, the war scenes were well written, but there was just too much of the same thing. I also do not feel that the novel actually tied all of the characters together well. The ending was so far-fetched. You could tell it was a man writing about female characters. I was reading this book for a book club, but probably would not have had any desire to finish it otherwise. It should not be considered a \\"novel of love and war\\"- it should be considered a novel of war with the occassional female character thrown in. The only person I would recommend this to would be a man who is very interested in reading war scenes, and then I would tell him to skip the first part and the 1978 parts, and just read the war scenes all in one sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, moving story","review":"Having recently read \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", it was with some reluctance that I picked up another book that is primarily about the First World War. What swung it for me were the reviews, which were full of phrases like \\"deeeply moving\\", \\"incredibly visceral\\". However, I am gald that I read the book, and would thoroughly recommend it. Faulks has basically written a novel about the horrors of war. He has tried to mix it up (with varying success) by introducing incidents/characters before and after the war. However, the main guts of the book is the central character's struggle to survive during the slaughter in the mud of Flanders. This is were the book is at its most compelling. Faulks does a superb job in capturing this nightmare. The claustophia of the \\"underground\\" chapters is particularly well done. \\"Enjoy\\" is the not the right word to describe my reaction to this book. \\"Respect\\" is closer to the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"A great book with some truly horrific detail. Enjoyed very much. I look forward to more of his in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abridged but good","review":"I would love to find an unabridged version of Birdsong, but this abridgement is about as good as they get."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of love and war","review":"I had a wonderful escape reading this book that was recommended to me by two dear friends in England (Trina Owens and Jean Ford). I like how the author flashed back to current times when the main characters' granddaughter chose to research her past. It's really a fantastic, heartfelt story. The WWI scenes took me back to a time that I had never really dwelled on...a great historic effort built into this classic novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is utter crap","review":"I bought this based on the New Yorker review. Are they becoming People Magazine? This is overwritten--this guy must be a complete nightmare at dinner parties (I imagine the Fremch character who lectures on in part 1 is a self-portrait). This is strictly for the 'Bridges of Madison County' crowd. The New Yorker compared it to the 'English Patient'? Please. They were both paperbacks, that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was haunted by this book","review":"I really can't think of a book lately that I enjoyed as much as this one. I felt immersed in another world while reading it and dreaded when it would end. I miss the characters. I really feel unable to put into words why and how I found this book so affecting, other than observing that the romance and the horrors of war were depicted equally well. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the horror of the trenches","review":"Birdsong is incredibly powerful because it describes with unforgetable imagery the horror of trench warfare, The insanity of this type of war is so lucid that the book is haunting and unforgetable. Noone can duplicate the terror of battle but this book will have a lasting effect on the reader.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work past the beginning and you will be captivated","review":"I was expecting a love story but instead found myself reading about a soldier's experience of war. The opening chapters focus on Stephen and Isabelle, a pair whose 'everlasting devotion' is terminated when Isabelle has a sudden and inexplicable change of heart. However, if you persevere past this point the rest is captivating. I can't remember the last time I was so caught up in a story, as when Stephen braves the battlefield and the underground. I am not a fan of war stories, but recommend Birdsong as an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect beach read!","review":"I had no objection to the novel, other than that it was hailed as an extraordinary work of art. To be fair, the war scenes were some of the best I'd ever read, but the writer spoiled them with his trite and unconvincing portrayal of the affair between Stephen and Isabelle, and by his seeming inability to create a single solid female character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paperback condition","review":"This book was in very good condition when I received it. It was quickly shipped, too. I would buy from seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"This is one of the few books I have ever abandoned midway through. I managed to slog through 235 pages until Part Three and then ran out of steam.Throughout those pages, I felt no connection to any of the characters, I found much of the dialogue either wooden or unbelievable, and while the writing is certainly competent, I found the whole thing really, really dull.Anyway, I'll put it aside for now and hopefully have the energy to come back to it another time. After reading so many positive reviews, I really feel like I'm missing something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WAR IN TWO FIELDS---LOVE...AND WWI","review":"The first 80 pages of this novel describes a torrid love affair that should hold your interest. The next 320 pages describes action in WW I in France of a British squad or Company. The details are typical war material (without the heavy swearing that is in most war literature)related in an interesting way and much of the action takes place underground while digging tunnels. This is not for the feint of heart as the horrors of war get quite detailed. Mr. Faulks surely knows how to write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a connection","review":"It has been quite a while since I read this book, which I found excellent and rivetting. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is a personal one: I like a book to have just a little more lightness in it, if only for the contrast (sort of the way the technique in painting of chiaroscuro emphasizes both light and darkness). However, that is just a personal thing, as I say, and it really should have...well, there isn't a 4 and 3/4 star category...There is a connection between the steamy sex in the book and the war. Aside from the fact that steamy sex is always a good read, I think the author intended it as metaphor: sex and death. However, this sex was somewhat depressing in its intensity, no doubt intended to parallel a very intense war. But that's why I choose to withhold my imaginary \\"quarter star.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care about the characters","review":"I found this a very hard book to get through. The writer didn't make me care about the story and the characters. The scenes were well described, but I just couldn't picture most of them in my head. Some scenes were obviously better than others, but overall just a two star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do the characters not come to life?","review":"I gave up after 200 pages. Maybe it is the Dutch translation, but I had the strong feeling it is also the writer who is just not able to even bring his hero Stephen to life. I gave up after 200 pages and that does not happen very often........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid, inept, wooden characterisation","review":"If this had been advertised as an airport novel I would not have objected to it so strongly, but I simply feel ripped off. It's hardly a novel, let alone a great work of literature. The characters are half-dimensional and often barely credible, it's badly written, its ovewhelmingly pretentious:one can see the author has a Grand Scheme to write an Epic Sweeping Novel, but he doesn't begin to pull it off. Frankly doesn't rate even one star. I'd rather read a Jeffrey Archer. No, I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdsong","review":"I really enjoyed this book but am between three and four stars on it. Perhaps if I hadn't heard such rave reviews or known that it was Number 13 in the '100 must reads of all time' (BBC The Big Read) I might have had no qualms about giving it four stars, it's just I'm not sure it quite lived up to my expectations which had been built very high! However, it is a lovely read and I will definitely read more Sebastian Faulks books after this. I would recommend Birdsong - it is easy reading and gives a real insight into what it was like living through the war and actually in the trenches, without being too heavy or too graphic. There are a couple of different stories going on and it keeps you interested. Worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr Faulks!","review":"Wow, what else is there to say after all the praise it richly deserves from the other readers. It would be a gross understatement to say that this novel is amazing. Although there is the occasional flaw in literature; and I found the balance between love and war a little shaky, this is THE book of 1996. What struck me was the power of the introduction. Faulks does not take long to chain his readers to their chairs (or beds); there is a must read element from the very beginning, which is almost always lacking in other similar novels. I honestly do not think that Faulks will write a better 'war time romance' novel. When he does, I would like to thank him personally for making yet another reader very happy indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why We Give Thanks","review":"I read Birdsong several months ago and am still haunted by the images of doom and life that Faulks weaves. Those of us fortunate to have been protected from war by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans until recently should experience this novel and its passionate descriptions of the unending Hell that was the trenches of WWI. While it could be depressing, Faulks gave me hope that brave men and women, no matter their nationality, freed us to carry on the values of liberty. Many left the war with deep psychological scars but allowed their successors to grow freely. Thanks to those who shared their lives as soldiers and as noncombatants."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"If I'm not into a story by page 50.... Buy the DVD it was well done, but this never got my interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!!","review":"I really enjoyed this! It was a fascinating revolving door from the horrible depictions of World War One in France to the life of a woman in the 70's. You know they must somehow be related, but the mystery is kept until the very end. I am ashamed at the dearth of knowledge I have for the history of that time, and the horror of the very vivid, extremely bloody time period of the Battle of the Somme in France; where over 73,000 British and their allies died with no graves.Sebastian Faulks has won many awards and has many fine, well known novels to his credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down, one of my favourite books","review":"Beautifully written love story with harrowing descriptions of the First World War. The scenes underground are so well captured that I could hardly breath they were so claustrophobic. I didn't want it to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdsong audio book with Toby Stephens","review":"Instead of buying the book I chose to listen to the audio version done like a radio show. I was transported by the magical voice of Toby Stephens into the world of the main character Stephen Wraysford as he finds love and turmoil during WW1. I found all the characters well done/read and the story quite gripping. Excellent sound effects made me feel as if I were there. It also made it very easy to visualize. I am constantly amazed at the excellent job done by Toby Stephens. As with his other audio work he portrays such emotion in his voice that he makes the readings come alive. Not a story for everyone due to the graphic discriptions of the war. But still I highly recomend it and other readings by Mr. Stephens.( Heart of Darkness, Guns of Navarone,Riddle of the Sands, Woman in White, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"As a lover of historical fiction, particularly with a war-based background and with several \\"The greatest book I've ever read\\" and \\"Have re-read several times\\" comments from Amazon's learned reviewers, I couldn't wait to read this book. However, reviews are nothing but opinion and I ended up being disappointed........Why? Well, I guess I just found Faulk's writing to be quite labourious and his characters bland and uninspiring to me as the reader.The initial part set before the war was a bit cliched and predictable - \\"young handsome Englishman wins over repressed older French woman, but relationship is ultimately doomed\\" - very Mills and Boon type of stuff. Then we cut to the war with the mud and blood, senseless loss of lives, poor leadership, etc etc etc. Seen it all before I'm afraid - \\"tell me something new\\" I kept thinking as I ploughed on. The \\"contemporary\\" parts with the grand-daughter didn't really grab me either.All in all, an average read."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"This is one of the most outstanding books i have ever picked up. I was gripped from beginning to end. It moved me to tears in many places and i pray that Charlotte Gray is as wonderful. Thank you Mr Faulks for telling the story of these heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, Mr. Faulks? A \\"Novel\\" Requires A Plot!","review":"Lovely descriptions, (and decent steamy scenes), but for heaven's sake, where's the story, and why do I care? A handful of lovingly described events combined with inconsistently developed characters does not a good plotline make. It's a boring mishmash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you fellow one star reviewers!","review":"Thanks so much to the people who have given this book one or two stars and who lived to tell the tale!! I feel as though I've been in the trenches.....until my rude awakening in 1978????!!!! last night. I was so ready to give up on this book and it is those of you courageous enough to buck the establishment who give me the courage to do so. I have no fear of birds. I am not afraid of Germans. In fact, at my age, I don't even really fear death. Bad writing and the thought of spending the day sweating in formal clothes near a fetid river scare me. When I read the jacket of this book I was prepared to be blown away by the awesomeness that was this book. I kept waiting right up until the time I read these one and two star reviews and I could not agree with all of you more. We will push on in search of a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We can never fully empathise","review":"When reading Birdsong I was attracted by the characters' struggles but at once repelled by the vivid description. I read on with sympathy and pity but at the same time never fully appreciating or understanding the horror. The calmness of many of the soldiers warmed my heart whilst causing me to recoil at their apparent composure in the face of such suffering. A feeling I do not understand. Only those who have endured such affliction may comment fully on this novel and the power of the imagery and emotions conveyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed","review":"This was such a disappointing read after all the hype. I'm giving up halfway through, and passing my copy to someone who may appreciate it more. The first part of the book was so hackneyed that I found it laughable - I was not at all convinced by the love story. I got very annoyed by Faulk's omniscient narration, the viewpoint constantly flitting from person to person. As other reviewers here have pointed out, Faulks has a tendency to \\"tell rather than show\\", which deprives the reader of much of the pleasure of reading. I also found that I couldn't care less about the characters, particularly Steven, who remains vague and shadowy. That I stuck with the book so long is testimony to the fact that Faulks recreates the scenes in the trenches so well. Both my grandfathers fought in WW1 and I am so hungry to know more about what they experienced. But maybe I'd be beter off reading a good history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre to Poor","review":"This CD lacks any punch. Byron Lee & the Dragonaires have the sound of a cocktail lounge house band. Tolorable but not anthing to go out of your way for. This particular Byron Lee aulbum actually includes the the \\"& Friends\\" in the title which combined with \\"Ska-Rock Steady\\" induced me to give it them another try. In this case \\"Friends\\" were often worse then Byron Lee. For example the first track \\"My Boy Lillypop\\" features Spencer, Roberts and is \\"screetchy.\\" IT set my nerves on edge. If you want Ska buy Ska, if you want Raggae buy Ska but don't bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful instruments, not as beautiful voices...","review":"After seeing the movie, I knew that I wanted to buy the soundtrack. Overall, it does not disappoint. Throughout the disc, Shaun Davey has done a masterful job interweaving instruments into quite a few beautifully composed tracks(especially #5). Davey's composition makes the majority of the disc quite stimulating. However, the vocals just aren't up to snuff. This reviewer found that in this case, the Waterboys should go back to just being Waterboys. Remove their vocals from this CD, and it is a 5 star soundtrack. Yet as stated earlier, with them, it is still quite a good buy. 4 stars, and definitely worth buying for the soundtrack to Waking Ned Devine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, lively, and sweet","review":"Previous reviewers have said it so eloquently already, but I have to chime in that I agree. This album is lively and sweet. Every song so appropriately complements it's respective scene in the film and listening to the music takes you back to each scene and the beautiful scenery of the Isle of Man all over again. Rich Irish instumentation - uillean pipes and all - make it authentic. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Ned Devine","review":"Being Celtic, I've always been partial to this type of music, but I must say Shaun Davey has put together a masterpeice! If one wants to take a trip to the mystical shores of The Emerald Isle and never leave his chair just plug this CD in and close your eyes and let your mind wonder. After listening to the CD, the movie is a must see. After this, sorry to say You're Hooked. In my opinion one could honestly wear this CD out.Ernest HutchersonSmyrna, TN."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorite all time movies","review":"What's not to like about the movie Waking Ned Devine: great music, great scenery, great comedy, great fun all around! The music from the soundtrack sticks in your mind and makes you feel good all day. Just listening to it makes me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland captured in music","review":"I just returned from Ireland last week and again felt impelled to watch the movie for a third time. I just knew it and the music would transport me back to \\"mother Ireland\\". The music captures the happy and the sad times. The beauty of the Uillian pipes is haunting and played with the utmost skill. A true blend of upbeat and insightful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Compliment to the Movie","review":"I would have bought this album for \\"The Parting Glass\\" alone. A truly immersive soundtrack which encompasses the wry humor and simple beauty of Waking Ned Devine. This film was one of those which cheers me up when I watch it, and the soundtrack allows that feeling to again pervade. A perfect sound representing a quieter, gentler place while retaining a sense of quirky liveliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Ned devine soundtrack","review":"Terrific collection of Irish music, reminding me of a wonderfully entertaining movie.

While this is a little more pop than what one might expect from Ms. Lemper it is still a very brilliant and gorgeous record. The duet with Art Mengo Parler d'amour is a standout as is the title track, a luscious ballad; there is a cabaresque track, Mes deux amants, and Ute even gets funky on track #6, La vague a femme.

This includes the English Revolution of 1688, Napoleon at Waterloo, both Pitts, the War of 1812, the American Revolution, World War I, India and more.

Her poems are often stories borrowed from the imagined pasts of her Morano ancestors, who fled persecution in Spain for the Dominican Republic, and then persecution in the Dominican Republic for the USA. Always, always, they are noble souls. Yes, always.Though grandmotherish in tone, devoid of vision, and musically challenged, she does pull some of the poems off in this collection. For that I will give her one star, one which I hope she will wear proudly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda edgy, kinda mellow","review":"So far I enjoy it. It has memories of the movie in this kind of intense feeling but some of the music is mellow and so Vegas like.I don't enjoy the sound bites that much because I have the movie on tape, but somehow it sort of works. I would love to hear a version without the sound bites and I bet I would rate it a 5 star.Overall it's a good CD but if you don't know the movie and didn't get into the Benisms, you may not enjoy it but for Sting and Don Henley which really make this a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of it??????","review":"Why bother with a whole soundtrack if you are only going to put a handful of songs on it. The best tunes from the movie aren't even on the disc. An EP would have been sufficient for the Sting and Henly tracks. Not 4 songs and 21 tracks of dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting and Don Henly make this soundtrack worth it.","review":"For all of you that haven't seen the movie, four songs in this compilation make this disc a must. Sting sings three jazz tunes that are among his best of all time, Angel Eyes, My One And Only Love, and It's A Lonesome Old Town. Don Henley contributed a track as well called Come Rain Or Come Shine, which also has a jazzy feel to it. Never have I bought a twenty track CD simply for four of its songs, however, the Leaving Las Vegas Soundtrack is an exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchering the classics","review":"If you enjoy listening to singers such as Sting and Don Henley destroy classic material this is the album for you. I have no idea why the director chose this material, and these singers, but they do not mix. This is especially true of Sting, who destroys My One and Only Love with his high whiney voice. I recommend the John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album. Once you know what the song is supposed to sound like you will know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Lonely Teardrops?","review":"Leaving Las Vegas sountrack is a beautiful collection of songs ranging from Sting to Don Henley. My only gripe about this soundtrack is the missing song Lonely Teardrops sung by Bob Seger, the song is played numerous times in the film and I was disappointed it's not in this album. Some of the rest of the tracks that are not played in the film are gorgeous and I love the dialogue that's added between Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.

I was entranced by Laura Hillenbrand's description of planes in a chapter of 'Unbroken'; I certainly can find a topic I otherwise am indifferent to very interesting but this author managed to completely turned me off. When I ran the NYC Marathon the residents of Brooklyn had the biggest heart and cheered like no other area along the course; I wanted to love this book, learn more about how the area was impacted by the Bridge but found the writing style and all the details to be a complete bore.

By the same token, no single book and necessarily suit everybody's needs which explains why some people below complain that there is too much social history, too much engineering detail, or even not enough engineering detail. Heck, if you want to dig deeper onto any aspect of this book there is a fine bibliography in the back of it, and an amazing amount of the historical materials cited in it can be found on the Web if you know how to search for it.One other suggestion: treat yourself and buy the Dover picture book \\"A Picture History of the Brooklyn Bridge\\" as a companion to this one. Even though the selection of photos in the McCullough book is more or less generous, the broader coverage of the Dover book helps you better visualize more of what is in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"I love history.

I just finished Lincoln and decided to buy The Bridge which I am currently enjoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Bridge","review":"The Great Bridge is not only well written, it is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read the history of how iconic sites are built."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll have to make a pilgrimage when you close the book!","review":"David McCullough is a guarantee, and the Brooklyn Bridge is too. But did you know that the Roeblings are top grade, 100%, acme dudes as well? This is a fine story that would be nearly unbelievable as fiction, but which is as interesting as anything a person could make up, better for being true. I just loved the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books of popular history","review":"McCullough has produced a compelling work of scholarship and, as we are used by now, an insightful study of dynamic (if eccentric) personalities who helped propel American history forward. The story of the Bridge is the story of the invention of 20th century New York. Is it too much to conclude that the Bridge was one of the most important technological accomplishments to America's emergence as world leader in the 20th century? Perhaps not. It's worth discussing. Either way, though, this is a book to relish."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I saw the story of the Brooklyn Bridge on a PBS special so I had to read the book to learn the whole story. It is a very easy to read yet detailed account of how the bridge was built. I still have a hard time believing that something like this could have been built so long ago! It sets the tone of the time just right. A truly great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McCullough's approach to history","review":"McCullough is a very thorough historian who amasses facts and background from many different fields: industrial, political, technical, financial, social, cultural, etc. and weaves them together as though he were writing a novel. Although this is quite a long book, we listened to it as we drove a long distance, so even when we got a bit bogged down we continued to listen. It was worth finishing, as the author weaves up all the loose ends, and at the end we felt a sense of completion, as if we were the ones building the bridge and were looking back on a work well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge (Purchased on 09/26/2010)","review":"I got this book to read on the recommendation of a friend who knew I planned to walk the Great Bridge. I thought \\"How could a book about building a bridge be so long. It must be boring.But even for a girly girl it was very interesting. I learnd what a caison was and that although it took years to build, only about 20 people died because of their concern for safety.I highly recommend this book for its interesting story and great writing style of David G. McCullough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph and Tragedy","review":"I learned more about structural engineering (and caissons!) then I'll ever care to know again. A structural engineer would love this book. I found it at times, to be tedious reading, but still a fascinating account of the bridge and more importantly the Roebling family who built it. Washington Roebling's life was like that of a Greek tragedy. I wish the Kindle version of this books and pictures and diagrams, but it did not, making me now want to get a hard copy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Excellent, informative and very well written. Although very technical, very good reading to the novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bridge, great book","review":"I drive over it every day to work and know that it's the most beautiful bridge in the world, but I had no idea of the labor, engineering innovation, political dealmaking, and family drama involved in building it until I read this terrific book. McCullough is at his best describing the Roeblings, the father and son engineering team who pioneered the use of steel cable in suspension bridges, and stewarded the Brooklyn Bridge through to completion. He also gives a vivid picture of the harrowing work done by the \\"sandhogs\\" who had to dig the underwater foundation of the bridge's towers. But McCullough, who knows and writes about American history as well as anyone alive, is surprisingly slightly less good when it comes to discussing the political back and forth between the Tweed ring and the New York state Republicans who originally sponsored the project. On the whole though, this is a great read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"Just okay. Its about the bridge...a little long in places, kind of boring, its history...what else can I say. okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Bridge","review":"Another superb book by David McCullough.

(17 CDs) I felt that he did a fine job of reading this text. At first glance I thought the book would be one about engineering, etc. While this work does include some of these data, the book is largely about the people and times surrounding the construction of this \\"8th\\" wonder of the world. McCullough does wonderfully to bring into focus the various problems which faced those 19th century personalities involved in this project. Good reading for anyone liking more insights into this interesting area of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge","review":"I have read all of David McCullough's books since May of 2008. They are all true masterpieces. The Great Bridge, along with Truman, are stand outs - but none disappoint! I visited the Brooklyn Bridge after reading this book and actualy saw the expanse for the first time. Before it was just a bridge. After reading the book it became alive with the story of the great(and not so great)people of the times. McCullough is an artist as well as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book on Bridge Building Interesting???? You Bet!!!","review":"It is the mark of a good writer to make mundane subjects interesting. While the grand vision and building of the Bridge was far from mundane, a lesser writer would have become bogged down in details and minutiae of the subject.Not so David McCullough. Perhaps I am a bit prejudiced, having once worked for CF&I, the successor to the Roebling Wire Mills, but I found this book to be substantive, yet comprehensive in detail.For those put off by the length, fear not! The book flows quickly and chronicles a fascinating chapter in the history of both New York City as well as wondrous engineering achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Bridge","review":"David McCullough makes History Come Alive. It's like we were there!! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the early history of our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Very informative book about the times back then building bridge.

Roebling Jr. as the Chief Engineer after his father's death and the involvement of his wife, Emily, throughout the years of construction along with all the politics of the age and the two cities involved make for great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual Errors in K. Burns review","review":"Don't mean to split hairs but previous latest review by Kerry Burns is factually incorrect. John Augustus Roebling was the father and Washington Roebling the son. Emily was the wife of John A. Roebling and one of the GREAT heroes of this magnificent book by the brilliant David McCullough. The Great Bridge is inspiring and uplifting to say the least. An epic triumph of design, engineering and construction genius. All the design,engineering and construction genius would be for naught were it not for the incredible dedication of the Roeblings and so many others. Completed in 1881 the bridge is a monument to all the blood, sweat and tears that went into it. The book is a classic and a must read in this day when the recently completed BIG DIG in Boston ( at a cost of $15billion ) is already an unmitigated DISASTER. The Great Bridge is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS IT WAS POSTED!","review":"These people are crooks. They advertise something that isn't what it is.

The audience was packed with people of all ages, and everyone had a great time. And how could they not? The movie has something for everyone! Fun, adventure, phenomenal graphic artistry, romance, humor, and a bouyant spirit! The characters are also brilliantly brought to life by the actors. I never would have thought of Brad Pitt as Sinbad, but he gives such a goregeous rough-voiced humor to this pirate that you can't help but love him. Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect as the fiercely passionate Marina, Joseph Fiennes gives a heroic nobility to Prince Proteus, and Michelle Pheiffer is deliciously wicked as the goddess of chaos, Eris. The crew is also fantastically lovable and deserves high praise. Go see this film! You won't be disappointed! I can't wait to see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, all it takes is to watch it as it is.","review":"Seriously, I don't understand what's so bad about this movie. After reading many reviews and people telling me that its 'lame' and all that. I bet it's all due to the current trend and influences of 'Pixaresque' story creation/movie making methodologies and past 'formulas' for animated feature box office successes.This movie is downright sincere with a story that works for people of all ages/cultures.

The story was even good but this animated movie from Dreamworks totally killed the story of Sinbad. The effects were horrible, and even though, the cast was good vocally the film just didn't out-do the other animated films of 2003 (ex. Brother Bear) If this movie had been live action and used the same cast, It could probably rival Pirates of the Caribbean, but as an animated film the movie totally disappoints in every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to El Dorado meets Disneys Tarzan","review":"Take the best animation and action from RTED and Disneys Tarzan and you get this surprisingly good Cartoon movie. Surprising, only because when we bought this I was cool to the notion that someone was doing another SINBAD movie. But this is very well done on all levels.All my children enjoyed, girls and boys, for its action and romance, balanced to hold the attentions of an ADHD child AND his sisters.the animation and action sequenced are often just plain WOW. Our family highly recommends this movie to you and your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is not one of Dreamworks better known animated movies, but it's worth seeing nonetheless. The graphics are quite good, and the story entertaining enough. The title is a misnomer-there's little of the authentic Sinbad from the Arabian Nights tales, rather the Sinbad character in the movie is closer to Odyesseus and Johnny Depp- but who cares, it's good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 year old loved this doll for the necklace...","review":"but the necklace broke the 2nd time she opened it.

I thought the music in the film was excellent; particularly at the conclusion of the movie and credits. I found the DVD musical scores were cut short.

I have come across this in search of an incredible piece of music that someone has seen fit to delete from this soundtrack. Either that or has been uncredited. The piece is by Thomas Tallis. It's called Te Deum. It is played during the sequence of her coronation, I believe. I have had the honor to be a part of the performance of this piece and am very sorry to see it unincluded in this soundtrack. Tallis was one of the predominate choral masters of the time. If you can find it, you will be truly lucky! It is nine minutes plus of beauty in music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for Harrison","review":"Harrison usually has intelligent characters making reasonable decisions, but this book is premised on a decision that is so ridiculous, that I couldn't get past the first few chapters. The situation: A modern-day bad guy has taken the plans for a simple machine gun back in time to change the outcome of the Civial War. The obvious solution: Take a year to train a Seal Team for the mission (You can send anyone from anywhen to anywhen, so it doesn't matter how much time you take to prepare.) Send them back to a month before the bad guy arrived, so that they are ready and waiting for him when he gets there. Harrison's solution: Send a lone black man with no training and no weapons to pre-Civil War Virginia to arrive several months after the bad guy.

I was disappointed in this workout because it is not even on each side of the body, the moves are vague, the instructor mumbles. I did like the mirror- this helped me see better how to perform the moves. I felt as if I should already know how to belly dance; perhaps that is the target audience? I will stick to Rania's workout dvd's with a belly dance 'flavour', at least I can work up a sweat. And what is all this palaver with the fabric and the cane?

When I first listened to this fantastic box set, I played one of the songs from Disc 4 on the radio. This Sunday I will be playing another one from this collection. Johnny Cash was one of the best country singers of all time. I've heard his music right from the beginning. I would have loved to see him do a few duets with Roy Orbison, another fantastic singer.

This is also one of the best sources for locating more in depth material, with a comprehensive bibliography included. Ironic that this book describing the politics of the most left-wing state in the Union is written by one of the most prominent Republicans in Vermont, the senior State Senator, Bill Doyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"author doesn't understand the theory of linear filters","review":"The author doesn't seam to know the theory of linear shift-invariant systems. Its very easy to see that his proposed double smoothing is just a convolutions of two EMA filters, and is approximated by a longer EMA, thus has the same lag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I thought this book was very short to begin with (only 104 pages of actual text, plus some small apendixes)...hardly worth $42 for a small amount of text. It's also very old (written in 1995). The content which is in the book is very difficult to apply because you really need a research tool (like tradestation) to apply these ideas. Numerous ideas in earlier chapters are brought back in later chapters and you have to go back and re-read to see what each indicator meant. I think all in all he just applies his idea of double smoothing to filter out misleading chart data....nothing revolutionary, and hardly worth the price.Also, as odd as this may seem, with all the math involved, 90% of the charts which he derives from these mathematical formulas look exactly like a line chart of the security!If you have access to tradestation, this book is worthwhile if you put the time into understanding all the concepts involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"This CD does not run on my computer.Apparently this CD was written for older computers (DOS) which are rarely in service. This should be made clearer in the up front marketing.I had to discard the CD and received no satisfaction at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of everything","review":"This 3 CD compilation contains a good mix of music, including Oldies, R&B and Dance. For those not familar with this set, the 3 CD titles are \\"Ready to Rock 'n' Roll,\\" \\"Freedom of Expression\\" and \\"Shady Ladies.\\" I particulary like the following songs: I Heard it Through the Grapevine, That Same Old Feeling, Rescue Me and Will You Love Me Tomorrow. It contains a good mix of women artists signing a variety of familar songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception Rides A Horse","review":"Okay, \\"Death Rides A Horse\\" ranks as one of the top ten Spaghetti westerns and Lee Van Cleef's best starring role in a Spaghetti western. However, DO NOT BUY this disc. First, it is not 16 X 9. Second, it is not widescreen. Instead, it is full-frame with a menu that allows you to play the movie. I know what I am speaking about because I ordered this awful piece of crap and thought that I would be getting some deluxe off-brand name widescreen version. That is NOT the case. In short, the wording on this movie is deceptive, highly deceptive. Beware!!! Happily, Amazon.Com allowed me to return this execrable junk. The company that manufactured this disc has no ethics. You can find a better bootleg version of this four-star western beautiful widescreen if you search the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I bought this film expecting a 16 X 9 Version and it's not. The movie looks as if it's been recorded off of television and the sound is horrible. The title is spelt wrong on the side of the DVD and they even spelt the legendary Ennio Morricone's name wrong. I didn't realize until after I bought the film that I already owned it in my Classic 20 Movies Features Spaghetti Westerns 5 Disc set. That version looks and sounds much better and includes another great Lee Van Cleef film titled Grand Duel. It's a cheaper collection as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie,","review":"I love the new format. This movie is formatted from widescreen theatrical to wide screen television so it fit the television without any bars and without starching the picture. It is cropped from one side or two sides of the movie. By the way, all the movies you watch on television are formatted to fit the 4x3 television or the widescreen television this why you do not see black bars. This movie is standard definition as most of Hollywood Classic movies. It will look little soft on wide screen television especially of 50 or 60 inch television. Also if you have high definition cable of satellite you will see the difference. The movie is a good movie I enjoy it. If you do not want black bars, buy this movie. The quality you see on the small video screen is the same quality you see on 40' screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge is a dish best served italian style","review":"Here's another classic Italian made spaghetti western full of revenge and regret. 2 men competing to take out the same gang for different reasons. Beautifully shot with a memorable score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. In fact some of the score wound up being used the new film from Quentin Tarantino \\"Inglorious Basterds\\". I just wish that this film could get the DVD release it truly deserves. As the film has lapsed into public domain there are no remastered widescreen prints available. If someone online says they've got a widescreen copy they'd be lying. The supposed widescreen copy I purchased was a transfer of a full screen VHS print with very poor picture and video quality. But that still doesn't take away from how friggin' awesome this flick is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for academics","review":"Like the other reviewers, I found this composition, and this recording, to be superb: shattering in its power and a revealing interpretation of the poems, innovative while fully faithful to their tone and content. The other reviews are quite helpful, but since they all sound as if written by academics, I want to add that this work is accessible and moving for a wider audience as well. Even without background in the poems, any careful listener would find this piece rewarding, although it is most certain to draw you into the stunning poetic work of Blake as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Modern American Music","review":"While this may not appeal to all tastes, it is definitely worth a listen if you are interested in exploring modern music. This is not what some people may expect when the term modern is used, although it is certainly modern. The other reviews have gone on at depth, I just want to say that I've listened to this recording several times and each time I hear something new. A fine addition to your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A supremely moving work of art","review":"I am writing this not as a music critic but as someone who has enjoyed William Blake's poetry for most of my life. I bought this CD because of Blake's poetry. I realized that of late I had not been reading poetry or enjoying it as much as when I was younger. I became hooked right away and I have been playing this CD over and over again for more than a month. I can't listen to any other piece of music. Some of the pieces are better than others, but everything sung by Nathan Lee Graham is moving beyond words (at least any words I know). So I think anyone who enjoys poetry, the English language, history, ideas or the human voice will enjoy listening to this CD over and over again. This music has touched me like no other piece of music ever. I think the artists, particularly Nathan Lee Graham, should all become rich and famous. I was even thinking that A Divine Image should be released as a single. I think it would go to #1, with a bullet."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to understand and entertaining to read too.","review":"the author explains the graphs quite well in his textbook. all the examples are interesting and relate to real life. i've had the honor of having the author as a sub for our regular lecturer for a week at UC Berkeley. his book's just like his lectures, very entertaning and does not bore me to sleep.but the book does not help with the difficult tests given since it only covers the basics, one needs to do the problems in the study guide in order to really apply the concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Intermediate Econ","review":"Had this for my second micro course.

For one thing, after half a semester of ECON 211 Principles of Microeconomics, this book has not been helpful at all.Graphs are placed on a page and the author spends two pages explaining the graph. The theory behind all of the paragraphs was designed to baffle instead of to enlighten. While some real-life case studies (Dell's organizational methods) are interesting reads, what the book needs to do more is to talk about applying theories to strategies in real life.It may be true that I am taking a Principles of Microeconomics course, but in a course where I am expected to understand how to apply theories to problems in the real-world, this book is a long way from being readable or being helpful in a course in micro."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Undergraduate Text in Microeconomics","review":"I am rating this book 1 star because I don't have the option of rating it a 0. 0 is what it actually deserves. I was required to buy this book when I took a course taught by the author, Jeff Perloff, at UC Berkeley. This book is the absolute worst micro text I've ever come across.

I do not agree with the statement that the Big Book was written by men (was written by bill.w) for MALE alcoholics (it was written at a time when women were apart of a.a....see the forward to the first edition).

It actually seems smaller than most, my child is now 6 months old, and she has almost grown out of it. The most impractical thing, however, is that you can not use it on shopping carts. I actually wish I would have purchased a less expensive brand just for that reason. I have three children, and with this type, the only option I have with the carrier is to put the baby in the back of the shopping cart, leaving no room for groceries or supplies.

After dropping out of college, he is drafted into the U.S. Army in 1965. He goes because he feels it is his duty to serve. His father tells him to make the best of it.What he finds is racism in the U.S. Army. Not only do the officers send him on guard and KP duty more times than the others, but once in Nam they send him on more dangerous duties.He finds the Army divided between Souls, white men, and Hispanics. Not only does this prevent the units from fighting more effectively, but it causes a hatred toward his fellow soldiers rather than the enemy. He finally gets out and heads home to a divided land.I think this book points out a unique perspective. America was divided in the sixties, and blacks and others did not have equal rights. However our nation put them at risk in foreign lands to back up our foreign policy. This is a good perspective of the black soldier in Vietnam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved them at first, but ...","review":"These spoons are lightweight, but very strong.

The one I ordered broke as soon as I took it out of the box, and it took almost three weeks to get to my house. The box is made cheeply too.

Don't hope for too much bass out of these (as is expected for the small speakers). I do not recommend these as the primary source of sound for your music player in your living room. For that you definitely want to invest in something bigger. I think they're most ideal for times when you want music on the go, but don't want to use headphones. In my case, I use it while I'm working as a bus driver (can't wear headphones while driving).

When a friend and I tried to listen to music, we couldn't get it loud enough. After a while, the on and off switch was getting more difficult. I had to keep pressing it to turn on and off. Finally, I came into the room one day and the thing was making a death-rattle type noise. I hadn't turned it on, it just was dying right in front of me. I would not recommend this item. All in all it only lasted for several months with moderate use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp clear but small sound!","review":"First off, if you're planning a Disco, then these are definitely not for you.These speakers are great for listening to music in small spaces, your bedside, for example. Volume isn't great (though I get more out of them by increasing the volume setting on my iPod through iTunes - If you don't do this, sound will be frustratingly low) as the speakers draw power from whatever device they are connected to (iPod, PC, phone, etc, sparing you worries about charging or replacing batteries), but sound quality is crisp and clear with some Bass sounding. Just remember to disable any Bass boost or equalizer settings on your player to prevent sound distortion.The design is lovely, and ideal for travel, snaps shut like a spectacles case, and the 30cm cord wraps snugly into place, but you must handle with care as the hinge does look rather fragile.Great for when one tires of using headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought these speakers to use with a portable DVD player, I sent them back they have terrible sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile for Travel","review":"The hinge on these speakers where they fold up is extremely fragile.

In the hotel room, I had to rig up a deal with a washcloth and the Hotel Guidebook so I could prop up the now lame speakers. Who knew you had to be MacGuyver to use these things?Because they're inexpensive and small, I could deal with the very low volume (they are unpowered) and the extremely tinny sound - that was expected.

My wife saved it from an early demise.This evening, my wife made the Pecan Diamonds. As the recipe insisted, she followed it \\"exactly\\". We couldn't see how it would hold together, but did as told. The result was a pile of dry pecans sitting on top of a crust surrounded by a pool of the caramel that had melted out of them.

Then to travel clockwise the rear car had to be taken off because it travled derailed. In a 20 min span it derailed 3 times sending him off of it. He weighs about 22lbs. Constuction is ok. Some parts could have been a stronger plastic. Assembly easy. May be I just got a bad one, most the reviews seemed good. Very disappointed though it is going back.

Although he had a spotter at the time, it happened too quick to save him. He landed on the nearby hardwood floor while the track was on the carpet. The train seems to need a system to vary the starts. It's qiute a jerk to get moving. The problem of a large area to leave the figure - 8 track up for long periods still exist.

He had difficulty steering the train straight and the handlebar housing kept pulling away from the train body. The train startup I thought was very jerky and moved way to fast for the track setup.

I really aim for toys that encourage creative play, exploration of the world, that are not loud. This train, I was expecting would not do this. Was I wrong?!This is a fun toy and very exciting. We have had it for several years now and my children still play on it. They can use it without the track which only makes it that much more fun.It is fairly easy to steer and has not broken down yet. It is sturdy and has lasted through three children playing with it. It really does lend to creative play- my children have pretended they are delivering mail, visiting family, and so on.Much fun. Throw in a few fun books such as Mailing May and this would be an excellent toy to encourage creativity, find and large motor control, and many more skills.Enjoy.

The glass is nice and the white flower pattern is pretty but it will likely not function well as a coaster since it is obviously not durable.

I have not read Ginny's and Steve's story, and honestly I don't want to, after reading this book. Laura is such a brat she got on my nerves. And I didn't feel sorry for her when she got kidnapped. Don't get me wrong know. I didn't want anything bad to happen to her, but I didn't like her. Like I said she really, really, got on my nerves!! And I don't know HOW in GOD'S world they fell in love. Trent was not the kind of guy you fall in love with. He was disrespectfull to her and was always calling her a \\"PUTA\\" (whore). The ONLY reason I finished reading the book, (or should I say skimmed the book?) was because a friend let me borrow it and I thought she might ask me questions. So if you can, skip this book.

Although I'm not anti-lesbian, I prefer to see the heroine having sex with the hero rather than her female friends.

But theres hardly any history between them other then that. I felt the book was a bit rushed and just lacking in ways.

Once because a part failed and the other time we had a power failure and the amp couldn't take it. It still isn't working properly. It sits on a shelf with plenty of air flow to keep it cool, but if I run three sets of speakers, out of a possible four, it will sometimes overreact and shutdown.This is just not a quality product. I wouldn't buy another one from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous playing - highly recommended","review":"Anne-Sophie Mutter and Lambert Orkis make gorgeous music. These four discs offer wonderful insight, passion and the sheer beauty of a Stradivarius played with stunning results by one of the violin's greatest living exponents. The accompanying Pluscore feature is fascinating: with four of the sonatas, listeners can follow the score while the music is performed, or practice it. There is also critical material accessible by computer, and photographs of the performers, of Beethoven, and of some of his contemporaries. I must admit I am still struggling with the interpretation of the Kreutzer (#9), which I found problematic. It lacks the spirit and vitality of the Francescatti/Casadesus version - my favorite - and seems so heavily mannered as to be ponderous at times. The other sonatas, however, are rendered with real beauty and a sheen derived from excellent sound and technique. The set is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent, exaggerated and nothing to do with Beethoven","review":"I heard the Kreutzer on the radio and found it so repellent (but actually laughable) that I had to listen to the end just to know who was playing.

A triumph of hype and marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beethoven? Who cares! This is Mutter...","review":"I have heard several terrible recordings by artists who really dont't understand the music they are playing. Many of them have such deep respect for themselves that they cover there misunderstanding in all kinds of strange ways. They are so great performers that they don't have to care at all about finding the true soul of the music. Mutter is one of them. Is this really the music by Beethoven! This is her most hysteric way of saying: I am the greatest, I can do whatever I want, and I know you will love it because of my genious. Sorry, there are actually some people out there who understands the meaning of playing music. And it sure isn't only to present your huge ego without any respect for the composer and his intentions. This is an insult to Beethoven and his art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling music; frustrating cd-rom","review":"According to an email correspondence with Polygram USA, there was a manufacturing error in the entire US run causing the CD-pluscore information to be absent from the CD.

Piper has introduced us to the life-changing concept of Christian Hedonism in his book Desiring God: The Meditations of a Christian Hedonist. Someone having read that book might ask: \\"how do Christian Hedonists worship God?\\" Dennis Jernigan is the answer.This 2 volume CD set was originally two separate albums. The second one \\"Break My Heart, O God\\" is the best. I would venture to say that it is one of the best pieces of worship/praise music ever written. It is heartfelt prayer and praise almost the whole way through. It is at times upbeat, but more often reverent, and always passionate. Rarely does a piece of contemporary Christian music has touch me as deeply as this one has. If you want to worship God, this album will be a wonderful tool for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 skis my %&@","review":"try to force even 5 skis into this and the plastic tabs that serve to catch the thing shut round off and then are impossible to close. hmph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love with this stroller","review":"The Aria is the finest lightweight stroller I have found and I have done TONS of homework. It has every feature I need, especially the child snack tray and a good-sized storage basket. My eight month old can sit in total comfort completely upright, she can lay all the way back, and it adjusts anywhere in between. She's so happy in it. And it is EASY to steer, even with one hand. I don't know why anyone says it takes force to steer, because it just doesn't. The front wheels have a \\"no swivel\\" lock, so make sure that's not on and it steers wonderfully. I now wonder why I bought the heavy, bulky Graco travel system (comfortable for baby, but a pain for me to take anywhere). I adore this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard to push-trying to return","review":"I purchased this stroller about 6 months ago & didn't really like it from day one! I love the over all look of the stoller, the snack tray is perfect, the under basket is pefect....but I can't steer the darn thing! It pulls hard to the side & for such a light weight stroller you'd think it would be easier to manover. I sent a e-mail to peg prego & the we're very helpful, told me to send it to them or to bring it to one of their local repair shops, but I think it's more of a design issue then it is a defect. I've read other reviews & spoke with other owners & they say the same thing. I'm disappointed because I love the look, but for now, I'm going back to using my VERY heavy Grecco stroller until I can find a better light weight stroller. It really is too bad, because I do love the way the Aria looks and it's accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better","review":"My wife hates this stroller. I'm not a fan either. First the good news. This is one light stroller. I didn't realize how light until I had to use someone elses. This thing is half the weight of a normal stroller and folded up it's much smaller too (think trunk space!)Now the bad. As others have said it does not want to go straight. You cannot push this with one hand. Mine pulls to the left always. 2nd, the cup holder for the kid pops out all the time. It's also very shallow so it's only good for a short sippy cup. Anything tall, including a bottle, will fall out when you hit a bump. The sunshade is tiny and basically does nothing. The basket on the bottom always comes undone and then it starts dragging on the ground. The straps are complicated and get tangled all the time. It can only be folded with 2 hands, no one handed folding.So, pass pass pass on this stroller! We're going to buy a new one to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to steer","review":"Although this stroller is light, it is very hard to steer. It seems to stick when you try to turn it.

Even $12.99's strollers made better than this piece of \\"cheap\\" plastic covered by \\"expensive italian\\" fabric.1. Absolutely NO maneurability and NO Steering2. Sunshade is SO small and uncomfortable - my son was always exposed to sun and rain.3. Basket underneath is NOT durable - once you put there gallon of milk it will scratch the asphalt forever.4. Aluminium parts are NOT durable too.5. System of Restrain belts are totally unuseful - my toddler came out from this stroller for 3 seconds so when you stop at the Dunkin Donuts window to buy a coffee you should keep un eye on you child otherwise you will look for him everywhere in the street.So i wish i knew all of these before i put in trash $199. This stroller doesn't worth this money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light-weight stroller with a tray","review":"We've had this stroller for over a year now, and are very happy with it. The main thing I wanted a light weight stroller with a tray. I have an old Peg-Perego Pliko, but it didn't have a tray. The tray makes all the difference. It's so much easier to feed the baby while you're out somewhere. It's easy to fold and unfold.The basket is big enough to store a diaper bag. It's a great basket for this light stroller.The only thing the adult cup holder fell off after a couple of months of use. It's not very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable, do not buy this product","review":"We used this stroller four times and it broke (the connection for the car seat).

Some of the cosmetic features have also fallen off.We have had no luck with the business where we purchased it or the manufacturer. I have no faith in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Stroller Quality","review":"I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months. She hated it. The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat. She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller. After several months of use, the wheel fell off. Also, the stroller is hard to stear. You need both arms on the stroller to push. If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction. Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers. I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied. This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better. I would not recommend it to another consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend it","review":"I have this stroller for over 5 months now and I am regretting the day I chose this. It does not perform up to expectation. I thought peg was supposed to be quality but really it's not. After about 3 months of trying to get the hang of snapping my horrible peg infant car seat into the stroller, the cupholder kept coming off, the aria sticker on both sides came off, and the steering is terrible. The wheels never wants to go straight. I always have to push with both hands. Everyone who helped me pushed this stroller has had a bad experience with it. The only good thing about this stroller is the way it looks. My friend has the pliko and she's very happy with it. I recommend spending an extra 100 bucks if you want the looks and not the headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels Fall Off","review":"We used this stroller 3x on even terrain.

The signs of abuse are all around her, from her comments about hoping dinner will come out just the way Troy likes it to a son who sits under furniture and growls.

Especially the First Asst. Engineer. ( Though the comment about his father being on the Titanic was a bit over the top ) Forget the passengers and the sinking ship, the real story here is in the interaction of the crew and the great backgrounds of a real ship instead of a fake Hollywood set.

The entire cast either under- or over-acts (mostly the latter), and the result is eye-rolling or leaden performances.

No itching, no adhesive sticking to you. (Ouch.)Never mind the environmental excuses, Lunapads are better than disposable for sheer comfort.Care is easy enough. I had a small container of cold water in the bathroom, and just tossed the pads in the water, instead of on the garbage, when I changed them. Dumped and refilled the cold water daily.

A supposed laser plant in a rural area is loaded illegally with governmental plutonium, and after being given a cursory tour by scientist Lithgow,Council is ready to spill the beans bigtime. He methodically constructs a nuclear device, which he plans to exhibit at a statewide science fair,using a hamster project as a coverup. Meanwhile, \\"Uncle Sam\\" is hot on his trail, having discovered the missing plutonium. The mood of the film abruptly turns taut and tense, leading to several twists of uncertainty until the entire situation is resolved. One has a good feeling having seen this movie, which should attract multiple viewings by many."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's No Lord of The Rings, but good movie","review":"The viewer of this movie must realize if you peak into every scientific detail and discrepancy of a movie from 1986 about nuclear weapons, you're going to find yourself not even watching the movie. It's a fun little tale about a kid who beats the system at their own game without realizing the ramifacations of building a nuclear device. Personally I was surprised at the detail that WAS gone into in the process of procuring the plutonium, and the other components he built from scratch. If you liked War Games with the young Broderick you'll love this, and visa versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Wasn't funny at all, the movie itself is a joke though. Weapon's grade plutinum facility guarded by a single security guard which is a total joke. Kid makes an atomic bomb that can blow up all his family and friends but he doesn't seem to give a care and he is applauded as a hero after threatening everyone with it and it almost killing everyone.Doesn't make a whole lot of sense for a movie that was trying to relay a message in which it didn't accomplish that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio & Visuals poor.

I was right about the Visuals, but unfortunately the audio is just as poor.The entire 2nd dvd of bootleg concerts sounds as if it was recorded on a 1970's boombox. Almost unwatchable.The 1st dvd is OK in places. The Commonwealth School set audio/visual is OK. The Middle East footage is OK (interesting to me b/c I go there). Some of the Kennel Club is OK.

Some police professionals believe that officers should not use a use of force model like the one in this book.

His tough and difficult character made it possible to persevere unbearable hardships of traveling, finding a guru in a remote country and following that gurus path.

Many financial planners and investment advisors tend to be analytical types whose education focused on courses in economics and finance. Dr. Altfest's excellent book clearly shows us that financial planning is 90% psychology and human relations and only about 10% number crunching. She clearly shows us the truth of the old adage that \\"clients don't care what you know until they know that you care.\\" This book is filled with wisdom, compassion, and applied common sense. Reading this book made me wish that I could sit with the author as she counsels clients.

You'll spend some time in the kitchen but the meals are all delicious and it amazed me for how quickly I began to feel better, more energy. I have to say though for my lifestyle I need most of my day to day cooking to be more efficient until my stores of ingredients become organized. You can also simplify the recipes and still stay in the zone. It's a great book to help get started and impress you guests. I do think, though, that to be successful you need to read \\"Mastering The Zone\\" or \\"Entering The Zone\\" gain a clear understanding of exactly what the \\"Zone Diet\\" is and how it affects the hormonal system.

This can not be done easily while driving.- If you use this on long car trips, you will need to switch the frequency often enough to be annoying.- I am not an audiophile, but I found the static distracting.- The unit is small and easy to use. If it worked, it would be awesome.I used to use an FM transmitter to play songs from my computer through my downstairs stereo. That was 4 years ago, and it looks like the technology has not advanced any since then.

It does not work in the home or in the car.

In all cases the signal was weak unless I held it out as close as possible to the antennae.

It was a pain to change the station because they are loaded on my ipod. I bought this one thinking it would be newer and stronger than the original. In addition I liked that it had a dial to change the station quickly. Unfortunately the signal on this is weaker than the original and it sounds worse. Whether you change the frequency to LX or DX it sounds like it is coming out monitone. I don't know if I am just picky, but non of these fm transmitters work all that well.

It start from 88.1 It works well so long as the iPod is placed less than a foot from the radio. The moment you move it to beyond 18\\", the static starts. Beyond 2', you can barely hear the music through the noise. Even less than a foot, the volume is low.This is a huge down turn in quality. The old iTrip was great. I bought a griffen car charger.

On long road trips and in more rural areas it performed prefectly...as well as a tape adapter would. The new one does also. In some urban areas I used to get a lot of static, but the newer unit makes it easier to avoid that by allowing me to quickly and easily change frequencies.Bottom line, at times this adapter will sound clear and clean, and other times, depending on the area you are in it will have static (or be completely garbled).

She thought it was set to fit her new apple ipod, but the fittings in no way were compatible.We really need to return it but do not have the paperwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Transmission","review":"This device would not be worth the price if it were free. Even if it is actually touching the radio, it still sounds as if you're tuning in to a station broadcasting from another galaxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No es bueno","review":"En realidad no me parece un producto que valga la pena.Tienes que tener el iPod encima del radio para que puedas escuchar bien la Musica.No lo volveria a comprar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Performance","review":"I generally liked this unit's predecessor, but found its playlist-based tuning to be a pain. So I bought this one. I am sorely disappointed. This unit is pathetic. There is so much interference and its signal is far too weak. It does improve markedly when the iPod is powered by the cigarette lighter. But I bought this unit to function on its own, without requiring external power. It is useless in that regard. Better to buy Monster's combination charger/transmitter that can also be used with a Nano. It actually works, providing vastly better sound than this does. It sounds better than the iTrip even when the iTrip is used in conjunction with external power. The Monster's only drawback is its limited frequency range. This iTrip is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"i was using the tape player for my ipod. but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter. i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency. i was very very disappointed. it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease. i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear. so i blame the transmitter. i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it. i'm glad target took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reception - Low Volume","review":"I used the iTrip with an iPod Nano, it connected fine but performed poorly. Both inside my house using a stereo and used in the car the reception was poor regardless of which frequency I tried and throughtout listening there was lots of crackling to be heard, also the volume had to be turned way up to hear anything at all.This was with the iPod within 2 feet of the radio antenna inside, and within 5 feet when using in the car.I returned it and the manager of the store said a lot of iTrips were being returned by unsatisfied customers.Save your money and time, look for a different solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"Do not invest your money in this. There is no way to get a clear transmission. Static on every empty station I tried. It works but be aware it has very low sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"No static but NO VOLUME","review":"Okay so I am not having the static problems that most other people seem to be having. My problem has been the auto adjust volume control. When I have my station and the music is playing the volume is turned ALL the way down. If I turn up my car speakers then I can faintly- and by faintly I mean like a whisper- hear it and then I do have static and other not so nice stuff to hear. If I use the scroll wheel to turn the volume up the music sounds fine (as long as I keep scrolling). When I stop scrolling the volume automatically gets turned all the way down again...this is extremely frustrating and I wish I knew what to do about it. If the volume worked I would give it a higher rating as, like I said, haven't had problems with finding a clear station. Thank goodness I have a tape deck in my car- I'll be researching those adaptors for my next purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit an Ipod NANO save your $$$","review":"I bought this as a xmas present for my sister who got an Ipod Nano....this device will not fit it. SO do not mistake the title where it just says Ipod, it may fit some, but it doesnt fit all of them! ..because none of them fit a Nano that I have seen on amazon & the only other one that says it fits a nano...does not.! what a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks sometimes","review":"if you are using this for your house. then it is very good and i would recommend it. ON THE OTHER HAND. if you are using the I Trip for your car or truck. it isnt the best by far. BUT if you have a device that can point your ipod at the stereo at all times then its kinda good. but for the average drives get a cassestte adapter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but you will sacrifice the sound quality...","review":"Both old and new iTrips work well, however, the 4026 is easier to tune to different frequencies. If you have a chance, buy the older iTrip 4014 instead of this 4026. The FCC ruling about FM transmitters changed how the iTrip works from 2004 to 2005. If you have a good ear for music you will notice the substantial drop in sharpness and separation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this thing","review":"Didn't work.Never work a single time. A cheating item.I bought this for my iPod.Nothing inside that object.Doesn't display anything.I took this to Radio Stack and those people laugh at me,because of the victim of cheating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this it's a waste of money","review":"I would give this a zero rating... This is the fifth of sixth one of these I have tried, none of them work. The sound always through with a background hiss both in my car and on my stereo. I found an $5 wire connector that works perfectly on my stereo, as for my car I bought a radio that connects directly to the I-pod... Griffin, Belkin, I-trip none of them work. Don't waste your time, and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Of all the radio transmitters I've used, seen in action, or heard about, this one is the best. Easily. I've had friends in other cars drive down the road nearly 40 yards away and hear the signal from my iPod crystal clear on their radio. It works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, not great","review":"This was really static-y on any radio I used. I now have an ipod video which this is not compatible with so I no longer use it any way, but wasn't thrilled with it while I did use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little item, simply great","review":"Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on. The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently.For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing.The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to original iTrip","review":"I had great success with the original iTrip until its connector broke. It provided great signal and stayed on securely. Purchased this one to replace it, and had tremendous difficulty keeping it connected when my iPod was in its iSkin. The slightest touch causes it to pop off and turn off. I understand that it's not Griffin's responsibility to make their FM transmitters fit with cases, but it seemed like an unnecessary and regressive change. Once I filed down the bottom, I was able to test it in my car. Unfortunately, when I set this iTrip to the same stations and put it in the same places I put the original, the reception is absolutely terrible. Along with this, there's a static blip that sounds between tracks. Overall, it's performance is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter is a poor product","review":"The range of iTrip is horrible - both in car and at home, worse than advertised. Found Monster FM transmitter (with iPOD recharge capability) in car to be a much better option. Still looking for something to use at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 functionality, 0 starts","review":"There's a reason this thing is on sale, and retailers are cutting the price now that Christmas is over... it doesn't work. I followed the instructions to the letter and tried it every which way but I get absolutely no sound; not poor sound quality, not poor reception, nothing. Dead air. And I live in a rural area, where the FM waves aren't exactly crowded. The teasers on the box make it sound easy, \\"simply plug it in, tune in the pre-set station, and listen to your iPod.\\" Yeah, it's simple alright, it simply doesn't work. So I simply returned it the same day I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I've been looking around for the right adaptor to be able to use my iPod in my car. I had a few problems with the iMonster system, so I thought I'd use iTrip.What a useless adaptor! There is constant static and if it's even the slightest bit loose it stops working. So, every speed bump, pot hole or other shift means it's not working. I've had it a couple of weeks and it's a constant annoyance. It's badly made and not useful for using your iPod in your car.Listen to the reviews and skip this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this POS","review":"This was a total waste of moneyDifficult to set up and when it was, you had to put the thing directly next to the radio to get any reception. And that reception was LOUSY.Avoid this product like it has fleas"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"After reading the 1st 2 reviews, I decided to give my own. In my car, the sound quality is somewhat better than AM stations, similar to the first review stated. I didn't expect an FM transmitter to give the same sound quality as a line-in device, but I did hope it would be closer to a normal FM radio station, which this new iTrip fails to do, IMHO. I also experienced static in around town, and it's true that I could try to look for another frequency that sounds cleaner, but that's a hassle to me when I'm driving. The design of the device is nice, but I wish it performed as nicely as it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"iTrip","review":"Don't waste your time with this item. The original iTrip is much better, but still not as good as a basic cassette adapter. Can never find a clear channel, the LX/DX does not make any improvement in the signal strength which is really weak coming out of the unit. The engrs that designed this thing really over compressed the sound - horrible range...AM is much better sounding. Stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little piece of hardware","review":"Handy little iPod gadget lets you turn your iPod into a localized FM transmitter so you can play your tunes on your radio. Easy to set up: just find a frequency on your radio, match it on the iTrip and press play on the iPod. No more burning CDs or overheating the iBook for tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got it right the first time","review":"I'm giving this thing two stars as my way of giving it the benefit of the doubt.I have a 3rd generation iPod. It came with a dock and four press pad buttons, in addition to its wheel interface.Anyway, though the new iTrip is supposeds to work with this generation of iPod it didn't, even if the connectors do match up.But, when I tracked down an original generation iTrip it worked great.So if you have the classic iPod I describe, stick with the classic iTrip and leave that LCD iTrip alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of garbage","review":"if you like static, get the iTrip.if you like wasting money, get the iTrip.if you like cheap flimsey plastic, get the iTrip.if you like buying products that don't work as they are hyped, buy the iTrip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about not much","review":"I love Charles Addams and everything he has ever done.

Que forma tan ingeniosa y unica de combinar la historia con la literatura. Este libro me cautivo desde la primera pagina. Catalina es un personaje cautivador que al principio le da entender a uno que no es nada mas que una niña sumisa que hace todo lo que sus padres o Andres desean, pero segun uno sigue leyendo se da cuenta que Catalina de sumisa no tiene un pelo. Es una mujer hecha y derecha que a pesar del machismo que la rodea se da a respetar y se da su lugar en el mundo de Andres y los que la rodean. Una fabulosa novela que recomiendo a todos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me quito el sombrero","review":"Es uno de los mejores libros que e leido. Angeles Mastreta tiene una manera tan sutil y la misma vez tan clara de burlarse del machismo. Su lenguage se admira por ser claridoso y tal como es. Una femenista que ense~a todas las caras de la moneda, desde la esposa enga~ada, la amante, el esposo que al querer pasarse de listo sale burlado. Sin ninguna hipocrecia Mastreta logra escribir un libro que llena al leector de animo, de emocion, y en veces de tristeza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem - oil never got hot.","review":"I just received this fryer for Christmas and it does not work. When the light went off, indicating the oil was ready to cook, I put the food in and nothing happened. When I checked the temp with a thermometer, it barely registered 100. After waiting for an hour, it still did not get above 200. I will be returning this one and trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice fryer but....","review":"Just pulled this fryher out of the box and hooked it up. forty minutes of frustration later I FINALLY got it to power up. Who's ever idea it was to put a magentic power cord on this thing needs to have his butt kicked.Seriously. I had to fiddle with the darn thing for 30 minutes -- the magnet wouldn't stick to plate and fell off every 10 seconds.Finally I had to wrap some black tape around the plug so it would stay in place via friction (you know -- the way 99% of all other appliance plugs work?I was tempted to box this up and return it but I think my solution will work long term.Not sure if I just got a weak magnet or if the whole thing is misaligned. I just don't see the point -- I guess if the fryer tips over the plug is supposed to pop lose. Okay. I get it.How 'bout just putting a trip switch like my electric heater?Sorry to vent. But if I had to do it over again I would choose a different model/brand based solely on the lame magnetic plug. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Deep Fryer","review":"While it does take 15 mins to heat the oil I find this more of a safety feature than an inconvenience.

The price is really good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fryer","review":"This is a great fryer for the price. I would have given it a 5 star rating if the basket was a touch bigger and a touch stronger. If you get to rough with the basket, the handle folds over and if you aren't paying attention you make a mess. I feed 5 or 6 people at a time which makes me have to do 2 baskets full to get everyone a serving to start. Other than that I really like the removable/washable tub so I empty it, store my strained oil in the frig for the next time and put everything away and don't have to worry about a messy clean up or the oil going ransid from sitting in the fryer between uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am glad I purchased the Hamilton Beach Coool Touch Deep Fryer.

Tried it out right away. Canola oil to maximum line. After 30 minutes the oil only reached 325 degrees F by candy thermometer that reads 210 in boiling water. All recipes call for temps of 350 or 375 degrees F. I wish someone made a deep fryer that tells you the exact temperature of the oil and gives you the freedom to raise or lower it as you add food or want to cool it down for something else. Sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job","review":"I don't use a fryer all the time, so wanted something small enough to store on a shelf easily and large enough that I would not have to make tiny batches of foods. This is a good balance. The outside stays completely cool and I like the way the basket handle raises and lowers the basket while the lid is open or closed. I also like the timer and the adjustable frying temp. The magnetic power supply cord takes some getting used to and stays in place if you don't breathe on it. All in all, a good product, I'd buy it again, and I thought the price was reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good!","review":"I've only used it once and that was yesterday; I made French fries. Everything worked very well; the oil heated up quickly and the basket is very easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the \\"ready\\" light isn't that iluminated and the window to view the food is small and gets steamy. My French fries turned out just fine.

As in most of the other reviews, I agree that it comes apart and cleans easily. The lid doesn't have a seal on it like my other cooker did which causes a little mess of its own. It started out cooking the food well (typically I usually just cook french fries) but it began to progressively take longer and longer to heat up and to cook as well. The other night it didn't heat enough to cook anything (Even though the ready light came on). I typically used this about once a week but it just didn't hold up. I haven't found my paperwork yet to determine if it's still under warranty. It's a nice unit for the price but it should have a seal on the lid atleast. I imagine that it may have held up better if I didn't use it as much But that's why I bought it was to use it. I hope this information helps in your decision to by a deep fryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold the temperature","review":"I purchased this deep fryer based on numerous good reviews, unfortunately my fryer doesn't hold the selected temperature. The first time I used this it worked like a charm, made golden brown delicious french fries in 15 minutes, now after the 6th or 7th use it takes atleast 25+ minutes to cook the same batch of fries which come out extremely greasy. My fries lovin family even commented on the greasiness as they ate that last fry. I'm reluctant to use the fryer now because of the added grease in the food, it's bad enough eating deep fried food, but when it's really saturated with oil it just way too unhealthy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two strikes and you're out","review":"I bought two of these. Unfortunately. The first one had a lid latch that was just misalligned enough that it would not catch the lid properly and would sometimes open on it's own.

Each two-page spread features one animal wearing some very inappropriate piece of clothing, accompanied by a quick explanation of why it's wrong for this animal to wear this particular article. For example, a kangaroo would find a coat with pockets \\"quite unneccessary\\" and a moose might find suspenders hard to \\"manage.\\" The illustrations are a particular delight; the animals have very droll expressions and the problems are depicted with some subtlety which will encourage dialogue during a read aloud.

There was no real funny jokes either , you know, like the ones Pauly Shore used in EVERY single movie of his! And Mr. Bean episodes didn't even have any funny themes like being stuck in a Bio-Dome for a year, no Cameo appearances as a Cokehead, no jury duty or joining the army scenes!, and why didn't have have a cool nickname like Weasel!?MR.

I promise you will laugh so hard your sides will hurt. However, be aware that there are some scenes in a handfull of the skits that you may find inappropriate for young children. Scenes like his being completely naked, from behind, at the swimming pool. Or when he is trying to adjust his tuxedo before meeting the queen and his finger ends up protruding through his zipper from inside his pants. You can imagine what that looks like. It's all done in fun but the visual image can be quite shocking for children, at least in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars for Bean; -4 stars for BUTCHERED episodes!","review":"How can A&E call this \\"The Whole Bean\\" when the episodes are all butchered down by about three minutes each? And what possible justification can they have for this? Surely there wasn't a problem getting the full versions from the BBC. Surely the extra minutes would have fit on these three discs. So why oh why did A&E screw up this long, long awaited Mr. Bean release? Incompetence is the only logical explanation. I'll wait until the BBC's own PAL discs show up on Amazon.co.uk and figure out how to play them then.

Obviously these were the episodes which were shown on commercial television (A&E) which needed to be cut in order to accomodate the commercials. This would not have been an issue had the BBC produced this series on their own. Luckily I was forwarned by reviews here and then received the proof when my friend purchased them. I am a big fan of Mr.Bean, but I will not compromise my standards just to satisfy a need. Companies need to realize that producing a sub standard product will not be tolerated. If Mr. Bean sells well (which it probably will) then this only enboldens such companies to release further truncated versions of films and television series. Wait for Mr. Bean to come on your local PBS station instead of catering to a company that does not care about the consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are NOT edited!","review":"Let me get this straight. These episodes are not edited. You are getting the episodes that originally aired in the UK. Let me explain. Those scenes that you are all used to seeing, such as the chair scene and the turkey weighing scene, are just extended scenes that were added onto the syndicated versions. Unfortunately, A&E ended up using the original broadcast version rather than the extended version for the DVD. So, they weren't exactly edited, they just didn't included the extended footages. I understand that they should have included those scenes as bonus features, but unfortunately, they didn't. But, I just want to make it clear that these episodes are not edited or anything. To answer a previous reviewer, nothing illegal was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good to fall asleep to","review":"Let me give you an example of how hilarious this dvd disk set is.... last night I wanted to watch something to fall asleep to and not put too much thought into and I saw my Bean set sittin there and I said \\"you know what, havent watched this in a minute\\" Big Mistake!

It's a bit like the old silent comedy stuff by Chaplin or Keaton. This set includes all 14 episodes of the show and some coll bonuses, like scenes from Atkinson's comedy sketches and interviews with Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. My favorite episodes are the one where he golfs all over town (Tee Off, Mr. Bean) and the one where he rides on top of his car in an armchair (Do-It-Yourself, Mr. Bean)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Bean - complete set","review":"I am very happy with this set....LOVE Mr. Bean!!!

Whenever they watch any of the DVDs, they laugh uproariously and continuously! They've brought the DVD set to family gatherings -- all the cousins crowd around to watch it, and the room is filled with laughter.Mr. Bean is somewhat of a simpleton, and the kids enjoy his childish sense of wonder and naughty pranks. He doesn't speak much, so the youngest children aren't bored with dialogue. The naked scenes of Mr. Bean are hysterical, and the kids are incredulous at his antics.

It's great. The packaging is perfect to store it, it's perfectly organized. I'm in the United States and I know that they aired Mr. Bean on PBS but I never knew when it was on so all I watched from Mr. Bean was on the internet. I don't know how much funnier it is with the \\"missing\\" parts but for me it's perfect like it is. The quality is great too...I wouldn't buy VHS just for the missing bits and get a lower quality video.

Hold on to those VHS tapes. This set is NOT complete","review":"First, let me say that Mr. Bean is a great character and is too funny. I bought the VHS tapes many years ago and have almost worn them out. I was thrilled when the DVD's came out.Now, for the bad news. If you have seen these shows before, and are a fan... you WILL be disappointed. There are edits in the DVD's. When I saw this I was so upset. I am trading this in at a book store and keeping the VHS tapes. I have emailed A&E, and have also read many reviews here and on the A&E web site (aetv.com). It seems I am not the only one disappointed in this DVD release. One can only hope that there will be a \\"RE-release\\" of a true complete Bean.Boo to those involved in this DVD - short change of a great thing!4 stars because it is \\"Mr. Bean\\" only.. not for this DVD set at all !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Mr. Bean","review":"I bought this series because I had really enjoyed Rowan Atkinson's performances in most of the Black Adder series. A friend warned me against it-- she thought the series was \\"stupid.\\" I can see her point but I thoroughly enjoyed quite a lot of it though. If you want plot, dialogue and character this series is not for you. If you can sit and enjoy plain slapstick then I highly recommend this boxed set.

The song used to be a classical one, not to say a cult song. Many of the original fans started to take military-like postures whenever they heard the first notes of this song. Not a very profound song, by the way; it is refering in a humoristic way to the African soldiers that killed other soldiers of whatever nationality their white bosses ordered them to kill. Much of the drama of Africans killing and being killed for European politics of power remains out of sight.Anyway, for many people this new, more rythmic version will have more appeal because it is more danceable than the original version. Still, it is a pity that it omits a large part of the original song.Apart for \\"Ancien Combattabt\\", the rest of this album is also worth listening to and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, fast ship","review":"Came quickly.

So the movements go skipping along without losing their gravity-and we do not get bored! I have always enjoyed recordings by Norrington (with all repeats included) Bruno Walter (very staid, validictorian, almost, but with glowing orchestral playing! ) and Toscanini (who of course, is fiery if with coarse recording quality) and I also enjoyed Gardiner's very well.

It tastes like sour milk water. If you have not had it before try it some where else before committing to a whole case.

By far the closest in taste to what I grew to love. I've tried the others, and they don't compare... this is the best and freshest tasting. I drink it at the gym or really whenever I can... Not to mention it helps a hangover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like dog breath","review":"First off, when I got my 6 pack of this stuff, it was VERY warm in my hand. I don't know if it was ruined in shipment, or whatever, but it smells hella funky. I asked my mom why it smells so off, but she says that's how it's supposed to smell, which is funny because I remember when I used to drink coconut water out of the coconut it didn't smell so weird.Second, I don't know if I ruined my taste buds by drinking ginger ale, but this does NOT taste like coconut water! I'll update my review in another, but honestly, I don't think I'm gonna grow to like this. I'm truly disappointed :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY an acquired taste","review":"I've never tried coconut water before, but heard it had a lot of potassium. I have a chronic disease that requires I supplement a lot of potassium so I thought I would try Zico. YUCK! I can't describe accuately what it tastes like, but it is not something I can drink plain. There is a taste that hits your tongue the minute you drink, but does not linger after it hits your tongue. The taste is not strong, so I just added it to iced tea, and cannot taste it at all in that. That's why I gave it 2 stars, for the potassium, and I can still drink it, just can't drink it without adding it to something else. I think adding it to juice would work fine, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acquired taste","review":"I strongly agree w/the reviewer who suggested trying a single serving of this before ordering a case. I had read great things about the benefits of coconut water but I found both the taste and the consistency to be extremely unpleasant.

The water has a strange smell and an awful taste. The previous two cases I ordered (before the plastic bottles came out) tasted great. I thought that just one of the drinks may have been bad but the entire case is the same; straight up nasty. I won't be ordering any more of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zico versus Naked and Vita","review":"So far I am not happy with the flavor and taste of Zico coconut water. I can only compare this to the Naked brand, which I enjoy, and the Vita Coco brand that I also like.Zico has less \\"freshness\\" to its taste, and the lingering after taste reminds me of the canned coconut water with bits of coconut that you find in the Asian section of the grocery store. For whatever reason, the smell is not crisp and fresh also.I have a hard time drinking the Zico straight, though it is fine in smoothies. I give the product two stars only because I can use it in smoothies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars - Seriously! ZICO? AMAZON? What are you doing?","review":"Bought the 12 pack thinking it is a great deal. The taste is VERY VERY BAD and BITTER. I don't know what to do with the remaining 11.

I took one sip and poured the rest down the sink.Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund on this order, but until Zico fixes their shipments I'd stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch ?? will not buy again","review":"Received the order from Amazon yesterday. I tried it this morning but could not get beyond the awful smell and taste. This must be a bad quality control because I had tried Zico at a local grocery store and the taste was pretty good to me, although I have to admit it was not as good as fresh coconut juice. Just tried the second bottle - same disgusting taste. Gave one to friends to try,they all agreed the taste was really bad. Glad I ordered only one pack (of 12); will not buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Cheated... All 12 of them were bad","review":"Received my package today and then tried drinking and the first one was bad.. tried second and third they were bad too.. it literally stinks very bad and cant even drink a single drop..

It's like comparing fresh squeezed orange juice and oj from concentrate....there's no comparison.

Do yourself a favor and pass on Zico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to like it but don't","review":"I've been drinking ZICO brand coconut water after yoga for a few years. My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available.

I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Overall decent taste, but not what I expected.

But my god. This is honestly the worst drink I have ever tasted, hands down. Tastes absolutely nothing like coconut. Or water. It tastes more like Satan's salty butt hole. Ok, I'm trying to be funny with the last comment, but I'm mostly serious. Saltiness was the only thing I could taste. It literally made me gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"tainted coconut water","review":"It's my first tme purchasing this brand of coconut water, but I have to give it a buyer beware rating.

I was so excited when my order came. I had some already in the fridge so it was cold. After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water. I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was. I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable. If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case. My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Honestly, coconut water is not going to be for everybody. My wife (Caucasian) thinks it tastes like \\"dirty water\\" and I can't disagree with her. I personally enjoy the taste as I've grown up on coconut water. I see this new coconut water trend being much like the Red Bull trend. People from Thailand and other southeast asian cultures were drinking that stuff for years and years before it got popular in the States.So back to the coconut water, yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, it comes out sort of brownish in tint. This is quite natural. Anyway, I've have Zico and Vita Coco, and for me it just boils down to which is cheaper at the moment.

First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of \\"natural flavors\\", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons:ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12).These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is ok as far as coconut water goes, but bottle designs suck!","review":"Coconut water tastes ok as far as bottled coconut water goes.

Wow, it made delicious coconut flavored rice! I will use this up in my rice maker, and may even buy it again expressly for that purpose! Less calories than adding coconut milk, and makes a delicious, coconutty flavored rice. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I do not taste the difference from Vita Coco","review":"I've tried Vita Coco and Zico, but I do not taste any difference between both.

I wanted to stick with the natural products and didn't want to buy the items in the plastic containers. So when Zico started to sell the water in the cardboard boxes again, I thought \\"all right, back in business\\". I agree with the most recent reviews that this product was awful. A couple were rancid and had to be dumped down the drain. The outer shipping box was damp. I hated the taste of the rest because even though drinkable, they tasted spoiled.

I was VERY disappointed to find that this coconut water has a strange scent that hits you as you go to take a sip, as well as a weird aftertaste. It's hard to describe...almost a metallic taste? Also sort of sour like others have said. Since I spent so much money on this stuff I really want to like it and want to at least be able to tolerate it, but I'm just not sure that I can force myself to do it. My husband agrees that it's not good and he won't drink it either. I've read that coconut water is good for your skin and can be used as a facial toner so if nothing else I may keep a few containers for that purpose, but chances are most if not all of this coconut water is going down the drain : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect treat!","review":"When I first tried the new chocolate ZICO, I loved it, but thought I was a little biased since I know all the amazing benefits of coconut water. SO the true test was with my 5 year old, the ultimate (and brutally honest) chocolate expert. It was in the evening, so i only let him have half the bottle, but no joke - he woke me up at 2am saying \\"mommy, i need more of that chocolate zico\\"...What a great option for us fitness moms out here! Thanks ZICO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious - some batch variation apparently","review":"My husband and I are training for a half marathon and picked these up as a healthier alternative to gatorade and a more convenient alternative to eating bananas (well, buying a bunch of bananas every couple of days, at least).We typically drink ours at room temperature, though it is also delicious cold/iced. Mainly, when I get back from a run, I don't really want something super cold and this product (as others have mentioned) is just fine not-chilled.The first box came a couple months ago and was nice, though only about 4 star nice. The flavor was a touch mild. We cracked open the new shipment yesterday and oh man, absolutely wonderful. The first batch was \\"yeah, this is coconut water\\" the new one is more like \\"oh man, just opened a coconut!\\"We will continue buying these since they are a great supplement to our longer distance training, but that is probably my only excuse since even with Subscribe & save they run about $1.50 each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coconut and Lime - O.N.E.","review":"Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste.

The taste is unique but great. I did a marathon in January and the chocolate Zico was my best friend during my training. Not only was it refreshing after my long runs, but I instantly felt rehydrated. I have told anyone that I meet to try it after long runs and they always come back and tell me how I was right. I have probably gotten at least 5 other runner's to be Zico drinkers :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"Similar to the ONE flavored option, I found this to be a bit too sweet, though not quite as much.

I felt a slight artificial flavor the moment I took the first swig. Having had organic tender coconut from nature, I feel Vita Coco comes the closest to the real one. Zico is not bad save that artificial taste probably due to the addition of extra electrolytes. It was definitely a good alternative to soda or Gatorade when you return from a game of soccer or baseball but not so good when you want a drink at home. I would suggest Vita coconut water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like plastic...","review":"While the plastic packaging seemed oh-so-convenient for me, when I opened the first bottle and took a sip- YUCK.

It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back!

It's very very mild and doesn't throw off the flavor or the experience, but is a little bit unsettling.

They use a heatless, high pressure system to pasteurize which is the way the market is trending.Guess Zico made a ton of money while on top so this stuff will still sell by sheer volume.

It tastes like funky dishwater. I'm having trouble getting the taste out of my mouth and enjoying the rest of my lunch.

Decent and looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad taste","review":"It does not taste like pure coconut water,Its taste like some drink with coconut flavour. I wouldn't prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs. they taste better than these bottled drink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I based my purchase entirely upon user feedback. It may be the packaging (non-hermetic) that is impacting the taste, but this product was simply bland. I reviewed the ingredients and is is reconstituted. Perhaps coconut looses flavor during the dehydration process. Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it. Off to the next brand..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate coconut water","review":"First and foremost I received my order right away.

The first shipment was fast and tasted great! On the second shipment, all of the tetra paks I've opened were bad. The water was not clear or sweet but a yellow and sour. I feel very mixed on this product from this seller since I've had mixed results in product. I'm not sure if there is anything they can do to ensure the quality of the product (maybe the 2nd shipment quality was due to lack of proper storing conditions?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite but good for you!","review":"Not sure if I would buy this again- Didn't really enjoy the taste but its good for you, and made my body feel good after a workout- Must have chilled, horrible room temp- It was ok for coconut water I suppose, interested in trying other brands :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zico coconut water","review":"I did not like the taste as compared to other brands of coconut water.

I bought it from safeway and was very satisfied with the flavor. Well I ordered this online and I gatta say I was VERY disappointed! 7 of the 12 boxes were rancid!

One or two I understand but this is unacceptable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed.","review":"This thing tastes like it has fermented and it was left a little bit longer it would turn into a local wine. I am surprised people who already used this product recommended this product with good things to say about the taste. Believe me if I were to choose between this one and a bitter Melon, I would go for the later one. We had guests over the day we received this product and offered it to them. They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit. I am just wondering now if I should even look at amazon reviews because this is a second instance where i was disappointed by trusting the reviews. I would guess it was the problem with the batch i received or something had changed in this product to not to match the review I read here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I love coconut water. To be more specific, I love GOOD coconut water. My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth, only slightly sweet and very refreshing. The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50% sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh. Goya runs a close second. I am not sure if it's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me. Coconut water should not taste sour. Despite the rave reviews, I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya. Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I was skeptical, hadn't found a flavored coconut water I liked.

Quenches your thirst, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good batch","review":"Starting off- I hate the taste of coconut water. I like coconuts, coconut milk and things that are flavored with coconut, but the water is aweful! I have been only drinking the chocoloate coconut water (which is mixed w/a little coconut cream), but at 110 calories and sugars added I decided that I need to expand my horizons. I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good! And while this doesn't taste like the chocolate coconut water (which tastes like slightly watery chocolate milk), this is pretty decent and I will continue my subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to ONE, Zico is way too inferior","review":"Been using ONE for almost two months.. I really like it.. It has subtle sweetness like coconut water does and tastes fresh and natural.. Always makes me feel fresh..Saw that Costco start selling Zico. Compared to 17$ that I have been paying for ONE through amazon, 14$ from Costco for Zico sounded a deal as I will use two 12-packs per month and bought a 12-pack.First impression: Does not taste natural. It has distinct made-from-concentrate taste.. Not sure why when it says it is natural.. No sweetness like ONE does... infact no taste at all.. Does not leave that refreshing feel... Even my 5 year old daughter said the same thing after taking a sip. Not impressed..I will stick with 17$ ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delish","review":"Love chocolate coconut water (even though I hate the taste of plain coconut water.)

It's the perfect post-workout drink. Not to mention it helps with recuperation after a night out. It truly is amazing stuff!Buying the 12 pack from Amazon is great because I have only been able to find it for single bottle purchase at organic groceries and health stores, where you pay a premium. It's been far cheaper to buy a case at a time and, if you set up automatic purchasing, you not only receive a new box without having to get online every few weeks, but you get a 15% discount off their regular price (which is already cheaper than buying at the local stores)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fermented/Toward Vinegar","review":"Maybe because I grew up in the tropics and know real taste of coconut water. I bought from a local grocery store. Tasted like the older coconuts with the thicker white meat, where the water is beginning to ferment. Subtle vinegar taste. But I guess it's not the real thing (direct from the young coconut). Maybe closest to the real thing? I don't know if there's a better one out there. But have tasted sweet coconut water from those asian markets that sell the whole shell but then again there is the debate of the shell being treated with chemicals so they don't brown. The inside itself is not affected so I heard, and that what matters is how you open and pour it. The real deal is the natural organic coconut direct from the coconut tree. If you can find one. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"not straight from a coconut","review":"The taste of Zico was growing on me and I really liked it but feel like I have been misled. Zico is now made from concentrate. I'm sure they mix it with filtered water and it's fine but it is not straight from a coconut as some of the other brands are. ie; I'm not going to buy orange juice from concentrate when I can get fresh squeezed for less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZICO WATER IS GOOD BUT NOT IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER!","review":"I love drinking Zico's coconut water. In camparison to all others, I find ZICO's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as I'm from an Island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage. HOWEVER, their packaging certainly makes a difference DO NOT purchase ZICO's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience \\"PLASTIC\\". ZICO's carton packing is much, much better!!! ENJOY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste like plastic","review":"I was excited to find ZICO on auto delivery, but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe.

It use to be so good!Cancelled my subscription today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Plastic Bottles","review":"I wish I could say that I loved this. I really do.

I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.N.E. and Vita). So the logical progression was to try the Zico Mango.ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. You can't taste the Coconut, but instead are overpowered with this terrible synthetic tasting Mango flavor that leaves a disgusting aftertaste that almost \\"stings\\" the back of my tongue. Like I said before, I am almost addicted to coconut water, and I hate to let things go to waste - but I couldn't even finish this bottle.After looking at the ingredients - Coconut water from concentrate and Natural Flavors.

Having come from a real coconut water drinking country (I mean coconuts off the trees), I know the difference in taste and Zico most definitely tastes like it is made of concentrate/extracts as opposed to being the real water! The only thing they have going for them are the number of celebrities they've managed to get hooked onto them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"from concentrate","review":"After trying the O.N.E. and Vita Coco coconut waters, the Zico does not compare, it has a heavier taste, not the refreshing, light taste coconut water should have.

This past weekend I went to a music festival and packed some O.N.E. coconut water instead, much MUCH BETTER. My Boyfriend also tried some of the Zico, but out of trying not to be rude didn't say anything...this past weekend when he drank the O.N.E. he finally spoke up and said, no offense, but this is WAY better than that stuff you gave me last week..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a little bit good","review":"I would have to absolutely agree with the reviewer that said to try this before you buy a case of it.

Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging.

But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible.

I sent this email to Zico but, strangely, they didn't replyHi Folks,I like the product and I buy a couple cases per month of the 11oz units. I do have a complaint though: Why do you bother to put that silver tab on the top? I thought it was to open the box, but I guess it must just be there to protect the plastic membrane underneath. At any rate, I always have to have a knife around to cut the plastic out. You can't just punch a hole in it because the plastic then prevents the liquid from coming out smoothly. It has to be cut out. And that is almost impossible to do without spilling some. And it's a pain in the ass.Come on, guys. It's 2012 and I know there are some companies manufacturing containers that are easy to open. For what you are charging, shouldn't it be a little easier to enjoy your product?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"I once bought a 12 pack at GNC. Buying them this way is certainly cheaper than stocking up on them individually. Well, GNC no longer sold them in 12 packs. I even went to Vitamin Shoppe. NOPE. So finally, I do a search on-line and find I can get them through Amazon. SCORE.This is an acquired taste and boy have I acquired it! You'll see all these ads for drinks \\"containing\\" only traces of coconut water. It makes me mad that they're falsely marketing products as coconut water. This is the REAL DEAL. This is as natural as it SHOULD taste. Zico is my FAVE coconut water brand. It's the best drink to hydrate with and beats those gatorades with their food coloring and added artificial sweeteners. You naturalists can't go wrong with this. Sample one first and it may be strange, but the taste will grow on you especially when this drink is served icy COLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discolored (yellow) !!!","review":"I've bought Zico many times before from Whole Foods, and I don't remember it being yellow! I started a subscription of this as well as the larger bottles of Zico.

I know they had a recall of many of shipments, but that is long over and this is not a recall item. It should be! I would say, stay away from Zico, or if you must drink, buy individually from the store instead of these cases! I am cancelling immediately...and would return this order too if I could!!!

Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts. It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories. I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.This chocolate flavor is excellent imho. It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.About me: I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give \\"5\\"-star reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"taste better than Vita","review":"actually surprisingly refreshing taste. served best when chilled. i like the Zico coconut water better than Vita, which tastes somewhat stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty","review":"I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted.

We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting. It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off. There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I luv Coconut water and have been drinking coconut water real fresh.

It seemed liked a good deal. The first shipment last month was great-all 12 \\"paks\\" were consistent in flavor and clarity. This month, however, the contents have led me to cancel all future shipments.Upon opening the box, I noticed a wet spot on the top although it seemed intact and untampered. There seemed to be no additional leakage and the expiration date was NOV '11. The first pak I opened had brownish coconut water that I had never seen before. The next one was paler and less acrid. Overall, the observation is that the coconut water was probably from different batches since the individual paks were different shades and degrees of sweetness/ bitterness.Other reviews have reported that coconut water is bitter, so if you like bitter drinks (healthier?), then you should get this product. There is not a sure way to determine if it's Zico or Amazon at fault, so use your own discretion."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes. It's my favorite drink. I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vita Coco is way better","review":"Love coconut water, really don't like this brand, kind of tastes like plastic.

Excellent substitute for Coke/Pepsi.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can never get the taste of the fresh coconut water.

We were ordering via \\"subscribe and save\\" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \\"from concentrate\\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \\"top dollar\\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \\"liquid\\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \\"subscribe and save\\" order.

I'm hit or miss with the fruit juice blended beverages of any brand. Along comes chocolate Zico. It doesn't seem right given the consistency and flavor of coconut water. Well, it is creamier in appearance than any other water or blend -- as it, well, should be. You wouldn't mistake this in a glass beside the plain variety. The flavor is rich, very cocoa and in surprising harmony with the coconut core of it all. I enjoy it because it tastes more like a treat than the regular and goes down smooth just in case I really need the hydrating lift! You've done juice blended coconut waters. Now try this. Be careful of price they really shouldn't be more than twenty dollars per case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Love the Larger Bottles","review":"I love this coconut water, (I also purchase VitaCoco cases at least 1-2 times a month). This coconut water is my husband's favorite, so we always have it in the refrigerator. Our family doesn't purchase soda, and now with the coconut water, we don't buy sports drinks, either! It's great to rehydrate, take to the gym, etc. And a liter is the perfect size-- I always found myself drinking at least 2 of the smaller ones so this is a more economic option.The items shipped fine, arrived in great shape.

I would recommend seeing this with a group of people lots of alcohol and no regrets about losing an hour and a half or so of your life.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliding Doors With An Edge","review":"The other reviews here surprise me; I thought this was well written, well-paced, well acted, edgy, funny - and a slightly softer version of the movie Closer, which got great reviews but was rather uninspiring in all ways, If you liked I'm With Lucy - you'd probably like this - It is offbeat, realistic (sad or funny to say) and shows you how one wrong move, one errant kiss can be a pivotal bad call that sends you, and everyone around you in an emotional spin, forever changing the course of your life....Sort of a psychic string theory thing.Worth it just for the \\"Why can't you love me' scene and the (bizarre) three wakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for stirring","review":"Wok stirring or around contoured pan bottom edges. For stirring but edge can slide under food, too. Quality smooth surface, quite sturdy--cannot possibly break."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I wanted this book because I found out the real author is actually one of the most wonderful men in the world. I won't say who, because he used a psyuedonym probably for a reason. Anyways, this book made me laugh, cry, blush, and throw it at a wall (which means you know it's good.) It's basically horribly written gay smut, though the plot, which can't take up more than sixty pages is actually really interesting. When I say 'horribly written' its like the first time someone tries to write porn and makes it too graphic, though in this book it adds to the charm. I highly recommend this book even if it is so expensive. It does amuse me because it has a survey at the back where it asks for your sex and it says 'we assume you are male.' Girls (like me) can love gay porn too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Sudzer Soap","review":"Excellent product, my grandchildren love this soap in a little sponge holder when they bathe. I will continue to buy this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There was this song im my dream...","review":"...and I asked someone who the singer was. She told me \\"John Fowler\\". Never heard of him, but, I wrote it down when I got up the next morning. For the heck of it I checked internet for the name and there was a CD. Was the song on it? Actually I remembered the name of the singer but not the song so I can't be sure. One is a good bet for what was playing, but even if not, the singer is good, probably a locally popular performer. It's what I call non-commercial music - that's not meant as a put down. Nicely done Irish folk songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"I've been a Supergrass fan for years now and am so disappointed that they broke up. This album is fantastic - probably because it's a real album that you can listen to start to finish and every song is great. I personally love the different sound that they created on this album despite it being more 'melancholy' than their earlier stuff. It's the album of theirs that I turn to most frequently on my iPod...definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change Of Direction - Good Decision","review":"Not your typical Supergrass album in that there isn't really a standout, radio single on the album. This is more of a Sunday morning / 'road' trip through the countryside album that has the group maturing their sound and showing their musical talents in a subtle but easy to embrace sound. If you are looking for a catchy, danceable song; the first song might entice you. Parts of the song have a little bit of a Franz Ferdinand sound. And \\"Coffee In The Pot\\" has a silly, happy-go lucky Russian wedding ditty feel to it that only Supergrass could pull off. But for the most part \`Road To Rouen' is a smooth, somewhat moody album that might take a few listens to warm up to. The warmth is worth the wait though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine ...","review":"The music of supergrass have grown up with me. I discovered their music when I was in my teens and have stayed a fan throughout the years. I loved I Should CoCo along with everyone else and the less popular In it for the money. I loved the self-titled Supergrass as well, particularly the song \\"Moving\\".Road to Rouen has re-ignited my passion for their music. \\"St Petersburg\\" is one of my favorite songs at the moment...I feel Supergrass have stayed true to themselves and in a way, had chosen to shun the super stardom some bands had arrived at only to lose themselves (Coldplay, though I still like them). The genuine love they have for their music and the obvious fun they have in making it is evident in every album....The best part is, they don't take themselves too seriously and therein lies the charm of Supergrass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Slow Supergrass Never Hurt Anyone","review":"One of my favorite band's personally, with this cd on the first listen you like it a lot but then your like \\"wait...what was that, i'm listening to that again right now\\". I have many cd's and not many I know do that so Props To !SUPERGRASS! I really hope they keep making music it's like the best pop music i've ever heard that has great thought behind it.Not One To Miss Out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supergrass maturing","review":"This has become my favorite Supergrass CD. It certainly has the best production values and clearly shows how the band has grown as musicians. If you only know Supergrass from \\"I Should Coco\\" (great album), you wouldn't think it's the same band. This is definitely more mellow than their previous releases, particularly St. Petersburg and Tales of Endurance, but the title track shows off a harder edge. The collection has a certain mood to it - the kind of disc to listen to on a long drive at night or a lazy Sunday afternoon at home. If you have the chance, see them live - I saw them play these songs before I got the album and they're better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Grass","review":"Secate li se velicanstvenih '90., kada su scenom vladali Blur, Pulp, Oasis i Supergrass?Pulp nazalost vise nepostoje, Oasis postoje ali bolje da ne jer posle albuma Be Here Now nista dobro nisu uradili, Blur se jos uvek dobro drze, a tu su i Supergrass koji su se vratili sa albumom Road To Rouen.Supergrass definitivno su se odaljili od pop forme, i na ovom albumu nema ni jedne catchy pesme osim instrumentala Coffee In The Pot, ali melodicnosti svakako ima.Beskrajno nezan i iskren, ovaj album zasluzuje vasu paznju. Jedan od najboljih izdanja koje nam je pruzila ova godina."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet.","review":"Well its nice to see there is still music around thats not marketed to sell, that said, it would be nice if this album was marketed and actually promoted by the their record label a bit more instead of being shunned from the spotlight which it rightly deserves.This is the best Supergrass album yet, and is a nice improvement over \\"Life on other planets\\" which seemed to be a bit lacking in focuss when it came to the songs.This is an essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charted Designs","review":"These designs can be easily be adapted for needlepoint, latch-hooking, counted cross-stitch, crochet, or knitting. The motifs include birds, flowers, animals, toys, fruits, vegetables, buildings, old-fashioned scenes, and more. The book gives instructions for determining how large a finished design will be and each of the designs suggests colors to be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive Supplement to Needlework Library -- Motifs","review":"This is an interesting book in that there are very few photos of the completed pieces - only the photos you see on the front and back covers (photos printed on inside of covers, too)! The book is filled with hand-drawn black-and-white charts on 10ct grid, three to five charts per page. Similar motifs are grouped together. There is a symbol key with color suggestions, but no DMC or Anchor numbers. The designers encourage you to experiment and substitute colors.Most of the charts are fairly simple in shape and color scale. They are sweet, but not cutesie. When I use the book, I make several working copies and color the symbols in with colored pencils to get a feel for how the finished design will work. This is an inexpensive and interesting way to get a variety of motifs to stitch, and may be useful as a supplement to your stitching library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant fun!","review":"Great for girls around the age of 7 - 11.

Very good family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Disappointing","review":"This movie wasn't sure what to do. It didn't have very good relations to any of the books. Maya Ritter wasn't the best choice for Molly, even though she looked the part. In the books, Molly is very cheerful, but not in the movie. The best parts had the Emily and Mr. McIntire in them, because they did a fantastic job of portraying their parts. After the terrific Samantha and Felicity movies, this was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst One Yet","review":"This Molly movie was very upsetting compared to the Samanatha and Felicity movie. It was nothing like the book and disappointing to me, a BIG Molly fan. The actress does look like the doll, but doesn't have Molly's charactics. She isn't at all as cheery as Molly and is stuck-up. I would purchase the Samantha and/or Felicity movie instead. If I could, I'd rate this without any stars at all. Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front is a waste of you time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't follow the storyline in the book","review":"I caught the last half of this movie on TV and was disappointed that the movie didn't follow along with the book. Molly gets sick in the book and is unable to dance in the Miss Victory recital but in the movie she isn't sick. In the book, she is at home sick while her family is at the recital and her daddy comes home from overseas. In the movie, he appears backstage after her performance. Molly and her sister hide a Christmas package their father sent until Christmas day in the book but in the movie, their father passes out the gifts in the family's living room.The acting was nice, the costumes were excellant and the backdrop was well executed. If you can get over the fact the show strayed from the book you'll be able to enjoy the show. Personally, I liked the book's portayal of events better. It shows what would happen in real life, not in an ideal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"No movie on DVD --- How disappointing for grandchild at Christmas","review":"In November I ordered the American Girl movie \\"Molly\\" from Jonathan Zuchowski for a Christmas gift.

It held everyone's interest - and at the moving end of the film, the two youngsters gave their dad a big, spontaneous hug. There are lessons and values, but Molly is never preachy. The acting is first rate - performances range from spirited to deeply touching. And there's genuine humor. The writing is especially wonderful. We all responded to the way in which the characters interact and grow. The oldies in our group were as captivated as the kids, and the youngsters grasped and responded to the movie's serious themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, entertaining movie","review":"This is another great American Girl movie. Not only are American Girl movies entertaining they teach values and morals in a non-preachy, fun way that girls can understand.

The widescreen presentation is great (1.85:1 Aspect Ratio) and the full-screen version is good too. Check this movie out. This movie is more suitable for younger audiences than the other C&C movies.

The authors work closely with human rights activists on the ground in Colombia to monitor the military impunity throughout the nation. You almost don't want to believe the contents of this book. Colombia is a lovely nation with wonderful people but the leadership of the nation has not shown the courage to end the lawlessness in its ranks.

In his early days, he put classical-music shadings into popular songs and performed them with lightning speed, creating jazz piano with real bite and texture. The tunes are comfortable and familiar, but there's also a lot of fun stuff going on if you're willing to listen deeply. For example, \\"Dancing on the Ceiling\\" contains passages from Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony, \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" alternates between classical and pop stylings, and \\"Yesterdays\\" glides back and forth between major and minor interpretations of the theme.

You can see Dr. Smith as a cold, calculating saboteur, before he became a prissy sissy in later episodes. The Jupiter 2 is drawn into an unfamiliar spacecraft. Dr. Smith is brave about exploring it because he thinks the ship belongs to his co-conspirators. His bravado disappears when he realizes his error. It's said that the LIS movie took a lot from this episode. I would agree. This episode, and the one before it and after it are very good. Almost straight Sci-Fi, and not a talking carrot in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Space with the Robinson family.....","review":"I have been a fan of this show since the beginning. So far this is the only episode of \\"Lost In Space\\" that I own. I specifically sought it out, remembering it as a child watching it on CBS back in the 60's. This one of those unique episodes that plays as great now as it did back then.This episode came along when LIS was in the early stages of its existence...before the campiness and onslaught of walking / talking vegetables which turned the show into a joke in the eyes of some viewers. In this story you'll catch a glimpse of the true potential the show had in the beginning. It contains a good solid story plus many shots of the Jupiter 2 spacecraft in flight - something I wished viewers like me could have seen more of.There are still good episodes out there after \\"The Derelict\\" but you'll need to sift through them. This one gets an A+ from me....make sure you are strapped into your seats for this stellar adventure sci-fi fans!

While I have come to respect Nelly as one of the greatest artists of our time, as a beverage producer, he leaves much to be desired.The drink is a scary neon green, and while it's not terrible (I haven't thrown the remaining two out), it isn't particularly good.

I've never been a big rap fan, but I heard about it when it first came out. The reviews on many beverage rating sites were positive, so I decided to try a case. I was pleasantly surprised!The taste is great, (sort of an apple jolly rancher flavor) and it gave me a boost when I needed it. Also an excellent mixer for \\"adult\\" beverages, if you're over 21.

It reads like what you might get if you asked a typical IR undergrad's thoughts: short, confused, abstract, littered with unnecessary and oh-so-intellectual neologisms. And the book literally has no point. He does not describe how he came up with his 3 categories of state (pre-modern, modern, post-modern), how we move from one state to another, or just his neo-Whiggish assumption the post-modern (European, of course) state is the inevitable end-product.A waste of time, another piece of waste-paper in the contemporary IR debate. Put it beside the rest of the one-track-minded garbage of Huntington, Fukuyama and Kagan.. (And I think of the Cold War generation of IR writers and intellectuals, Raymond Aron, George F.

I'd expected Logitech to make better stuff than this!However Logitech wowed me with excellent customer service. I called the support number given on their website for warranty service (866-291-1505), and they offered to replace it with their Freepulse Wireless Headphones.

I am very careful with these headphones and one day I noticed they were way too loose. So I took them off and noticed that they were started to snap down the middle. I glued them with super glue but that wore away and they stopped working all together. I tried regluing them but they are very fragile now and now much use to me since I wear them while working out. These are WAY too expensive to have such a major defect. BUYER BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly thought out","review":"I have been able to thwart the hairline cracks and breaking band with tape. That is fine.However, these headphones act like a hyperactive child. The non-stop loud beeping has made them basically unusable to me. They beep when you turn them on and then don't actually come on (with another beep) until you actually play something. They beep every 20 seconds when there is nothing playing -- even though they automatically turn off. They beep when being turned off.I've contacted Logitech tech support and they have confirmed that there is no way to disable this beeping. They are now at the bottom of my desk drawer, forever.Update: I wish I could downgrade these to 1 star.

The only criticism I have of Wambaugh's writing is that he intersperses quaint/trite little comparitives like \\"more complicated than Lebanese politics\\" so much in the story that often it distracts from the intensity of the story, and leaves you wondering just how much more of the compelling story was written with tongue in cheek."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must-read if you went to Upper Merion.....","review":"I went to Upper Merion, the school where all this nastiness took place. When these books were released and the requisite mini-series came out, a number of the characters were my teachers. If you know the people, it is interesting to see the liberties taken in the way they are portrayed.... and if you are looking for a handbook of trite and cliche detective lingo, this book is for you. It is a shame that this horrible crime was not documented by a book of better quality, but what are you going to do? It is an inexpensive book and worth exactly that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tattered phrases; interminable progression","review":"I began thinking this book was a parody of a detective novel and then found I just had to finish it to find out exactly what drove Mr. Wambaugh to fall so far from the excellence of his watershed book, The Onion Field. I never discovered his motivation, but stand convinced that this work is over-researched and poorly presented with a combination of well-worn detective book phrases and redundant event coverage. I cannot recommend this book to any serious reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"not well-written","review":"I can't really evaluate the topic since it's all true, but I found the author to be a bit too wordy for my personal tastes and I did find the book slow (due to his writing style, not the topic). This surprised me because apparently he is a best selling author. Also, I was a bit put off by the author's sarcasm, I didn't feel it was appropriate given the weight of the story and it felt disrespectful to the deceased. As a forensics buff I enjoy true crime. The story itself was downright bizarre, but it just goes to show you anything can happen in this world; there is so much evil out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be his best book;","review":"many reviewers have said so. The book is about two sociopathic mass murderers interacting with each other. The first third is about what they do and think. Just when I thought the top of my head was going to come off, focus shifts to detectives who are trying to put the crazies behind bars--good instinct on Wambaugh's part. The book reads like a \\"Dragnet\\" script--\\"just the facts, Ma'am, just the facts\\"--but in a curious style: \\"Dragnet\\" scripted by Phillip Roth or Terry Southern. The eye for detail that Waumbaugh ascribes to one character is his own, and a sharp eye it is, too. References to literature show he's done his reading. Reading this book is like sliding down a razorblade; there's blood all over, but you don't feel a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying True Crime","review":"This account contains too many poorly drawn victims and perpetraters, all of which the author claims are beyond stupid. It makes for frustrating reading that, without at least one intelligent central character, lacks tension and suspense. Instead of an intriging chess match of worthy and fascinating opponents, it reads like a dark version of a Keystone Cops/Three Stooges caper that grows very tiresome about half way through the book. I am surprised so many readers found these people interesting and that the author who is so obviously contemptuous of the all his subjects (the manipulated as well as the manipulators) could sustain his interest long enough to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Curry Ever","review":"If you're an Indian curry lover, this item is for you. It is fairly easy to make, needing just water, yoghurt and butter. The spice mix takes a while to mix into the yoghurt but the effort is well worth it. Also don't take the directions of weight or volume for the yoghurt or water or butter too seriously. If you add too much, chances are you'll have more gravy and might need extra salt. If you add too little, you'll have thicker gravy that you can dilute anytime with water. The flavor is extremely good, very aromatic and buttery and goes very well with Basmati Rice. I also like onion rings with this special curry dish and I find it adds more flavor. Highly recommended for its ease of use and yumminess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encyclopedia Brittanica","review":"The merchant advertised the entire set but only sent volume R.

My wife and I read the book and went to a recent Imago workshop run by Rick Brown. While the book has some very nice insight and may help some troubled couples, much of it is untestable conjecture and post-fact explanation based on the author's opinion. To blame everything on one's parent's and chilhood has gotten a bit old for the post-Freudian generation.

It captures the reader. More importantly, for those who don't know about Haiti in the past or present, it captures a period that is essential to understand. The book conveys the barbarity of a time before Jean Bertrand Aristide came to power. After coming to power, he was soon ousted. The state sanctioned horror of that time comes alive through the author's travails. It also serves in giving us an understanding of the character of the man that became the center piece of history in the last fifteen years in her personal interaction with the former president in ways no author has.

In it, police work is definitely a team acitivity. Lead detective of the Rutherford, MN, police department, Jake Hines is presented as hard-working and self-aware, able to use both his intelligence and forensics to solve murders. The novel features many attractive characters including his boss, chief of police Frank McCafferty; county coroner Adrian Pokornoskovic (\\"Pokey\\"); and crime techs Trudy Hanson and Jimmy Chang. Ms. Gunn has a positive gift for creating believable characters in just a few sentences of indirect characterization. She handles the first person male narrator adeptly. Her sense of place is above average. The plot involves gruesome murders, apparently the work of a serial killer. The violence is not graphic. There is a neat surprise ending, but it had been adequately set up with appropriate clues.

It pretty much just gives the top level, and page after page of printouts of Linux kernel source.For me, this adds very little value, so the book is worth very little to me.

With such prominent authors I was expecting more than a rehash of O/S and IPC concepts with generous reprints of un-annotated source code. Yes, I can read C code and they did say the book was for those well versed in reading C. However, if I wanted to take the time to read and understand the source code myself then I wouldn't have bothered spending $70. The book does at least give a good idea of exactly which pieces of code do what. However, this book is a far cry from Richard Stevens' books (My Hero !, R.I.P.)At most I would feel comfortable with paying $20 for this book for reference purposes and because of the nice hardback binding.Overall, the book is pretty pathetic and the authors should be embarrassed to have ther names associated with it.

My heart sank when I saw how thick the book was and when I then saw there was a 4th book coming...Then I started reading the book. With this installment the author seems to have lost her sense of balance with story telling. Most of this book (3/4) seems to be about Mikhyel and his tangled relationships. In the end I gave up on this book.

That or the \\"author\\" has worshiped at the alter of the idiot John Grey for so long that their mind has turned to mush. Don't waste your time, and more importantly, money on this.The worst part is that it has NOTHING to do with persuading anyone to do, or think, anything. There is nothing about debating in here.

It is supposed to curl and straighten. However, it was extremely difficult to use for curls : you have to hold a section of hair out with one hand, turn the iron half-way,wrap the section of hair around the iron, turn the iron half-way again, while you continue to hold the remaining portion of the section of hair with your other hand. Very hard to maneuver for the front of your head, absolutely impossible for the hair on the back of your head. Instead of curls, I ended up with crimps and bends. This iron should only be used by professionals on their clients. I would never recommend it for individual use. Considering the high price ($160.00), this was truly a waste of money. Luckily, I was able to return it to the vender for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have taken Guru's advice:","review":"First reviewer was spot on.

Oh, the credits don't come out and SAY that the film was edited by Sasquatch. But from the best I can tell, Sasquatch edited the film, using a blunt instrument. Maybe a tree trunk or smooth rock.I also learned that Sasquatch has X-ray vision and can dodge bullets. This leads me to believe that Sasquatch is the love child of Superman and Chewbacca.

This poorly edited and written excuse for a movie (complete with frame jumps and atrocious acting) will have you screaming (at yourself for renting it) all the way back to the video store.

Poor Lance Henriksen, usually a decent actor, is just as bad as the rest of the no-star cast, playing a genetic executive who is looking for his daughter (and an important genetic machine, too) after her plane goes down in the Northwest. He assembles a team which includes Andrea Roth as a supposedly sexy rival and a horrible Phil Granger as a supposedly expert tracker.

Characters are all very one dimensional and badly acted, though I don't think even a good actor could have spoken this dialogue and made the characters seem real. The characters do nothing to grab your attention, in no way will you feel for them as people. When they die, there is no satisfaction in seeing them die because the movie does not even succeed in that sense. If you can't get the audience to feel bad for the characters at least you can let them laugh at their deaths (like Final Destination tried to do though not a good movie either). You just don't care when you watch this movie. I can't imagine how anyone can see anything of value in this movie. Terrible plot, terrible characters, I could go on but there really is no point.

The story in the film advances 2 months and Enter-stalk mode! Am I the only one tired of \\"stalking\\" and no action? I just wasn't scared... Throughout most of the film, Bigfoot roams around the woods staring at everyone and making noises. By the time Bigfoot gets to the killings, as a viewer, I lost interest.

It wasnt bad, but being an amateur researcher on the actual legend, I wasnt all that impressed with it for several reasons:The editing was bad, the creature itself at the end was nothing like eyewitness descriptions, it wasnt even the same makeup they used for the glimpse shots of the creature in most of the film.

Clarke, is a startling and speculative look at the ultimate destiny of mankind. It begins by answering (or seeming to answer) the question of \\"are we alone?\\" The book proceeds plausibly enough by beginning with the arrival to earth of intelligent aliens who are as far advanced over mankind ethically as they are technologically. The book at first seems to end its speculation there, but there is far more to come. My only criticism is that Clarke's vision of our future is not uplifting, and is frankly somewhat depressing. Paradoxically, this does not take away from the quality of the novel. While many books are called \\"classics,\\" this novel really is one.This is a classic novel of intelligent speculation that belongs in every science fiction afficianado's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Buck Rogers tale.","review":"A classic.

There were so many characters they were hard to keep them all seperate from each other. The time lapse was also another thing that confused me. First we the Overlords, then we meet Stromgren and Wainwright and then they die. It's like each chapter there's a whole new set of characters! I mean to me this book was too far out there. My personal opinion of Science Fiction that I don't care for it. I think if you do get into Science Fiction this would probably be a good book, because a lot of my fellow peers liked it. Personally it's a matter of whether you like Science Fiction or not. I give Arthur C. Clarke credit for the many books he wrote, but this book to me was a waste of 2 weeks. My experience with Science Fiction is also very little, but I know enough to never read this book or any other Sci-fi books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur needs to get over himself","review":"This \\"classic\\" was a disappointment. First the events were too fantastic, too far fetched even for science fiction and too hard to swallow,..etc. Again and again through out the book, Arthur demonstrates that he has this British Empire superiority complex.

Not, really...the book says that man's future is not in the stars.All in all, I can see why Clarke wants to distance himself from the views presented in this book...so why did he write it at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childhood's End: What a weird book...","review":"The novel \\"Childhood's End\\" has been a disappointment to read. I say this because the novel starts off strong and exciting and finishes off weak and boring. In the beginning of the novel, the author kept me wondering what would happen next. Towards the end of the middle section of the book, I perhaps became tired, which explains why it seemed to me, the story began to lose its mood and started to make me not want to read anymore. This only got worse as the book came to an end. The story started to drift away from the human race and more into the Overlords, and eventually into a whole new character called the Overmind. In my opinion the adding of a new character, a couple of pages before the end of the book was not a very good idea. I don't recommend this book to a reader who has not read many science fiction books, because the book is a bit difficult to engage in, while it is very easy to disengage and stop reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beginning (you start with the UN?!), sad middle, very disturbing end","review":"Having loved 2001 and the sequels, I was very interested to read another book by Clarke. Until around page 21, when I realized there was going to be some kind of message in the book. Authors sending me a message usually = the plot is going to suck. Long story short--this book shows us what Clarke's idea of what a great afterlife it would be without a God. Oh, and if we all give up our individuality. So some Socialist undertones to the rampant Atheism throughout. And to those who say there's no pro-Atheism, anti-religious bias in the book? Take a look at humanity's \\"assistants\\" through the process. Subtle Arthur, very subtle. Ditch this waste of paper, and save yourself about 3 hours of wasted reading, and 1 to 2 hours of rampant depression after finishing it--this is the most depressing thing I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an ending!","review":"Throughout my experience in reading Childhood's End by Arthur C Clarke life started normally on Earth and then took a dramatic turn when the Overlords came, that changed everything on Earth. As humans began to adapt to the sudden change life went back to normal.The beginning of the book started off with no real excitment and then later on the excitment began to grow. Soon the excitment began to disappear as I reached the end of the book which ruined the book because it all happened so fast. The ending was unclear and left you questioning things. I would not recommend this book because it is not one of those sci-fi books that makes you want to keep reading, and this book leaves you questioning in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intresting means so many things","review":"The word 'intresting' is often used when trying to be kind, and still give an opinion,my opinion of this book is the same. I did, in all honesty, find certain parts of the book to be fascinating and thought provoking. However, I was deeply disturbed by the author's view of society,and by the way that he thinks - the evidence being the story in the book itself. I was horrified at the ending, and repulsed by so many of the points made by the book. I found the entire read extreemly, almost intinctively disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childhood's End","review":"Being forced to read this book, I thought it stank. I mean, who wants to read a book about aliens, opps i mean Overlords, taking over the earth and turning the children into robots who cannot think for themselves. A lot the the book was confusing and just weird to read. The indivisuaily of the Overlords and the children is taken away. You can't tell one Overords from another and the children have no human capabilities. They aren't even human anymore don't get to lead a normal life. And the fact that Clarke is questioning Christianity is just wrong. You can't write a book that goes against one faith. Why didn't Clarke write about Buddism or something else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Clarke's best, that's for sure.","review":"Although short (218 pages of text) this book is fantastic and it posts some, lets say \\"philosphical\\" questions: The idea that science can't explain what's beyond our common understanding of the Universe has some truth on it. The description of the places is greate. I specially like the description of the two dimensional world. What I didn't like was the fate of mankind, but it's O.K. (we know that that's not gonna happen !!) It is good to know that somewhere in the book reads: \\"The opinions expressed on this book are not those of the author.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading, spookily realistic.","review":"Childhood's End is a grim tale about mankind's first contact with aliens. The plot unfold's itself towards the very end, with only brief insights into the true nature of the alien's mission on Earth. As the story unfolds, I was surprised by the many twists and turns in the plot. The ending is incredibly emotional, and Clarke brings the reader right into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"Imagine this: suddenly, a lot of alien spaceships comes to earth. They stay airborne for a while, but then they land, the aliens steps out and they look like the devil himself. A great number of bad looking aliens have landed and what do you think manking is doing about it? Read and find out.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Clarke is not a master of insight into the human soul, and \\"Childhood's End\\" reflects that soullessness. There is not anything here worthwhile enough to redeem this tedious paean to the New Age philosophies. If you want to read Clarke at his best, look at 2001. It's far more readable than Childhood's End, and has the added advantage of not aspiring to silly philosophies that ultimately can't be substantiated"},{"rating":"2","title":"an extraordinary novel","review":"Arthur Clarke cannot be praised for his literary skills nor for the relatively shallow and underdeveloped characters in all his books. This is book is no exception, but it has other merits that make it one of the best sf novels ever.Alien \\"overlords\\" (with an interesting physical appearence, no less) arrive at earth and take over humanity. Under their ruling, all known great problems of humanity (war, poverty, discrimination etc) disappear and earth finally becomes something close to a paradise. Sounds interesting? No matter what, it is impossible to guess the stunning unforgettable climax towards which the novel slowly builds up. The scale of Clarke's theme is of cosmic proportions. A must read for every sci-fi lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SF Ever","review":"\\"Childhood's End\\" is often called of one the best science fiction stories of all time. I am a huge science fiction fan, and after reading this book, I will gladly call it THE best.Clarke is somewhat unusual among science fiction writers in that he a brilliant technique in addition to his brilliant ideas. The utter realism and plausibility of his fiction is striking, and in the case of \\"Childhood's End,\\" frightening.It's fascinating to see how well this story, written in the 1940s, holds up without being dated. Only the occasional reference to radar ranges or the predominance of radio makes Clarke's work seem less than contemporary. The great similarities to the TV miniseries \\"V\\" and the blockbuster film \\"Independence Day\\" make one wonder why Clarke has not sued for plagiarism.This is a well-written, thought-provoking, thoroughly engrossing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the greatest Sci-Fi Novel","review":"This would probably be my pick for the #1 Sci-Fi novel. It would certainly be in my top 10 list, which would include books like Dune, Starship Troopers, The Forever War, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Uplift War, and so on.In this captivating and poignant book, the human race comes to a bittersweet ending by evolving into a strange, communal intelligence, thereby leaving the limitations of isolated corporeal minds behind. The Overlords, who have reached the pinnacle of \\"individual\\" evolution, and whose minds are perhaps a hundred times more powerful than a human's, are memorable characters. If you only read one Sci-Fi book, this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still thinking about it...","review":"Clarke is officially my favorite sci-fi author. He makes me feel like a slug. A slug with aspirations!!!! If you like being put in your place, you'll love Childhood's End. Also, check out Rendezvous with Rama. You'll feel like an unnoticed slug that a gardener flicks away with his spade while planting new bulbs. We're not worthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Arthur Clarke: great scientific mind and great writer. In my opinion his greatest virtue is the quality of his work which does not have the ups and downs of other writers, even those that \\"play\\" (i.e. write) in his league. In this respect, \\"Childhood's end\\" is another great story. He had my total respect ever since I stumbled upon his \\"2010:Odyssey 2\\" 26 years ago (yeah, I read 2010 before I even knew that 2001 was his, what can you say, teenagers, right??) and I can honestly say that I feel his abscence. Anyway, enough with the personal stuff, bottom line is if you like science fiction, you have to read Arthur Clarke's work and \\"Childhood's end\\" is as good a start as any..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still enjoyable","review":"I finally got around to reading this on a business trip, common for most of my Clarke books. For some reason, his writing style is perfect reading for travel... I've heard from many that this book has too many characters and too many stops-and-starts. I suggest this book be approached like Bradbury's \\"Martian Chronicles\\": different short stories centered around a common theme. In fact, I believe at least two of the chapters were also presented in short-story format in other Clarke collections(?). A central message is there, but Clarke has chosen to take a wandering path instead of a straight one. He DOES get there, however. Also, this book has an surprisingly epic scope; surprising because it only has about 250 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood'sA Fascinating , Mind opening & Heart warming book","review":"The summer returned in the midle of Tehran winter when I felt this book in my hand . A great story that gave me a pleasent trip to another dimention Niether so far, Out of touch, Nor too close to make You say I know. The first book that got me reading 300 pages in a row. A.c.Clark is the best story writer that I know. His brilliant style of writing presents You with Fresh Air in a row . One space ship & 4 Holograms of it , traveling in the body of a whale & Helping wild & civilised by puting to work the technology of hologram , I read Childhood's End Farsi translation 15 years ago in Tehran , 10 years ago the Original English with a friend in Austria, 5 years ago in France & Now it's with me again in Amsterdam . The book in English original that I could suggest with a firm pride as a mother who dearly cares, to all children & grown ups is no other but childhood's End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Great book, loved the characters and the approach to the story was original. One of Arthur's best; recommend for utopian novel fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent story. Grossly spoiled by the introduction.","review":"I have to give this edition one star. The story itself is magnificent, as you'll read in other reviews.However, the introduction, by Adam Roberts, utterly ruined it for me. It gave away the physical appearance of the Overlords (saying that we learn this 'fairly early' in the book. By my estimate we actually learn this about a third of the way through - NOT early at all, and all the suspense leading up to this revelation is ruined).The introduction also tells us pretty much exactly how the story ends! I mean what the hell! A book whose overarching theme is the question of what the Overlords are here for and what mystery awaits humanity, and the conclusion of the plot is spoiled before I even got a chance to start reading!Utterly unforgivable. I feel cheated.You only get to read a book for the first time once, and this one was ruined before I started. Thanks a lot, Adam Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly diminished","review":"Although I have enjoyed many of Arthur C. Clarke's books, this is one that made almost no impression upon me. Perhaps I've gotten used to the conventions of the genre which this book in part set up from scratch, but knowing that a book was groundbreaking in its time and now simply reflects standard cliches does not make it any easier to enjoy. The aliens, despite their initially mysterious behaviour, turn out to be all-too-human and banal; the touching but rather juvenile faith in the UN and other world institutions that permeates most of the book reeks of 1950s transnationalism; and the mystical aspects of the book are rather amateurish and anti-intellectual. Compare this to Theodore Sturgeon's To Marry Medusa and you will find Childhood's End seems like an appetizer in comparison to the literary feast that Sturgeon presents on a similar topic. Unless you're eager to explore the antecedents of modern sci-fi cliches, I can't honestly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool albeit slightly depressing sci-fi classic","review":"This was my first Arthur C. Clarke book and it definitely will not be the last. It is a chillingly humbling story about the \\"invasion\\" of Earth by some alien guardians with a secret mission. The story is very creative and brings us through the limitless galaxy of Clarke's imagination and curiosity. Some of Clarke's vision came true, such as our ability to determine paternity and much more efficient air travel. The book serves as a reminder about the \\"smallness\\" of Man and the possibility that exists beyond the minuscule world we are aware of.As alluded by the title of the book and this review, the book is melancholic and quite depressing. I certainly hope that Clarke's other books aren't as negative. I think that when and if intelligent alien life were to come to Earth, it would indeed be the end of mankind's childhood phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never disapoints","review":"The best of S/F where sience fiction has potential to become reality.Recomended fo anyone thinking of human evolution or is just C Clarke fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative reading","review":"Great read! Arthur C. Clarke's sense of vision and perception is fully shown here in my view. I found it disturbing to imagine on several levels and some concepts he wrote about future earth have already come to pass. A true sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I actually bought this the day ACC died, and what a legacy this man left behind. This novel actually adresses racial issues. For it's time, I'm impressed with the ethnic diversity represented here. I love a book that gets me thinking, and this is no exception. What happens when an alien race solves all of humanities problems, or so we think? Unless you're getting this book for a short plane ride or a trip to the beach, your money might be better spent getting this as part of a Clarke collection, because it's so short...a mere 212 pages. An interesting fact I didn't realize about this book was the influence it had on the V television series, which I hear is coming back to film or TV after 20 years of obscurity (Part II). This novel is fascinating, keeping in mind this was originally published in 1953."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be rather dull.","review":"The beginning was somewhat unclear and vague. The plot seemed dull"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not so great","review":"The book is readable thuough the story line is pretty dull.

It's kind of vague on why things are going on. The ending is just plain weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"metaphysical nonsense","review":"Arthur has written a lot of good classical science fiction. This book is not one of them. It is very famous but lacks the spirits of good ones like city and stars, 200x series or Rama.Clark lost himself in this great nonsense of transforming human kind in other thing that is just mind. The plot is silly and at the end you will ask yourself if Clark paid someone to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few interesting ideas, poorly executed","review":"As always, Clarke has a few interesting ideas, but his prose is deadly dull. Tone of the book was depressing. The story was bereft of anything valuable. Maybe the story would have been more interesting if humans would have at least attempted a war with the aliens. I gave my copy to the public library after I bought it. Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a story that will make you think, and stays with you","review":"I read this book over 10 years ago. The story was thought provoking. This is one book title that has always stayed on my mind and I definately would read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this review for help!!","review":"The people that gave this book a bad rating could not grasp its concepts. What I got out of it was this. In life we have religion and science, God and atoms, unexplainable and predictable. These are tow different things. Here there is the extreme of both. One civilization has conquered science and knows everything about the physical world. And the other is like this physic supernatural being that all humans are connected to through consciences. What way will humanity go? To become so entrapped in our physical world, or go back to the old days of religion and meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceedingly profound; has possible and probable thoughts.","review":"As a non-science fiction reader, I began reading the book as a drudgery. I felt like I didn't relate to any of the topics and I felt the author had no talent for prose. However, as I began to get past my lackadaisical gripes, I found the book to be very intriguing. I would very much like to read the book again. The plot seemed to move slowly at first, but I found the reading much quicker and easily comprehendable once general information and exposition was passed. I liked the book, not because it was science fiction, but because of its fanciful realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"This book is one of the best science fiction books that I've ever read. It was really cool how the author took something that we're all fimilar with and turned it into something that takes on a whole new meaning. Who would have thought that time could turn itself around so that the thing (or person) that we connect with evil is present in our thoughs hundreds of years before we actually see them. This is a great book to read if you are in the mood for thinking and not overly religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the best Science fiction book I have ever read.","review":"I had to read this book in school for a grade.

Regardless, few would call it conventional. It's the tale of an aspiring astrophysicist whose carelessness changes the life of a brilliant composer forever; now that a new planet exactly like ours has been discovered, can our heroine get a second chance to make everything right? Brit Marling stars and co-wrote the screenplay for Another Earth, and the film offers proof of her unique talent -- just don't expect a typical sci-fi story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the science?","review":"I had seen the trailer and was horrified by the idea of what would happen to Earth and other planets due to the gravity suck of this new planet. Hell, the planet couldn't even have gotten there, without major astrophysical calamity! I wanted desperately to see how this would be handled. It wasn't. This and the hundreds of other scientific issues were not addressed, much to my disgust.After wasting my time and money, I was given to understand that the entire charade was a metaphor for personal growth and renewal. I feel like throwing rotten tomatoes at the rental box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost a buck & 2 hours of life","review":"This is the only 99 cent movie I have ever felt cheated on. As others have pointed out it is SLOW and painful to watch. Putting aside the facts that science and physics dictate (another planet in such proximity would create gravitational disruption destroying both \\"earths\\"). This is just a boring movie, no real special effects, no real story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! even 99 pennies!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH OF THE SAD WORLD WE KNOW AND NOT ENOUGH OF THE OTHER WE DON'T","review":"The far-fetchedness of this story belies the notion that nothing should really surprise us in our age of near magical technology and discovery. In a mundane world of sadness and tragedy, what would happen if another version of our earth suddenly appeared? This attempt at a psychological sci-fi tale inverts the known with the unknown and teases with all the possibilities therein.I wish there were much more joy and mystery in this unusual film of hope amidst the ordinary. But this is still definitely worth a look. In my opinion, some of the deleted scenes would've helped finesse the story about this young woman dealing with the pain of causing a tragic accident.It's too much of the world we know and not enough of the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another movie!","review":"When I saw the trailer I was thinking that this movie will be a good movie because the sobject is very interesting, but the movie waste it!...

The soundtrack is one of the best i have heard since The Fountain and it really captures the mood of the film.Shot with a very limited budget it still has the ability to draw you in without stunning special effects but with some amazing acting and story. Some of my favorite films are works of passion of their creator and this film is that. Mike Cahill Co-Wrote, Directed, and edited the film himself and Brit Marling the lead Actress also Co-wrote. This film is an Indie Filmmakers dream come true, to create a film of this level with very limited resources gives all us artist the drive to carry on in hopes to achieve the same.The buildup in the story line will keep you watching till the last frame and I have to admit that the last shot was one that will stick with you for a long long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Horrid Execution.","review":"I saw the promo for this on another movie. I was so excited that it would be a neat movie and fun to watch as well as thoughtful.The whole story could be be changed to a winning lottery ticket. The Earth 2 really does not play into the story except as this ideal that there is another me.The movie is slow and tedious and I kept waiting for the encounter with Earth2. I kept waiting and waiting for the movie to get going. I paused the movie at about an 1:15 and saw only 15 minutes left. Disappointment. The movie does not get going.On the positive side: I think this says something about how justice and recitation to make a person whole after a crime should work.Outside of that, if there is another me out there? DO NOT WASTE 90 minutes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"The premise of the trailer is that this is another \\"Contact\\" but not to be, just a wasted premise.

After paying to see it I stuck it out to the bitter end. Hindsight would suggest it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the substance?","review":"This film is a small, artsy independent film and it shows just a bit too much. Most of the film is consumed by silence. The silence isn't filled with stunning visual images or movement, but rather just the main character Rhoda being depressed with her lot in life. Unlike say 2001: Space Odyssey, where the silence has meaning, here in this movie it's simply boring.The whole concept of the second Earth is supposed to be a philosophical metaphor for the fact that small acts of luck/misfortune can dramatically alter somebody's life. However, it's a bit overdone. The whole concept of a second Earth literally just hanging out in space next to ours is way too unrealistic and unscientific to carry the film. Viewers can't take it seriously. Other sci-fi movies movies have explored the concept of decisions and chance in life with much more grace and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Earth Review","review":"This wasnt quite what I expected it to be from the preview.

But if you're expecting a movie about \\"Another Earth\\", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST BORING DEPRESSING MOVIE OF MY LIFE.","review":"This movie was an embarrassment to nature. seriously. i went in to the movie expecting an intense science fiction movie with romance and drama but was met with a depressing blob of boring.

NOT...","review":"Good science fiction, whether it's on the printed page or on the big screen, should always evoke a sense of wonder. Too many mainstream SF authors have forgotten this and the genre is suffering everywhere but at the movies. Now Another Earth comes along. There's no sense of wonder here, only meaningless, girly dispair.Instead of a sense of wonder, we wonder why the hell we're sitting through this stinker. I'd give this mess a zero stars if Amazon would let me.FYI, this film died a death at the theater, and more films like this will only do the same. Hollywood, wake up and smell the stink of failure.

I wish I put more effort in finding a good cheap guitar, this is not it.The color is good though & it will be prefect for some one who's never played guitar to get used to tuning and fretting, but if you know how to hold one, tune and strum, then you want a better guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first guitar","review":"This guitar is perfect for me as a first guitar.

I am returning this and anxiously awaiting X-Men Legends 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Alright, its fun every once in awhile but it gets old fast...If you like mindless button pushing and fighting mole-men, stone aztec things, and now mummies then you should still find a different game then this one. I know it's hard to make a video game that doesn't envolve mindless button pushing but this one doesn't even make an effort to differ from that.What they should do is put games like this out on PSP where you wouldn't mind pushing buttons because you'd be traveling or trying to pass the time. I actually think it would be more fun on PSP because with large systems you expect a lot which, this game didn't bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring four","review":"here is the story watch the movie i like it play the game i feel like i want to cry. this game is pointless i mean who wants a pointless movie based game i like the idea of having the original cast in it for voice overs but all the game is fight , jump, solve easy puzzle the graphics stink and that is what i think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Bore","review":"Awful!! Those people that gave this game good reviews are making money in some way from the sale of this game.

Graphics stink, gameplay is awful...I can't think of anything nice to say about it.I should have seen it coming...the commercials for the game have no actual footage or screenshots from the game. The animation on the commercial looks nothing like the game. Multi player mode is even worse that single which stinks.If you just feel the need to get rid of 50 bucks....flush it down the toilet and cut your losses.

My wife and I both felt the first movie \\"4th of July\\" was very worthwhile. The second movie though \\"The long days of Summer\\" was not nearly as original or interesting as the first. The movies show signs of aging and low production values, but still made for an evening of enjoyable viewing. We didn't find \\"Summer\\" worthwhile at all, but that's just our opinion. Dean Jones is one of the most under-rated actors that ever was; even in the Disney movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Every Day Was the 4th of July DVD","review":"Thanks so much for having this cool DVD for sale on Amazon!

Without doubt I'm glad I did. Master Chuang describes Taoist history in a way that is so much more thorough and succint than in any other book I've read. Now we know how Taoists themselves view Taoist history! And the second half of the book, which deals with Taoist practices like mantra, hand gestures called mudra, magical spells to control spirits, etc., is without peer. This is no theorectical discussion, this is a detailed description of actual practice. It's about time someone wrote this book, and I applaud Michael Saso for doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOOK!","review":"This is simply a tremendous book that everyone who is interested in Taoism should read. Saso, who is not only a Professor of Taoist but is also a legitimate Taoist Priest, describes his training in full detail. He gives real descriptions of rituals, incantations, spirit-controlling spells, etc. Plus you get to know Taoist history as Saso's own master knew it. This sort of information just isn't available anywhere else. If you already have a grounding in basic Taoism and want to know more about higher-level activities, this is one of the only references you'll find."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important books for your Taoist library","review":"Taoist Master Chuang is one of the absolute most important books for anyone's Taoist library. In my opinion, everyone should have (in no particular order) Robinet's \\"Taoism: Growth of a Religion\\", Mair's translations of Zhaungzi and Laozi, the Yi Jing of one's choice, and Saso's \\"Gold Pavilion Classic\\" and \\"Taoist Master Chuang\\". Taoist Master Chuang is simply that good. Saso delivers information that was absolutely unavailable to the Western reader prior to Taoist Master Chuang. My only concern is that no one should attempt to utilize the spells, incantations, and rituals in Saso's book unless one is trained to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to the Heart of Taoist Practice","review":"I just finished readnig this book, and all I can say is \\"Wow!\\" Whether you're a beginner or a long-time Taoist, \\"The Tao of X\\" can only carry you so far. At some point you have to move beyond poetry and nice words and discover what the real practices and traditions are all about. And that's exactly what Michael Saso does in this book. Finally, someone gives us a serious introduction to the rituals, dances, chants, spells, and methods of true Taoism. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 10 stars?!!","review":"I just watched this yesterday and I was completely blown away. It was truly an emotional experience. Rod Argent really outdid himself putting this together. To hear that album performed live from beginning to end was breathtaking. Colin Blunstone did 3 numbers backed by only a string quintet (in the first set), and that was mesmerizing as well. Even if you're only slightly familiar with the album, get this DVD and prepare yourself for the musical treat of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must see concert","review":"if you're fan of the Zombies, this is a dvd you have to buy. the 1st half features the touring band, the 2nd half of concert brings together the original band minus the original guitarist who passed away a few years ago. the band sounds great with top notch vocals. you wont be disappointed....ITS AWESOME !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old book with good info.","review":"Original pulished in 1971, this is definitely an older marine book. Surprisingly though, it has some good relavent info. For example, their is an equipment section where the advantages of protein skimming and ozonizers are discussed. The heart of the book though is its discussion on marine fish. Mr. Cox does a nice job of discussing fish behaviors, vulnerabilities to disease, etc. Pictures of fish are hand drawn paintings, and though good I would perfer a nice picture. Overall it is a good book, but there are other reef books that are much more new and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshment for the mind","review":"Dr. Morris has written a wonderful \\"slice of life\\" book that illustrates universal christian struggles and principles by showing how they play out in the real lives of himself and his patients.

This is a bad, kids movie that has a plot with no point, actors with talent but have lost it here. I put faith in Matthew Broderick in alot of films, and he sucks in this one. And as for the Claw guy, your a bad actor! Get rid of him! Hardly entertaining and a very big disappointment. This is as bad as KULL THE CONQUEROR! Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent a video of the cartoon","review":"This film was simply terrible. I had high hopes for it, too. Gadget never fell in love in the series, and the Gadgetmobile never talked (though that was the coolest character in the movie). Dr. Claw (or is it just Claw now) was the worst character. My favorite, though, was his pudgy little henchman, who looked EXACTLY like the one in the cartoon. I had to applaud that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go go gadget...away please","review":"Sadly, I thought the movie was way too overblown, telling jokes that nobody really got and going off on its own little spindle while everybody scratches their heads and wonders just what's going on. Broderick tries his best to be Gadget but just falls flat, and Rupert Everett doesn't exactly make a novel Claw- I mean, didn't Claw hide his face in the original show! The story is scattershot, the good jokes are seldom (if you can find them), and the Yahoo! advertisement is dreadful (was it even needed?). Worse yet, the original Gadget voice, Don Adams, is wasted on a talking dog bit. And why does Gadget say, \\"Wowzer\\"? It's \\"Wowzers!\\" Not really that great a film, go see George of the Jungle instead. It's far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"if I could give less than one star I would!","review":"When I received the package there was NO movie in the case. it was just an empty case VERY UNSATISFIED"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cartoon is Better!","review":"I like the cartoon and I thought I would like the movie because I like Matthew Broadwick, Joely Fisher, Rupert Evrett, Michelle Trachtenberg and Andy Dick but I didn't like the movie and was so bored I felt like walking out of the theater but couldn't because the people I was with paid for my ticket but after the movie was over they said they didn't like it either. As for the movie there were too many gadgets and special effects and not enough plot and there was just too much blatent advertising for products like Skittles, etc, making it way too commercial! I'm not totally against product advertising in movies, take the Home Alone movies for example, they had a little bit of advertising but didn't over do it. I think only little kids would enjoy this movie but older kids and adults might be extremely bored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go Gadget Commercial","review":"Usually, the opening title sequence of a movie sets the tone of how good or bad will be the movie. This opening sequence seemed to last 10 minutes before it actually started the story. After watching this much of the show, I was quickly reminded of the movie \\"Spawn\\" which had an equally boring to watch opening sequence. \\"Spawn\\" had all the computer special effects in it, but the story was boring. Such is the case with Inspector Gadget, but this show decided to add \\"in your face\\" commercials (like Yahoo, Skittles, etc.) in practically every scene. I was highly annoyed watching this show.The movie is not funny, is not true to the original Inspector Gadget cartoon, and is very boring to watch. The run time of the actual movie is only about 60 minutes excluding the opening and ending credits. Skip this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go throw my money away","review":"After watching this movie i felt that it put to shame the original cartoon. Having too weird of effects, it seemed too fake. I felt bad taking my little cousin to see it because now he thinks that the cartoon is like this too. I thought the cartoon character could \\"act\\" better than Matthew Broderick. And for heaven's sake take that annoying voice from the car. Inspector Gadget is not from the freakin ghetto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go, Go, Gadget - Don't Come Back","review":"Matthew Broderick is a fine actor, but even his talents could not save this awful film. The fact that he appears in it merely indicates that his career has declined sharply. The fact that this is a Disney film glaringly demonstrates that the level of quality at Disney has declined even more sharply. Broderick does his best, but he cannot carry the film alone, particularly when saddled with an inept director, a horrible script and an equally horrible supporting cast (particularly the annoying, untalented Michelle Trachtenberg). The story is uninteresting, the jokes and gimmicks fall flat, and most viewers will find themselves checking the time frequently, and marveling at their endurance in sitting through this dud. Do yourself a favor: Stick with the cartoons, and skip this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go Gadget ripoff","review":"It uses every over-the-top reaction,every cartoony sound effect,every corny slapstick and every dumb joke soo much that it's not funny.It tries waay too hard to be funny to a point that it is not funny at all. It has little to do with the cartoon and the moments that are true to the show is just a slap in the face. The movie's Dr.Claw is nothing like the Craw from the cartoon. He's more like a sidekick to him. The acting is crud. The editing is trash. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD MOVIE!!!!! I give this trash a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go-Go-Gadget Remake!","review":"I was very excited to hear that this movie was coming to theaters! I have been a fan of the cartoon show since my youth. I must say, I was disappointed in this movie.First, one of my pet peeves is deceptive trailers! A good portion of material from the trailer was either left out entirely or rushed through as a flashback or afterthought. This movie has the air about it that budgets ran dry and rather than scrap the movie altogether, it was rushed to production.Disney needs to raise the bar on their live action movies. This was as much of a disappointment as Snow Dogs. If you are going to produce a movie based on a book, comic book, television show, etc., from a by-gone era, it would help if a fan of the material was involved in the production in my opinion.See this one once, but save your money on the video. Maybe they will release the old cartoon on DVD. I would buy the whole series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, stupid, stupid","review":"what can I say about this movie? Stupid.

It's painfully obvious Disney hasn't got much talent or creativity as far as updating a retro cartoon to keep up with the times. First they gave us a movie adaptation of Inspector Gadget followed by Underdog a few years later. Neither one of these movies can match the witty and clever nostalgia of these two animated series.Wowsers... this movie is a waste of time and talent that should have been direct to video if nothing else. Just watch it and you'll see why it didn't do well at the box office. Oh well, maybe another movie studio will get it right next time with a better cast and more experienced movie director. Go go Gadget reboot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie","review":"Matthew Broderick is great as Inspector Gadget , it is a movie you should not miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the cartoon, but pretty darn entertaining.","review":"What I loved about this movie was the direction. Although it didn't follow the point of the cartoon, which was Gadget not solving anything and Brain and Penny doing all the work, the fun they had making the movie was apparent in every frame. How much fun is that opening sequence?And the effects are flawless. As for the talking car, well...I like Hughley as much as the next guy, but that was just a tad too annoying and self-aware.You and the kids will love it, but the grown-up might find him or herself chuckling at this a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspector Stupid","review":"This movie sucked and wasn't even remotely funny. Matthew Broderick is one of the worse actors out there and made this movie even worse. Stupid plot, stupid comics, stupid stupid stupid. And I used to like to watch the old cartoon series too. If you want a stupid movie thats actually funny, go watch Meet the Deedles."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can one film be so bad?","review":"That's a question you'lll be asking yourself time and time again as you watch Inspector Gadget. Granted it's for kids but Disney should really give children a little more credit.

Labeled by most as \\"Hitler's showhorse\\", we can see that this unfortunate term fails to describe most of Schmeling's life. He had conversations and meetings with various prominent and contemporary statesmen, eccumenical, and showbusiness people, to name a few.

Warren recorded this approximately 14 mos. before the first rumblings of Gov't Mule were heard, and anyone who has any sense of musical appreciation could tell that he was going to be one of the underappreciated talents in Music today. The CD was released without much fanfare, but grew in poprlarity throughout the ranks of the Allman Brothers Band faithful quickly, and still remains one of my favorites to this day. The blend of Warren's tough, bluesy voice and the solid aggresive slide playing; coupled with the great musicianship of his backups created one of the best fusion recordings I've ever heard..I was lucky enough to see Warren perform the music live, and was just blown away! If you like great slide guitar, with a funky/bluesy twist, you will like this CD. Check it out.... I don't think you'll be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I've seen Warren Haynes live both with Govnmt Mule as well in support of the Warren Haynes Band.

I read a few of the reviews and was not sure what to expect. I had purchased the Warren Haynes live CD/DVD after seeing his steller band live at the Orange Peel in Asheville and wanted to find out where the tunes came from that were not on \\"Man in Motion\\" and not cover tunes. I was not dissapointed. He really rocks on this CD. Love the Mule but must admit, I prefer his solo releases. Fire In The Kitchen!!

As far as this disc goes, I can't say enough good things about it, my fave tracks are Blue Radio and Broken Promise Land.

This washing powder is my hands-down favorite. It dissolves completely even in cool water, doesn't lead to greying of whites (like Woolite can), and has the most wonderful, light fragrance. I usually prefer unscented products, but there's just enough fragrance lingering on my lingerie that it's a pleasure just to open the drawer.I also use this powder to wash cashmere on the delicate cycle (in a lingerie bag to prevent stretching). Great results there, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get what I selected","review":"This is not a review for the wilkinson blades themselves, which are awesome (5 stars). I selected to purchase 100 blades for $18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for $14.54.

My goal in buying a old-style shaver and blades was to reduce my impact on the environment. I had considered a straight razor, but all the stropping and honing seemed a bit too much for me, and my barber told me that even many barbers are unable to do it properly. So I settled on the old style razor. No plastic, and you can recycle the blades!All well and good. However, I was unhappy with the packaging of the blades. Instead of receiving a nice little box of 200 blades, I received 40 five-blade packages!?! Ugh. What a waste packaging material.I would suggest to any person intending to buy a 200 blade package to call and confirm that you'll get a single 200 blade package.That being said, the razor blades themselves function well. They are cheap, and they work nearly as well as contemporary razors. They are much more environmentally friendly than contemporary razors because they are not made with any plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chunky Salsa","review":"Whew!

I removed the blades from my rotation as soon as the five day trial was up. I will not be using these again. As is with all shave products, though, your experience may vary.

It wasn't until the Darla troligy did things pick at all for me. From there on out the season kept getting better and better, until it finally peaked at the season finale. The addition of Connor was one of the geatest things in Angel history. While I like season four and five better, this season definitly is better than the first and second IMO.The DVD is looking great, planty of featurettes to go around, some bloopers, and even screen tests. Widescreen looked great for season two, so it should look even better this time.Hopefully Fox keeps up its six-month intervals so that season four and five (my favorites) will be out before this time next year. Season four was like watching a season of 24, you never get board, and season five, now with Lindsay's return as a big bad, is going to possibly become my favorite season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Season Three... can you say AMAZING?","review":"It is official my friends. Joss Whedon can do NO wrong!!!! I loved this season. It has you on the edge of your seat! I love the story line of Darla and how we get to see more of Angel's past and their relationship back in the day. I definitely recommend this season to all Angel fans and it arrives very quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Connor is awful even has a baby","review":"Overall Angel is a great series, and I hesitate to give season three such low marks but lets be honest, Connor was a mistake, such a huge mistake in the current season he is all but forgotten and never mentioned (rarely). Darla having a baby not entirely interesting though Darla is interesting pregenant Darla is whiny and uninteresting.Second, Gunn and Fred love angle, another low point of the entire series, again the obvious love story between Wesley and Fred is put off for this very fake love story between Gunn and Fred.Third, I just can't get it out of my head Angel trying to kill Wesley while he was unconcious, one of the worst scenes ever in the history of Angel, its hard to forget or forgive.The fact I note so many people giving this season such high marks realy ignores these important points, I hope anyone thinking of purchasing this otherwise excellent series will take these points into consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding 3rd Season!","review":"I caught part of Season 1 when I was back in the US. I was hooked! I'm an American living in Europe, so don't have the luxury of catching shows on primetime or even in English for that matter! I bought Seasons 1 and 2 immediately and finished them in a matter of days. The wait for season 3 was awful, but certainly worth it! It seems that the series only gets better from year to year. The storylines are masterfully written and the character development has been superb. I especially like how Cordelia and Wesley have come into their own on Angel. I can only hope that Season 4 and beyond continue with more excellent shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel takes off","review":"It has been said by others, but bears repeating that in this series Angel realises its full potential. The story arcs become bigger and better, which suits a DVD release. The cast have now established themselves and go on to interesting places with their characters. And as with everything from this team of writers (Angel, Buffy, Firefly) the stories leap from genre to genre but always entertain.Who'd have thought Cordelia, \\"..the Spatula!\\" and Wesley from their mild Buffy origins could become strong and believable characters. Whilst Holz, Lila and Darla provide dark edges to the show far more interesting than the monster of the week. And Fred becomes one of those Willow-type characters whose scenes never seem to go quite long enough.Like Buffy, this series works very well on DVD and rewards a second (third ..) viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems what so ever.","review":"Ordered, it came in the mail in a few days, even though I purchased used, it was ingreat shape and plays like new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 3 one of the bests","review":"I'm a huge Angel fan and am really sad that the show is gone, I feel it could have gone on at least another year.Season 3 will always be one of my fave seasons, I could watch it over and over again and I do! Season 3 introduced Fred as a regular character and the amazing Amy Acker as her portrayer.Season 3 is full of great storylines, quotes, moments etc. Darla's return, her sacrifice for baby Connor, The Ballet episode, and many many others.These dvds are even worth buying just for the extra scene, of Alexis/Wesley and Amy/Fred's ballet dancing is both beautiful on her part and hilariously funny on his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season","review":"I am a huge Buffy fan and Angel was the next step. I really enjoyed this season. It is very interesting show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The packaging causes damage.","review":"While I love the show, and will certainly buy Season Three, it's worth noting that the packaging for the previous two seasons is poorly made and tends to scratch the DVDs. The plastic forms that the DVDs fit into was poorly made and has a sharp spot. Since none of the other reviews have mentioned a change in packaging, I assume this season suffers from the same problem. I don't know about you, but when I pay this much for entertainment, I expect a better quality product. If you do buy Season Three and it arrives unscratched, I recommend immediately removing the discs from the box set and putting them in new jewel cases or padded sleeves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't speak for the show itself","review":"Because Amazon's streaming/downloading service is so terrible that I've been unable to watch it yet.

It could be that the material is not UV resistant. The item descrption makes no claim of having UV inhibitors but it does imply that it will protect outdoor living furniture and grills from the elements. To me that means it will stand up to the elements when protecting your gear. It is a nice cover and I think it would be great if it didn't deteriorate so quickly. So if you keep your grill in a protected area this might be for you. If you leave your grill out in the elements, I suggest you look for another type of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love the message of a claddagh, that is just beautiful.

We are very fond of WOW toys as they seem virtually indestructible (we own several other pieces) but the cars, or rather one car, didn't hold up quite as well as we would have expected. We've also given the cars as a gift to several friends and they were a big hit with the kids.

There were include directives that referenced code that wasn't included on the accompanying CD - nor shown in the book.

Ignore the reviewer's comment about their source being piano rolls. Even Rachmaninoff said of his piano rolls, \\"Now I have finally heard myself play.\\" even though he had previously heard his audio recordings. The piano rolls had additional holes for recording Rachmaninoff's expression, hence why they capture all the vibrancy and subtlety of his playing.If you are a completist or such a Rachmaninoff fan that there is something here not captured elsewhere, go ahead, buy these discs, but buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The item overall is real good, nice no-slip silicon rubber, the only thing bad is that it said i would get a pair of headphones with it, i even got to choose the color of them, but they were not included with the case....i dont really care but someone else might!"},{"rating":"1","title":"iskin","review":"This is great for protecting your ipod but when I went to use the belt clip for the first time, it broke.

For best results, you must view each section, before practising the routines. The instructions of the coach are clear and well-paced. After the initial viewing, it is easy to follow the instructions without having to view the TV or monitor constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this DVD because of all the positive reviews, however, I was very disappointed when I received it. The instructions are given as a voice over to a woman who demonstrates. The two are not integrated well and the editing needs work. These instructions were far less complete than a single intro class I took locally. The DVD is organized poorly and doesn't flow well. The time stated for each routine would sometimes be incorrect. Also the \\"warning\\" statement at the beginning of every segment is annoying. I still believe in the value of pilates but I certainly wouldn't if it was based on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"For a novice person this video might be ok. I had never done pilates before this tape and I did not find it challenging enough after I did the workouts a few times. I got bored watching a single person on the screen with someone else describing the exercise in the background, no music. There are a lot of workouts to choose from. I did like the fact that there were workouts for times when you don't have a lot of time to spend working out or you can workout for a long period. I did not like the way the video was set up, the segments did not flow together. In between each segment the screen would fade to black and the single woman would reappear and the annoying voice would start again. Overall I thought the video was boring and I had a hard time wanting to complete a workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific find!","review":"I love this DVD because it makes you work. And because you can customize your workout you won't get bored. Instead of being unable to finish an hour long DVD and feeling frustrated, you can start with one complete mini workout and just slowly work your way up. It's also great for busy people. Who doesn't have 10 minutes. I do it in the mornings to wake up! This is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I am not in the greatest shape, but this DVD is very adaptable to my needs and has allowed me to grow and improve. I have used it for over a month and a half and I can now do things I never thought I could. The instructor's cues are clear and concise. It is somewhat of a straightforward instruction style, not so sticky sweet, which I prefer but if you need a cheerleader pushing you on this might not be for you. Overall, this DVD is a fantastic value and I am going to get some of their yoga titles now to try them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some have been better","review":"This DVD advertises 35 workouts. Actually it is the same workout with maybe one or two changes, additions or deletions. The one thing that bothered me most...she kept referring to \\"stomach muscles\\". The stomach is an organ, not a muscle. Should have been \\"abdominal muscles\\". I believe in correct terminology when teaching. Cues were pretty good. A better DVD is the Complete Mat Series with Alycea Ungaro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"When someone makes a video, I look for inspiration, passion, and dedication. This video appears nearly clinical with correctness, but I did not think the model expressed vitality or muscularity. Another point is that the verbal instruction did not feel inpiring. Am I the only one, or did anyone else think it's impossible to put 35 workouts on one DVD? There are a lot of DVDs on Pilates. I suggest checking out some of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total waste of money","review":"I bought this DVD because it has such great reviews. But as I found out after having it for only one week that it was the biggest waste of time and money. If you have never taken a Pilates class before, and have no idea what it is supposed to be this DVD might be something you would like. In the end though you would be wasting your time, effort, and money on something that is poor quality and poor pilates! (...) It also states that there are workouts for the \\"less flexible people\\" and that is completely false, they do not alter the routine one bit from the original \\"more complex\\" routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored out of my Mind!","review":"When I got this video I was ready to start toning up with pilates. When I watched how boring and bland the instruction was I had second thoughts. I want to get a good Pilates workout but without the yawning and sleepiness. The next Pilates video I get will have more pep in it's step than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"i practically fell asleep while watching this tape, the girl doing the exercises isn't even saying anything while she's doing it. It's a voice over! also she's all alone in a blank room. All the exercises are basically the same. I would suggest Mtv Pilates. It's a lot more fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This would have been a great DVD if it didn't freeze up after the workout was done, or if all of the workouts would play on my DVD. The company that makes this DVD said some players don't run these DVD's well, mine must be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a motivational workout","review":"This was my first Pilates video and I am not sure if I will buy another one if they are all like this. The background looks like a plain background from grade school pictures from the 70's. There was no motivation at all with this. Her voice is really boring and very annoying when she is counting each breath on \\"The One Hundred\\". I tried to zone her out but no luck. The instruction is good if you can stay awake to listen to it. If you need motivation, I don't think this will do it for you. And I agree with the others, that there are not 35 different work outs on this DVD. It is just the same work outs in different sections of the DVD. It reminded me of copying and pasting with a computer, i.e. copying & pasting the same work outs into the intermediate and advanced sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no no!","review":"Having taken lots of Pilates classes, I'm here to tell you this dvd isn't very good. Some of the exercise cycles are incomplete (Garcia does right leg series, but skips left, that sort of thing), preparatory instructions are sometimes unclear, and reminders as to inhalation and exhalation are scant. This might seem petty, but certain poses just fall into place when your breathing is right, and this dvd won't help with that. If you're new to Pilates, buy something else. If you're experienced, don't buy this unless you have a remote handy at all times to stop the dvd and complete a cycle of reps, or unless you're so experienced you don't need breathing reminders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it everyday for 2 weeks","review":"I've never tried Pilates before but I excercise regularly. With bikini weather here I decided to try this DVD because of what I'd heard that it does for your abs. It's true, the 'workouts' on the DVD are usually only 7-12 minutes long despite what the menu options say, but I've found that doing atleast 4 'workouts' a day has made a huge difference in the way my abs look. What's great about this DVD is the number of 'workouts' included for each level of training. I've been using it for a month and I'm only yet beginning the intermediate level. I can see that I'll be using this DVD for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"choice of level choice of time good workout and stretch","review":"This IS the way workout DVD/Videos should be, as another reviewer stated, Choose workout intensity from beginner to challenging advanced there are about 6 intensities. Then choose workout length 5, 15, 25, 30 minutes, with or without weights AND choices within these options for more or less flexible people! I recommended this DVD to a co-worker and she also loves it! I thought Pilates was going to be a joke, but I am very pleased with the results and how mind clearing and centering it is for me. You will see results and with all the options will not soon get board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, what can I say...","review":"This DVD is curious in that it claims to have 35 workouts. If any DVD had 35 workouts it should be at least 12-15 hours long. Actually this DVD has 35 partial workouts. Although the model seems to demonstrate Pilates with precision, the voice instruction is not pleasing and the verbal cues seem flat. I would suggest the Pilates for Dummies DVD and Classical Pilates DVD because, together, they span the entire specturm of complete workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been doing Pilates for years, and I was hoping to get a DVD with some variety to change up my regular routine when I purchased this DVD. But when I popped it in my DVD player and selected the intermediate workout, I was surprised to find that the movements were way too fast than what other instructors teach. I thought Pilates was supposed to use slow, precise movements in order to tone the muscle groups. Another aspect of the video that was a letdown is the fact that this is the most boring thing you've ever seen! It shows the same woman all the way through going through the motions and another woman doing a voice-over or narrarating the movements and counting. There is no personal interaction or instruction whatsoever. I definitely would not recommend this for a beginner or any Pilates level, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Excercises - Little Explanation","review":"I'm very new to Pilates and bought this product because it said that it ranges from beginner through advanced and I thought I'd be able to grow with it as I progressed. I thought the exercises were good, but the DVD gave very little background information and didn't outline how to build a good routine. I thought the environment is very boring. It did not get me too excited as I started along the path to a good workout. I'm going to look for a product that has more information on the aspects behind Pilates as well as a more dynamic environment to make the training a bit more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring and disapointing","review":"This workout is advertised as having workouts for beginners through advanced. This is partly true, except that all the workouts are basically the same both in sequence and movements. Some of the advanced workouts include some additional movements, but this was a big disapointment.The second problem with the dvd is that there is a second or two of black screen between the movements which is disconcerting because it interrupts the flow. This means that sometimes you will be scambling to get into the correct position to start the next movement.The third problem is that there is not enough instruction on correct form for a beginner. The fourth, and biggest problem is that overall this video is uninspiring.On a positive note, I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this really is a good example of classic Pilates which can be hard to find these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great dvd for those new to Pilates. It has different levels of difficulty and even variations within those. I love that it's all on one dvd as well and for such a reasonable price.

A large booklet is included detailing the development of the piano and its music. Each pianist is then given a biography and their CDs in this series and what repertoire they play on them.

The photography was terrible, the dialogue (when you could understand it) was moronic and uninspired, and the acting...well it's hard to find an adjective that truly captures how bad the acting was. The words \\"take two\\" obviously never found their way onto the set. The first half hour was ok for a couple of laughs (at how bad and goofy it was), but it was all downhill from there. There isn't a student filmmaker alive that couldn't put this movie to shame. I thought the box was cool though (hence the two stars instead of one).

The next volume in the series is actually also dedicated to Pollini as well and exclusively contains Chopin works. This volume shows Pollini's ability to play multiple composers works from Romantic period of Schubert, Schumann and Liszt to the more modern composers of Stravinsky and Debussy. The Schumann Sonata, Schubert Klavierstucke and Debussy etude excerpts are fantastic. For the Liszt Sonata I prefer performances by Vladimir Horowitz or Claudio Arrau, and the Petrouchka suite I find more suited in the hands of Emil Gilels. Maurizio Pollini though is one of the Great Pianists of the 20th Century and is worthy of 2 volumes dedicated to him.

An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered. A good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor picture quality","review":"I am an avid collector of classic movies, and the quality on this DVD is very poor. Not like I rememered"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Charles Laughton's greatest performances.","review":"This is an incomparable portrayal of Henry VIII that makes you feel you are actually seeing the King as he was. The Keith Mitchell TV biography was also excellent, but that was many hours longer. The Laughton movie is brief, but very moving and sometimes humorous. Robert Donat, Binnie Barnes, Elsa Lanchester, and Merle Oberon all support Laughton brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"good old movie","review":"This is a really old movie but if you are a King Henry Vlll bluff you will like it. Charles Laughton makes a wonderful King Henry Vlll. I love all of the Charles Laughton King Henry movie and this one is great. For all King Henry Vlll fans. Worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry reading, but amazingingly detailed information","review":"First of all, the reader needs to keep in mind that this is an official military document; it is factual not entertaining. I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in Holocaust history in any way, whether is it your profession or hobby.Even though it is a government report, it is nevertheless moving and at time gut-wrenching in the matter of fact details of what the United States Army found at Concentration Camp Dachau, in Germany at the end of the European War."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth analysis","review":"For Dostoevsky fanatics, this book is a must-read. It explores The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor in The Brothers Karamazov. It keeps Dostoevsky in the context of his times, examining his political and religious philosophy. Extremely well-written and thought provoking--good help to understanding Dostoevky's other works as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fan","review":"It's not too loud and the lighting looks pretty nice if you like that sort of thing.

What are missing are the subtitles. \\"The Exorcist: The Beginning\\" - Renny Harlin's rescue to Paul Schrader\\"s \\"Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist\\" is my preference; it is a more commercialized update than the stylish latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exorcist Anthology","review":"This package is a dream come true and a set of dvds that every household whom loves mystery/horror should be in their collection. The service was excellent and packaged very well. It was delivered well before the expected date. My wife is the main viewer of these type of movies and says this is one of her all time best! She watched two of them the first night. She has watched them several times since. The quality of the dvds are great!Great value and the dealer has always produced great items."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete set at a low price","review":"The reviews for these films are found at other locations in Amazon.

So if you are into horror and do not have all of these films I recommend the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"do you know what she did?","review":"This is great if you don't have any of these films yet.For someone who doesn't want all of them 1,3 and the Renny Harlin version of the prequel are the must haves. There are some continuity problems with the 3rd and I say that because 1 and 3 are both written by William Peter Blatty, so there really shouldn't be mistakes but they are there. The ones I'm talking about are in the dialogue, having to do with the tapes Karras made of Regan talking to him in the first film. That is talked about in the 3rd but it's not described how it actually went down in the 1st... why Blatty why"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I first saw this movie when I was just 8 years I begged my mother to let me watch it,It still is the most disturbing I have ever seen to date,most of the flicks today are boring compared to this, Linda Blair had to endure hours of cold in a meat freezer while filming the bedroom scenes.This box set rules!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, Great find","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find all of the movies together and for one low price.

We all know what The Exorcist is, otherwise, we wouldn't be reading this page.My main problem with this boxset is this: the only two films in this box worth owning are the original (or the \\"Version You've Never Seen\\", whichever you prefer) and The Exorcist III, both of which you can get for $5.50 or less at Wal-Mart. Why pay almost $20 extra for three other movies that aren't worth watching, and you're more than likely never going to watch?Spring the $11 for the two Exorcist movies that matter, and go out to eat with the other $20. Thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it today, going back tomorrow","review":"This \\"review\\" is for the Diamond Multimedia PVR550PCI Xtremetv Pvr Hardware Tv Tuner.

Everything's hidden, no adjustment. the software is TRIAL version! It gives you serial numbers, but it doesnt do anything it still says you have x days subscription. This card is billed, sold, PRICED as a \\"premium card\\", on par with Hauppauge etc, it is NOT.Tomorrow I am taking this back and getting the hauppauge like I should have...The so called \\"media server\\" where you can view the tv remotely is an ADD ON PURCHASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Remote!!!","review":"I ordered this card from Amazon and did not receive the power pack edition as advertized, but instead the standard edition without the remote. I returned it and promptly received a replacement from Amazon, but it was again the standard edition. I will give them one more chance to get it right. If not, then this is a classic case of bait and switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reproduction","review":"I bought these to replace the standard iPod and Sony ear buds. I was under the impression that I would get a much deeper bass response. I was wrong. The bass reproduction is simply horrid. I read somewhere there is a \\"break-in\\" period. I have found this not to be true. They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new. This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed. I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more. My recommendation is to keep researching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Mozart, not for Metallica","review":"These headphones are great for the home, at the office, or anytime when you're in a relatively quiet environment. As several other reviews have mentioned, these phones perform best in the mid-to-high frequencies, where the sound is crisp and vibrant. If you're listening to anything with a large dynamic range, you won't be disappointed.However, I agree that the bass is somewhat weak, though they're not nearly as bad as some reviews would have you believe. Putting them on carefully and adjusting them properly does make a difference, but these phones have simply been optimized for Mozart (or Dave Matthews), and not for Metallica.So if you're looking for a set of affordable phones to rock out with, or to listen to on the bus or subway, buy the PX100 instead. They've got much better bass, though at the cost of some of the clarity and crispness that the PX200 offers. I don't leave home without my iPod and my PX100s, but at home I usually reach for these PX200s."},{"rating":"1","title":"much less compared to PX 100W","review":"I purchased it based on my extreme satisfaction with the sound quality of the PX 100. A higher number means a better product, right? Wrong. The sound has virtually no bass compared to PX100 and overall sound is tinny. I immediately returned it & ordered a second PX100. The only thing going for the PX 200W is the same smart fold design & accompanying case that comes with a PX100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Fan","review":"I had my first set of open air white plastic Sennheiser headphones in the early seventies; would run the 150' cable from the stereo down to the beach and listen to Cat Stevens, et al, for hours. Now, in the day of the mp3 and xm player, I have a pair of basic Sennheiser ear buds with a convenient volume control slide. I purchased these PX200W phones simply to see if I could get a little more 'oomph!' in the playback. I'm pleased with these phones, like the white finish, and, as another reviewer commented, 'as soon as you figure out how to wrap them up in the convenient carrying case without destroying them...' you are home-free. I'm a dedicated Sennheiser fan, and use these new phones as an alternate to the very convenient buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile","review":"I've had the PX200s for just 3 months, and the right wing just snapped, dropping the earphone out of the adjustable holder.I've loved these headphone; they deliver excellent sound and provide a tight fit to minimize outside sound interference. I very much enjoyed the fold-up feature, exercising care w/ the folding and placing into the provided bag for carrying. I'm not hard on these things or careless in their care. Upon investigation, I learned that the cost of repair/replacement from Sennheiser is nearly equal to the cost of a new set. I'm disappointed because the sound is really good. Duct tape to the rescue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can hear again","review":"I have two sennheiser products - one a wireless headset connected to my home theater and the PX200W headset that i use with a sansa MP# player. I know i have high frequency loss in both ears, but these instruments help me enjoy what I thought was lost. Great phones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Excellent story, Fantastic artwork. This is a super book for birthdays, showers, or story hour at the library. Kids love it.

Jewel might have grown up in the wilderness in Alaska, but it's funny how she got access to Rikki Lee Jones and Sheryl Crow CDs while she was there. This snaggletoothed vacant's book of poetry was the funniest book of 1999 -- this one might be even more dangerous. Her comment about how hotel rooms feel like homes even if just for one night is inspired stuff. When is she appearing at the Guffaw Factory?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book","review":"Jewel yet again gives both disappointment and disgust to any and all with taste in literature in this horrible book.

On the plus side, however, she is hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully intimate...","review":"When I purchased the video \\"Jewel: A Life Uncommon,\\" I was disappointed. However, I found what I was searching for in her book \\"Chasing Down the Dawn.\\"This book is wonderful. Jewel demonstrates her talent for writing prose with astute observations and beautiful language. She is truly a talented writer. Part of what makes her so talented is that you can actually feel her emotions rising off the page--she writes of her childhood, the painful loss of her best friend, her relationships with both her mother and her father, and some of her family history. It is fascinating and could be fiction just as easily as nonfiction. She has truly led a unique life.Supplementing the writings of Jewel are great photographs of her and her friends, and of her when she was younger and of places she has been. I found this to be a great addition to her writing.This is a mandatory item for any Jewel fan--it will give you more insight into who she is and what she does and it is truly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased with the book","review":"for being used its got charictor im pleased on how long it took to get to me and the price was very reasonable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel opens up.","review":"Chasing Down the Dawn: Stories from the Road by singer/songwriter Jewel is an intimate look of her life.

So the pictures sparked my curiousity and I started reading it on the way in to work, then during lunch. Well, I was hooked! I got home from work and finished reading it last night! The book jumps around from gigs to childhood memories. But the writing is so descriptive, that I felt I was there. I was able to imagine living in a cabin in the middle of a harsh Alaskan winter.

The cardio section is pretty lame, I'm not going to lie, but the rest of it is really good. They work muscles that other DVDs don't and the first time I did it I was so sore! To make up for the short cardio I try to do 20 minutes of something else, but even if I don't I still feel like I got a good workout.I really like the variety. There are two workouts, one for dresses that highlight the upper body and one for dresses that draw attention to the lower body, otherwise you can create a workout doing the sections you feel like doing. I normally do all the sections for a total body workout. This DVD never bores me, and I keep reaching for it everytime I go to work out. This is one of the best purchases I have made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"In general I think that the workout DVDs put out by magazines intend to target beginner or low intermediates. They are not only non-challenging but incredibly boring and sometimes annoying. (Which makes no sense really, because fit women are the ones buying health and fitness magazines). So, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The instructor has much more personality than the ones in the other workouts from Women's Health. Admittedly, I have to modify to get things more intense, but overall this was pretty decent and the only one worth keeping from the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quick workout","review":"I ordered this DVD as most people do to tone up for my upcoming wedding. Most of the segments are 20-30 minutes, great for when you are short on time but still want to get a workout in. You can also select which chapters you want to use for a custom designed workout which is great. You do need some light weights in order to do the workouts properly... I have been using books instead of real weights! Will probably get sick of it after a few months but I think that happens with all workout DVD's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Workout","review":"I actually really liked this workout, and the instructor.

You can mix and match your workouts in whatever way you want.

It doesn't compare to a class at the gym, but as far as videos go, it is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding Workout Review","review":"The video is very upbeat, but I believe it is made more for beginners, those who have some toning to do but can't really work on the strenious side. I have used the video for a few weeks but have had to move up. My fiance and I just bought the P90X workout system and it is much better for muscle toning and exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toning and cardio workout","review":"Pros: Has different segments for upper and lower body, abs and a cardio section, toning sections are easy to follow and really work out your muscles, cardio is a real heartrate booster! The instructor is good and not too annoying, although you could make a drinking game out of her saying \\"Nice!\\" Cardio moves are easy to follow -- has a short kick boxing inspired segment.Cons: Cardio is pretty short, but it is challenging, so if you're short on time (who isn't?), this might be a really great workout for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and useful","review":"It's a daily workout, easy and fun.

It's amazingly well made as most Melissa and Doug products seem to be. He can do most of the tricks but I had to read the instructions first and figure out the tricks and then teach him. He would have never been able to do that alone. He is reading but not to that complicated level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish this had been around when I was a kid","review":"I was magic-obsessed as a nine-year-old, but only had dusty Mid-Century-Modernist beginner kits at my disposal, full of cheap plastic tricks that were hokey, outdated and fooled no one; so I was immensely pleased to be able to give this much better-made and more clever beginner kit for Christmas this year to a modern nine-year-old boy, which was an immediate and huge hit this holiday. Difficulty of tricks vary, although an 8- to 10-year-old should be able to do most of them just fine (a few are clearly designed for kids older than that); and although most adults will be able to see through the tricks pretty quickly, I can attest that the magician's twin nine-year-old brother was legitimately impressed with them, with pieces made out of painted wood, real fabric, and an elaborate Victorian-patterned carrying case that doubles as a trick unto itself. Hard to believe this comes at such a reasonable price! Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great confidence booster!!!","review":"I got this for my 7 year old son because he wanted to be a magician for Halloween. The product is of good quality and the magic tricks are fun. Great toy to practice fine motor skills and visual motor skills.

I got this for my 9-year-old son. We both liked that it was made out of wood and that the components can be stored inside the presentation box. A few of the tricks are self-explanatory and my son was doing them within minutes. For the rest, we read the instructions. There is still one trick that we still don't understand how to do based on how they are explained in the booklet. I think there could be some improvement there. Video clips of someone doing the tricks so we can see how they're supposed to work would be even better. Also, I think a bit of showmanship is needed to pull of some of these tricks and not every child may have this (mine doesn't!). That's not a flaw of the set, of course! Maybe he'll develop that a bit more after a few more family gatherings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MAGIC SET that is WORTH BUYING!","review":"I cannot imagine why this set would get anything other than a five-star rating! The value is superb! I would have paid a much higher price to get the quality and fun this toy provides. My children aged 11,8 and 6 were able to perform the magic with ease. The pieces were mostly made of wood and velvet and the colors are very vibrant. The magic was very amusing and would keep the adults guessing. I highly recommend this set to all the parents out there with kids interested in magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"He liked it but...","review":"I got this for my 9 year old son for Christmas along with a magic top hat set. This is a cool set but comes with a lot of small pieces that can easily be lost so put em in a bag asap after opening it!

I was satisfied with this purchase, definitely a good value for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"magic set","review":"this is an all wood magic set. very strurdy. my 7y/o is really enjoying learning the different tricks. he was alittle upset that they are tricks, not real \\"magic\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"We bought this for my 6 year old son and I am so happy with the quality. I purchased this based on other reviews and I'm glad I did. The set is made of wood, has some cool \\"mystical\\" graphics.

I would definitely recommend this set and I will be adding to the set in the future with the add-ons from the same company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooden Magic Fun!","review":"This is a quality, wooden magic set. It is probably a \\"second\\" set, after your child is done toying around with a Marvin's Magic plastic set or whatever. There are ten tricks, all are worthwhile, two are showstoppers. My son will be putting on a magic show for his 7th Birthday and we feel confident in using these tricks. They look nice, work, are easy, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect \\"Starter\\" Magic Set","review":"My son is six, and I searched pretty hard to find a set that I thought was of the appropriate age level for him, I picked out three and he chose this one from the three.

It's well made and has great tricks.

It was not obvious and unfortunately it was a gift and I was unable to return it. The wood was thin and I can see why it would break in the shipping process but it was very disappointing.

He enjoyed it for a day. The product is very sturdy and I liked the quality. My son's interest in performing magic comes and goes. Christmas morning was a day he was only mildly interested in magic. We tried all the tricks once but he hasn't gotten it out since - that's not to say that I don't expect him to get it out again in the future. I dind't think the tricks were too incredibly difficult and thanks to the quality he CAN go back to it and play with it again when he wants to. If your child is in a phase when they are really intent on wanting to perform \\"magic\\" tricks, this is a great sturdy product that would likely fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3 trickes are good the rest are stupied","review":"i got to my 7years old kid , it's all made of wood and badly made ,,,the tricks are not funny at all except 3 of them ,,, the rest are really stupeid ,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eight year old puts on a great show!","review":"Our (almost) eight year old put on a fantastic show with very professional tricks.

She learned a couple of tricks that she liked very much, but then lost interest. Some of the tricks seemed a little complicated. But if I was going to buy a magic kit again, I'd probably get this one because of the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best Gift Ever\\"","review":"Quality is great (solid wood), though we needed to do some touchup stitching on the bag. I got this for my 7-year-old nephew because I remember having great fun with a magic set when I was about that age (or a little older). He loves learning the tricks and showing to people with astonished looks on their faces. He may be slightly young for this in that he needs to work with an adult to help with his presentation skills, but it's a great little project for parent and child to work on together. Meanwhile, his 9-year-old sister (who loves performing in front of people) has also enjoyed learning the tricks and developing a more complex presentation. And their (almost) 5-year-old sister has deemed this as her siblings' \\"best gift ever\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Unlike other magic sets, this one is well-made. Almost all the tricks are easy to learn and will stand up to the roughness of younger children. Great beginner set. We are getting a lot of quality family time with this.

A 1985 reunion between two original Blue Cheer members, bassist / vocalist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley. They had guitarist Tony Rainier play on this one album. I was a bit caught off guard. I mean,this CD is better than what I expected. Title has several reworkings of older tunes, like \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Out Of Focus\\", but also good newly penned tracks like the rocker \\"Ride With Me\\", \\"Girl Next Door\\" and \\"Heart Of The City\\". So even though 'Beast Is Back...' is half new, half old material, it's still a worthy pick. Good revived late '60's heavy rock. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you dig it?","review":"This band will kick your ass! I would put them against ANY newer metal band and they will always come out on top. Don't believe me?

I called and was subjected to about two hours ofnonsensical answers, mainly insisting that I had only ordered the refill card. I have copies of all these emails. Finally, I received a letter advising that the $49.99 charge would be removed from my credit card. Have since bought cell phone from other provider. Sorry, I could not focus on the product because you failed to ship the product. It was a positive experience after all because it taught me never use AMAZON again.

I was pulled in from the first page and couldn't stop till I'd read the last word. Mick Dawson, is the perfect possessive, loving, indestructable Hero. He first stole my heart in Bequiled. While in that story, he was a young man struggling with trying to gain his footing in life, he even then showed his overwhelming sense of honor. He helped and took care of Angel, in that book, and now he's taking bullets for his one true love, Delilah Piper(aka. Del Piper) in his own story. He stopped my heart with his painful past and sped it up again with his sensual slow loving ways. Lori Foster introduces Mick's two, loyal-to-the-bone, friends Zack and Josh. And ladies you'll fall head-over-heals for all three of these fellas! I simply can't wait for the next two books in this wonderfully fast paced, sexy-as-sin series!!! Don't walk, run to your nearest bookstore, or order it right here on Amazon, whatever, just get this book, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book that everyone else read????","review":"This book is so stupid that I couldn't even finish it. It's ridiculous! They don't know each other, but Mick has a crush on Del, just by seeing her. So he takes a bullet for her, and within 24 hours of actually meeting each other she matter of fact-ly kisses him and pretty much is ready for sex. And I guess if what you want is page after page of sex, this book is for you. Personally, I prefer a plot... I like characters who are at least likable and somewhat realistic (although I realize that most men in these books are nothing like real men!).... It's best when the character touches me somehow... these characters are just there so the author could write sex scenes!The plot is so thin...This must be why I haven't read many of Lori Foster's books. I have started reading the latest series, (Men who walk the edge of honor) and DO like those books.Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this particular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Josh and Zacks stories are much better!!!","review":"I was very disappointed in Lori Fosters story of Mick and Del. This was very far fetched and I would go has far as to call it silly at times. I absolutly love Lori Foster but this book was not that good. \\"Mr. November,\\" the story of Josh and \\"Treating her right,\\" the story of Zack are much better and more believable. I hate to give Lori Foster two points because i usually love her books but this is a dud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Del's a mystery writer who meets her perfect hero!","review":"Caught in the Act was a great romance mystery novel. Mick is undercover cop who saves Del in jewelry store heist and gets shot in the process. Del offers to take him home and care for him after the shooting...

The more I read this book the more I found myself not liking it. Sure, it was fun to read at first- wondering how the main characters would get together but not long after that I just stopped caring. I didn't read the first books that this must have come out of so I didn't really care for this one but somehow I managed to finish it. I wish I'd been as smart as the reader from Los Angeles who got a refund for hers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book from another point of view","review":"This book is not a great book of strategy but a great book from a tactical point of view. Colonel Collins is clearly an experienced, resourceful and insightful combat leader. Although not all will be interested in the rundown of his early career, that background sets the stage for arguably his greatest contribution -- his experience leading 1 R Irish in the Second Gulf War.It is shameful how his life and career were derailed by an unwarranted attack from a U.S. officer that seems to have taken the fight out of one who could have been a great general officer.My personal favorite, and I believe the most valuable, part of the book is the last chapter (\\"All for the Good\\") where he analyzes the Second Gulf War from his perspective as an experienced counterterrorist officer.Colonel Collins's lessons on applied leadership should make this book required reading for junior military officers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light","review":"Funny looking light works great! You get swivel head, spare light bulb (brand-name spare bulb would cost almost this much), great stability on the surface due to low center of gravity (unlike most of the other stand up lights) and strap. Just for kicks, light does look like an animal when looked from the side. Light lasts three hours on a single charge (which is to be expected: 0.6 A bulb on the 1.7 Ah battery).Light was great value at around five bucks for a while, now it is less of a value but still good compared to other lights in the same price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good flashlight for the price","review":"I live in the country so not much light a night.

This game rocks because it requires only simple use of the controls. Plus, at the end of a long work day, the plot is not too taxing. The 1st level requires you to \\"dance\\" on the beat. As you move up, you are challenged to repeat long, syncopated rythms. If you have a music background, you'll recognize it; otherwise, you'll play intuitively. The graphics are smooth, and my boyfriend was pretty stunned at the sex pot, Ulala, who has some excellent moves to learn for the night clubs. She is better drawn than Jessica Wabbit, and I had no idea that they made sexy video games without violence, for girls. I hope the trend continues. The sound track is Fab-u-lous, and the dress code is Dee-lish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is fun but difficult.","review":"This game is pretty hard, but you get the satifaction after you have done really well on it. In the game you have to time each move in your head, you dont have a time meter or anything like that, so when you mess up it could effect your TV rating, which you have to keep up. But if you do it correctlyyou save the people and you feel satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEWS FLASH! NEWS FLASH! MUST PLAY!

She has everything from awesome dance moves to cute clothing! I do not want to tell you much, but one thing she comes up to dance with is a girl named Evila. She looks just like Ulala except she is a robot and she is is wearing blue clothes in the same style as Ulala's.( I think Evila has better dance moves!) Hope you buy it and enjoy it, because if you don't, I'm sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Channel 5","review":"I recently bought Space Channel 5 at a used video game store, and I love it. I play it constantly, defeating aliens quickly. I bought it yesterday, so I'm only on level 3, but I think I'm doing OK. The only fault of this game is that the rhythm is hard to keep up with. Sometimes you miss it when you think you did it right, and it gets on my nerves. But overall this video game is extremely fun and totally awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save us Ulala","review":"must have for dancers and music lovers! Super sexy Ulala must save the human race from dance loving morolians. useing memory, skill, and rythem, she must destroy the morolians.

So you'll be grooving everywhere you go! and you wont be able to stop humming the theme! and the plot has some twists and turns so you'll have to keep on playing untill you finish. La la Bum Da bum Da bum.. This game also requires alot of attention, so dont play if your feel sick or if your tired. you need energy to play this game. You may like Dance Dance Revalioution or Bust a Groove if you like danceing games. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but needs work.","review":"I played this game recently, and at first, it made a \\"cute\\" impression. The graphics, although slightly fuzzy, were nice and gave a good, retro-space look from the 50s. The music was also pretty tight, as was the dancing, if not ridicously funny. But the main problem with this game was it's control. Response was awful, and the supposed tutorial was just a version of the manual plastered on your TV screen.After figuring out the controls though, I got a general hang of it, but not 10 minutes into the game, you hit some incrediablly complex combinations that are just way too much. One major problem is that the voice acting of the aliens is terrible. Granted, they ARE aliens, but they weren't real good at pronouncing the words clearly enough to be understood, so you knew which way to press.All in all, I don't recommend this game. With shaky control and bad directions, it's a good idea, but flawed. Looks like just a screwed-up import if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but you may need to buy a game shark!!!!","review":"This game is very unique in that you use a sexy female to dance with funny little aliens. This game is a lot of fun, but it can be very hard to achieve the points necessary to go to the next levels.Therefore you should get a cheap gameshark. There are codes for Infinite Health and for Max Viewer Rating. Those codes allow you to make mistakes, but still move throughout the levels.As I mentioned that the female star is \\"sexy\\". (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Experience","review":"This game is a great experience not to be missed, however, a rental may be considered wiser than a purchase. I beat this game the first day I rented it, and although there are cool secret levels and the goal of getting a 100% \\"view rating\\" (the vr is like a scorekeeper for the entire game, rising when you do well, and falling when you do badly), that was not enough for me to go out and buy the game. One thing I liked was the ability to save people and let them join your posse. Seeing 50 or so unique characters falling behind Ulala dancing in rythym is one of the things that makes this game an aesthetic wonder. Although there have been many great games released on the DC(including this one), Sega falls short in the difficulty level of the games it releases. Definetly check it out, but don't say I didn't warn you if this astounding experience ends all too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Graphics!","review":"I like the moves that ulala uses in the game. I find it funny and amusing. Everytime i come home, i'm motivated to play space channel 5. It's something that's interesting to play. It's sort of like parapa the rapper on the Sony play station. But the graphics will blow you away. It's more like memorizing the steps in order for you to complete the level, and advance further. But i got to give it to Sega. It is interesting to play. And what do you know....Michael Jackson is in it.....:o)..So you dancing fans out there..go and check it out. At the begining of play you might be upset...but as you keep playing it..you will enjoy the game from then on...it's funny to watch ulala's dancing ,and they're preety good moves...so check it out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about timing","review":"The ultimate eyecandy game where the graphics are excellent and the soundtrack is a bonus. I was amazed at the images and fluid animation. The game is all about timing and as the game moves forward and the sequences quicken a little frustration may set in. Learning curve as far as timing goes may be roughly in the medium range - some folks may get it right off the bat, it took me slightly longer to figure out the beat sequence. The soundtrack may be a tad louder than necessary and often drowns out the movement instructions. There are times when being able to see Ulala's movement will help with determining beat sequence - however, overhead shots may make the figures seem small and therefore audio is all you have to go on. Overall, an entertaining game with enough replay value to go back to it. I have to admit its addictive. Its definitely not a game for everyone, renting it first may save you the frustration if you lack confidence in your own rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Jam","review":"this was the jam back in 94.Barry White came back strong on this Jam.Trademark Barry He brought it Home Here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot for the money","review":"My son was very disappointed when we got this for him - he expects with that much of his allowance going out there would be a lot more legos - he hates the cardboard set up and the colors - all wrong he keeps saying:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly antiquated","review":"Well I finished \\"That Yew Tree's Shade\\" by Cyril Hare (US title: Death Walks the Woods) Apparently this author is one of the classics in the crime/mystery genre. The novel is centered about the investigator Francis Pettigrew. Well I must admit that I was not too caught by this book. To me it's greatest charm was the naivety and innocence of its setting in rural England in the first part of the 20th. century. Things we would normally expect from a crime/mystery book like suspense, thrill, fear, I didn't encounter much of in this book. Honestly the investigator Francis Pettigrew seemed a little stupid and laid back to me, certainly no Sherlock Holmes! Also the plot of the murderer was in no way impressive! It's interesting where in the lifecycle of a genre the classics become born.

And a 5 year old would for the most part merely be an observer. Plus you need to give the glue time to set before moving on the some steps. Even if he did assemble it in one hour as claimed it takes a considerable amount of time to prime, sand, paint, resand, repaint and apply the decals which are very difficult and time consuming.My main disappointment came from the fact that the E9-6 rocket engine exploded shortly after takeoff at approximately 20-25 feet off the ground and destroyed the rocket beyond all repair on it's maiden flight. So beware of these engines! All in all it was a lot of work and a big disappointment for me and my oldest child.

More than the finest recorded performance of this great opera ever made, it is one of the finest movements of performance one can ever experience, and it is some kind of miracle that we can hold a relive a piece of the fleeting past. It's irrelevant to describe the beauty and intensity of the music-making, but it caresses and grabs by the throat simultaneously. Vickers is overwhelmingly powerful, he leaps at you from the speakers. That the audiences overpowers the orchestra in their frenzied, passionate response as the finale approaches says more than any critic could.

I don't bought any other title, since I have most of them on other CDs. Needless to say that this is one of the greatest renditions of Beethoven's Fidelio. Everything else was written on the other reviews are exactly what you'll find here.

I thought I was getting a quality product, but as one of the previous reviews says, these styli are very lightweight and don't feel at all like the original (which I unfortunately lost). I wish I could find a legitimate, original replacement instead of these cheap imitations. The stylus end screws on and off and it keeps coming loose while I'm using it; plus, it is not straight so I'm constantly rotating the whole thing to find the correct angle to tap with. I suppose the only saving grace is the hidden pen, which I didn't know was there until I read these reviews. No matter, I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Guilt in Losing These","review":"I too would gladly pay $20 for the same stylus that comes with the TX. Although a bulk pack of styli is great for those who are on their PDAs constantly and often misplace styli, I prefer the weight and sturdiness of the original. Since I've begun using one of these new ones I've noticed that the weight feels too light and that both the top and point of the stylus often come unscrewed, which is unnerving. I like the fact that I can lose any of the 3 and not feel bad, but I don't like the quality of these, so I'll keep my original stylus protected in a box and use these cheapy ones for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price.","review":"These are priced great and have a pen inside.

There is some Archie Bunker-type humor based upon stereotypes and caricatures, which apparently goes over with his agent. But there are some amusing stories and some of them are probably true.

The Reluctant Tuscan was an excellent choice - but don't be fooled by the light reading part. Having lived in another country for two years, I know that Americans tend to bring their \\"Americaness\\" wherever they go. Rather than being annoyed by Doran's impatience and at times, ignorance, of the Italian culture, I was rather amused. It brought back memories of being in Asia as a child looking for McDonald's (obviously a while ago) and wondering why eveything was so different - when I was the different one!

Am so envious that Mr. Doran and his adventurous wife created this incredible home in Tuscany and are able to spend so much time there.

This is a great contender if you're upgrading your old mattress in your RV. I saved about $100 over an internet \\"RV Superstore's\\" comparable product since they added on SHIPPING at the checkout. The mattress arrived in a protective vacuum pack roll--in a box. The directions were explicit and easy to read. Really, if you mess this up you probably shouldn't OWN an RV. Note: Don't plan on sleeping on this right away as the mattress needs some time to decompress from the vacuum packaging ... I think it's about 24 hours. The new mattress smell seemed a little overwhelming the first week... but probably aggravated by my small sleeping area in my low-profile 5th wheel. I gave it some more time to \\"air-out\\" and all is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent replacement for original RV mattress","review":"We just purchased our first travel trailer. The original mattress that came with it was terrible. I tried to sleep on it twice but woke in the morning feeling sore both times.

It was delivered the next week to my front door. The instructions were easy to follow. I was a little unsure what to expect since it was a mattress rolled up into a box. After we unrolled it, the mattress came to life. It couldn't be more comfortable. I recommend this mattress as a great replacement for cheap original RV mattresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product, finally we can sleep in our trailer","review":"The mattress that came in our new trailer was aweful, but this one is great.

Well what mattress doesn't have some amount of staining after six years of use? How easy it that for them to not live up to a warranty, even if the stain has no bearing on damage to the mattress. The way I look at it, Simmons won't stand by their product and will blame you for its deficiences. It must be pristine, like new, for them to even consider standing by their product. The warranty wasn't worth the paper it was written on. I will never buy their product again, and thank the Lord there are other mattresses I can purchase.

One major issue I have as an accomplished map reader: the north to south pages are backwards! Yes, the book is designed so if you are traveling south holding the book in your lap, you'll find west on your right and east on your left; completely backwards! It took me a minute to get over that, but once I figured out what the author was trying to accomplish, I realized how brilliant this idea actually is. My beautiful and intelligent wife and navigator will be able to tell me, \\"it's on the right,\\" or, \\"it's on the left,\\" instead of trying to turn the map upside-down in an attempt to decipher west from east.I particularly enjoy the pictures of the cop cars that warn of speed traps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for the I-75 Traveler","review":"This was our third edition, and it was great, as always.

The graphics look nice but the game play is the absolute worst. The user interface for pitching and hitting is clumsy and awkward. You cannot field for yourself and the computer does a poor job. This game is a waste of money and time. The player movements are choppy and the hame is no fun. I have found this to be a common problem with dreamcast games which is why as soon as I can get my hands on one I will be buying a Playstation 2 and getting rid of the Dreamcast. Instead of playing Sega's baseball game, I break out my old Playstation and fire up a game of TriplePlay 2001 whihc I still consider to be one of the best baseball games."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful baseball game - No fielding!","review":"I dont understand all the 5 stars for this game. This game was hyped up to be the best and it is really lacking as my review and most of the views by game sites on the web state. First of all, the graphics are good but not great. There is edgy crowd graphics and skippy fluidity of movement around the bases sometimes. Now for the real killer...gameplay. I can't recall one baseball game that doesnt have an option for you to field except for Microleague Baseball back in the late 80's. Thing about that game was that you are the manager, solely...so I can understand this. In this game where it is a new hi tech baseball game to not have an option where the player can move players to field the ball is absurd. I STRONGLY recommend not to waste money on this game if you can't stand playing a baseball game that is as far as real as baseball is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Is So Bad It Hurts","review":"World Series Baseball 2K1 is surprisingly the worst Baseball game to date. You don't play this game, you watch it. When your on the field you don't even have the option to CONTROL your own players. You can't even imagine making a cool dive for the ball or stealing a Home Run from a batter because its all controlled by the Dreamcast. When your base running, you can't control your leed off, when you slide, where you slide, or even if you slide. Some how there is no bull pin in which to warm up your pitchers, there are no fielding errors, the game doesn't know the infield fly rule, its only two players, the announcer for the game makes Ben Stine seem exciting, the players batting stances make them look like hunch-back rejects, and the game is a flat out joke to M.L.B. This game might be fun for a six year old who doesn't know what a Baseball is, but is excited by all the pretty colors on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sega dropped the ball on this one.... literally","review":"This game is the absolute WORST baseball game of all time. You cannot field, throw, catch, bat, follow the cameras, etc... it's the saddest thing to happen to baseball since the strike cancelled the world series.

The game is consistantly slow, unresponsive, and absolutely boring. The graphics are decent, but as a sports game that will only go so far. Who cares how good the catcher looks trying to pick off a runner at second base, when he just stands there as you continuosly press the button trying to throw the ball. The outfielders stand in one spot and after a delay they begin to run for the ball, as it's flying over their heads. The crowd noise is annoying, it sounds like a track from an old atari game...the game's simply not exciting in any way shape or form. This game is an embarassment to the Dreamcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a negative star rating","review":"WSB 2K1 is the most disappointing game I've ever played. I sold my copy of the game to Funcoland two days after I bought it. Do not waste your money. The guy at Funcoland summed it up better than I ever I could: \\"It seems like Sega released the beta version of this game\\". You can hit the ball and you can pitch the ball. But you can't field it (the game does that for you, though you do control where the fielder throws the ball once he picks it up.). The game-controlled fielders make stupid choices and they are slow to respond to \\"throw commands\\". The commentator is horrible and you can't shut him up! The in-game options are weak.

CANNOT CONTROL THE DEFENSE!, hitting and throwing controls are sluggish, 680 foot homeruns (that is wonderful attempt at realism), among others. Did I mention you CAN'T CONTROL THE DEFENSE?

I have wasted my time and money with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not what its supposed to be!","review":"The game doesnt have player injuries like was mentioned in so many game details and that is just one of the things its missing that was advertised-Homerun derby, weather problems(delays), Hot and Cold zones of a batter versus a pitcher, the so-called 32 possible pitches per pitcher, and there are less camera angles than a Genisis baseball game. This game was simply rushed out to the market to beat ESPN baseball tonight. If they had just included the above things like was suppsed to included this game would have been fine....

I don't think there is anyone more disappointed than me about this game. I was counting the days to play it, to only find out how much of a stinker this one is. The gameplay for World Series Baseball 2K1 is awful, the controls aren't sensible(and you can change them if you wanted to).The biggest problem in this game is that THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY FIELDS THE BALL FOR YOU ! Where is the fun in that ? You can't even turn that option off. There is a lack of batting camara angles, and the menus for creating players isn't fluid, I can go on and on. Just heed my warning, THIS GAME STINKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Series Baseball 2K1 is the worst game ever!","review":"The game has great graphics and and very smooth gameplay but, the biggest problem with it is that you cant even field so when the CPU hits teh ball you can just sit there and wait for the CPU on your side to get it. It gives me the feeling of little control. The pitching could be better. I mean come on you got this little circle with lines pointing off of it in different directions you have to look in the book for WSB 2K1 to find out which pitch is which. The aiming thing to bat.

The graphics are OK, but they fall far short when compared to the other Sega Sports games for the DC. The Pitching/Hitting control looks like a good idea, if it weren't so hideously slow (and shouldn't a 90 MPH pitch LOOK faster than one that's 60MPH?) The unforgivable feature of this game, however, is the substandard fielding feature. It's true; YOU CAN NOT CONTROL THE FIELDING, only where they throw to and even that doesn't work half the time. Two prime examples of how lousy this game is: 1) The first baseman will usually only run to cover first when the ball is hit. HE WILL NOT EVEN TRY TO PICK IT UP IF IT BOUNCES RIGHT TO HIM. 2) Twice in the 6 innings that I played this thing a chopper was hit to the pitcher. Would you believe that he could not throw out the batter in time? This game gets -10 stars in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This is by far the biggest let down in all of video game sports history. I dont understand how this game made it to the streets. The game is in no way playable. I feel like Sega beat me out of 50 dollars and I deserve that back with an apology.

You can't control the fielding until the computer catches the ball (then you can control the player throwing it),2. The replays are repetitive and boring, but at least you can turn them off. 3. Throwing the ball to the bases is kind of tough because instead of pushing buttons that resemble bases like in other Baseball games, you have to put the analog in the direction of the base, hold it there, and press A.Besides those problems, I liked the game.

I'm not one for writing reviews on Amazon.com, but I wish I read some before I bought this game. The graphics are very good at first, but they repeat themselves, and they get boring FAST. I've played the game over and over, trying to make myself think that maybe somehow it wasn't a complete waste of [money].My advice? If you see this game on sale for ... somewhere..... You'll still be disappointed by it. Order a pizza."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Don't Do It!","review":"Watch out! This game is awful. The graphics and commentary are buggy to all ends. This game was completely rushed out the door, and as a result, suffers immensely. The graphics are 'sometimes' nice, but the crowds look like something off of Genesis. The fielding is atrocious (you can't even control your fielders! the computer does it for you!), there is no home run derby, almost no options, a skeletal season system (that has no career mode, just one season) and the music and sound effects sound like something from the original NES days. What a horrible disappointment. Do not buy this game! Show Sega that they can't just put a sub mediocre product on the market and expect everyone to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Gamers beware","review":"This game was not worth the wait. It earned 1 star due to good graphics. Game play is horrible, no control of the players playing the field, no homerun derby, no franchise, no batting practice, game play is very sluggish, poor stats and to top it off instant replay cuts off very quick. This game was not designed in the states and it shows. When batter is at the plate it is very difficult to aim where you would like to hit the ball, when the pitcher throws the ball it is very difficult to determine if the ball is a fast or a curve. I have been playing video game for 18 yrs and this is so far one of the worst I have ever played Triple play 2001 is way better aside of graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment!","review":"After all the hype surrounding this game, and how well the WSB games were in the past, this just doesn't measure up. Sure it looks great, but you can't even field! The computer does that for you. It also decides how fast you'll swing your bat, and how late it should delay your fielders from reacting to the ball. With another person it's pretty fun, but by yourself the computer cheats wores than in NFL Blitz. Wait till ESPN's game comes out. It's good, but it's no NFL 2K"},{"rating":"1","title":"remarkably bad","review":"This is the only baseball game coming out for the Dreamcast this year. In other words, there are no baseball games coming out for the Dreamcast this year. I played this game for the first time today at a friend's house, and left very disappointed.This game is an absolute mess. Your control over your own players in this game rivals Virtua Striker for the title of Worst Ever. The graphics are 90% brilliant, but the 10% that aren't make this game look rushed. The gameplay adds to that rushed feeling, as the experience of playing WSB2K1 in two-player mode is servicable but not what you'd expect from the people who brought you NFL2K and NBA2K. The one player mode is so boring and weighted toward the CPU, it does not merit discussion.I know a lot of you will say \\"Who cares, it's baseball\\" and plunk down $50 for this monstrosity. I bought Virtua Striker 2 under a similar philosophy. Live and learn, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What had a chance a greatness falls short","review":"I was looking forward to this title. Being hyped as the best baseball game ever made I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, instead of following in the steps of NFL 2K, it takes the path of the mediocre NHL 2K. WSB 2K1 from the get-go looks rushed. The player graphics and the stadium graphics are superb individually but they do not mesh together and it looks very tacky and unrealistic. The controls are choppy. It lacks a fantasy draft which is what I was looking forward to the most. At least the rosters are fairly up to date. Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"graphics don't make a game fun!","review":"Well, baseball 2k1 has beautiful graphics, but graphics don't necessarily make a game fun. It's not possible to control your fielders retrieving the ball, the pitching has very little control, and batting is a total guess on where the ball will go. All Star Baseball 2001 for N64 will satisfy me untill Dreamcast comes out with a baseball game that is actually fun, not just visually pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the best they can do?","review":"wow, this game looks beautiful, i can see actual players faces! the stadiums look great, yippee! now try playing it, better yet, try fielding a fly ball...better yet, try playing a 9 inning game in less than half an hour! why dont i just take [money] and set it on fire next time...i couldnt get virtual tennis back in my dreamcast fast enough"},{"rating":"1","title":"I own and want to throw away this game","review":"Im not sure what game everyone else is playing but i bought this game on 7/21/00 and it is the worst game ive ever tried to play.

Sega told me to trade in game on money back its not defective, they are wrong the whole game is defective. Thank you 3do for Sammy Sousa High Heat 20001. Now thats a baseball game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god...","review":"This is the the worst excuse for a baseball game I have played in a long time. The graphics are obviously great, but that is all. The announcer sounds like a robotic dork, the crowd is a mess, it looks like a bunch of blobby sprites, and the gameplay is absolutely horrible. This is supposed to be a next generation game, yet you can't even control your fielder's! You choose which base to through to after they've missed the ball and jogged to pick it up, this is the very worst baseball game in terms of gamelpay that you can buy, period. The graphics do not make up for it. Avoid this game like the plague unless you like staring at nice player models on pause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this game. I thought that it took them so long to get the game out that it would be outstanding but falls short of mediocre. You don't even have control of the defense which is half of the game. Boring! Forget about trying to beat the computer in All Star mode. It can't be done. With a runner on first or second the second baseman stands near second base which you can't move him and the hitter will hit the hole between 1st and 2nd every time. The most disappointing is that when a runner is on first and the batter hits a pop up the 1st baseman won't catch it and it drops for a hit. No control of defense.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Bluff and no Stuff","review":"This game has great graphics, of course; but the game play is equally reciprocated. In this game you are only allowed to throw and hit. All the excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away. You cannot play defense at all! Your job is to throw in the right direction, but that is even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press the throw button repeatedly. Even if you get the throw off in time, your player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally attempts to make a tag; and by then it's obviously too late. Speaking of delayed reactions, the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the ranks of Genesis games. I would take the classic, \\"Bases Loaded\\", over this junk any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the naysayers","review":"I've read several bad reviews of this game so let me give you my perspective in thier conplaints. First the play by play is awful, I turn the sound down and listen to a cd. However no one ever bought a game because it had good play by play. Second, the fielding/batting/pitching engines are difficult because they are difficult in real baseball. I think it mirrors real baseball beacause it's hard to pitch and hit and field. To paraphrase the great Ted Williams, \\"The hardest thing in the world to do is hit a baseball.\\" So get over it and practice the game....It gets easier with practice. as for this so-called frame rate slowdown, no one seemed to notice it only slows down for close plays. To conclude, this game is very realistic and very enjoyable once you get used to its quirks. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because that style and realism first appeared in NFL2K. So it isn't revolutionary anymore. If you love videogame baseball, buy this game.....go Reds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is OK","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. Batting is VERY difficult. They put up the strike zone, but then give you no indication of where the pitch is heading until it is past you making it alomost purely a guesing game to try and hit the ball. I can't even tell you how disapointing it is that there is no Home Run Derby (I don't feel like playing a game all the time). The graphics are cool and the stadiums are up to date (including PacBell Park in SF).Overall, I'm bummed I bought this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointing","review":"This is easily the worst baseball game I have ever played. This game features diffcult feilding and almost impossible hitting. The graphics are subpar for the dreamcast format. The bottom line is dont buy this game dont even waste your money renting this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I love baseball games and this game is just bad -- How can you have a game where you don't even get to field? What was Sega thinking? Graphics a great but that does not make up for all the problems in game play. It is almost impossible to pitch anything but a strike right down the middle of the plate. Hitting isn't that bad rather interesting but very hard to get the hang of. My suggestion wait till ESPN Baseball come out is has to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster from top to bottom.","review":"As devoted a fan as I am to Dreamcast...Given the monumental achievements made with NFL-2K and NBA-2K, this game is an abysmal failure.And as much as it pains me to say this, even Ken Griffey's Slugfest for the Nintendo 64 is superior in game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Once you get past the awesome graphics, the gameplay on this game is very weak. The true test of a baseball sim is how much it can emulate the technical game of baseball, with all of its intricasies. This game falls short in so many ways it would take me hours to list them all. In a nutshell, the hardcore baseball fan will find this game very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible","review":"I'm the biggest baseball fan you'll ever meet, this game is pathetic.

But I was wrong the controls are horrible.To took me 5 innings to figure out how to swing the bat right. The annoncer bearly even talks. There is almost no music during the game. The best pard is you almost always hit home runs when you bat. But when your pitching you have no idea what type of pithch your thtrowing. The fealding it very hard to do. Im still playing tripple play 2000 for the pc that is way better. So stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looked soo good at first, What went wrong?","review":"A total waste of time!! Never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible. I got the game thinkin I could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game. But as I began to play a little and realized how bad the game really was I started to wonder if it was the same game as shown on the case? But after minutes trying to convince myself that the store had made a mistake packaging, I realized I made the mistake of buying the awful game. No lie here, the worst baseball game to date, hands down. Just take my advice, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever!!!!!","review":"This is simply a horrible game that makes you want your money back!!!!!!

Im pretty tolerable of game glitches, but this is pure crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"I've been touting the Dream Cast's sports game for some time now. Generally they are some of the best--NFL 2K, NBA 2K, Virua Tennis... I suppose it shouldn't come as a surprise that sooner or later I'd find one that isn't that great. And I'm not surprised it is the baseball game. Unlike football and basketball, there really is no movement in a baseball game, which I think is partially responsible for how much I dislike this game. Just being baseball itself. Add that to a difficulty in pitching and batting, and the problems with fielding a ball and you've got a game that isn't real great (I remember a nintendo baseball game that was more fun, even if the graphics weren't that great). I will say that the stadiums and graphics are beautiful, but it takes more than a pretty picture to make a fun game. And this game isn't much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this game...dont even rent it!","review":"this is the worst video game on the sega dreamcast console.

However, why would anyone design a game where you can't control the defense. Who's ridiculous idea was it to have the computer make the plays for you and only allow the game player to throw the ball. Stupid! This could have been a great game, but instead it's all but average. Cool graphics are great, but they don't make a great game. The game needs to be played, both offense and defense. Back to the drawing board for Sega."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Series Baseball 2K1 Continues The Tradition of Quality","review":"World Series Baseball 2K1 continues the tradition of quality and excellence set by its predicesors. The first time I saw a WSB game, it was on the Sega Genisis. The game looked spectacular, far beyond any game of its time. This game is the same. I had a chance to play this game and thought the same thing I thought about the original game. It is much better than any game I've ever seen. No PlayStation game even comes close to comparing to this game, and you don't even want to look at ESPN Baseball Tonight after you've seen this. It's like trying to compare NFL2K and QBC2000, also for DC. NFL2K beats QBC in all ways possible. If you want the best baseball game ever, you need to put WSB2K1 at the top of your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to pride?","review":"It's just ashame. In an obvious effort to satisfy a deadline Sega makes the mistake of pushing an unfinnished product out the door.

Sure its nice to look at but try playing it. You have no control over virtually every aspect of the game. B4 u buy it at least rent it first and see for yourself.

The graphics are choppy and any time you slide into a base or perform any type of action the game slows down terribly. The options (or lack thereof) are miserable. And the fact that you can't control your fielders AT ALL is the worst concept a sports game developer can come up with. If you decide to ignore my advice let me just say, \\"I told you so\\" the first time a pop-up is hit to your 1st Basemen and the ball lands 2 feet from him and the 2nd basemen has to run over to get the ball.

The roster is even so updated that David Justice is on the Yankees. The main problems are the slow down in graphics if too many people are on base, sometimes causing you to get out. The other main problem is that your base runners run even if your guy hit a pop fly, causing a double play for the comp. NO FIELDING I might add! The comp controls your outfielders but you throw the ball to your choice base. This is a good game for baseball fans. The season mode is fun, but there is no home run derby(boo hoo).

I was VERY disappointed with this game! It just isn't fun to play! Sure the graphics are pretty realistic, down to the player's faces, but that's the only strength of the game. The sound effects and announcing are terrible, the crowd in the stands looks very fake, and the game play is the worst. The computer does all of the fielding for you, including running to and catching all ground and fly balls. All that's left for you to do is to throw the ball after the play is done. What fun is there in that? I love making plays on defense, but this game doesn't even give me a shot! The pitching is pretty bad too, requiring you to aim your pitch and select the pitch speed at the same time. It just makes pitching harder then it needs to be. The hitting is ok, but not great.If you have Playstation too, stick with Triple Play. It is much more fun to play than this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freeloading Outfielders","review":"Graphics? Great. Controls? Confusing as all get-out. Fair warning: You can't control the fielders on your own. You have to wait for one of them to get to (or catch) the ball, then hope that you know how to throw it to one of the bases. That was one of the cool things about the previous versions of World Series baseball that Sega put out for the Genesis. It's a shame that you have to sacrifice game play just so you can see John Rocker's face in detail when he walks someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the dough!","review":"This game has absolutly wonderful graphics, I couldn't ask for more. But what this game doesn't lack in graphics it lacks in game play. The game doesn't respond as quickly as other baseball games that I have played. It has automatic fielding which means the computer does most of the defense. When the players through the ball it doesn't replicate the actual throwing motion of the real players also the trajectory of the ball doesn't look as acurate. Instead of a hard, fast throw it is more of a high, slow lob.In my opinion this game isn't worth the time nor the effort. I made a fatal mistake in buying this game.

But at least the Players in \\"Baseball\\" knew how to play baseball. The players in WSB 2K1 could be beat by a YMCA t-ball team. Why does my pitcher run to center field to make a catch? Why is my first baseman not trying for that pop-up by first base. Why Won't my shortstop throw to first? I dunno? And what is up with the pointless replays? I dunno how many more times I can watch a guy run halfway to first...At least you can turn those off, unlike the boring announcer I think they brought back from a genessis game.

They also failed in the multiplayer aspects of the game. I have two roomates, therefore most of our game playing is done in a multiplayer mode. Sega failed to allow the user to play any part of season play out in multiplayer mode, thus if you are looking to collect stats on a given team you must either play by yourself or grab a pencil and scorebook and track them yourself.They also failed to include some key elements of other successful baseball games (i.e. homerun contest, batting practice, etc..)Overall I think this game was rushed to be produced, and Sega felt the great graphics (which are truely great) would carry this game over its many flaws.To those considering a purchase: wait till next year..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baseball 2K1 Disappoints","review":"Since this is the ONLY baseball game available for Dreamcast and we had to wait until August to get it, I am amazed at the disparity between the best features and stuff missing in the game. While the graphics can be truely spectacular (they got Nomar's batting routine down quite well) and what got the 2nd star, there are action features that have been on other platforms for years, such as fielding, that are missing. My kids old version of Backyard Baseball on a 486 PC doesn't stall as much as the Dreamcast does with this game. The ability to take an extra base, throw out a runner trying to steal and getting the pitch where you want it seem always to be subject to chance when playing with multiple players.

Frank Sinatra had never forgotten the start of his musical career with Harry James and always called him \\"Boss\\" in the later years. He was America's favorite trumpet player in the Swing Era.This CD is a showcase of ten of Harry James' best hits. His instrumental treatment of the best tune in this compilation and my all-time favorite, \\"You Made Me Love You,\\" is simply fabulous and played with warm emotion. Recorded in 1941, it was the very same tune that made him a big star. Other highlights are \\"I Had The Craziest Dream,\\" \\"Sleepy Time Gal\\" and \\"Stardust.\\"There's something nostalgically beautiful about this CD that will take you back in time to the wonderful era of the Great Dance Bands.

As a graphic design student, I print a lot with this printer and find myself using $60-100 a week of ink that I buy at a discounted price. My classmates that have the 2200 report that they typically spend about $20 to $30 a week on ink (as they come with separate cartridges for each color), their print quality is better, and the 2200 seems to break down less. My printer is now broken and not under warranty and the repairs cost me $167.00. Most of the people that I know that have the 1280 have had to repair or replace it within the last 2 years. If you expect to be printing a lot, my advice is to spend the extra cash on the 2200 and you will make it back with the savings on the ink. Another piece of advice is to buy it at costco.

I bought the printer expecting it to print out renderings, plans, and presentations for school.My first problem is that it DOES NOT print borderless at 11 x 17. If you read the specs carefully you can determine this, but it isn't readily apparent. It prints borderless at every size except for 11 x 17, which is the standard presentation size in many design programs. Also, it takes almost an entire ink cartridge to get one good print - the ink is always smearing or leaving droplets of cyan or magenta on the page as it prints out.I think this printer was a waste of money, and if I had to do it all over again I would spend more money on a better quality printer, because I know I would save the money in the end on ink.In short this printer has been a source of frustration and a huge headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"This printer is crap.

Since I am the only drinker in my household, I can't finish a bottle each time and had to find ways to keep the wine fresh for a while. This vac Vin really worked well. The wine stays fresh for 4 to 5 days, just enough time for me to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works so far!","review":"I bought this because my old wine pump was absolutely terrible and could not keep any wine fresh, even for a day. This pump is much better and for $10.00 it is an exceptional value. I only gave it four stars though for two reasons (but this may only apply to my pump): There is never a \\"click\\" sound to let me know that it is finished. I always just pump until I am sure all of the air is out. Also, I read a few reviews stating that the wine stays fresh for a week or more. That is definitely not true. In my experience it only keeps the wine fresh for about 3-5 days max. These are only minor complaints though and for the price I still think it is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New version","review":"My old Vacu-Vin died a few weeks ago, so I replaced it with this new model.

The stamps are on squares of rubber w/ adhesive backing. The backing doesn't hold all that well and some have peeled off/fell off on occasion, the stamp characters aren't raised off their base very high and the ink isn't very... potent. So when you try for ink on the stamp you need to work to coat the ink on and when you stamp, you have to press so hard to get the character to fully transfer. When you press hard enough to do so, you get a back ground of the square stamp on your paper from the base stamping the paper.

An advantage of being retired is I have more time and hopefully more patience in trying to learn this thing. I am sure it will take time. The product itself seems well made.

This is a superbly directed, intensely shot, and above average acted rise and fall story of a famous British \\"gangster\\". Part bio-pic, part crime story, the tale of Carlton Leach is an interesting story that shows the violence and the grit of his criminal activities. It also does not shy away from the cruelty used in the criminal world which makes it that much more compelling to watch. I have also read Carlton Leach's autobiography, which indicates that this movie is suprisingly accurate. It is not true to the last detail but it is far more true than one would guess otherwise. If you like crime stories this stands very high, and absolutely needs to be a part of your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another dumb crime film.","review":"I found the main protagonist, and almost all the other characters, so unlikeable that it was hard to get into the film. I couldn't feel any empathy toward Carlton or care about what happened to him. It's the story of a large brutish thug who grows to become... a larger, more brutish thug. And there's really not much of a compelling story here, the conflict seems there only to set-piece moments of violence. There's no growth with these people, no one learns anything. It's kind of like watching a documentary about someone horrible, but with no narrator to provide subtext or to dig for deeper meaning you're left with watching this horrible guy do horrible things for two hours, which gets pretty boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is very fun and very easy","review":"I got this game for my birthday and I loved it.

Time, money and moldy spouts all down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have owned this sprouter for several years, and used it 3-4 times per year. I have had awful luck with it. Everytime the sprouts start to grow (after 3 days or so) they start to mold. I have run it through the dishwasher, used spring water and filtered water and no luck. I have even called the company and they told me I am using to much water? This answer was not helpful as I can grow sprouts in a sprout bag or quart jar fine.Save your money and buy a sprout bag or use a mason type jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy///1","review":"There is nothing in the design of this product that makes it work as a s sprouter. Thank goodness that I bought it at a thrift shop for under $2 and not new for $35! There is no way to rinse and drain the seeds and once I did that using a separate strainer the seeds proceeded to mold once placed on the trays and covered with the lid, I am assuming because the layers are fairly airtight along with there being no holes but the small one on one side of the trays. I am going to try drilling small holes in each tray and in the lid to see if this makes the seeds sprout without molding. Meanwhile you all go out and buy a different sprouter unless you have nothing better to do than play with sprouters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"I had high hopes for this sprouter. Unfortunately the design is flawed. The reasons are as follows: 1) the trays do not stack well, 2) little seeds get stuck in the drainage holes even though there are red plastic caps that should prevent this, 3) the red plastic drainage caps come off and are easily lost, and 4) unless you have a cool location, mold grows easily on the sprouts rendering them useless.My advice is to pass this one by and use a Mason jar. I'm currently using two pickle jars with their original lids. I simply poked holes in the metal lids and paid nothing for something that works better than this $40 Biosta Sprouter contraption. Too bad since they have a good idea that was poorly implemented. It's a miracle they can sell any at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor air circulation","review":"I borrowed one from a friend. It seems ideal for smaller seeds, like alfalfa & clover, but it doesn't get the air circulation, so the seeds molded before the sprouts grew enough to eat.The best sprouters I've used are the Sproutmaster trays or a fine mesh strainer set in a pot for drainage, or a fine-mesh (metal) coffee filter -- then you just rinse the sprouts often. If you don't get good drainage & air circulation the sprouts tend to taste a little bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal at best","review":"The sprouter is like a lot of others so to be fair the design is typical. The little red siphon caps color, (red), rubs off on your hands. The little siphon orfices don't drain well. The different trays are \\"tippy\\" in the base.The sprouts germinated fast. It is nice looking on the countertop. It really only needs two waterings for alfalfa, that was cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring read . . .","review":"Boring book, slooowwww plot!

Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, with an irritating heroine","review":"I wanted to like this book, being interested in the setting and time period. The plot had potential but the writing is stilted and the personality of the lead character makes no sense. I think the author was trying to make her appear conflicted and multidimensional but she seems naive to the point of social-retardation to me. Also, paraphrasing the book, another character calls Leigh a person who fits her times. Well, I thought just the opposite. She's judgemental, prudish, boringly-conventional, and completely out of place in the 1960s. For that reason and others, this book captures none of the magic and excitement of the time period in which it was set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classically Bad","review":"This is one of those movies that is really hard to review. It's either a no star movie, or a five star movie. This might be the single worst movie of all time, however, it's so bad that it's hilariously funny. Every time i've rented it, and yes i've rented it more than once, everyone of my friends who've watched it have laughed until they cried. Essentially a take off on \\"The Warriors\\" this movie is so bad it makes \\"The Warriors\\" look like Masterpiece Theatre. My favorite part is when the main character, Trash talks about how New York is deserted and has been for years and in the background you see rush hour traffic moving back and forth on the Brooklyn Bridge.So, if you are in the mood for a really, really bad movie that will most likely make you laugh like crazy, you might give it a try, but don't say i didn't warn you. This movie is a turkey with all the stuffing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"Campy, charming, and stylish, 1990: The Bronx Warriors is one of the best things to come out of Italy since The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Lots of great action scenes with obvious choreography which parallel's Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS, and a lot of Enzo G. Castellari's usual style and slow motion. The story does get slow at times, but is worth sitting through for the show-stopping finale. This movie was heavily cut for US release, so I advise you to track down an uncut, letterboxed version of the film. The Sergio Salvati photography is much more suited by the widescreening than full frame.

Lydia is portrayed as a compulsive, emotional over-eater, when study after study has shown that many fat people do not eat any more than average people, and often are persistent dieters. The film also comes down on the side that Lydia needs therapy - it portrays sizism as an issue that must be dealt with internally, rather than dismantling society's prejudices. If any other group of people facing discrimination were told to seek therapy and self-help, we would recognize that attitude alone as an extreme prejudice, much less the problem of failing to recognize the very real prejudice that leads to internalized oppression. This film portrays the leaders of the fat acceptance group as being extremists instead of being needed social reformers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I got bored with this movie and could not even finish it. There is ignorance on both sides of the fence, whether in regards to the anorexic woman or the obese woman who doesnt understand you dont have to starve yourself to be thin. There is even a scene where the obese woman announces a fat acceptance walking group to her support group, and she is ridiculed because apparently walking means that you are caving into society's ideals of beauty. I guess being active and eating healthy means you hate yourself, according to those idiots. At times the movie seemed poorly filmed and the dialogue was overdone or overly boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Must-See Film","review":"This was one amazing film, and one everyone should see - fit, fat or in-between. It brings up a lot of interesting subjects and surprised me in that early on it becomes clear this is not a movie about making overweight women feel proud of themselves. It also doesn't really answer any questions - what it does is make you think: about how you view yourself and how you view other people, and this includes the overweight as well as the underweight.

He makes his case very convincingly; while Britain would certainly have fought under a number of possible wartime PM's (Anthony Eden, perhaps, or Lord Halifax), the personal leadership provided by Churchill was critical to Britain's success.The book assumes a good working knowledge of the players involved and of the period; this is a good book for a World War II history buff, but is not intended to be a primer. This aspect of the book makes it difficult for novices; after having read Churchill's 5 volume history of the war and half a dozen other works, I understood the nuances of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The human side of Hitler?","review":"A gifted writer and historian, Mr. Lukacs writes a thought provoking differing view of Hitler then is untypical of most books about Hitler. Gone is the rug chewing, temper tantrum throwing, maniac I was used to reading about, and in his place, a cold, calculating, revolutionary Hitler emerges, who frets and worries, makes right and wrong moves, and is good at reading everyone but himself and Churchill. The portrait of Churchill is more conventional with Churchill being the great wordsmith and indomitable soul of Great Britain.A caution should be added: bone up on your vocabulary or have a good dictionary within easy reach when reading this book. The author is erudite and a master of his subject matter but it is ,at times, a bit difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agian will change your view of history","review":"This book fills in the gaps one might have about the years 1939 to 1940 about the British-German front.

This set is very fun because it gives you all sorts of extras. All the various wares for the shops sit loosely around in some cases so you have to be careful not to misplace them.

I had hoped with his association with Sandburg... Plus I had previously read \\"Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight\\" which is a superb poem. And \\"The Congo\\" has a great reputation. Lindsay's poetry just wasn't all that great--and I'm not saying that because of the performance pieces.

The descriptions make these films sound like very enjoyable viewing especially if you like to see sexy legs. Are these rated R or X? How's the photography? How is the sizzle factor? I have seen a few of the R/X rated strip shows here on amazon. So far the best was Sara St James. check out my review. Sara St. JamesAgain, I apologize that this is not a review but please post some feedback and let me know if you have seen this movie.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Very few shows make me laugh aloud nowadays, but this one got belly laughs! Just when Howard fixes one mess he somehow gets himself into another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Britcom","review":"I'm a huge fan of British comedies from Monty Python to The Royale Family. So, I had great expectations for TWWML. I was disappointed from the very first scene. It was an almost exact replica of a scene from Bridget Jones' Secret Diary. That's the main problem with this show. Like so many sitcoms before it, there's absolutely nothing new here. A prime example occurs when the main character lets a secretary try on his fiance's ring which has been in the family for years. Guess what happens? Hmmm. The same actress who plays Jane in the excellent series Waiting for God plays the secretary but, I'm afraid her talents, like everyone else's are wasted with this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This does not contain any original recordings. If you buy this, you'll regret in 3 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The entire band is not here.","review":"This is more of a Mark Lindsay reprise of PR&R greatest hits - not the original recordings. He does a fair job, but the music lacks the style and punch of the original band - especially on tracks like Let Me and Him or Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Original Tracks!!! (Be Warned)","review":"I am a \\"Raiders Fan\\" from way back but this is the \\"weakest\\" album of their music I own. These tracks are not as well done as the originals. The low price of this CD says something! Definitely look at the other CDs listed here for better representation of this terrific '60s band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This recording, in no way compares to the originals!","review":"I have been a Paul Revere fan since they gained fame in the mid sixties.It is only for this reason that I am so generous with my rating of two stars.Mark Lindsay's voice is not as powerful as it once was.He also seems unable to hit some of the high notes.Even though you can't beat the price, I would not recommend this album to anyone. Play it safe and stick with the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"$15 doll .79 book","review":"Just an FYI if you order this \\"accessory\\" version of the Paper Bag Princess you will get the .79 edition of the book (very small paperback). I was unpleasantly surprised by this when my order arrived. The small book isn't big enough to hold a child's interest, although the doll's box sort of vamps into a stage on which to act out the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SAW THIS IN SPANISH, AND I STILL HATED IT TO DEATH!","review":"YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY WATCHED THIS AWFUL AWFUL MOVIE IN SPANISH. AND EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD THAT WAS BEING SAID, I WAS BORED BY ITS FIGHTS ALONE. THE REASON I CANNOT TELL YOU THE PLOT IS BECAUSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE DIALOGUE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, FROM WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I SAW SOME OF THE WORST KUNG-FU FIGHTING EVER. BRUCE LE SEEMED COOL, BUT, THE FIGHTS HE DID IN THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY LOW-QUALITY. I REGRET EVER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD THAT WHEN I SAW IT IN SPANISH ON CHANNEL 47 IN NEW JERSEY, I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA WATCH THIS VIDEO TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CHARACTERS WERE REALLY SAYING. IN ANY LANGUAGE, THIS IS DEFINITELY A KUNG-FU MOVIE YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANNA SEE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and enriching!!","review":"This is as satisfying as a book can get. I had a hard time putting it down once I started. The narrative is spiced with brilliant word-pictures and dialogue that will bring smiles to your face. As well as entertaining, it unfolds the drama of life for the Creole in Martinique. Well worth it to pick up this book and give yourself a superb treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book not worthy of Subject","review":"I admit it, I'm a huge Beck fan. So I was disappointed in this effort. The book relies on all the old magazine articles and websites as its sources. It would have been more effective, and interesting, had the author interviewed Beck himself, his family, band-mates, and music critics. For those who are interested in Beck's multi-talents, check out the book \\"Playing with Matches.\\" Though not a book directly about Beck's music, it does give an interesting back ground on his artistic influences, namely his grandfather Al Hansen. One final note, while I feel that the writing was vague and magazinish, the photographs were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Camera","review":"Love this. My daughter LOVES it and loves taking pictures with it, and playing the games on it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"pictues come out blurry","review":"The pictures comes out blurry and it take 4 AAA batteries. You have to constantly buy batteries. I will probably in a year spend more on batteries than i did for the camera itself. But my 4 year old daughter likes it and feels independent with it, so it serves its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable - yes, camera - no","review":"This camera is very durable, but the pictures are so bad who cares. My daughter desperately tries to make use of it, but gets depressed every time she sees what kind of pictures it actually produces. Most the time it's hard to even tell what she took a picture of. I guess Fisher Price put so much effort into making it tough they forgot that it was actually supposed to function as a camera. It might as well just be a block of wood painted to look like a camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"f/p camera","review":"Rate it at 4.5 stars. Well made. Good pictures. Takes a little to get the kids started, but great after that.Grandpa Bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for Kids and Fabulous Customer Service","review":"We have had these cameras for our children for almost a year now. The kids still use the cameras all the time. How many toys can claim that? We did have a small issue with one (the first edition), however, Fisher Price's customer service had been great to deal with and a replacement camera (new version) is in transit (took about 6 weeks to get). Highly recommend, even with the small glitch we experienced. Plus, you can always use on vacation when you forget yours...we have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible!!!!!","review":"This is a horrible camera I can't even see half the pictures there just either pure white or dark and grainy. Do not buy from valley tech toys they have a 40% restocking fee if it's open. Well of course you have to open it to realize what a piece of crap this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Tough","review":"I bought this toy for Christmas last year and by February I exchanged it at the store because the sounds quit working. That wouldn't be a big deal except you need the sounds to know when the picture is taken, thus keeping the camera still and keeping the pictures from being too blury. The picture quality is ridiculous. Now the second camera is broken. My daughter was 6 at the time and treats her toys very well. I thought it would hold up better, given the title and the commercials showing it being dropped down stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"My son recieved this for his birthday. Takes HORRIBLE pictures. In many we can't even make out what they were. Viewfinder is inaccurate resulting in many chopped off head shots. After using it a few weeks it sometimes wouldnt start up properly, sometimes would. For the price I was very disappointed. Also, it comes with a usb cable but when plugged in my computer couldnt find a driver for it and there doesnt seem to be any available. My son didnt seem to care about the picture quality and had fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera!","review":"This camera is truly a worthless piece of garbage. I agree with all the other reviewers who say that durability is meaningless when the photos this camera produces are as foggy as pea soup. Seriously, you can not make out a thing once you've snapped a pic. I bought this camera for my child over two years ago and am STUNNED that this product is still on the market. You might as well take a kleenex box, cut a hole in it and paint it pink. You'd end up keeping the same number of photos: NONE (since you can't make out a thing on the Kid Tough one) and it would be a whole lot cheaper. Take it from me -- you'll have buyer's remorse if you shell out for this complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for first camera","review":"It's amazing how easy it is for my five y old daughter to use it. She found how to use it right, to delete pictures she didn't want any more very fast. The quality of pictures is very low, but that is not so important at her age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but the quality is not that Great","review":"We gave this camera to my 3-year-old for Christmas. She loves the camera. It is easy for her to use, and the buttons are easy to understand. The double-eye view finder is nice and the on-screen view is nice, but the pictures are just not the best quality. Most of them are too dark or overexposed. As much as she loves the camera, I am still not sure if we will keep it or return it for one that is cheaper, and takes better quality pictures (not a kids camera). Fisher-Price didn't put much effort into this camera. It's sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"With a working flash, a double view finder, a larger (than the older version) display, easy to work controls to scroll, delete and turn on and off, it's approx. 60 picture internal memory, the durability and attractive look for a toddler; there's only one more thing that you could ask for and that's a bit better picture quality. The pros FAR outweigh the con. To me, it was just a bit pricey, but I think we have gotten what our money paid for! My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this, and out of everything it has already become her favorite gift, the strap never leaving her wrist! She LOVES seeing her pictures, and taking pictures of everything, including little piggy-toes, the wall, or the dog's tail! LOL.This is a big hit in our home.... Though where I bought my new version of this item, it was $69.00, so shop around for a good price. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This camera is a great idea. My daughter has fun with it but the picture quality is so terrible that I don't understand the point. If she did happen to take a good photo it is useless. You can barely make out the image it is so dark. It really is a terrible camera. If you just want a pretend camera for your kids that clicks and makes noise I think you can find something else for a lot less money. The picture part of this camera is pointless. Don't waste your money. Fisher price should be ashamed of producing such a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY","review":"I bought this camera for my daughter's 4th birthday. I liked the pink color and the looks of it on the picture. When I started to use it I noticed that the picture quality was horrible. I could not identify the person in the picture. After reading the instruccions I noticed there was a setting to make the picture quality better. SO I put it on that setting. IT DID NOT HELP... still the people in the photos were irrecognizable. Would not recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"We got this camera for our 3 year old, because she loves to take pictures with our digital camera. However, the quality of the screen viewer is so bad that she doesn't really enjoy snapping a shot and looking at it the way she does with our camera (and that is what she loves). So, it doesn't quite do the trick. Also, when you look through the viewfinder what you see doesn't match with the photos the camera takes, which is also annoying and hard to remember as an adult, let alone a 3 year old.she does use it now and then, but not as much as I had hoped. We'll likely give her an adult camera soon - probably when we upgrade.I will say it is as tough as nails, though! And that's good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use, inferior product that your kids will love.","review":"My five year old loves to take pictures with our \\"grownup\\" camera and, amazingly, sometimes the pictures come out really well. Because of that, her grandmother bought her this camera since it seemed like it would be easier to use and more durable. You could probably drop this thing from the Space Shuttle and it would survive the impact, but it produces such awful pictures that it's not worth saving any of the photos taken with it.Of course the kids love this camera because they don't know any better and it is, admittedly, a lot of fun to play around with but it is honestly one of the most disappointing toys I have ever seen. I would hate to reward Fisher Price for producing something that, while fun, is such a piece of junk otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a TOY, not a camera!","review":"I was quite disappointed when testing the camera prior to giving it to my four-year old daughter. The picture quality is terrible. I don't think we will be keeping many of the 480x640 pixel, grainy images. However, my daughter absolutely loves the camera; it has become her favorite toy and she loves taking pictures of everything! She isn't a critic of the quality, so maybe I shouldn't be, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We looked everywhere for this camera for my son last year for Christmas. We finally found one, but I wish we hadn't. It is a nice concept. I like the way it is built for kids with a double eye viewfinder and it is durable, but the picture quality is terrible. There is no reason why Fisher Price couldn't have made the camera to take decent pictures. These aren't even worth having printed. I wish we would have bought a regular digital camera instead. At least my son would have pictures to show and be proud of. Definitely not worth the [...] we paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"My 6yr. old daughter was so excited to get her first real camera. She was ecstatic when she began to use it. However, she was smart enough to realize that the picture quality totally stunk! Yes, she got to push the buttons on her own and take her own shots, but she also wanted them on the computer to look at. The pictures were horrible. This would be more suitable if she was three and didn't understand that the pictures go somewhere after the camera. It's a lot of money to pay for just another \\"play\\" camera. The camera has definitely held up well and still works, but it is definitely not close to a real camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNKY HUNK O PLASTIC!","review":"Do not waste your money. Sure, my daughter who is three was so excited to get her own cam and so was I until I looked at the pics. There is no reason why they at least cant be viewable. There is basically no point in even looking at the pics since you cant even make out any of them. Yes, the quality is that bad. This thing was not cheap and I just dont get it. She wanted to see her pics later and I showed them to her and her smile turned into a frown and she just kept asking to see her pics and I kept telling her over and over there they are!!!! She thought I had lost my mind. My cam phone takes pics 100 times better than this. Look if your kids are this age just give them one of your old digitals. My daughter has never dropped mine and if she does I dont really care since its my old cam. Otherwise go out and buy them a ton of those cheap disposables or a regualar digital one for half the price. Trust me on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Little Ones","review":"I bought this for my almost 4 year old daughter. She loves taking pictures with our camera and I wanted her to have one of her own. It is very easy to use and I like that she can hold the camera and push the button with ease. If your child likes taking pictures (of everything and anything) I recommend this camera. A little pricey but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Useful","review":"I gave this camera to my granddaugher for her 3rd birthday.

With some practice and training from her mother, I am sure she'll get better. But it gave her great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Tough Digital Camera","review":"This is a great camera for a little one. My daughter is only 3, but she can take pictures with this camera. Before I saw her use it, I wondered if she was too young for it, but she really does well using it. It takes pretty good pictures too. I think the two-eye viewfinder makes this the best kid camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera for a child to learn on!","review":"This camera is excellent for a child to learn how to take pictures properly without cutting heads off or taking pictures of the sky!! My daughter absolutely loves it and because she can see what she has taken on the screen, she takes more time over actually taking the picture. The viewing screen is not as clear as a normal camera but then the camera does not cost as much!! It is very durable and can be dropped, kicked, you name it which is excellent for my 5 year old and stops her wanting to play with my expensive camera (thank God). All in all well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Helpful illustrations.

For anyone who can't visualize sixty-nine small sheets of paper, it's about as thick as a quarter, little more than a pamphlet. It's got an overview on different knives, and basic instructions, with semi-helpful pictures, but not much else. The last few pages are dedicated to a minibiography on the author, and color photos of his knife collections. I found the most useful part of the book to be the 'section' dedicated to designing a target. As for throwing itself, I found more useful material on YouTube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... Almost a complete waste of time...","review":"This teeny 60-page pamphlet spends the first 30 pages telling you how great of a hobby knife-throwing is, and then provides instructions on how to build a large wooden target. Then it spends about 5 pages going over the same basic throwing concepts, then spends page after page espousing the virtues of EVERY KNIFE Hibben has every designed or licensed. Then they wrap it up with a flowery epilogue of just how great a guy he is. What an unconditional WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This did not meet expectation. Nothing useful in the book that is worth the money. You can find these basic and I mean really basic stuff here, probably on line search somewhere. It is not even that big, 60 pages, each page of 6 X 3inches.

Of course by now you've heard about the great graphics. Okay, I'll give you that, but I want a game not a movie, so I care about how it plays and that's where 'Shenmue' falters. The gameplay consists of punch-punch-kick style action and at times it's restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene. 'Yawn'. I actually dropped off a little during part of it; no joke. While it is certainly a technical achievement, it's more movie than game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring period.","review":"I bought this game after reading all the wonderful reviews it gets. Now I know I won't be very popular in saying this, but this game [is not very good]! It's true. I played it for a few hours the first day I got it and haven't played it since, I wish I rented it first. All you do is walk around and talk to people following a confusing story line. It made me get bored with the quickness. Where's the nearest pawn shop, cuz I gotta dump this [game]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Swallow The Hype","review":"Well I have to tell you that I couldn't wait to get my hands on Shenmue. Then I did get my hands on it and I was quite disappointed. How long can you walk around and have the same people tell you that they will talk to you tomorrow? Don't get me wrong, the graphics are incredible on this game. Better than any of the current PS2 games that are out there, but it just didn't live up to all the hype given to it. Some people love it. Some people hate it. I found that it is a beautiful game and a kool concept, just not for everybody. And mine and my friends both started freezing up at load points. So, on a final note, I think that shenmue is a testimonial that game companies should stop worrying about how kool the games look, and focus on just giving us good games with good plots. Like how about some more F.F. games. PLEEEEEEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GET!!!!","review":"Well when I saw this game it looked pretty cool. But once I started to play it, it was really boring. Yeah, it does have cool things like the graphics are awsome and they talk. The story line is pretty good. But still dont get this game, the only thing you do is talk to people the whole time. There isnt really lots of fighting, which is the funnest part of this game. You only fight like 10 time or somthin like that. At the end of the game you just leave for HONG KONG and that is it. Then you have to buy SHEnmue 2 and they don't have english versions only japanese. If you like talking only I recomend this game but if you like action DO NOT GET THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS REVIEW","review":"Yu Suzuki changed the world of sega with Shenmue. This adventure, fighting game sends you on a trip you will never forget. This action packed game sends you on the edge of your seat. This high drama sends you into the world of Japan having you meet new people trying to find the man that killed you father. This game brings you into a real world with real citys. I checked it up. This game changed the world of Dreamcast and all Sega systems. You get to handle forcklifts and get to go against gangs like the MadAngels and tough sailors at bars. This game is rated T for teens but im only 12 and i've beaten Shenmue and Shenmue 2. Meet anonymous characters like Ryo Hazuki, Ine-san, Fuku-san, Iwao Hazuki and Master Chen.

It is so complex. It is like you are living the life of this boy in the game. It is such a beautiful and realistic Japanese world. Everything is so real in it. Not only being detailed and beautiful, this game is so much fun and it never gets boring. It's not like some old boring RPG, there are always places to go, things to do, and many people to meet. The fights are awesome too. It is just so cool. This is no dought the BEST game of all time. It even has a whole big bonus disc called Shenmue passport that does all kinds of things. I really can't even put this game into words; you just have to buy it and experience it for yourself, you are going to love it. You can get it here on Amazon.com ... It is really worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an Experience","review":"Playing this game is like playing a good movie. Avenge your fathers death. Its the best game i have ever played on any console. You can interact with just about anything you see in the game. You can go in the arcade, buy drinks from vending machine, and even go shopping in the stores. Everything is realistic. Magic weather lets you play a part of the game while it's snowing, but when you play the game a second time (which you propably will!) it may be sunny at exactly the same scene. This game has it all. Elements of roleplaying, action, adventure, and arcade. I highly reccommend this game to anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best game","review":"wesam (five stars)( shenmue) Unique game, funny,big environment, best role action adventure game.we need more games like it in future. it deserve five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will change the way you see RPG","review":"This is by far the best game ever! There are hundrends of people you can talk to, fight, get really mad at, and feel sorry for. My friend told me not to lock myself away in my room until I beat the game...but I did it anyway. This game makes you want to keep on playing. I thing the best part about this game is that every person in the game lives there own life weather you see them or not. Another great feature and as far as I know... a completly origianal feature, is you get a job, and you can get paid or even get a raise (depending on how hard you work!) Thank you Yu Suzuki!!! For making the best game EVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"I love this game its probobly my favorite game. This is a must on anybodys list.

A Breakthrow","review":"Ok if you don't have this game and you are wondering if you should, stop wondering and starting counting your money. The game is the best thing to come to dreamcast since the 2k series.If you like games that are tough but aren't imposible to beat this is your game. If you like stupid invaders or other games that have mind puzzles you'll like it. It's not all about skill, you also need to use your head. This game is great. I am playing for the second time and still loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game except one thing.............................","review":"Shenmue is one of the best graphics games ive ever played on dreamcast. You get to go and fight a group of angels that are mad (lol). I think this should be one of the best games for dreamcast except one thing made it so incredibly stuped. DUH! The game is way too short. 3 discs should be alot but they are not. This game is about Ryo Hazuki from the Hazuki Dojo in Yamanose. His father was murdered by the secret man Lan di sama. He is Ryo's main target for revenge so he tries to kill him. (And for people who want to fight him you dont get too). Lan Di will not fight you until a girl named SHENHUA Jona meets you and you destroy him. There are 16 Shenmues if im correct. This game is great but its too short. And the weather and time are very accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is truely THE BEST yet for Dreamcast!","review":"There is no way to explain how good this game is. Three disks of exellent game play in a totally cool 3-D world. This is the ULTIMATE Dreamcast game! It's so lifelike it's hard to beleive! My sister bought this game used about a month and a half ago and I haven't stoped playing yet. I also still haven't beat the game. It's a little hard to find your way around and know where to go but that just makes it more challenging which is better.I can't think of one bad comment for this 3-D Adventere, real life fighting game. It's so action packed! I would buy it again if I had the money. I recommend this game one trillion percent! And I can't get any more Sincere that that!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG....period","review":"shenmue is a great story about a teenager out to get his father's killer to get his revenge. theres plenty of street fights and awesome moves. the game can be slow and frustrating in some spots, but thats how RPGs are. graphics are ok, could be better, but thats probably the best the Dreamcast can produce....since we are so used to better graphics. BUY THIS GAME, YOU WONT REGRET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats wrong with you people","review":"This game is simply amazing. The game has incredible depth and has multiple story lines. For example, if you are ... and you can't fid the second mirror, Lan Di comes and kills you. Later in the game you get a job as a forklift driver. If you do it worng, it becomes a forklift sim. But it can be fun...The games graphics are awesome. Only one problem. For some reason no one can ever get hair to look right... Oh well..The soundtrack to the game is pretty much pointless in that it is just random.Little extras in this game make this game great. For example, being able to play pool. The interface kind of ... but it is there. Another one is being able to play old sega and made up games.One more problem is it too realistic. This might not seem like a problem but it is. At first it isn't a problem, but when you have to wait until 12 o clock, and it is 8, it takes a while because you can't fast forward time.Minor errors aren;t enough to hurt this classic action/rpg game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game","review":"if you are a gamer that like to play games that uses a real world enviroment and like the idea to see around and think what you going to find is what you are specting then this is the game for you. Shenmue uses a great F.R.E.E world enviroment that make you interact with almost anything in the game, the grafics are amazing and with a rich detail, the story line make you keep playing for hous and hours and hours. Altought I think this game is for older people who, knows what going on in the game and the story line, young kids may find this game boring for the reazon of been asking people all over the town to find a clue for the next step on the game, but that doesnt't meand that they can't play this game, I recomend this game for people who likes to spend hours on front of a tv playing. I hope the socond part be as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the control, really","review":"Shenmue is just like an interactive movie. The graphics are excellent, and they suck you in. Like, for example, when the weather changes, the whole atmosphere changes. The only problem is the control. It takes a while to actually get Ryo to not walk into walls and people. But, the sound, graphics, game play, and story line are great. If you are a fan of RPG's, fighting games, and really great games period, buy this one; trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shenmue the best game ever","review":"Shenmue is just one of those games that personofies a system.

But interestingly enough, almost every reader board I have seen on-line has expressed a very different opinion: This game was terribly disappointing. I'm an RPG fan, so I'm used to running around towns and talking to people, but when you're FORCED to do this for HOURS on end without any action, it gets tedious...and more tedious...and frustrating...and finally, you want to throw your Dreamcast out the window! I honestly think that the only reason this game received such great reviews was simply because it was one of the first RPGs on Dreamcast. Now that Grandia II, Phantasy Star, and Skies of Arcadia have been released, RPG-lovers have a MUCH better selection to choose from. Pick up one of those great games instead, and don't even bother with Shen Mue.

How much fun can walking around asking tons of people questions and getting the same answer be??? Ok the free battles are pretty fun, but then there is not really much to keep you coming back for more.

So many worlds to see and it is as if I am actually there. The graphics are excellent and everything is done and painstaking detail. You can go from looking at a phone book to watching a cockroach crawl across a kitchen counter. I think that anyone and everyone who has a dreamcast should get this one. There's even another chapter on its way to stores.Only on problem that I have found. Some rumors about the second disc not working properly, sadly is true. I had to send mine back and get it replaced. But don't let it get you down.

Nothing can compare to this.The enviroments are spectacular.

Sometimes Shenmue can get pretty repetitive, but it's still addictive, so be ready. I played it hours on end. Really the most dissapointing thing is the ending. When I \\"resolved\\" the problem, I was mad. You'llfind out why when you beat it. Shenmue is still one of the best games out there, so buy it if you have the chance.

You can also buy toys, play arcade games such as HangOn, SpaceHarrier, and more, you can also buy soda and you can also win things in the game such as a stereo and toys. The game took me 21 one hours of gameplay,I beat the game in one day but if you are a extreme gamer like me who when you play a game and doesnt stop until he beats it, you can also beat the game fast, but dont mind that it is an awesome game, great story and amazing graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shenmue","review":"Ok first off VERY VERY VERY good game I LOVED it only 1 prob.

The missions are dull with hardly any decent action. The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto. You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him. It always happens that his house is the last you look at. Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them. There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open.This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it, borrow it from a friend. If you don't have any friends, then only dish out the $6 to rent only if you think you might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very Pointless Game","review":"Please don't buy this game for your own good. Even though the graphics were great that wasn't enough to make this game great. All you mostly do is talk and once in a awhile you fight. The plot of the game was good but was really made me rate this game so bad is that they don't even let you finish it. I don't know about all the other gamers out there but I for one am a person who buys a game and expects to finish it and not have to wait for the stupid sequel. The games cliffhanger really did it for me but if you like waiting for a sequel or like cliffhangers in a game then this game might be for you. But if you want to finish a game without having to wait for a sequel then I suggest you just rent it and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good selections, lousy sound quality.","review":"While the songs were good, the sound quality of the CD wasn't.

For some reason, very few retailers have a universal AC adapter that gives the 5V choice anymore (most that I have seen do 3V, 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V. 9V, etc.). It is possible that some 5V devices would not be damaged by 4.5V in, but I don't think it is worth the risk for a $200 MP3 player.Anyway, the product lasted 2 months and then died.

Safe sex is important but a lot of the information about stds is unfounded and already obsolete.

First, it is nearly impossible to get the spinner to go fast enough to get the water off of the lettuce! That defeats the original purpose of this device. Second, it's rather small - you must wash and spin the \\"average\\" head of lettuce in halves. Third, although the outer shell is all stainless steel, the handle and the internal basket are just inexpensive plastic, just like any other spinner. The handle in my new unit has popped off a few times. I don't expect this spinner to last more than a year or two. I would avoid this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but kind of small","review":"This salad spinner is great for a very small head of lettuce, but cannot hold enough for me to buy a large one. This is a problem for us because we eat a lot of lettuce and can't hold a lot for a later time if we want.The other problem is that I was dumb and put the plastic lid that came with it in the dishwasher and it shrunk; it doesn't fit anymore. Other than that, it is a good spinner-- good system, and is easy to use. Plus, it is nice looking, which is always a bonus. The bowl is useful as a back up mixing bowl or a serving bowl if necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Item was not marked as MIU and appeared to be an extremely generic chinese knock-off.

After all the only part in the book that actually shows any cannibalism on Hadden's part was when he drank some blood and it was'nt even human. Don't get me wrong, he's still a sick son of a xxxxx and so was the rest of his family, except his sister, but if the author wanted to compare someone with Hannibal Lector it should of been Hadden Clark's Brother Brad.

I write to Hadden and he has never once shown that he has multiple personalities he was diagnosed in the navy because they wanted him out for wearing womens clothing.

Other books I had started to read on this field were boring and it was easy to lose focus. I would find myself pages ahead but realizing I hadn't caught anything of what I just read.

If you are interested enough in physics to be at this page, then reading this book is a no brainer. I will say that I read QED first, and that is Feynman's masterpiece. This work suffers by comparison only in that he is addressing underclassman and trying to get them interested in the big picture, whereas QED is the big picture.

One way that I have found to minimize this problem is, after failing a mission 3 or 4 times, stop for the day, and come back the next day and try again. This way you don't get too angry, and just stop playing.Overall the game is definently worth it's cost, and, along with maybe 2 or 3 other solid games, makes it worthwhile to get a dreamcast, even though the system is so old, and many of it's games are on other systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game....its a must play","review":"This game is hands down one of the best games i've ever played.

If you left one of these unattended, it could be potentially dangerous. I love the coffee, we still use the pot, broken lid, electrical problems, and all, but I'm not surprised I can't find it on the market anymore. We developed a habit of immediately turning the pot off after brewing to avoid the reboiling defect and I was actually going to try and buy another one, hoping that the electrical problems were just a fluke, but they seem to be gone.

But my real problem with this machine (and my reason for writing this review) is that while it is an excellent design, the manufacturing seems to be second rate. After about 6 months the electrical unit on the machine burned out. I called Bodum and they said the replacement part was back ordered. After waiting about 6 weeks I called them again and they finally sent me a whole new coffee maker.

The only complaint I have is that once you have a bit of stuff in the portfolio so that it bulges a little, it is hard to keep it closed. There is no velcro or anything on the flap to keep it shut. The position of the handles is supposed to do this work, and it does if you are actively carrying it.

This film is terrible. Even 'The Terror of Tiny Town' (a film I previously thought was the worst ever) has better acting. I keep my copy just to annoy people.Good SciFi has to be somewhat believable. This story concens a comet coming close to Earth and ripping it in two, then returning and putting it back together. Very campy. The military unit in North Africa reminds me of a Laurel and Hardy routine without the humor.And special effects? Exceedingly low budget. I give this film 5 stars because it's SO BAD it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never ending","review":"The Paris Lounge series has never ceased to impress me with its sexy sounds, and this compilation is no exception. If you were a fan of the former releases, this is a no brainer and even if you are just getting into the genre this is the perfect place to start. In all actuality, even though clearly thier are plenty of reasons to buy this album, \\"To fall by the way side\\" Is worth the price of the entire cd alone. The song sent shivers througout my exoskeleton when I first heard it and it continues to reverberate through my body when im not listening to it. It may sound like a stretch, but that song might have the best male falsetto I have ever heard in my entire life. Its bone-chilling.

I've played with others and am evious of everyone who has the red and black engine to join Gringotts and the Diagon Alley shops, to Hogwarts and the grounds. With the removable lid, and luggage ejection in the engine it's a pretty cool train and the platform stands out too. The sign hanging out, the luggage waiting to be loaded, the clock etc. But the thing that really does it for me is the secret door. A normal lego piece converted as though it were created for this soul purpose; a spinning wall, one side opening on to the muggle world, showing a train timetable, the other opening out on to the platform. How more realistic can you get. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very happy Christmas","review":"My daughter was so happy to receive this set for Christmas.

I have a T5 & friend has Zire 72, and the templates were ~3mm too small along the vertical and horizontal edge. If you buy this product, make sure you cut something larger than what the template indicates and just keep comparing it to your pda's screen.Also, I don't understand why I am forced to buy a pack of 13 protectors. On my last pda I kept the same plastic protector on my pda for over a year, and it was fine even though I use the pda a lot.UPDATE:I have since bought BoxWave.com's ClearTouch Crystal screen protector, been using the same one for a year without a single scratch or problem.

I also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size. I've tried an Invisible Shield screen protector, and it was tough as nails; the problem was that installation was difficult, and the tacky surface also produced input errors.

Seemed like it would make keeping your car clean an easy task.Followed their instructions very carefully. (I always do that before using any product).Used it on 2 german cars. Unfortunately in both the cases I see permanent damage to the finish.The spots looks like water marks.

While the band does a decent job of recreating the Kaempfert sound, in many spots the recording sounds like it was done in a barrel. It is a \\"live\\" recording, and one should be prepared to make some allowances, but this is just terrible. My advice is to buy the re-issues of the original works, and avoid this CD like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad for a cheap CD","review":"Remember, it's only $4 or so. The musicians themselves are great but the quality of the CD is lacking. Sounds like it was recorded on a tape player in Mexico and then transferred to a CD.

On the other hand, if you're adding to your Mexican collection, this one's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams of a High Fit Home","review":"I expected beautiful photographs of beautiful houses, and was not disappointed.

Ive only had them for a little while but if any issues arise ill post it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sun glasses","review":"These are great sunglasses nothing more to say. The chrome lenses are just like a one way mirror. The UV protection is amazing. theses sunglasses are honestly so dark you can look directly at the sun and on top of all that they look cool.

They were on time, they came faster than expected, they came in a square cardboard box, was sturdy, inside was just the glasses in a plastic wrap. They are mirrored, they look nice, they work, and of course, no one can see your eyes, when they look at you they see their face in the reflection. However I was a bit disappointed to see that they were a tad bit crooked, but its not noticeable. For the price you pay, these are amazing. Deffinetly worth giving a try if your looking for a pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pay what you get: Absolute Garbage","review":"Received sunglasses in small box.

However when putting them on they are awkwardly large, and I have an average sized head/face. The frame wasn't straight either, it took some bending to get them to sit level on my face, and the whole time I was worried they might snap. Also the nose rest isn't made well, even with some bending of the pads they still sit low and fall down the bridge of my nose easily. Overall, not worth the $4, you don't get what you pay for with these, you get less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"I received two pairs of these sunglasses yesterday in the mail. They are great had to bend the arms a little cause they were off. While you wear them you can totally feel they are cheap, but for 4 dollars they're not bad at all.

I received the other ones quite a bit faster. I was excited to try them on because I thought I would get a good deal... wrong. These practically fell of my face because they didn't fit. The plastic things that go on your nose weren't even so it was lopsided. I am disappointed with my order and plan to return them or give them to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems.","review":"I was so excited for these glasses. I'm Asian so my face is pretty flat and these looked straight across and even, symmetrical, yadda yadda yadda. Because of all the positive reviews describing them with larger lenses (a must for me) and overall decent quality, I thought, why not? Big mistake. When I got them one of the arms was stuck down so I almost had to break the glasses to even put them on my face. Next they do not at all look like the picture. They have a more black-metallic finish on the lenses and they are not shaped as the picture shows. The lenses are more curved at the bridge and around the face more. Also, for the life of me I cannot get them to sit straight on my face. No matter what I do, the left lens remains about a cm below the right. I suggest you go to target or the gas station to get your sunglasses, before buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage from Yagoozon","review":"Bought from Yagoozon because the price was right and Prime shipping was available. What a waste of time. Unboxed them 20 minutes ago and have already printed my return label. Shame that Amazon is eating the cost of shipping this trash in both directions. What arrived did not match the product description; the shape was similar, I'll give them that. The mirrored finish was lame, frames were all bent to hell, no cloth bag, etc. Seriously, if you're tempted, make sure you order from someone other than Yagoozon because what you'll get is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look okay, but are really cheap. Wont last long.","review":"The glasses i got arent quite as reflective as the picture but are still very shiny. They are VERY cheap tho.. One lense is constantly popping out part way and there is a sharp piece of metal poking out by the nose piece. These are great if you want a pair for your halloween costume but not for every day use. There is a spot on one lense that is not reflective and one of the bows has a kink/dent in it. neither of these make them unuseable but i expected better.Also, i took them off today and put one of the plastic ear pieces in my mouth while i got my keys out of my pocket (about 20 seconds) and the place where my tongue touched the plastic it got a strange tingly/numb sensation. I know they arent supposed to go in your mouth but this is a little worrying none-the-less.

The 1st day I wore them they were great. Good tint, great mirror lens, just overall good looking pair of aviators. When I went to put them on the 2nd day the screw popped out of the hinge and the arm fell off. Turned into a useless pair after that as there was no way to wear them. As with all things I suppose you get what you pay for, but this was my expectation when I bought them. I just wanted them to last the 8 days I was at the beach, but alas they barely made it 1 day.......update: upon leaving a review I was contacted by the company and was offered 2 pairs of sunglasses for the problem I had. The new glasses I have had for a week and they are holding up well. They do scratch easy, but other than that they seem very nice. I must have gotten a defective pair originally. thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap. Not nearly cheap enough.","review":"So, I bought these waiting for the sun. First, it turns out that if you stand in a shadow, you can't see anything. The lenses are awful for walking around, though they might be ideal if you do a lot of welding and hate those masks you wear when you do so to protect yourself from the light. Second, they feel and behave incredibly cheaply. Not cheap as in \\"Wow, I can't believe I got these for such a low price,\\" more \\"I can't believe I paid five dollars for these\\". The frame is chinsy and bends altogether too easily. Also, the parts of the frame that fold? They break. Mine were destroyed before I saw the sun. Overall, this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made, and I feel nothing but regret. Don't make the same mistake I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"When I ordered these I thought I would get something resembling the picture, well no, not the case. What I got were a pair that hardly fit my face, being bent up and to the right. After fighting to bend them back into place I put them on and the glare was massive, in full sun I could not recognize people any further than 15 feet. Driving with these things on, forget it I can't with all the glare.

These glasses are not those. The lens is very dark and reflective, but it is not a true silver mirror finish like you'd see in a mirror in a store. Also, they are sort of aviator-ish, but not really.

This concludes the positive portion of this review.These glasses are about as sturdy as a paper hat. One of the lenses popped out as soon as I took it out of the box. I managed to get it back in, but it's an ongoing problem. Also, the spring hinges do more bad than good; they're too weak, and when you wear the glasses, you feel like they're going to fall off your face because they sit too loosely. No amount of bending and reshaping of the frames fixed this problem for me.The lenses are perhaps TOO dark. When I drove while wearing these glasses, I found myself unable to read my own speedometer, even when I set the numbers to light up.I'd pass on these glasses if you're going to use them for anything other than a Halloween costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I got what I paid for for 4 bucks but they are not good at all.

I wasn't sure what to expect with such a low price. So they came in today (9/19/11) and I opened the box. As I tried these bad boys on, the left endpiece was missing a screw and it fell off. It's an easy fix, but as a new item, you would think it would not have come broken. So, I contacted Private Island and let them know about their dysfunctional product. They told me they would cheerfully send me a new pair, free of charge. Despite the faulty product, I'm still a satisfied customer.

I even went ahead and bought another pair just in case he breaks the first pair.The mirrored lenses are super mirrored, and they make it exponentially easier for him to drive during the day.We live in Miami, and these sunglasses have been a life saver. I spent over $400.00 on my brother this Christmas, I bought him video games, Miami Heat tickets.... the gift he keeps talking about? This $4.00 pair of sunglasses.As an added bonus for him, random girls at his job stop him to check their reflection in his sunglasses when he arrives at work.

Im leaving today and my good pair comes in tomorrow. For the price i figured these could hold me over for the week im gone. Well, The lense popped out and the center bridge has come apart after 2 days. I know they are $5 but was hoping for atleast a week. They are not very reflective and not very dark.

I do not recommend it at all. The glasses were crap. They scratched up, and doing so took off the reflectiveness. There were no hinges, no spring, and the glasses were small. They couldn't lay with the bottom of the lenses on the ground, they just fell backwards onto the top of the lenses. The glasses came low on your face too. The reason why I say came is because one day, I was putting the glasses away and with no effort accidentally snapped of an arm. This was only a week later btw.

The seller was Private Island. I saw these were about 4 bucks so I figured I would throw them in with my purchase. I would not recommend them. They're not worth it. They came in a nice small box and when I opened it the sunglasses were in a small baggy so I was thinking they should have been safe but it turns out it has a nice large scrape on one lens and the other has circular scratches around it. The adjustable nose pads are completely misaligned! The frame is bent on the top of one lens so it's at the point of popping out. Overall terrible construction. The lenses are dark like others have said but they hurt your eyes to look through them. Some say \\"you get what you pay for\\" I say they're definitely not worth it even at the low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice sunglasses","review":"First off, I bought mine from Gravity Trading.

The shape, however, is pretty perfect and the lenses are quite dark. People can't see through the reflective side at all.I've had a number of people comment about how awesome they look, and when I tell them how cheap they were, they freak.

I own several cheap pairs so that I can have one in each of my cars, a spare pair around the house etc... These sunglasses are pretty decently made for the price.

Well worth the $4-$5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I am not a sunglasses snob. If you are, I don't know why you are looking at $4 sunglasses to begin with. For those of us who aren't, these do the job. They have the same aviator look as more expensive pairs... they are just cheaper.Maybe they aren't going to last forever. But so far they have been working fine after several uses.If I had only one complaint (which I barely think can count against them at $4 a pair... after all, that's cheaper than ones you would find at Walmart), it's that they don't really stay up on my head when I put them up. The sides don't have an extremely firm grip when they are loose on my head. But they are great when they are on.Recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible glasses","review":"I received my glasses on time but thats no surprise with the quality of the glasses.

When they arrived, the lens weren't even placed right in the lens holders. No time to review or contact seller concerning this as we were leaving the next day for Disney. So my son wore them anyway on the trip in hopes that the lens would not fall out of the frames. Well, he wasn't that lucky cause out it came.

They came with cloth cases and everything. They were just the right size and were great quality for an even better price. Since I lost my pair and have the tendency to lose sunglasses somewhat regularly, I recently decided to grab a new pair and two back-ups. (May 2011) BAD IDEA. The price was still low but it was no wonder. I got three cheap, crooked, not even good enough to be costume quality sunglasses and not surprisingly, no cloth bags. The next time I need a new pair, I will NOT be buying them from here.

If I could have given 1/2 star, I would have. And then they were suppose to come with 2 pair of complimentary sunglasse, I only received one.

They look sweet if u can rock 'em but as you might guess by looking at the pricetag, they're rather cheap. The first day I wore them, i dropped them and the pavement made a scratch on the mirrored part. Other times I've had them other places and theyve gotten bent up and the lenses have popped out. I was able to fix them because theyre so easily bendable thou. Theyre nice. I still love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"After reading all of the glowing reviews for these whack glasses I have come to the conclusion that the reviewers are either from 3rd world countries or have never owned a pair of sunglasses before. You get what you pay for. And for 3 bucks and some odd cents, ya don't get much. These are basically sunglasses that you win at a carnival during a game of balloon pop. They are extremely poorly made, mine came scratched AND they sent them in an envelope with ZERO protective casing!!! It should also be noted that the glasses you get are NOT the ones pictured. The ones in the picture are silver looking but the ones you get are its ugly twin, dull and flat gray. Sure, these may be cool for Halloween if you're going as a hipster or Tom Cruise in Top Gun, but if you seriously intend on wearing these regularly, you will look like a complete d-bag. Seriously. Don't buy these, they are not worth the paper the money is printed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Dark and reflective","review":"these are pretty sweet. They're super reflective and it's almost impossible to see through them looking in. They're really really dark, so you can't wear them indoors (not sure why you would) and they aren't great for dawn or dusk. But when it's bright out, they're perfect.The only downside is that they do scratch pretty easily. I got 3 because they're cheap and other reviews said they scratch easy, and they definitely do. One of them was scratched when I opened them, although it wasn't that noticeable, but I can see the scratches adding up and being a problem if they get regular use.Good for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This voting system is rigged","review":"THERE IS NO WAY IN A HELL A NORMAL PERSON CAN RATE THIS 5 STARS! The glasses creek when you open them. They feel like flimsy plastic able to break at any given moment. I could see absolutely NOTHING!

I wanted something where you could not see through at my eyes...a true mirror lens. Upon inspecting them for less than five minutes I tossed them in the garbage. Oh well...$4.00 down the drain, who cares..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"These glasses are exactly what I wanted. Cheap sunglasses that will do the job.

Excellent deal but they do feel fragile. Also, it is a FULL mirror like the product description said! Very Happy :) Thank you 80's purple!-TimPS Took forever to ship though, but still got it in the allotted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sunglasses for the price","review":"By no means are they a sturdy, nice pair of sunglasses. In fact, they're light, seem to bend with the slightest pressure, and the lenses get very dirty with the slightest bit of use.So why did I give them five stars?The price!You can't beat these glasses for the price. If you have trouble keeping sunglasses in good condition, these are the ones for you. They do their job, they're inexpensive, and they look pretty nice.I've bought a dozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made","review":"I loved these glasses.

The glasses were broken and Amazon refused to send me another pair. The glasses suck and made very cheap. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty&Cheap","review":"They're pretty, but flimsy. Very light construction. The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it. It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off. Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Were Broke.","review":"Unfortunately I didn't listen to the reviews and it had alot of bad reviews. I took a chance and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Faulty Sunglasses","review":"These sunglasses arrived in the mail today, far under my expectations. I was anticipating a cheap pair of glasses, I'll give them that, but not horribly disfigured. The two lenses are almost a centimeter out of line, one bends inwards as well as outwards, and one of the lenses are tilted downwards. The two 'tear drops' are not symmetrical, and the two arms aren't at the same height. Unless you want to look like you've lived in Mexico your whole life, or you tried to make these yourself, don't buy these glasses. They are also not of 'Aviator' brand. They look nothing like the pictures! Don't even 'try' them - shipping them back will cost more than the product itself. They are generic, and extremely bad. For you're own good, Do Not Buy These...'things'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge","review":"Received these glasses fairly quickly because I use Amazon's Free Two Day Shipping.However, these glasses are huge.

I guess thats true, but if you want some sunglasses that are actually meant to be worn, dont purchase these. they look similar to the sunglasses in the picture but are not exactly the same.Not only is the quality terrible, but as I took my sunglasses out of the wrapping i noticed a scratch on one of the lenses! I dont care how much you pay for a pair, they should not arrive already scratched. If it was small and unnoticeable, i probably wouldnt care as much. But its not, its big and right in the middle of the left lens.The only reason i give the product two stars is because it shipped very fast, and came in a small thick cardboard box. I honestly think the box was made with better quality than the sunglasses. Overall, NOT A GOOD PURCHASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Avoid at all costs! Cheap material.

Live and learn I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Spectacular, but decent for the price.","review":"I'm giving this product 5 stars because for the price, it's just fine. Yes, the frames are light weight and bendy, but they look good and are extremely light weight. I bought these for a prop when I shoot models. For that function, they're perfect. If you want them for accessorizing then you'll be happy. If you want them because you need a good pair of sun glasses, you'll be disappointed. They are what they say they are and nothing more.Edit:Note also that even though these look like mirror glasses, when worn they don't look like mirrors on yuor face. Strange, but true. Also, tehy do not photograph as mirror lenses, but look like dark lenses in the photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"So DARK you can't drive with these nonpolarizing lens","review":"It's so DARK you can't drive safely with these nonpolarizing lens and even worse, bits of sun glares reflects off the back of lens into my eyes.

The mirrors are awesome and no one will ever see your eyes and they fit really well on your head.

His research is, by today's standards, minimal and is presented to support passe founding-fathers worship and his own normative approval of aristocratic government.

The author is NOT an experienced photographer, nor does the author offer any resonable, useful tips. Very outdated material also, from 1995-1999! Its not helpful for the serious digital or medium format photographer or even for an amateur. Its simply a waste of money.

This takes it to another level, Killoran is difficult, dark and full of issues and in spite of that the author writes him in a way that you can't help but underestand him, you can't help but fall in love with his story. I have to praise the author for this, because it is so hard to write a character with very few likable features and manage to make his love story believable. He does't change overnight, it comes so gradually that you feel it as a natural development of someone's personality, nothing is forced in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogynistic","review":"Anne Stuart has writing chops, but I can't get behind the misogynism that permeates \\"To Love a Dark Lord.\\" Uncle Harold tries to rape Emma at an inn; she kills him in self-defense. Killoran, bored but intrigued, rescues Emma by claiming he did it, and no one messes with Killoran. Killoran rescues her again and again while publicly seducing her. The heroine, Emma, is strong-hearted, brave, etc., etc., yet yearns for Killoran almost against her will. Lady Barbara is a slut, although eventually we find out why she has such low self-worth. Emma's evil cousin is a fanatic who hates Emma as the embodiment of female sexuality as much as she loves Emma's inheritance.In fact, every man, except the saintly Nathaniel, who meets Emma attempts to rip her bodice and \\"take her\\" to make her submit or to punish another man. Modernly, we call this attempted rape.Reading this book is like watching a train wreck. Turn away, please, there's nothing here to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"I love Randy Florke's style of decorating, but didn't enjoy this book. If you read Country Living magazine, the photos in this book will be all too familiar. I expected that there'd be some photos from the magazine, but this book had absolutely nothing new. The text is also disappointing and seems to be written for readers who've never given a thought to decorating prior to opening the book. It's hard to imagine that fans of this simple, yet sophisticated style would need to be told that \\"paintings add color to white walls,\\" or \\"when furnishing a porch, refrain from using old automobile seats or broken down couches.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful pictures, but...","review":"I'm sure this gentleman Randy Florke is immensely talented. I certainly LOVE the rooms featured in Country Living magazine. But I honestly didn't find many ideas I could actually use in my small 1300 sq. ft. 1800's house with 7 ft. ceilings.I'd have to agree with Nancy's review that many of the ideas are not practical. How are my kids going to sit on those metal chairs? And with dogs, I could NEVER put out the kind of accessories lower than 3 ft. or they'd be munchie snacks. I guess I was hoping for more inspiration.I did like his use of large paintings in small spaces to open up that one room. Beautiful style, but not a real how-to book. Show the problem, and show the solution. That's the kind of book I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Poor Quality Photos","review":"For me, there is too much poor photography throughout. Some photos are the quality to be expected, however, too many are out of focus, or have too little depth of field for the purpose of the photo, many contain a lot of noise/grain, some apparently are images that were originally small, then printed larger, creating a poor quality image, many were photographed with poor lighting, some could use color correction for the lighting (i.e. on some photos they failed to adjust the color temperature of the photo correctly leaving a few images shot with incandescent lights looking unnaturally yellow - which brings up one more problem: using a single incandescent light as the main light source, which not a good idea when trying to create a beautiful photo, and this was done more than once)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Country Decorating Book","review":"I own almost every book on country homes and decorating published over the past 5 years.

It uses the 3M self-adhesive pads. Each pad is good for one use, and I think it came with 4 pads in the box. I bought additional 3M pads at a large chain store in the mall (I won't mention names). Yes, buying additional pads will cost money, but it doesn't poke holes in your walls like the other products will.The unit has 3 bubble leveling vials, one for each axis. Initially I only saw two of them, and when I fastened the unit to the wall, it was perfectly level on the first wall, but titled on the second wall. I then found the 3rd vial, and learned that the whole unit will tilt to get the line on the second wall level with the first; I was impressed.It requires 2 AA batteries, which are not included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad.","review":"I bought this at a local home center, but when I got it home found that it was at least 5 degrees off level--the bubble didn't agree with the laser.

When I got home, I installed brand new batteries, turned on the power switch, and nothing happened. I tried a few times; I tried different batteries -- still nothing. Battery compartment was also awkward to open. You need to line up the inside of the battery cover and pull to open, but if you don't line it up just right, you'll miss the groove inside the compartment. Not only will you have a hard time opening the compartment, but by the time you do, you've nearly wrecked the part of the compartment cover that's supposed to fit into the grooves inside the compartment. Needless to say, I returned this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work and no fixable parts","review":"We purchased this a while back, and I didn't save the warranty (dumb).I thought this would be a grand help in re-tiling the bath. But after under an hour use, the light went out. I tested batteries, installed new ones all to no avail. The manufacturer's web site says there are no serviceable parts.

Released as a mass-market paperback, this reads more like a fleshed out synopsis than a finished work.Monteleone isn't a terrible writer and his characters have enough differentiation that you don't confuse one for the other (always a plus!). The story advances via the viewpoints of the central five characters and the author does an admirable job of maintaining VP integrity while doing this (i.e. we don't have VP switching back and forth within a particular scene or episode).All the same, a goodly amount of editing could have been done, even to the cover copy which identifies the female protagonist as \\"Kate Hudson\\" while all through the book she is presented as \\"Kate Harrison\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"Cheaply made with horrible acting.

This book is not a paper obviously, but it fails to state why what its talking about is important, and thus it is in essence, seemingly pointless.Essentially while you read this book, you will read one or two sentences making a point, and then several pages of information supporting that point. The problem is, with all the different names and jumps to different time periods, nobody is going to remember all the information supporting the point and the author never goes back to the point being made, so soon you'll forget why he's giving you all this information.I bought this book for a college course, and dare I say, I refuse to sell it because that would be a crime against humanity. Instead, I should opt to give it away and provide my sympathies for whoever will have to read this in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"new band for old watch","review":"Its a wach band and so far so good.

The book is an easy to read, self-help guide, which focuses on the application of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy for quitting alcohol and drugs now and for good. Dr. Tate explains and shows how to take control of your behavior and emotions--without having to attend meetings for the rest of your life. By recognizing and eliminating the irrational beliefs behind addictive behavior, alcohol/drug-free living becomes a natural way of daily life, not a meeting after meeting challenge to try and remain sober, one-day-at-a-time. Alcohol: How To Give It Up and be Glad You Did, is an exceptional book, which answers many of the questions traditional 12-step programs do not. Required reading for professionals and lay-persons in need of alternatives to largely innefective policies of America's Addiction Treatment Industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"By hook or by crook, this is the worst book!","review":"This is without doubt the worst book I have ever read. It is so badly written, it is almost impossible to finish. I wish I hadn't wasted my valuable time reading it, and I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying it not to! The Kindle version doesn't even allow you to navigate from chapter to chapter.

I thought this title, \\"Writing Nonfiction : Turning Thoughts into Books\\", is another one of such great works.I was so disappointed while reading this book when I realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book. I just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience. I don't know if you get, I just don't.To make matters worse, this title is not as detailed as the original work. So, if you are interested in learning from this man, I suggest that you get a copy of \\"The Self-Publishing Manual\\", rather than this one.I gave this book 1 star, not because it does not contain useful information, but because it contains nothing new from the author's previous publication. It is really unfortunate. I felt cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Nonfiction: Turning thoughts into books","review":"This is an extremely useful book for writers. Many people have difficulty putting on paper what they know and think. Dan Poynter gives them a very good guide to follow.

I recommend this book to all nonfiction authors with whom I come into contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed with the lack of substantial content in this book","review":"The amount of motivational jargon and quotes is overwhelming, and not useful. The amount of practical information on writing a non-fiction amounts to little more than a few sentences of generalizations. He suggests we make piles on our desk for each chapter?? Thank you for that. This was a waste of $7.00. The reviews appear to be talking about some other book - not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with Caution","review":"I found this book easy to read, and it was clear that Mr. Poynter follows his own advice on how to design front and back covers, construct chapters, etc. However, after reading this and another of this authors books, it started to feel like an advertisement for the self publishing industry. Since Mr. Poynter is in that business, and much information is made available from his business to further help authors, I began to feel like I was on the receiving side of a sales pitch towards the end of the book. I did pick up a few ideas, which were of great value. However, I think this book has one, but not the only, and for some authors, not necessarily the best, perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully Explains The Process","review":"This is a book full of useful information from someone who knows the subject. I had the opportunity to attend a seminar where Dan Poynter spoke on writing nonfiction. It is great to have this book to bring back everything from the presentation. If you want to write nonfiction, this book will guide you though the process. If you already write nonfiction, this book will make you much more efficient. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best by Far","review":"I've read a lot of \\"How To\\" books and this is the best by far. Dan Poynter's enthusiasm for his subject is infectious and because he has been doing what he teaches for decades, and constantly updating his material, there is an astonishing amount of usable information packed into this book.If you can make a list of the stuff that you know about and your experience with it, then Writing Nonfiction will show you how to make it into a book and guide you into publishing it. I'm working with it now on my own book and can assure you that *anyone* can write nonfiction - Dan Poynter's many students and follows will attest to that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to work with","review":"This is an unusual product.

But after only a few weeks of ownership, after walking on flat pavement probably not more than 5 miles total, the sole on both of these boots split all the way across at the metatarsal, all the way through to the insole. The sheep wool around the foot packs down within a few hours of putting them on, forever losing its comfortable fluffiness. After the wooly lining has packed down, the fit loosens, then the boots move around on the feet while walking, causing rubbing in the heel. The heel also seems to be shaped wrong. The boots rubbed the edge of my heel on both feet, producing callouses with big blisters underneath. Couldn't walk in shoes for a few weeks until my feet healed. Don't try to walk around town in these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Loved my demi boots when I got them for Christmas, but here it is Jan.17th and my bear paw demi boots are worn through across the toes on the right boot.

It's a characature, a stupid cartoon with painted outdoor scenery and painted indoor furniture. Voices are good, the tenor (if you can stand to look at him) is wonderful. And Devia! She is terrible, a clown, my guess is (like his other comedies) Donizetti meant this to be amusing, fun, not an asinine farce. (How do you spell asinine, I don't have spell check.) Devia has good agile voice (so do lots of coloratura sopranos) but when she bothers to end an aria on a top note (which she rarely does) she slides (so do LOTS of coloratura sopranos - and I won't listen to them either). To be a good singer these days, you need lots of hype, PR, a cult, a good photographer and a following. What you don't need is a voice. To get a good coloratura today you need Sumi Jo or a time machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny Krivit - Grass Roots","review":"Danny Krivit is not only a first rate DJ and compiler, he is one of the nicest musical experts you could ever meet.

I really enjoyed watching this series again through about the first 3 main villains, the last set which I believe are four kinda working together I didn't enjoy quite as much but don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. (Just a long anime and I think I was just ready to finish it) I don't think it would be quite worth the general price range but I caught it on sell and it was definitely worth what I paid, about $28 when I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you expect","review":"This set contains the entire first season beginning to end. VERY lacking in the special features department. All it has is a photo gallery on the last disk and that's it. It is in English ONLY no dual audio. It does include a very nice booklet showcasing the different forms of all 8 main character's digimon. On a strange side note, the booklet also includes English lyrics for the Japanese opening, ending, and digivole song. Which makes me wonder why they didn't include a Japanese audio track with subtitles. Over all it's a great collection for someone trying to get the American version of the show, just know they the American version is retooled for a more conservative audience and quite a bit different, it is eitherA. Cut out orB. RewrittenIf you can look past that I say get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is a little high","review":"Im very glad to see Digimon season 1 coming to DVD in an official release.

The digi-volving and naming parts all seemed to happen way too frequently. Back when I was only watching an episode or two a day it didn't seem nearly as bad. There were an episode or two that I noticed seemed really blurry.

I certainly can relate to his passion, as I canoe, camp, andd spend time in nature all around the stated purpose of fishing.It wasn't a page-turner (for me) but it was a nice read and it stays on my \\"short shelf\\" of handy books to grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it","review":"An elegant masterpiece of crime fiction.

I listened to the doctor's words but did not hear him. First thing I did when I got home was to try to find out as much information about FIV as possible as quickly as possible. Immediately I ordered this book \\"Feline Aids: A Pet Owners Guide\\" and I cannot say enough good things about the book or Mr. Hapka. He actually took the time to speak personally with me, and offered nothing but encouragement and hope during a time when I was getting nothing but negative feedback about Mongo. The results I have had are amazing and I will be forever grateful for the wealth of information and support I received from the book and Mr. Hapka. On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what every cat owner needs","review":"When our cat was diagnosed with feline aids I was devastated. However, this book gives hope, encouragement and guidance on how to manage this condition. With 20 -25% of cats contracting this illness and their owners not knowing until their pet becomes very ill this book is one which is essential reading. I am surprised that such a book has not been written in the UK with the names of UK suppliers of natural and homeopathic remedies readily at hand. A slim tome and because most of the suppliers are in the U.S partially unhelpful, but this isn't the fault of the author who is writing for his home market. I would recommend this book if only to demonstrate that an adverse diagnosis is not a signal to abandon all hope and also to encourage pet owners not to simply abrogate responsibility to the vet, but to be pro-active in providing the additional care a FIV pet needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Jazz","review":"Was surprized when the CD arrived from Germany, unfortunately, not in time to be used this year but we will enjoy it next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reggae Rocks!","review":"This album has been a family favourite for years and gets dusted off every Chrsitmas for it's annual play.

When we returned, I thought it would be fun to have some Christmas music with a Caribbean or steel drum style as we heard during our stay. After reading the wonderful reviews, I ordered this CD.I am very disappointed in the CD. I find the vocals to be annoying and irritating and not at all the fun upbeat melodic music we heard while in the Caribbean. The music was repetitious and without any sort of musical creativity and sounding very amateur. I'd recommend looking elsewhere. This CD was a major waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"This a great video that deals with major issues from a Christian stand point. I would recommend for believers to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books","review":"I bought this book when it had just come out and I was newly married. Ive used it so much that it is in tatters, but I still treasure it. The information and illustrations of storage closets, kitchens, general home layouts, etc. are still as useful and inspiring today as they were back in the 1950s. Their sections on choices and care of products for the home: floors, etc are still valid. Their discussions of time and motion techniques in cooking, house cleaning, bed making, etc. are outstanding. I still refer to it frequently. This book is like a dear old friend and has influenced my life for 50 some odd years. It is one of the 9 or 10 most influential and treasured books that I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Banjo Christmas music!","review":"Wow! This banjo music is really great!

The Elenium and the Tamuli series have been captivating and I look forward to another series, if any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!","review":"Why does David Eddings do this? Meaning, why does he start with a decent \\"let's find the blue rock\\" story (the Elenium, the Belgariad), and then follow it up with what seems like an exercise in being as farfetched as possible (the Tamuli, the Malloreon)?! He just tries to pull more ideas out and they're just TOO fanciful, even for fantasy. And, of course, all the characters have to deliver their dialogue as one-liners that really aren't that funny. In particular I would LOVE to have Caalador killed off to get rid of that ridiculous dialect (and all the characters who decide to imitate it). And the ending just wasn't that convincing. Stick with the Elenium - the best series Eddings has written, in my opinion. The one-liners are there, but not as many of them, and there are some serious characters to balance the overly witty ones. Plus the story is fantasy, yet not the totally farfetched stuff of the Tamuli."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring story filled with unfunny characters who won't die.","review":"This is one of the few fantasy series' I ever read where I really, really wanted the villain to win, but wait the villain here is too boring to even root for. Eee Gad, it the horrible conservative god!! I ended up wishing their little universe would collapse in on itself, killing all those annoying characters and even more annoying pantheon of gods. The repetitive one-liners and sarcastic remarks made by EVERY character are not funny in and only cemented my intense dislike for them. Don't even get me started on the horribly annoying Caalador and his accent. I couldn't even read his dialogue. Is this supposed to be cute? And then to top it off, Eddings rips off his own Belgariad, by having two opposing destinies meet to decide the fate of the universe...blah blah. Please Eddings if you're reading this no more Sparhawk stories!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After finishing this trilogy my first response was \\"blah\\"","review":"As a big fan of Eddings' Belgariad and Elenium I was truly disappointed by what turned out to be a dull repetetive bore.The plot is in a word: STUPID. It can be entertaining enough while you wait for the next Robert Jordan book to finally come out, but on the whole I can not shake the feeling that Eddings is running out of ideas and/or was under heavy pressure from his publisher and had some undergrad English major ghost write this for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"episode six - the boring menace","review":"I honestly don't know how someone can give this book 5 stars, cause I've read many excellent books, which get 4 stars of something. How can a book like this get 4.5 stars on the average. The characters are the usual: fighter(s), thief,the Mother figure(sephrenia), and bla bla bla bla. The jokes aren't funny, actually, they're an insult to the people of real humour. And in the conversations sometimes I can almost predict what they're gonna say next. All I can say is that the fanatic eddings fans should really think of changing the books they read ---> if they think this book is EXCELLENT... then what about the dark elf trilogy? Dragonlance? Forgotten Realms? All those beat the Elenium and the Tamuli. I liked the Belgariad, those books were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry","review":"To have got this far you mus be an Eddings devotee. I was. Emphasis on the \\"was\\". I'm really sory to say this, but second the first books of both heroes was an incredible read. Wonderfully descriptive and characters with quirks and depth that really brought them to life. Both second series for me were a flop, but this none more. This must be the worse book I have read from an author I have recommended to others. Gods moving around armies? And then, in the end, there's no point to it all! Why not just let Sparhawk have his big gem, go in and kill everyone himself. That and the invicible band he travels with. Once you bring Gods (and the more powerful) in, you kind of lose touch. Isn't fantasy about you relating the character, or you living the hero?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's have another series","review":"Having read some of the reviews prior to typing my 2 cents worth, I must confess to being a little surprised at some of the reviews. Having read the Belgariad and the Malloreon, I thought that both the Elenium and the Tamuli series were superior. Once I had started reading, it was always a shame to stop. The one reservation about the series was the ease with which Sparhawk's enemies are destroyed at the end. Having had Sparhawk and his friends running around madly for 3 novels, Cyrgon bites the dust in just 3 pages once the main event begins! Also, I have to agree with the comments about Caalador's accent - it really was annoying. What's worse, he was faking it! Aside from that (and it really is a very small issue), both of the Sparhawk series were great reads, with good characters, and I would like to see another seies. There has to be someone on the other side of their world that doesn't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fantasy novels","review":"Eddings writes the best fantasy novels after my tasteDefinitely a must read for fantasy addicts like meGreetings,Me"},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"this book, like all the other ones in the Tamuli, doesn't deserve a proper review: I only say BADDDDDDDDDD, dont read, READ DUNE instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful coasters!","review":"Bought these for a Christmas present and was so happy with how beautiful they looked.

The art and writing are both sub par. Especially the Ironman story which looks like it was written by a twelve year old and penciled by his kid brother. Really bad.I think the Ultimate spider-man series is one of the best comics I've seen in years but this doesn't belong on the same shelf. The by-line says Bendis, but I don't believe it for a minute.

A thorough rewrite, with more detail on more recent models such as the early Turbo Esprits, and more of the \\"what to look for when shopping\\" info that is the principal reason people buy these Guides, is urgently needed.

Get the 2006 Precious Time Remaster here http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EHRAG6 which is in fact, remastered.As an unashamed Pat Benatar fan, I find it really disappointing that they only remastered her first three albums, In the Heat of the Night, Crimes of Passion and Precious Time. There are some additional remasters on her \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00094AT4O, but unfortunately, most of them are cut down \\"single\\" versions and not the uncut album versions.

I mean, that is what it's all about, isn't it? Instead, I found myself reading a rather stilted, artistically static, lackadasical story which didn't do much to enlighten, or entertain. The annotataions at the end of the book are interesting; but, since they didn't do anything for the story as I read it, weren't that meaningful to me. To be honest, I wasn't impressed. I guess I'm a Tolkien fan and want orcs, goblins, and demons spewing blood.

I also have 2 other Dell computers right next to these using the Dell wireless cards ordered with them and they show a connecting speed of 54 MBPS. I did a speed test and the ones using the Linksys WUSB54GP show actually running about half the speed of the Dell 54g devices. Trying different channels did not help.

That means my 8 and 10 year old children who prefer Linux to WinDOZE can now have internet and wireless network connections. I wrote to Linksys asking why they won't support an O/S that millions of folks use, but did not get any reply.If you use this for Linux, configure the card using NetworkManager. I'm using it on WEP Open System. I put in either Passphrase or hex strings and it works well.

To understand this movie I watched it a second time with the commentary on. It made a huge difference.
