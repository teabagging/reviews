I started researching what strings are best for adding warmth and balancing out an overly bright guitar. I came across the \\"silk and steel\\" type of string that several brands carry and ultimately decided to go with Ernie Ball's Earthwood series based on reviews and forum posts I read. I think they sound and play great. Another nice advantage is they exert less tension than your average string, which is great for the Backpacker since it's supposed to take extra light strings only. I don't think I'd recommend these strings for something like an all-mahogany guitar as it's already going to be pretty mellow and you'll probably just end up with a muddy sound, but for anything else that's sounding too cold or tinny, give these a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product...BAD supplier","review":"Super product....I have three in my laundry room and one in each guest bedroom.

Video games have a bumpy history of movie and book translations (\\"Mario Brothers\\" and Alan Dean Foster's \\"The Dig\\" are just two of the low points), but this book did a good job. The action is good, the side characters have more than one dimension to them, and the plot is perfect for this genre.As a stand-alone SF/Adventure novel, however, it's not the best read. While the characters have depth when compared with the video game, they certainly wouldn't stand up against other true SF/Fantasy heroes created by Orson Scott Card, James Stoddard, or Jennifer Roberson.Is it fun?

The plot is uneven, with enough holes and nonsensical twists to nearly kill any coherence it might have had were it not for the absolutely godawful exposition. Again, this could be sidestepped, but the central problem is that the author really doesn't demonstrate any knowledge of the Lara Croft character. She's not nearly intelligent enough, and doesn't that that Tomb Raider edge. If the names were changes, the author could have been writing about any female hero on the run.

When it does open, the latch gives way suddenly and violently - I have taken chunks out of my thumb and hand on that same sharp metal bolt.Overall, I think this gate does more harm than good; it is worth more being junked for scrap metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Construction","review":"We bought this gate and returned it within a few days. The gate instructions say that this gate is intended for children 6-24 months. What good is this gate when you really want to prevent your 18 month old to 3 year old from going down the stairs. No where on amazon does it tell you the age requirements/intent for this gate.I started to put this thing together and noticed that the screws that come with the gate are really cheap (soft metal). I stripped a few of them while trying to install the gate. I gave up and sent this gate back.We also noticed that we had to buy extra parts for this gate (wall connector and no-screw banister connector). Overall, this gate did not satisfy our needs. We are in the process of looking for another gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the hardward was missing from this product.

The latching mechanism is simple, but seems secured. It was not too bad to assemble. I didn't do it myself but hired couple guys to install it. It took them about 30-45 minutes to put it together.The only negative thing is the price. I have no idea why something this simple and made with relatively cheap materials should cost more than $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Withstood My kids for 7 yrs & counting","review":"I have 4 children & this gate is still in use & has somehow lasted for the past 7 years. The bottom latch doesn't always go in place without you angling it in with your leg, but I still gave this 5 starts due to the fact that I have used it for this length of time in a 5 foot opening in my home, even with a 40 pound kid swinging on it sometimes (which needless to say I don't recommend). I need to replace 2 other gates from another manufacturer & Kidco G20 & G22 are what I am purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gate","review":"Overall a great gate.

It was also extremely difficult to line up and install correctly. The directions have no pictures (besides the pictures of the parts, labeled at the back).

It's not that I just didn't 'get it' the first time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design, difficult to install","review":"We have two of these gates and are very unhappy with our decision. We will be trashing them once we find something to replace them with. They are sturdy once you can get them to latch properly (the only reason they get 2 stars). The install process was tedious and frustrating. Once installed, it is very difficult to actually get them to latch properly. You have to have strong fingers to pull up the latch when opening the gate and your fingers sit on a screw, not on the metal part. It's annoying and painful. Safe gate, just a bad design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use in any stairway","review":"We have an old farm house but needed to make it safer for small children.

Two long, rudimentary bolts extend out past the gate, top and bottom, to secure it to the wall or railing. The top bolt is directly in the path of a child's head and they can run into it if the gate is accidentally left open. It is not-self closing like other models.We installed it yesterday and it's coming down today. No way I'm leaving this up with 2\\" bolts sticking out and a four year-old in the house.For a safer alternative with rounded edges, that can't be climbed and can be mounted for stairs, consider theThe First Years Everywhere Gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note about dimensions","review":"For anyone with a very small margin of error on dimensions, the gate height listed here (30.5\\") is misleading. While that is the height of the gate, the height required for mounting it (the distance from the floor to the top of the bracket on the template) is 31.5\\" on the hinge side and 33.5\\" on the latch side. Unfortunately this means it is impossible for me to install in the location I purchased it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the Installation Template","review":"This is a well designed and well built gate. The installation directions were clear and I followed them carefully. Unfortunately, the template provided to locate the mounting brackets did not match my gate. It was off by about 1/2 inch. That is enough to prevent the gate from latching after installation. If I had simply laid out the latched gate on the template, I would have seen the error and prevented several hours of wall repair and re-installation work.I would buy this gate again but I would throw away the installation template and use some common sense to install it. If it had not been for the unforgivable template error, I would give this gate four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good baby gate","review":"This is an excellent product, but a bit tricky to install.

If you're not a master carpenter, don't bother. Hardware templates are not even close to matching and the hinge is JUNK. Instructions are the worst ive ever seen, and my 1 year old, who the gate is designed to protect, and happens to be completely illiterate, could've written better instructions. My rating and review might be different if the product came w a few sessions of marital counseling, or a low flat rate criminal defense retainer, bc attempting to install is guaranteed to result in an argument and/or one spouse being charged w homicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice at first, but....","review":"Works great at first, then gets rust/corrosion and breaks. One of the bars broke from the weld/sauder after 3-4 years, thus creating an injury hazard to my infant. Immediately replaced gate with the Munchkin Extender 2100, from Target. The Munchkin is much better. Will review that next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best child staircase you can buy - see below:","review":"PROS:1. Variable width gate - fits even wide staircases2. A WIDE opening. I almost purchased theThe First Years Hands Free Gate, however the gate width opening is SO SMALL. This was unacceptable to me.3. Opening the gate requires the person to push DOWN the lever while simultaneously pulling up on the gate to unhinge it from the lock. Clever design and IMO very safe.CONS:1. I wish the hinge pieces and locking mechanism were metal. Even though the plastic feels very hard and durable, I use this gate at least ten times a day... that is a lot of wear and tear.SUMMARY:If you are looking for a stair gate for your infant/child; this is the gate to get. My main requirements were usability and safety and this fit them both perfectly. Usability meaning it had a wide opening.On a side note, in case you cannot screw the hinge and locking mechanism into a stud, consider securing these pieces down with Liquid Nails along with the provided screws and fasteners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased At All","review":"After an hour+ of reading and deciphering poorly written directions, my husband and I finally got this gate installed. We are truly underwhelmed. It is difficult to use, the stops barely work, and the latching mechanism has already fallen apart once in the single day it's been in use. Normally I am really good at installation-type things, too! This made Ikea furniture assembly look like the easiest thing on earth.For nearly $60, and for protection on an old, steep, 2-story flight of stairs, I am really disappointed. Of course, we've already disposed of the packaging, and taking it apart to return it would be a huge pain in the ass. We'll try to improvise a better stop, be a little more gentle with it, and hope for the best - but I would really recommend against this one. There has to be something better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"so awful, it's almost funny","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK !!!This baby gate is utterly ridiculous. It is made of heavy metal, but the parts that attach it to the wall ? Cheap plastic !!! Tiny little screws !!! Does that make sense ??? My mom and I spent a good amount of time battling it as a result of the AWFUL instruction manual. Why put the written portion in one section, and pictures in another ??I recommend instead the EvenFlo gate. It's significantly less expensive and the instruction manual is better. The gate is made of wood, the hardware that attaches it to the wall is METAL. Much safer, I think !"},{"rating":"1","title":"have to drill into wood banister","review":"To install this gate you have to drill into the wood stair banister. We didn't want to do this. There is an option to purchase an installation kit for $30. We didn't want to spend that much on a gate, as we needed to buy 2. We opted for the Regalo top of stairs gate. They come with a gripper and sturdy Velcro straps so you don't need to drill into wood.

This is not even a high traffic area. My husband and I did not abuse the gate. We used it how the instructions stated but there was a plastic piece that broke off which rendered the entire gate useless. I would not buy this gate!

A friend in London is a tour manager and he was given a compilation CD of Ké's work; he lent me the CD and I was hooked.One reviewer calls Ke's work 'whining bland drivel'. I'd agree his voice can sound whining, but perhaps a better word would be plaintive - expressive of suffering or woe - or melancholy.Others have mentioned his French/Cherokee 'heritage' and androgynous looks and sound - that may be offputting to some. The production is excellent, Ké's lyrics are intelligent and thought provoking, his vocal talents leave so many artists sounding like 'bland drivel'.'I Am' is not my favorite Ké album.

They are just terrible, the woman the whole program can't even speak \\"ich\\" correctly - she says \\"ik\\" the whole time. In fact is not a book trying to teach YOU German - is just a record from a classroom, where somebody is teaching others, but no you. If you think that with these eight cds you will be able to speak German, forget about it. You won't be able even to ask directions! If you are planning to travel to Germany, buy something best. If you think is nice enough to know some words in another language that you don't want to understand seriously, go ahead, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique approach","review":"I have been studying different languages over 30 years with varying results. When I started with Michel Thomas' German course, it took just a handful of minutes to get quick results. His approach demands complete attention. Most of all, I appreciate that he emphasizes how a language is structured. As he says, \\"the rest is just vocabulary.\\" I have listened to my Michel Thomas' CDs (the deluxe 8-CD set and the Advanced German set) a dozen times and here's the reward: When I make my annual visit to Austria and Germany, I have no problem with sentence structure or accent. Native German speakers will help me with vocabulary from time to time but never with grammar or prounciation. That's how helpful Michel's German courses are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best conversational German course I have found!","review":"I have had 3 college semesters of German; however, I have learned more conversational German from this course than I have in those three semesters. This is an excellent course to improve your conversational skills. Though grammer is covered a little, it is not explained in any depth. This is truely a conversational course. Having said that, I find that this is so far the best German course for the price. I have only gotten 1/2 way through the course, but so far I really enjoy his no-nonsense teaching style and the fact that you feel as if you are a participant in a private tutoring session. I do feel having a fairly good background in German grammar certainly helped me make the most of this course, as it was my conversational, not my grammar skills that were lacking.

It keeps you guessing along the way and has some suspenseful moments. I would recommend it for grades fourth through maybe seventh. This book teaches a good lesson for people of the ages 9-12. If you like little animals that talk you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs.Frisby and the Rays of NIMH.","review":"Our teacher made us read this book as a novel study, and I can say that it was an interesting read. Though it is interesting, the plot seems to simple for older children. I'd recommend it for children ages 9-11. Nicodemus's story of the rats escape takes up a lot of the story. If you are interested in animals I recommend this for you. Some people in my class found it boring and hard to concentrate on. It has excellent characterization though, and Mrs.Frisby is a very believable heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the cover in the photo","review":"book was in fine condition but I expected the edition that was in the photo.

Or do you think if you rip up the floorboards in your house that you will find an elaborate society of mice at work, complete with all the amenities that us humans enjoy? Well, when I was a kid, I know that I certainly wanted to believe in those things. And that's what's so great about Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM. It brings those fantasies of a secret animal world to life. O'Brien's characters are rich and well-conceived and he combines the right amount of mystery and tension with adventure, humor, and sensitivity. I just love the scene between Mrs. Frisby and the owl and there is nothing better than the telling of the rats' escape from the laboratories of NIHM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Excellent","review":"It's just excellent.

First, Mrs. Frisby (a mouse) is very brave and outgoing. For example, she saved a crow in cat-guarded territory!!! Also, she puts sleep powder in the cat's eating bowl. Second, the rats are smarter than any other rat type in the world. For example, the rats make their own machines and gears. Also, they plan for their future survival. Last of all, the animals use human items that were not being used. For example, the mice made a home from a cinder block. Plus, the rats used human items like car batteries, Christmas lights, strings, linen, cardboard boxes, metal sheets, dye, and many others!

While trying to find help Mrs. Frisby met a young crow named Jeremy and she helped to save him from the farmers cat named Dragon. Jeremy returned the favor by taking Mrs. Frisby to see the graet Owl who told her to go to the rats in the rosebush and see Nicodemus for help. When Mrs. Frisby met Nicodemus and the other rats she found they were very smart. Nicodemus told her about NIHM and their experience at the lab.

However, within the first page or so of How Not to Spend Your Senior Year, I knew I was going to like it.Jo is fun, down-to-earth, with a great sense of humor. She's got more maturity than your average teenager, but it's tempered by her own admittance of the somewhat silly, teenager-y things she does.The plot may sound a little far-fetched, but overall, Dokey pulls it off nicely. A little out there, but more believable than some of the other YA stuff I've read, especially from Pulse. And the ending was great: sweet, but not so syrupy that it made you want to puke on the book.I would say that Dokey needs to work on her dialogue a little. Not the content, but the presentation.

With her new school she gets too attached with a boy and when she has to move again, she is unwilling to let him go. The newspaper says she was killed in a car accident, but she keeps going back to her old school. She shouldn't have done this.

The drawings convey the incorrect impression that basic silhouettes changed little over 900 years, and they seem to be based on other costume books, rather than on actual contemporary portrayas of dress, and so compound the errors of these earlier books, sometimes combining elements of dress which were never seen together in actual fact. There is no attempt to site sources for the costumes, so it cannot be used as a springboard for further research. The only real use I can see for it is perhaps for theatre designers wanting an overall impression of how the clothes of a particular period looked, and even then, there are much better books for almost every period in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited usefulness","review":"I use this book a lot to give my customers a rough idea of what period costumes look like.

Any costume design or history class will teach you that for correct research, you need original sources, and unfortunately, this book has none. Personal interpretations carry with them the style of the period within which they were drawn, as well as the artist's own slant, and this is especially true in the works of John Peacock. With the vast amount of bad costuming found in theatres and some films, I hate to see how often this book is lauded as a great source and looked to for advice.

I had bought this to replace an old one that was stolen from my home(btw the old maglites were awesome!!)When I got the new MAGLITE flashlight, I noticed the LED light looks different than the Maglite LED 3D flashlight that I also have. Plus, when I checked for the extra bulb behind the tailcap, I got a regular bulb NOT AN LED BULB!! Furthermore the DURACELL batteries exploded inside the flashlight so I didnt have a chance to use it. I called MAGLITE, and they said they were not responsible, and to call Duracell, ugh!! In Conclusion, I bought another one from a retail store, and If I have any problems I will return it and get another. Fortunately I kept all the parts and just replaced the bulb. FYI you can buy the LED kits from NITEIZE.COM, or any store that carry it, like Sports Chalet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maglight 4D LED Flashlight","review":"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement! I have many LED flashlights, from many differant makers. All of them are better than the Maglight, even there own AA version.

I am going to try and send it back, but since it was bubble packed, and I opened it and put batteries in to check it out, I don't know if I will be able to? I should have paid more attention to the reviews, as the second one I read stated this very thing! Live, be stupid, and learn. I can't even say I didn't know, because I read the reviews. I decided to try it because almost all the other reviews never mentioned it. I guess it must not have mattered the majority of those buyers?

I thought it was a good book, it was interesting to read. Basically, the book was about Malcolm's plans and his murder. He went to jail when he was young then became a Muslim. He eventually broke away from the Muslims and started his own movement. The police didn't like Malcolm or his organization of Negroes. He thought blacks and whites should be seperated. Unlike Martin Luther King, he believed in the violent approach. He was killed in a ballroom. The author wants to know the reason the police didn't look further into the investigation.

A book that inverts the .com model and provides the building blocks to creating a winning, sustainable \\"wired\\" culture.Too much of the current writing has been limited to customer focussed strategies. The assumed hope, then, would be that the internal processes would catch up with the external activity. Guess what? It is not going to happen. The culture of an organization, its value system, its internal communications & management style will have a much bigger impact on success than grand marketing schemes, overhyped websites and poor response times to customer needs. The author makes a strong case to look inward first before showing your face to the world.The case studies and tip sections reinforce the authors' arguments and are well laid out. I would recommend this book as required reading for all managers--now wired or soon to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"Culture.com is at its best when it describes the effect that the Internet revolution is having on the corporate cultures of modern business. Of special merit are the book's lists of suggestions that managers and human resource executives can follow in attempting to develop a new culture that adequately addresses the changes and strains brought on by the rise of the virtual revolution. Also intriguing is the book's analysis of the dangerous transition period in which companies shift from old cultures to dot-com cultures.

Its author is obviously a bright scholar, and the book itself comes from an invited memorial lecture at the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1989. There is lots of good material here about 2nd Century Christian beliefs, and quotations from many sources that can be hard to track down.BUT, it is difficult to know what the author is up to. There is no apparent structure nor theme. He seems to jump from one topic to another with no segue. Each pericope is perfectly good by itself, but there is no cumulative effect. Even more problematic, the documentation is poor and the bibliography is incomplete.This book may have made a very good lecture, but it doesn't survive as a meaningful book. Nonetheless the material herein is very valuable and the book may be of interest to scholars of early Christianity who are interested in the works of Marcion, Valentinus, Ignatius, Irenaeus, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"I missed this book.","review":"I read this book when it first came out around 15 or so years ago.

I was a Corpsman(Medic) with the Marines in Viet Nam several years after the events of the story but I had a very similar experience. The web site Capmarines.com gives a program used by the Marine Corps that was more \\"Peace Corps\\" than what you would call the usual impression of the Marine Corp. We lived and worked in a small village. The Marines were a police force and I was the \\"doctor\\" for the village. I am attracted to this story because it shows a part of the war that wasn't about the fighting but about the attempts at healing.

At every step, the authors go to great lengths to use the most verbose and indulgent language possible. Cut all the fluffy verbiage out and you would have a considerably clearer book that contains 100% of the information in far fewer pages.I would love to have the time to actually sit down and read this book properly. But a surgery clerkship simply does not afford enough time for that - there are simply not enough hours available when you work 15-17 hour days and were also hoping to eat and sleep. I cannot imagine why some clerkship directors feel that students should read this book.

It explains the essence of software packages in this arena. With tables of CAD providers, and vendors who offer extensive component libraries. While you could certainly use a CAD package to design your own custom parts, it may be more cost effective to see if an existing library has what you need.Another chapter covers solid freeform production.

However, the position where his protagonist faces towards the finale of the book sounds strangely similar to the same predicament the human protagonist faced in the Babylon 5 Vorlon-Shadow war. Additionally, the choice made by the protagonist in this book was very similar to the choice made by the protagonist in the Babylon 5 Vorlon-Shadow war conclusion.

But where does one look, when the average marketing book sounds either like warmed over pablum, or airheaded nonsense. Well, if you're going to read one book, take a look at the one Tom Peters begs you to read.

But the videos in this series have proven that there are excellent quality, biblical, movies available. I was very pleased with how close the director walked with Scripture. I wasn't certain upon viewing the movie so I had to go back and check for myself. Solomon never married the Queen of Sheba. Solomon just gave her whatever she wanted and she simply went home (I Kings 10:13). But I understand the desire to read a little romance into the story. It helped me realize that it's still \\"Hollywood\\" and helped me research a little more. I can't complain about that.Overall this was an excellent movie! It's a good way to spend a few relaxing hours. Ben Cross was convincing as the \\"king with many wives\\" and Vivica's eyes worked perfectly behind the veil. Hard to resist. Great series! Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"A magnificant set of movies packaged into one deal. Who said bible based movies cannot be good? The most interesting of these movies was the Jeremiah film. These films crush the horriable (yet loved) \\"Left Behind: The movie\\" apocolyptic style films. The only reason I give this series a 4, is because I feel the scenes could have been shot a little bit better with the camera, and parts of the Solomon film were a bit boring.It would be nice to see more films like this. I'm glad these movies exist. I think it would be great if we saw more movies based on the books of the prophets, and maybe a movie or two based on the book of acts/pauline epistles (although that could be a bit confusing for people who are not familiar with Christianity)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What A Movie\\"","review":"Ben Cross plays a wonderful and powerful part as \\"Solomon\\" which you will find it all, rebellion, corruption, courage, and faith.

I found that the love affair with \\"Qween Sheba\\" was not in accordance with scripture. The biblical text account of Sheba's visit was apparently a trade mission and to test Solomon's wisdom.

I don't dispute that Mr. Johnston has a beautiful voice. However, I find that the production of this recording is very poor. It is narrated too fast, with hardly a breath between verses, chapters and books. I doubt this is how Mr. Johnston actually read it, but rather an editing room issue. A previous reviewer eluded to some editing splices where errors were corrected with voice overs. The number and quality of voice overs is distracting. Some of the voice overs are obviously not even Mr. Johnston. Additionally, the background music, in my opinion is obtrusive. At points, the music is distracting. In the early part of the book of Psalms for example, the music shifts from quiet and serene, to climactic concert pieces. I found myself almost paying attention more to the music, trying to guess the piece.All in all, I would not recommend this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Mr. Johnston!","review":"The perfect spiritual companion when unable to read my Bible firsthand.

I will definitely keep reading his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light on the science, strong on characterization and story","review":"Robert Wilson often has leading characters that have a life separate from their novel. Blind Lake is even more so, and would stand as a modern fiction novel without inclusion of the science and fantastic elements. The science is well used to enhance the plot and resonates with the theme of the unavoidable connection/isolation of the human(sentient) experience. A few quibbles: the explanation of the science is thin, resulting in a \\"black box\\" effect which in turn makes some of the character choices hard to swallow. Additionally, the flow of time is awkward in places - a few paragraphs describing a character's habits will move the time forward by a day or two, and a few more similarly toned paragraphs will suddenly move the time forward by months.Mr. Wilson's novels often include one or two \\"accept it as given\\" elements (as does most advanced tech SF), so the minor presumptions in this novel did not prevent enjoying the strong character drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good author, terrible publisher","review":"A good read, spoiled by the quality of the (mass market paperback)printing.

I was quickly caught up in the characters and the plot, and I didn't want to put the book down! I wish I had. After about 350 pages of pure enjoyment, the book's ending is a Grade B filmmaker's delight that is not only farfetched but inconclusive, resolving the character issues but leaving the central SF question unclear.Wilson is a very talented writer, but he does not seem to be able to handle endings satisfactorily, as both this book and Chronoliths exemplify. If he could correct this weakness, Wilson could quickly become someone to buy in hardback!If you want to read some great Hugo-nominated SF by a Canadian writer, give this one a miss and pick up Sawyer's own Hominids, which won last year's Hugo, or its sequel, Humans, which is nominated this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story","review":"Boring plot, bad end, good character description.Could be a good book if it wasn't sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very well done","review":"this wasn't the best written book that i've read. the descriptions were long and boring, and the character development was subpar. all in all i would find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Unlike most sf novels, more character development here.

There were cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. It was a little annoying being teased like this. I don't generally like this style.2. The ideas in the beginning were really, really good, but then there was little development of them in the middle part of the book. I was worried it would be the typical thing that happens with SCI FI, good start of an idea that falls apart at the end.For #1, I guess I got used to it. It certainly made me read it faster. For #2, the intellectual payoff was very good.

Superficially, Blind Lake is the story of a science facility, engaged in watching an extraterrestial civilization, that suddenly finds itself to be quarantined from the rest of the world.

Mini headphones are the way to go with an adapter at this price range IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is disappointing.","review":"The Sony Outlet store had this on special for $12. What a steal I thought. The headset feels comfortable but the sound quality is not very impressive. For a headset this size, you'd expect to hear some sort of BASS. I'm taking it back to the store.I would have probably have kept this at the price, but given that they do not hold the sound well (too loud to use in the office cube), I won't find any use for it. I wasn't planning to write a review, but I read user review comparing the sound quality of this model to his $90 headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke pretty quickly","review":"mine broke after about 6 months the right side went out and i can't get it back, for a while whenever i turned my head the right side would go out halfway, they look nice, and they sound ok when they work correctly but, id try something else with stronger wires or something, i also bought a pair for my sister when i bought mine 6 months ago and she doesn't have her's anymore either but i dont know why..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has the theory of bass","review":"I give these earphones 3 stars but review at 1 as it is to highly rated. The sounds high and middle are good. The bass however is crap. You can tell there is bass but you can not fell it at all. Bass to me is the most important part of music. These lack severly.

So pretty much two years I've had them and now I'm searching for a new pair of headphones. The sounds is REALLY good and bass is awesome. I'd recommend them. I just wish they lasted longer. Two years isn't bad, I guess. I don't regret the $20 I spent on them.PROS:-Comfortable fit-snug fit-has decent adjustments-great bass sound-great overall sound-comes with extra piece for amplifiers or whatnot-lasts about a year if taken care ofCONS:-magnifies outside noise (as if you tap the headphone and your ears go screaming, or say the TV is in the b.g.)-lasts about a year if taken care ofchord is way too long (i guess it's more fitting for tuning your electric guitar plugged up to amplifiers in the garage)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug pops out of MacBook Pro mini-jack","review":"Any comments on sound quality are eclipsed by the mini-plug easily pulling or popping out of my MacBook Pro's earphone jack. So, when shifting position on the couch or wherever, it can slide out, the laptop sound hangs for a second, and then the sound comes blasting out of the laptop speakers. This sounds like a laptop problem but I keep the finger pointed at these headphones - previous Philips and Sennheiser headphones did not have this problem with my laptop.Otherwise a good beater pair of cans if you have devices whose mini jacks are customized for these. Bass a little flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good deal","review":"at first time I was excited with the price and apparently the product...When I got I first realize that the wire is really too long, good to use at home, make you able to walk around, but extremily exagerate when you are using ion your mp3 player...the sound is clear but to low...sometimes, mainly on the street you want more volume and can not get it!the isolation also not good there is no isolation...and the plastic is resistent but very simple and not what you expet from as sony product...I do recomend to add 10 dolars more and buy other headphone as I did one month later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, these things are HUGE!","review":"I bought these because I needed something that would cover my ears while I work out. I sweat so much that earphones would constantly break or one side would work while the other would not. They are big, bulky and super annoying. If you are using them for working out I would look for something else. I would have returned them but the box was open and the instructions clearly said no returns on open items. I was not up for a fight so I didn't bother sending them back. They are here collecting dust...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"These are an excellent pair of headphones for a relatively cheap price. Very light and comfortable, the sound is fine by me, a casual listener. Don't be fooled by the large size, they are NOT noise canceling, so if that's what you're looking for, avoid these. Overall a good quality pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet up to my expectations","review":"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. But sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations. The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say about these. So I returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand.

I wear shooters ear muffs a *great deal*, because of the racket of all the noise (yes, we have tried earphones for the other PCs, but you know how destructive kids are). i *thought* that getting headphones for myself would solve the problem.....i was wrong. while the sound quality is great, i can hear every single thing that goes on. as a disabled person, i cant just jump up and leave the room when things get irritating. i had so hoped that these headphones would solve the problem... they dont.if you live alone, they will be perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Memorex HP2000","review":"If you are looking for an inexpensive headset. . .try the Memorex HP2000. The HP2000 sounds superior to the Sony MDR-XD100 with much better bass response and has a volume and Mono/Stereo switch built into the cord. I use them in my home studio, not for mixing but for the musicians and vocalist to hear themselves. They are hard on headsets so I don't want to spend a pile of dough on them. The earcups get ripped off easily and the plugs eventually break but at $14.95. . .what the heck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these things.","review":"The design of these is like a sick practical joke. They are very uncomfortable and feel like they're about to slip at any second no matter how you adjust them. Any slight movement of the head causes a \\"Uh-oh!\\" feeling like they're gonna slide off and if you do actually lay back or bend over, they fall off. Add to that the fact that they don't block any surrounding noise and people around you can hear what you're listening to and this product just fails, fails, fails.Total junk. All that + they don't have any bass and sound like pop garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"PATHETIC. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!Seriously, if you're expecting full, rich, vibrant sound then these are NOT for you! Way, way too much high and not nearly enough bass. Period.

Fortunately, I just picked them up in K-Mart on a whim and they're going right back.

The two cushions were loosely attached, and as soon as I opened the package, they fell out. Now I'm stuck with two ear cushions and plastic headphones.The quality is VERY, VERY fragile and hard-plastic; it is of utmost discomfort. It's like putting a piece of wood on your ear, it's that hard. The material in the image looks soft and cushioned; it pierces the ears and hurts you within the first few minutes of putting them on. Not only are the ears hurt, but the top part is hard plastic as well, it hurts the head, even when the headphones are extended.The sound quality is great. The wire/cord is long, that's also good. But the quality of the actual headphones is the poorest of its kind. And the fact that the two cushions were not placed on it properly means I'm refunding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 % headphone","review":"very, very nice this products. 100 % sony mdr-xd100 stereo. ergonomics and light products. good performance.recommendet, hy frecuency, tanks jose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound while they still worked.","review":"I'm not sure how to feel about these.

I tried them on my PC for movies = not that bad, PC for MP3's = sucked no bass, on my Ipod = sucked again no bass or volumeThey're under $20 I know but come on Sony.My gut was to go with some Sensheisers but I went with Sony because I love my Sony earbuds but I was wrong.

Fortunately, it's not my hearing. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with these headphones with superb mid range and treble and a shameful lack of bass. I can hear enough to tell that the bass is there. But it really is not satisfying. Even at maximum volume, all it did was crank up the treble and mid range.My suspicion is that the actual speakers in these are very tiny despite the big package, which would explain why they are curiously light for their size. I trusted Sony but I should have listened to the gut feeling I had about the price. Big brand name or not, you will never get more than you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low cost, cheap design= AVOID","review":"I got three units for my company and after ten minutes of testing I needed to send them back. They look nice, but that's all. The quality of the sound is poor, they are made of cheap, cheap materials.When there is nothing playing you can hear the ocean! It's like the sound of a seashell, very annoying.

I dont recommend these things. Plus they are big for no reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, they're amazing","review":"I purchased these headphones about four years ago (2006) for $20. I didn't have high hopes for them, I just needed a quick pair. Was I ever surprised, though - these have awesome sound quality for the price. Granted, they don't go quite as loud as I would like, but that's probably for the best (my eardrums are grateful). They're also not the greatest for listening to music out on the street... I'd use a noise-cancelling pair for that. The cord is long, which is a plus.

The main reason why I don't like this is because the front part of the headphone band at the top rest on my head while the back part doesn't. After using these for a half hour and trying to make them comfortable I couldn't find a way. All the weight of the headphones are on that little part of the band and it hurts after a while. I really wanted to like these, but they are just too uncomfortable for me :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but in the shadow of little brother..","review":"The MDR-XD100 headset is actually rather good for the price, though not great. The low-end range is pretty pathetic, leaving bass heavy songs sounding anemic. Volume is also rather low, something Sony's MDR line (at least, as I'm finding) is having a problem with. The headset is pretty bulky and clunky, but once on your head you forget you're wearing it. The cord was impressively long, keeping me able to move through a standard-sized room without much hassle. However, Sony's shining star is not the XD100, but theSony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcups, which have a smaller footprint, a smaller pricetag and pack a much bigger punch.

In the past I have paid more for some not-very-good in-earbuds.PROS:- Very Good sound quality- price- quite confortable- long cable- includes adapterCONS:- Not for audiophiles (but you would not be looking to these on the $20 range if you were one)- Cable might be too long depending on how you want to use the headphones.- I find them too big for no reason (and I tell you that I also have a big head...)- Quite platicky.OVER ALL these are not ment to be $200-300 quality headphones but definitely you will be very happy for having bought them for or under $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound quality!!!","review":"This is an amazing product from Sony.

I recently found them locked away in a bin. I am now married with a child and forgot how good music sounded with good headphones. I'm a huge Apple fan, but you miss so much of the music with Iphone/Ipod head phones. It's like almost listening to music over again with these head phones. The bass is so deep. The treble is nice, and especially with winamp you can tune this so perfectly to your listening preference. I have to say - these headphones remind me of the old Sony. QUALITY. LASTING QUALITY.Having said that - these aren't $1000 Sennheiser's. If you want that fidelity - then you have to pay out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for cost.","review":"I recently purchased these headphones and I am quite satisfied for the price.Sony MDRs have the flattest frequency response for any audiophile this is good. The frequency range is amazing and beyond the hearing range of the average human ear. Human hearing is from 20Hz-20KHz. These phones go from 18Hz-22KHz if I am not mistaken.I wish that they blocked out more outside noise and that the wires didn't clack about causing annoying clicks in the ear sometimes.Overall these are excellent listening phones for sitting and listening to music in all it's quality. They may not be good for running or listening to anything near traffic, however, they will protect your ears from damage unlike the stock iPod earbuds that destroy your hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at first","review":"These were decent at first, with the downside being the bass had no power. Even without decent bass the mid-high range was very clear so for $14 or so these were an OK purchase. About a month later the speakers are crackling on certain frequencies, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy a high end headphone so I could trash these.

The plot is uninteresting and the characters are flat. The artwork is pretty, but not especially unusual.I cannot understand why this series is so often linked to Kenshin. The only resemblance I can find is that there is swordfighting and the main character has a dual nature.

I tested this scale many times. Sometimes it would give me the same results 3 times in a row.. But then sometimes 5 minutes later, I would get very different results, up to 2 lbs off. I believe part of the problem may be with the flimsy plastic casing of the scale. It looks much more sturdy in the photo than it does when you get it. I am returning this for a higher level Tanita model with a glass base. Overall, I think the Tanita scales are very good, but I think you get what you pay for and this scale is obviously the economy model. If you don't mind your scale being 1-2 pounds off than buy this, but then you might as well buy a cheap analog dial scale and not a digitial scale which is supposed to be within .2 lbs accuracy. There are definitely better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readings are substantially irregular...","review":"I agree completely with the previous review.

It isn't. For example, today the measurement varied (in 30 seconds) by 0.4 pounds. I was also curious as to how a minor movement in position on my hard, level, bathroom floor would affect it. It went from 175.8 to 177.4.

I bought it because it is a \\"spiritual sequel\\" to Branded to Kill, which I felt was a pretty good assassin movie with just a couple incoherent scenes. But this is way more nonsensical than Branded, it barely has a plot. This movie seems like just an excuse for the director to film a plethora of what he thinks are \\"interesting\\" scenes; including one with guys in the background wearing sarongs, covered in grey paint that are not even acknowledged. Yep, that had zero relevance to any part of the story.The only positive things about Pistol Opera are; one or two cool scenes (i.e. Stray Cat's assassination at the pool and part of her gunfight with the blonde guy), the movie's theme song and some of the characters are kinda cool too. This could have been an updated, modern day Branded to Kill, but is just another ridiculously wacky Japanese movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever come across. Unfortunately it is incredibly boring. It starts off very funny with a wheelchair assassin and gets really bad from there. The story is about a female assassin and the movie feels a lot more like a play. The music was great but it was the only good thing about the movie. The underage nudity has to be commented on also. It was just absolutely disgusting. I don't know how that is legal. This is a piece of art that I enjoyed looking at for a minute, but I found it unbearable to watch the whole movie.

I even took another reviewer's advice and skipped ahead to the assasination (after forcing myself through the first third of the book), but try as I might, I couldn't get into this book. The characters were dull and the story boring. I was immediately drawn in by the prologue, but then the story went nowhere quickly. The part about the assasination was interesting, but the monotony quickly took back over soon after. It is unlike me to not finish a book once I'm already halfway into it, but I just can't seem to muster up the desire to stick it out. I think I'll just skip to the epilogue and see what happened during all those dull pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry & Clara: A Novel","review":"Only two interesting things ever happened to this uninteresting couple: they were in the theater box with Lincoln when he was shot, and many years later the husband went crazy and killed his wife. While these were highly dramatic events, they were the only high points -- or low points -- in the lives of two remarkably boring people. Mallon has tried to stretch their otherwise idle and pointless stories into an entire historical novel. He fails. Readers will be better served by looking up Henry and Clara Rathburns' bios on the Internet and passing on this tedious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot, Bad Ending","review":"The book, Henry and Clara, written by Thomas Mallon, is about the couple who sat with the Lincolns on the night of Abraham Lincoln's assasination. Lovers from the ages of young teenagers, the basic plot is about Henry and Clara trying to convince Clara's father for them to marry, while Ira Harris (father) keeps putting it off longer and longer.The basic plot of this book was very imaginative and could be useful to people curious about Lincoln's assasination, though it lacked depth. In some parts of the book, it was horribly slow, and most of the military information really was not necessary. In the end, Thomas Mallon was most likely trying to speed up the writing process to get his book off to the publisher because the ending was the worst I have ever read IN MY LIFE.Though it was a fairly decent plot, it would be stretching the limits to give this book a rating of any more than a three because of the dullness in parts, occasional lack of description and terrible ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"elegant psychological study of an obscure historical figure","review":"Henry and Clara was an elegant psychological study of an obscure historical figure.

While there is a wisp of a thread that runs through the book about Mike Boyle and his interest in the race, the book is more about the early years of the Indy 500. It goes through the winners of each year in a repetitive fashion in a manner that 5 chapters could easily be condensed to one. There are also a number of sentences that are repeated, nearly word for word, over and over in several different chapters that lends the book a redundancy of thought. Specifically note the references every few chapters about WWII.If you are a big fan of Indy Racing, there are some interesting facts (not necessarily enough to warrant reading this book), but if you seek history on a gangster life style, skip this book. The rating of 4.5 stars on Amazon (Aug 09) is definitely overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbrella mike","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is loaded with history about behind the scenes. I love the \\"old days\\" of the indy 500 and this book hits home about some of the happenings of the day. I would recomend reading this book.

(which looked like 1/2 inch). It seems that eggcrate mattresses have changed over the last 10-15 years when I last had a 2 in. They don't seem as thick as they used to be. That is why the 3 in. was a good choice. The peaks were higher but there was enough density to the pad to add comfort to a dorm mattress.

When she hooks up with the First Lady after the SIDS death of her son, she slowly uncovers a theory about his death which may even lead to murder, and soon finds she's a target of those sinister machinations. With the help of former White House aide Gray Boudrant, who left under a cloud of suspicion that he was having an affair with the First Lady (and might have fathered her child), Barrie slowly unravels more layers, which lead to some high ranking officials, while the First Lady remains in seclusion.The romance between Barrie and Gray doesn't ring true, but Brown manages to make the pages sizzle. Sure, the story is pretty implausible, but Brown manages to just add one tense moment after another and throw so many villains your way, leading up to a riveting cathartic conclusion and complete surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One in a million...","review":"Geez.. this has to be Mrs. Browns best book yet.

Bought it again recently, and I'm amazed at how good it is! I used to prefer the first two albums, but now I consider this one as their equal. The sound is slightly more polished, but far from getting to the point of selling out. The highlights for me are Ordinary, I Won't Lie Down, Handout, Take it Back, Complicated, and Put You in your Place, but the rest of the album is nearly as good. I'm a huge new school punk fan, and this album definitely makes my top 20 in that genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 Step toward Commercial....But worth it","review":"This is F2F's 3rd release. The first track is one of their best (I've never heard it live) \\"Resignation\\". This is the first song that got me into Face to Face. It goes right into a very commercial \\"Walk the Walk\\". \\"I Won't Lie Down\\" is one of my favorites. Great live song as well. The rest of the album is good as well. The best track on the album in my opinion is track 10. \\"Complicated\\". Another great driving song. An amazing live song. For the new fan who is a little timid of the hard stuff....This one is a perfect choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"clean, fast, hard","review":"I've been a face to face fan for five years, and this cd just won't lose its edge...just as good as the day i bought it! if you like emo-core, its a great break from the snotty/poppy punk trend. check them live...loud, fast, sharp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy and upbeat walking tunes!","review":"This CD has a young, and fun upbeat feeling to it.

I've always loved the original group, but lead singer Jimmy Beaumont is the only original member still in the group. Donna Groom fills the shoes of original female soprano supreme, The Late Janet Vogel-Rapp. I was very skeptical, but they DO DELIVER on this album of mostly new tracks, except for two useless remakes of their two classic christmas releases. \\"One More Mountain\\" is worth the price of the disc alone, sung beautifully by lovely & talented Donna Groom. The song tugs at your heartstrings & touches you the way a great song, done beautifully should! Other stand outs are \\"You Got Me Ball & Chain\\" & \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\". Not as good as their classic tracks from the late 50's to late 70's, but there shouldn't be any comparing because the group is not the same as it was in it's hey day.

Some of the reviews I read mentioned issues with bass in the ears but I have noticed through listening to a lot of Techno, Dubstep, and Alternative (Screamo) music. It has a very good bass considering price, I would have to say that Sony never dissapoints imo.

I git them on Amazon a little over a year ago, and I somehow broke one of the ear pieces off. I pulled them up online and saw the price of $60. I knew that wasnt what I paid. I pulled up my old order and I paid $14.53. Right under $25 with two day shipping. They were good headphones for the price of $15. But at $60 they aren't worth it. I dont under stand why they would more than quadruple the price. I will be getting something else to replace my broken set.All of the reviews saying they are great for the price are also from before they cost $60. They are not great for the price anymore. Think about it. You will be buying headphones that sold for $15 for the longest time, only you're paying $60 for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I wouldn't recommend this set of headphones. You can tell it's cheaply made. The design of the headband is ridiculous; it creates pressure at the top of your head which is uncomfortable after a few minutes. The sound quality is average at best. And even at the softest volumes, it is still audible to someone sitting next to you.edit: I paid $24 for these two years ago. They weren't worth THAT amount. Now they're charging more than double!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for your buck","review":"Look no further than the Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones. The sound quality is great and they are good to wear for hours fitting comfortably over your ears. I have a pair at home for my media PC and another at work.

I may be a bit of an audiophile but I know bad headphones when I use them. The mids are not that powerful and the highs just crackle annoyingly. And do not believe these provide good bass response. I would say that any sound under about 50Hz just buzzes and is about as annoying as the highs. Don't bother with these unless you really don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"Nothing very special about these headphones, but for this price, its the best out there.

I also use them from time to time for music. For the money they do the job. They are pretty good for blocking out outside noise.

Actually, a lot better than that but don't expect big, booming bass. I used to have Skullcandy Ink'd in-ear phones and when I listened to Love Lockdown by Kanye, it was amazing the depth I perceived from those $10 items.

They are not as loud and you can hear the music about 30ft at high volume away. One thing that is wrong with this is that can they make this cord any longer? The cord is at least 8ft tall maby 12ft.

They stick out a full 2 inches from your ears. The only way you could wear these headphones and not look absurd is if you were Andre the Giant.

These are pretty comfortable but I wouldn't rely on wearing them for more than a few hours at a time. The top of them that sits on your head could use a little padding but I'm a wuss so that's not a big deal.The sound is great in my opinion. Don't know why they have a music - movie switch on BOTH ear phones but they do...I don't change the setting but maybe it matters. Overall a good purchase.

They are pretty inexpensive and still are good quality! They provide the perfect amount of bass and are extremely comfortable.

When I first got them, I measured the cord and it is 11 feet long! Now the only things that are bad about this is that it tangles easily and is quite bunchy in your pocket.But overall this is a great pair of headphones!

They are total crap. The headband is very uncomfortable, they do very little muffling of the sound around you with zero noise cancellation and the bass is lousy. I have in-ear canalphones that give me better bass than these things do. From what I can tell anything below 60 or 70hz just isn't audible at all, and anything above is like a whisper in the bass category. Pathetic. Also the \\"music mode\\" vs \\"movie mode\\" toggle has never given me any audible difference what-so-ever.

They are also uncomfortable... my ears get hot really fast and the top of the headphones push right into my skull like a spike.Edit: After using them for a few days I had to come back and lower my rating. The treble has so much echo and no definition. I can't even hear the kick drum in my music with these. They are literally the worst headphones I have ever used. As note, I mostly listen to metal with them, so they may be better for other music. They also let out a ton of sound. These will definately annoy my coworkers.

Could be worse, but not good.Edit: after a good year or 2 of owning these, they still work and I am still using them daily. I also think they opened up quite a bit, the sound I feel is considerably better than when I first reviewed them. Also, they are very comfortable, sometimes I just wear them so people won't talk to me. The echo is also gone, though I imagine that is more my brain/ears compensating. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value.","review":"These headphones are a great value. They are big, with ear cups of about 5 1/2\\" in diameter. The sound is good, for me anyhow,(I have significant hearing loss), but very bass and full sounding. I prefer more treble, and cannot hear it as well unless I turn them up really loud. As for the movie/music selecting switch, I cannot distinguish between the two modes, maybe its just my hearing.

If you pay $50.00 or even $30.00 for these headphones you will be disappointed. At the most these headphones should actually cost $ 15.00. This is not the quality I expected from Sony.

His old pair of headphones weren't cutting it for recording tracks onto his laptop or even just listening to some songs on his Zune. These fit his needs perfectly and so far he loves them. They fit his head comfortably, the pads don't make his ears hurt and the sound is awesome. I put them on when he was explaining the switches (I think something like music and movie are the switch options) and you can definitely hear a difference in the bass, movie is made to get the most out of all the explosions and other loud sound effects.

People say they hear their music or movies like they never have before, and I can assure you, that is completely true, especially with this set. Very good quality, even considering the price. Would recommend to anybody looking for a sturdy pair of headphones.Giving a 4/5 because of the size, though the quality of sound makes up for it. Wears your ears down after a good 3 hours of use, and looks like you're wearing cd's on your head (3 3/4 inches is the circumference of the part that actually rests on your ear.)Overall, great, quality made headphones that are boosted by a great price.

They're cheap, so I don't have to worry about going over budget. They're also much better than the nasty old rubber bushings that the car came with. Due to various accident repairs, I've put multiple sets of these in the car, so I can recommend both pressing out the old bushings and setting them on fire if you don't have a press handy.

The problem is I could find no way to press lightly enough to allow a very thin stream of conductive fluid to flow. Instead, I get big pools of the stuff which goes all over the circuit.

Yes, it is thin (only 8 pages). If the only objective is to place the stickers then I can see where a child could do the entire thing in a day. What it offers is so much more than that. It gives the opportunity to read the caption for each of the stickers which takes time; time well spent with your little one.If you enjoy doing things like this with your child, buy it.

I have a Q22LW , Q66LW and a NC11A. I'd still like the Q66 the most because of its comparatively higher sound quality.

I loved these headphones to death. The retractable cord was certainly a space-saver, too. The only thing I disliked was that the sound wasn't too great and leaked easily. However, less than 7 months later, the right side just stopped working. A day after that, the left side died. Needless to say, the headphones are now garbage. It's not worth the money. Don't buy it.

A lot more good. When you have hot and humid days, it is not a good idea to use an air cooler that bases its cooling on cycling water vapor; (i.e., more humidity). I do not recommend this for people or pets. My regular fans are working better in trying to cool down the 100F+ days. At night it is okay-- but no good for the true heat. Don't waste your money. Buy a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refrigerator Carton Cooler","review":"Save your money. The only possible cooling you may get from this unit is if you have a refrigerator carton you can get in, (ask your kids) and take this \\"cooler\\" with you.

If you expect your room to be freezing cold, this is not the product for you. It's a COOLER, and it does its job very well. It works by evaporating water. Try soaking a T-shirt, wringing it out, and putting it on wet to get the effect. It doesn't work very well in humid areas, but it works GREAT where the air is dry.I'm in southern California, where the humidity varies pretty widely. I place the cooler six or eight feet from my chair, and on the hottest days I'm quite comfortable.Benefits:* it's about 1/5 the cost of an air conditioner* operating expense is a fraction of the cost of air conditioning* neat features!

Tried a normal fan, but it was only pushing hot air around.Pros - good construction. LIke the drain plug on the bottom and the remote control. Though I'm still int he winter here in Las Vegas, I expect it well keep my computer room cooler by at least 5 degrees. Surpentin, company that makes the cooler, has excellent customer service.Cons - the coolers pump was moving water through the back mesh, thus not cooling. However, I email the company and they immediatly sent me back another cooler and paid for all return shipping.I would recommend this item if you have a small room that needs cooling. Any other cooler cost a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"We're very happy with the air cooler. It really functions as a higher powered, cooler fan, it's not like an air conditioner at all. We primarily use it in a very large space with a small window unit air conditioner & a ceiling fan. The combination of the 3 keeps the place feeling cool. We've recommended it to several friends & may order more for the bedrooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works But Needs Attention","review":"This unit blows like a fan and does offer the benefit of cooler air, but only if you fill it with water on a regular basis.We bought it for our 13 year old niece who came to stay for the summer and she is too lazy to fill it with water, so complains that it doesn't work.If you are unlazy enough to add ice on hotter days, you're rewarded with significantly cooler air, as long as the ice lasts (maybe 1 hour).In short, with constant attention, it's a decent, (much) cheaper alternative to a stand alone air conditioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get an air conditioner if you don't want to be hot!","review":"I thought maybe this would work for me as I have a small place.

You have to put over 10#'s of ice in it just to feel a few degrees cooler than a regular fan and as soon as the ice melts it is just a fan and not a swamp cooler at all.

And I am thoroughly disappointed with its inability to cool, even within a small area surrounding the Cooler itself. Three separate times I have taken the temperature of the air near the Cooler, added ice water to the machine, and after several minutes (15-30 mins), measured the temperature again. In every instance the air temperature had not decreased, i.e. the appliance did not cool the surrouding air, instead it circulated the air like a fan - a fan that does not have a tremendous amount of power in comparison to Vornado fans. I would try to return the equipment, however, that would result in my paying nearly the price of the fan just in the delivery fees to and fro. Save you money - do not purchase this appliance, it behaves like a very low-powered fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is worthless","review":"This product actually made my room warmer and very humid. You spend all your time filling it with ice and water which is the opposite of what you want in the air. It works against the a/c unit and results in a warmer more humid room.

I am hoping it will serve as a large humidifier in the winter so I did not waste my money completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.","review":"I live in Southern Utah and it is very hot and dry. I like my bedroom to be cold at night and I hoped that I could use this to cool the bedroom and turn the central air in the rest of the house up. Well, I turned it on high when I got it and had a thermometer in the room and let it run with and without a window open. The air never went down even 1 degree even after 1 hour running. Another reviewer mentioned that it only has a net that the water runs over and I don't think that covers enough area to really cool. It is quieter than the next one I ordered. That one didn't cool my room either so maybe a evaporative cooler just isn't what I need. I ended up ordering a portable air conditioner but am so thankful for Amazon's return policy.

So I put this into my greenhouse only to bring up the humidity . I bought a whole home swamp cooler and it works far better then this thing. With my whole home system I cool my home for $100 a month vs the $350 power bill I get when the AC is on. It's not that I was expecting this little unit to cool my whole house but I wanted it to cool a small 14 X 10 room and it did not . I think the reason being that this unit is not made to pull in outside dry air. So from the time you put this on humidity goes up and doesn't go anywhere meaning before you know it your bedrooms humidity is so high this cooler stops working leaving you with a hot sticky room. It might work fine for some one who works out side and wants a cooler breeze but that is about it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts out way too much humidity","review":"Before purchasing this product, check your local weather forecasts, if you live in a high humidity area, this machine will not work, but will only make your room hotter.

To drain the water out, there is a plug at the bottom of the unit which easily unscrews. It rolls easily from room to room. The fan is pretty good and distributes the air evenly.Unfortunately because of the high humidity in my area, it is nothing but a overpriced fan.

When i ordered this Sunpentown swamp cooler, of course i knew it was not going to perform anywhere as effective as my much bigger window-mounted swamp cooler, so i expected it to produce moderately cool air. After running it for a while with ice in the reservoir and on the top ice tray, i can honestly say that it was not any cooler than a fan. I'm serious. Physically, it should produce cooler air, but it just didn't. Maybe it was 1F cooler than a fan, but is $100 worth it for a fan?

I love it!","review":"This little air cooler has saved my husband and me!! This unit cools down a room very well. It isn't too loud and putting water in is not a hassle like I expected. Once or twice a day i put a tray of ice cubes in the top section and it gives an extra chill breeze. The reason why I opted for this cooler is because it doesn't have any drainage or hot air flow tubes that require an outlet outside like most portable air conditioners. Also, this unit does not exhaust hot air out the back. We keep it plugged in in the middle of our apartment and direct the air flow to whichever room we are in. It isn't difficult to move, just a little sloshy with the water inside. You will need a slender pitcher or container to fill the cooler; the opening is on the side of the unit and is a little small. We live in a pretty dry climate and this cooler has been perfect. I give it 5 stars for cost effectiveness, ease of use, and overall performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I bought this unit based on the relatively positive reviews it was receiving. I have had lots of experience with swamp coolers, and I live in a part of California where there is the kind of low humidity that a unit like this requires. Nonetheless, it was completely ineffectual as cooler; no matter how much ice you add, it will not produce air that's much cooler than what's being pushed through a standard fan. What it does produce is humidity, and lots of it. One of the positive reviews I read about this product claimed just the opposite, but I assure you that such promises are false. You'd be better off looking for other cooling options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Here in New Mexico where the humidity is often in the single digits, good evaporative coolers can be very effective.

Using techniques of modern geometry, presented in an understandable way, it explores not just the solutions of dynamical equations, but the behavior of those solutions over the manifold in which they operate. The book begins by applying this geometry to well established Newtonian mechanics. Once you have that under your belt you are propelled into the Lagrangian formulation in a way that seems quite natural and reveals, easily, the symmetries that lay within. This book is written in a tight and readable style that makes even the most difficult concepts accessable. I highly recommend it and hope that it becomes the standard by which other mechanics texts of this level are measured."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tough book","review":"I used this book for a graduate level classical mechanics course without any prior knowledge of this subject (my background is EE).

The wannabe in the film is Orny Adams, who shows the ugly and unpleasant side of the business and his personality. He is a bad man.More than anything else Comedian shows Jerry is not much different than his SitCom character.

I know that this movie depicted what happens behind the scenes, but had he not been in it, I would of rated this much higher. In essence...I have never even heard of Orin, and the reason is obvious. There are so many other comedians worthy of placing in a documentary that would of made this more interesting.

I didn't find wisdom in this book. IMO, Dr. Phil complains that arguments are inevitable, men and women are hopelessly different, etc. The idea of people taking 100% full, personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences is not mentioned in his book. I've gotten better advice from Dr. David Wolf's 'Relationships that Work: The Power of Conscious Living' book which helped me find new ways to create a great marriage without needing my spouse to change or read any book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

My husband has never been interested in anything like this but he said he'd go through it with me and \\"play along\\" Our relationship has improved on so many levels, not only because of the book but it was a major help :) It does a very nice job of telling you how it is without you having to decode what it's trying to tell you.

It is interesting finding out who the killer is and his life story. its just falsely advertised"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Worth The Effort","review":"I must admit that this book was really not worth the effort it took to read it. I am a fan of the romance genre, but I still was let down by this book. I wanted suspense/with a little bit of romance and I was very upset that it took more then half of the book to get around to the suspense part (it had such promise with the prologue) and that the effort that was put into the suspense was not very good. I really was not compelled to continue reading. There was no \\"hook\\" and I did not feel that I would miss out if I never picked the book up again. I feel that this was really not a worthy effort by this talented authour. I am glad that I bought it used instead of new. If you want to read this borrow it from the library or a friend. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of some my nights","review":"I thought she should have spent more time in South Louisiana reserching for this book. First of all resturants around here do not sell Rhubarb pie. At the very least she could have used real \\"Cajun\\" last names along with the names of towns and Parishs. There is nothing \\"Cajun\\" about this book. As far as the story goes I am still wondering why \\"Jimmy Lee\\" was even included in the story, or the fight between Savanah and Annie. The way that Hoag would describe items, places or individuals went way beyond then what was necessary. Jack felt sorry for himself, not deserving of anything the entire book, what a bore that was. Laurel, what a pity she was wanting to cry at every turn. This the second Hoag book I have read and it will be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I must be missing something. Tami Hoag is a popular novelist, yet I cannot understand why. In this book, she takes forever to get on with the story, describes the smell of the swamp and a character's \\"peridot eyes\\" over and over again. The plot? It seems she can't decide whether she's writing a romance novel or a suspense novel. And the romance theme has been seen before. A strong woman who has had problems in the past encounters a man totally unsuitable for her, yet she is drawn. She fights it as well as she can, but then relinquishes, only to find that the man turns out to be her one true love. Ugh. If you like suspense and good writing, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Annoying Heroine","review":"This was my first book by this author and I was very disappointed. While she does get a A++ for her research of the locale and Cajun dialect, I found the heroine , Laurel Chandler to be very annoying. If she was going to rehash her past experience as a DA and the case that lead to her downfall one more time I was ready to put the book in the trash. I wanted to scream, Get Over It and Move on! The rest of the characters , including Jack (who I failed to find appealing or sexy) were fair to midland. I found myself intrigued with what the handsome DA Steven was wearing. His wardrobe sounded straight from GQ. So much for the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good read!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Although it focused more on romance than most of Tami's do, it had plenty of suspense too! I loved the two main characters, Jack and Laurel, and the use of Cajun French! Savannah was a heart-breaking character and a lost soul. The descriptions of the Bayou, the food, the people, the scenery made me able to close my eyes and feel like I was there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Great Condition!","review":"I love Tami Hoag and the book was good from start to suprising finish. The condition the book was in was very good and the time frame for shipping more than met expectations.

I had the \\"killer\\" fingered half way thru the book. It drug on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"slower than molasses","review":"This book took absolutely forever to get going. Read the first page about a murder, almost 30 chapters of filler, then towards the end she finally gets around to writing about a resolution to the murder.The 30 chapters of filler revolve around the two main characters week long session of love making and weak emotional breakdowns. My wife loved it.Overall impression of the book: Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book dragged on and on. The identity of the killer was predictable. The final fight scene was short and lacked imagination. The book has a few steamy love scenes but otherwise is worthless. I would spend my time and money reading another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mystery?","review":"I've read and enjoyed Hoag's novels before, but this one I just could not get through. I don't like romance novels. Lots of people do, and that's totally fine. However, this book is described as a mystery novel (read that back cover and tell me if it gives any inkling as to its being a romance), when it most certainly is not. There is no mystery or suspense until well into the second half of the novel.The first half crawls by at a snail's pace, and you get an inordinate amount of detail about, to be perfectly honest, a bunch of terrible people. Laurel, Jack, Vivian, the Reverend, Ross- none of them are very nice characters. There's really no one to root for except for maybe Aunt Caroline, and she's got a very small part.Hoag is generally a great author, but this is not one of her best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful AND laughable","review":"Can't I give zero stars? I had read \\"Night Sins\\" and thought it tolerable at best. I made the mistake of giving Hoag another chance with this dismal effort. As someone who's lived near the setting of much of this book, I cringed at the pitiful stereotyping. Laughable characters and an adolescent plot (I don't mean to insult adolescents) actually prompted me to mark the book with a post-it note, warning would-be readers. (in my home, not a library) I realize Hoag has her followers, and I suppose writing like this has its place--perhaps alongside dime romance novels--but I'll pass on future Hoag works, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn - quite disappointing","review":"I've read Tami Hoag books before and enjoyed them. However, this was not at all what I expected. It was almost like two books sewn together. The first 50% (thank you Kindle) was all romance and I kept wanting to slap the guy, he was so crude and obnoxious. At the 50% mark we finally get another murder, but still it goes back to the romance and the personal problems of the character. The murder comes second or even third. I finally gave up and skimmed to the 81% mark where it looked like we were finally being told who the killer was.I gave it two stars vs. just one because unlike Twilight and Fifty Shades I was (kind of) able to finish it. Alas, zero stars is not an option for unbearable books and books like this get 2 stars vs. 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Wolf","review":"Very disappointed with this effort by Tami Hoag. Not up to her usual standards. Found myself skipping over some of the parts (which I never do). Slow moving, far too much sex discriptions (I'm not a prude) and takes too long to get to the murders part of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, suspense and murder all rolled up in one great book","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The first Tami Hoag novel I ever read was \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" which was also very good but a little more gruesome and scary. \\"Cry Wolf\\" was more of a mild thriller. The things I loved about this book was the outstanding character development. You really come to know and like these characters (most thrillers are not into character development). I also enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters, it seemed so \\"real\\". But don't worry there is also plenty of action. You'll just have to wait for it a little longer than in most thrillers. I highly recommend this book. This is a perfect beach book. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cry wolf","review":"This was without a doubt one of the best books I've read in a long time.The heroine and the hero have all the elements to make a good book great. The tension not only between the two, but, also, between the heroine and her family is right at the edge and Ms. Hoag makes you feel everything she feels.It took me a long time to figure out who was the killer in this book and even when I did, I didn't want to believe it.If you enjoy this genre, this is the book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More romance...","review":"Normally love TH books... do not like same ole' romance in any shape or form. Too much sex and not enough about the murders... This book should have been called \\"sex on the bayou\\".

It had NO suspense whatsoever. About the only thing keeping me from throwing it in the trash in the middle of the story was the hope that the ending would justify the time I invested in reading it! Yuk, yuk, yuk. I think Tami Hoeg owes me a couple of hours"},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars really","review":"This was the first book I read of Tami Hoag, and it is also the last. I thought I bought a suspence book, that is how it was presented (yes, I did read somewhere that it was originally written as romance novel - it should have been marketed as such) but what it ended up being is a romance novel with a laughable \\"suspence\\" plot. Very predictable, she even gave away the identity of the murderer with a really weak metaphore. I did finish reading it only because I kept hoping it would get better and because I hoped that the murderer was somebody other than who I knew it was from almost the beginning. I guess if you are into romance novels you may enjoy it, I absolutely do not like romance novels. There are so many great suspense books out there, this is not one of them, don't bother..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I should have walked away\\" quote on page 528","review":"I had selected this book to read based on recommendations of several friends. It was one of the most difficult books I have read. (Difficult in that I kept saying to myself, Why are you reading this?) To much time was spent in setting up the plot and the ending was so abrupt. Ms. Hoag never spent time setting up the monster villian but spent two much time on the whining of \\"Jack and Laurel\\". I got tired of the phrase \\"I should have left\\" Actually it should have been me, that left this book. This will be my last reading of this authors work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Romance","review":"This book does not live up to Tami Hoag's standards. I thought it was a new book but it is written like a romance and hyped as a mystery. It is full of goopy hate-love senarios that are soooooo boring. I bought the audio book which was quite expensive and I am very sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance Novel","review":"I have read two other books by Tami Hoag. Both were very good murder/mystery novels. After reading one half of Cry Wolf, this is NOT anything but a romance story. Not what I wanted at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Dimensional characters","review":"I loved this book for its three dimensional characters. The suspense is not there like it was in Night Sins but thiss book is more about the two main characters overcoming their own self-torment and finally accepting happiness and love. Tami Hoag does an excellent job in fleshing out the two main characters and making them three dimensional. I enjoyed this book because of Laurel and Jack and not for the plot. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of time, paper and ink!","review":"At least I didn't waste any money on it, since I checked it out of the library. Cry Wolf is the dullest \\"suspense\\" novel I've ever read. I had to slog through 300 pages of goopy soap-opera histrionics before the plot kicked into what passes for high gear. All the characters are so broadly drawn as to be almost cartoonish, with the exception of the killer, who suffers from too little character development. The ending is slapdash, as if Ms. Hoag ran out of time. She should have spent more time develping plot tension and less time on the endless whining and hand-wringing of the two exceedingly annoying main characters. Very unsatisfying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, Intrigue and Murder...southern style","review":"This is the first Tami Hoag book I have read and I absolutely loved it. Each and every character in the book was well developed and totally fascinating. The romance between Laurel and Jack the main characters was believable and exciting. I love the way she intertwined all the characters in this Lousiana town. Being a New Yorker, I don't normally gravitate towards fiction focused on the south - but anyone would appreciate the way Hoag describes life in the Bayou, and truly makes you want to visit. I noticed some reviewers complained that the suspense didn't start until the middle of the book. Personally that didn't bother me because the build up with the incredible character development was fantastic and absorbing. The ending was satisfying too. This author has a classic, timeless writing style and I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry Wolf, Cry Reader","review":"When you read this earlier work of Tami Hoag, you can see just how much she has improved. In Cry Wolf, she thinks she is Barbara Cartland with murders. It is hard to imagine that this is the author who wrote such outstanding novels as Ashes to Ashes.Here's how the book goes: Oh, dark passion! Oh, deep secrets! Oh sex, love, violence! Electra! Swamp, alligators! Whimper, moan, and whine. Laissez le bon temps rouler, \`tite chatte! Oh, violence! Sex! Dark secrets! Deep passion! Oh, stereotypes! Oh, clichés! Whine, whine, whine. Sultry, hot, humid, violent swamp, bon Dieu! Sex! Deep, dark passion! Dark, deep secrets!Okay, that'll take you up to about page 250. From there on, read about four lines every page and you can keep up with the story.I don't know if the wolf cried, but the reader may cry from boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a romance novel than mystery/suspense","review":"Expecting a mystery/suspense novel, I was disappointed because Cry Wolf had little mystery and little suspense. Although several murders had taken place, there was little action toward investigating the murders or collecting evidence. For the most part, it was a soap opera, involving Laurel, her sister Savannah, her mother, her father and her step-father. Cry Wolf was pretty much what I was *not* looking for or expecting. I'll have to be more careful in selecting books in the future. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I thought this one was of Tami Hoag's best books yet! This is the most intense book with one predictable death that you're almost thankful for, and learning about Laurel and Jack's past makes your heart break. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angst-filled novel with little suspense or romance","review":"I've read page-turning suspense novels and tension-filled romance novels. This was neither. After more than 200 pages, the two main characters still had not gotten together. But they had spent numerous nights/days/afternoons hammering themselves with retribution over their past failures that poured into pages upon pages of guilty, angst filled thoughts. Oh, and in between, a couple of women are found dead.Reading about a woman who is near anorexic, wears baggy clothes, over-sized glasses and chews her nails at every turn of the page was not my idea of a fun read. She was only slightly better by the last page. I don't think the author had a clear idea of what this book should be--a romance novel or a suspense novel. It turns out to be not much of either. In the end, I didn't care about either one of the main characters. They need counseling...and I hope they get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - not the mystery thriller I expected","review":"I gave up half way through - way too much I love you - No I hate you sappy romance and pathetic sex sequences. By mid-book there was no murder mystery thatI had expected.Not worth the time it takes to get to the point.Tami Hoag should just stick with the murder mystery stuff and forget the romance - or at list keep it to a minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"Jack and Laurel were different, but great characters. Tami always create some of the best charaters. I began reading her books in 1996 and havn't stopped. I have read all her books that I know of under her name. They are all #1 in my library. KEEP IT UP TAMI. I hope your new book ASHES TO ASHES is just as great. I will soon find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am an avid reader. I have read numerous books by Tami Hoag. \\"Cry Wolf\\" is by far the most boring. I agree with another readers review in that most of the time the characters in the book whined. I skimmed through most of the book. I am always interested in who-dunnit so I read through to the end. I hoped as the story progressed it would become more interesting. It did not. I would not recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex","review":"A major theme of this book is sex in its many different forms.

RCA should have combined the handful of good '70s singles with some live staples on one CD instead. That's all anyone would ever need of EP in the '70s. I sold this set to a record shop a week after I bought it. I love Elvis to death. But this is garbage, worse than the trash from the movies. At this point in his career, Elvis was literally dying from his pill addiction. He's high on stage and the Colonel gives him more crap to record in the studio. Save yourself from being embarrassed for your idol. All you need is the Complete '50s Masters Set, TigerMan, Memories:The Comeback Special, Suspicious Minds:The 1969 Memphis Sessions and download the good stuff from the early '60s and '70s.

The third and fourth discs include studio recordings that were not released as singles. The last disc features live recordings, not including live recordings that were released as singles.

It was one of the few such dictionaries available at the time for English-speaking Czech language students. I found the book to be woefully inadequate in the number of words, examples of usage, and grammar points given for each entry. I have a rather large collection of dictionaries now in both the Czech and Russian languages and Trnka's book was one of the worst I'd ever seen. I ultimately disposed of the book. In fact, most Hippocrene language books I've seen in bookstores are of very poor quality. As a linguist, I would never recommend them. One would be much better off purchasing Czech published dictionaries as I eventually was able to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as they say","review":"This dictionary is OK for a tourist who will use it to read a few store signs and order a beer, but it IS somewhat unreliable.

If you can wait until you get to Prague (or another big town), you'll find better and cheaper dictionaries there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"Annoying font, confusing layout, highly abridged. This book is supposed to be a reference tool, but it seems like the publishers decided to try to make it look \\"hip\\" by giving it a stylized old-fasioned typewriter font and putting the entries in all lower-case.

For in-depth translations, definately go with one of the larger (pricier) hardcovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks important words, sometimes poorly translated","review":"This is such a bad dictionary I am surprised it is still being bought.

It's small enough and cheap enough to be carried around easily and gives you a ton of words to learn whenever you get the chance. I use my huge Czech printed dictionaries for more intensive home study and take this book around wherever I go. I recommend it along with other works by this author.

Unfortunately, my anticipation was not rewarded. Ms. Shreve's idea for \\"A Wedding in December\\" was sound and could have been developed into a terrific book. Instead, she provided the reader with poorly developed characters and an ill-conceived storyline tied to a rather odd \\"secret\\" from the group's past. Interspersed within the main theme was a story-within-a-story about several people involved in a historical disaster that had no apparent relevance to the main story. It was out-of-place and, as a result, it consistently served to interrupt what little momentum the main storyline was able to carry from chapter to chapter. To top it all off, the ending fell flat and was unsatisfying, giving the reader no sense of closure. I would not recommend this book and have actually cautioned friends against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's just pretend this never happened..","review":"I'm such a huge Shreve fan that I preordered this book months in advance and couldn't wait until it came. After reading about 75 pages, it became a chore. The details are so cliche-a group of college friends reunited, old loves lost and refound, a dear friend who died, etc. Then there is a bizarre second storyline about an explosion in Halifax at the turn of the century. That,along with strangly placed references to 9/11 throughout the book made me want to cry (with disappointment).Anita, I'll wait for your next one, but this time without bated breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and boring with self-centered characters","review":"What a disappointment this book was after having enjoyed some of her other novels! The characters are dull and self-centered. Who cares what happens to them? I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. They haven't worked out isses from high school! What boring lives they have had!! The conversation between them is stilted and unreal. I want to tell them to grow up and move on!! But don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I am an avid Anita Shreve fan and have purchased and read all her books. A Wedding in December was definitely not worthy of her. I was so disappointed, I considered asking for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going On Here?","review":"Did Anita Shreve promise her publisher to a book of so-many pages? Is that why the Halifax disaster novel of Agnes is included? Or, is it there as a clumsy attempt to mirror 9/11? Whichever, it is, it fails! I would have liked to learn more about the other characters, Jerry, etc.I'm the type of reader who usually finishes a book, no matter how painful...and I finished this one. I had to, as I had just stopped at Day 5 in \\"Ten Days in the Hills.\\" I couldn't fail on two consecutive reads.If you haven't purchased this book, don't! If you have, save it for the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and inconsistent","review":"I listened to this on CD in the car and believe me if I hadn't been on a long trip and needed something to listen to I would have stopped withing the first few chapters. There is only one or two characters worth liking and rooting for (the couple marrying) The rest are sniveling idiots and the story withing the story is so predictable. Ms Shreve also needs an editor for the inconsistencies within the story. A little more research please"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few strong points","review":"The premise of this book sounded very interesting, and probably could have been. However, you instead suffer through a very slow beginning and middle, only to in the end be disappointed with unresolve. The book does contain some interesting scenarios, such as the Halifax disaster, the struggle with cancer, and the \\"butterfly effect\\" of the past, but these high points are overshadowed by a slow pace and abrupt ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story idea never developed","review":"Shreve took FOREVER to tell this story, and she told it very poorly. The characters were cardboard figures...shallowly developed. And what was the point of the novel within the novel? This book disapppointed me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great \\"Evening\\" Read","review":"This book was thoroughly enjoyable, and the characters nicely drawn. Shreve creates wonderful word pictures, and has provided the elements of love, mystery, and reunion within a beautiful setting. She also leaves the reader to decide what happens next, at the conclusion. It reads quickly and holds your attention from beginning to end, with the added twist of containing a story within the story. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and I am a Shreve fan","review":"I have read almost all of her books and this one was just not one of her best. It took all my effort to get through it and the only reason I didn't put it down is because I am a fan of hers. I wouldn't recommend this book, however I highly recommend Anita Shreve as an author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Story Teller","review":"I've been a fan of Shreve's for years and one thing I've learned is that she has a talent for telling a great story. Great characters and circumstances. This book is no different, even if it's not her best work.The story is of a group of 40-somethings getting together for a sort of high school reunion. While they seemingly had a lot in common at 18, their lives have all taken extremely different paths. A joyous event, a wedding of two, has brought them together. However, under the surface secrets, sadness and tragedy lie.Again, I wouldn't say this was as good as The weight of water, sea glass or the pilots wife, it's still a good read. If you haven't read Shreve before, I'd recommend anything she's written, as I mentioned, she really is talented!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't even finish it!","review":"I'm a Shreve fan and was SO looking forward to her new book but it doesn't flow well for me and I just can't seem to get into it after reading 1/2 the book already! The characters blend into each other and one writes a story ~ perhaps the story within the story is confusing to me and I can't get past that. Anyway, I give up and am disappointed. LIGHT ON SNOW, her recent book was better. If you need a great Shreve book to read, go for FORTUNE'S ROCKS! That's my alltime fav of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"La la la...connect the dots...PLEASE!","review":"I was very disappointed in Shreve's latest effort.This book is so disjointed, with: characters I never came to care about, men speaking in a woman's voice (I kept thinking - come on - what guy talks like this?), a bizzarre interjected story one of the characters is writing (which just made me go - huh? and skip over it), strange dialogue about 9/11, and a weird supposed cliff-hanger ending, which made me think - who really cares? These self-involved idiots need to get better excuses to cheat on their spouses than former infatuation, even if it was around a tragedy - grow up! This was a throw it across the room when you're finished reading it book."},{"rating":"1","title":"halifax story was the only redeeming point","review":"very disappointing. glorifies and justifies adultery. only redeeming part was the sub-plot about the Halifax explosion which led me to do some research on that historical event. build up of the secret revolving around the night of Steve's death was such a let down. so trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous dribble","review":"I loved the Pilot's Wife, so I thought this might be an interesting one to read as well. I was sadly mistaken. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. The understory written by Agnes is a distraction, and the bottom line is I just didn't care about any of the characters when it was all said and done. I really felt as though Shreve's goal was to impress me with her amazing vocabulary and make these people seem as haughty and pretentious as possible. Now I'm not sure I'd like any of her other books. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!","review":"While I usually enojoy this author's writing, this book took me 3 weeks to finish. I found it especially tedious and the little segments where Agnes was writing about the Halifax episode were boring. I skipped over those parts, which turn up quite frequently in the book. I definitely say this was not one of her best books, but will read more of them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Depressing","review":"Found this book to be boring and depressing. Did not enjoy Agnes's story within a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can relate - this is an amazing book.","review":"This being my first Shreve book, I was pleasantly surprised. Offered on the pages of this book are issues that may raise the hackles of some readers, but remember that it is fiction. Shreve does an outstanding job developing characters who are real. There is no \\"happy ending\\" which, for me, was a happy ending in and of itself. True women's literature. I found it refreshing to read and have become a Shreve fan based on this book. Highly recommended if you can handle what may cause some to squirm. I'm reading \\"The Weight of Water\\" next."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"This book was depressing. I read it with my book club and I found it boring and sad. I love to read books more than one time but this one I threw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Shreve","review":"I waited quite a long time to read this novel which I reserved at a local library. I was very disappointed and surprised because I had thoroughly enjoyed all of Shreve's previous novels. This novel was more complex than it needed to be....maybe because the main characters, best friends from high school didn't provide enough story. Shreve's constant reference to 9/11 seems out of place and the sub-story about the Halifax disaster was ponderous and I skipped most of that. I am hopeful this is a low point in Shreve's literary work and that we can expect another novel soon that is worthy of her previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book feels like a parody of Anita Shreve's better work","review":"All of the elements that make \\"The Weight of Water,\\" \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" and \\"The Last Time They Met\\" compelling are there: the sense of longing, of what might have been, haunting memories, sensuality, unresolved and unrequited first loves. But perhaps because so many of the characters are experiencing these same feelings at once, there's a feeling of overkill and emptiness to it all. \\"Wedding,\\"in fact, almost reads like a caricature of the Shreve we know and love. It was interesting, theoretically, to observe the parallels in this book, the same formula for a relationship repeating itself again and again. But the characters felt hollow, perhaps because they were all asked to share the same basic conflict and plot. Harrison in particular annoyed me...I thought he was shallow and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite themes and shallow characters","review":"I am not a *huge* fan of Shreve's to begin with, but I usually at least find her books entertaining and thougtful (like Light on Snow). But this one was not even good. The idea that we can't get past our high-school first loves to the point that we would all have disfunctional future relationships is trite. The implicit defense of infidelity in the face of the seemingly overwhelming pull of these shallow first infatuations is just sad. Please. I didn't marry the first guy I had a crush on, but I have more insight in myself and perspective on those immature first relationships and respect for my husband and kids than to jump in bed with the first old flame I meet at a reunion or event of mutual old friend. Not worth reading. I only even gave it 2 stars because the subplot of the halifax disaster was at least mildly entertaining, even if it made absolutlely no sense in light of the larger story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Chill - W/O the humor, compassion, etc.","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that this book was a big dud. The dialog was stilted, there was little character development, the \\"big secret about that night\\" was very anticlimactic. The only characters I really cared about were in Agnes' backstory. I would have read that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty pointless and definitely boring","review":"Shreve may have had a good idea with what she WANTED the point to be, but the book never makes it there. Definitely not worth the time I spent trying to get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"This is the first time I have read Shreve and probably my last. This book was so boring and I had a hard time just finishing it. As stated in other reviews, there wasn't any reason to reference 9/11 so many times. It didn't fit the story. I also thought the explanation of what happened to one of their friends was ridiculous. It may have been realistic, but Shreve could have come up with something more page turning. I'll never get the ten minutes back that it took for me to drive to the libabry and check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable even with Unresolved issue","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as I have all the other Shreve books (except Light on Snow, which I haven't read yet, but will now as I am reminded what a great writer she is). But a question remains unanswered: 2 times (maybe 3), Shreve refers to \\"oily cylinders\\" floating at the edge os the eye of Agnes. In fact the 2nd to last chapter of the book (I think it is 2nd to last) ends with a reference to this thing in her eye. What is the purpose of this? the only thing I can think is that maybe Agneshas MS (Multiple Sclerosis) as this is a common early symptom.The last chapter refers to \\"diagnoses\\" so maybe I am right. Maybe she will be the main charachter of Shreve's next book and this will be the story line.....did anyone else notice this factjust \\"dangling\\" at the end of the book like I did?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have rather watched paint dry","review":"I anticipate the arrival of Anita Shreve's latest book and this was no exception. A huge disappointment. Cliche-ridden and just plain boring. 180 degrees from The Pilot's Wife. Even the normally delightful prose describing the New England scenery seemed stilted. The characters were poorly drawn parodys. The story within the story was totally irrevelant. The comparisons made with current events made no sense. I skimmed the last half and then just gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo disappointed","review":"I'm an Anita Shreve fan, and this book was so disappointing. The characters were so unbelievable and totally undeveloped. I kept struggling through it in the hopes that it would redeem itself, but no, it was one huge disappointment. Not up to the standards of her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book","review":"This book was BORING!! I made it to the 5the chapter and stopped. The beginning focuses a lot on their high school/college days. Just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ho-hum wedding in december","review":"I have read other books by Anita Shreve, so I imagined I would like this one also. I have started and stopped it - but only got to page 57. I am still debating finishing it. I found the \\"imaginary story\\" very boring. It may get better but there is nothing there to hold my attention. I think she should stick to one plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting characters","review":"I really don't find these characters worth knowing. This bunch of prep school alumni have ended up in predictably artsy/intellectual careers yet come through as vacuous both intellectually and morally. They keep invoking 9/11 and a classmate's death for instant (read cheap) emotional impact. The dialogues between Harrison and Nora are so meaningful as to be insipid. Compare this to any Anne Tyler novel, where the characters can be perfectly bland but are somehow worthwhile... at least interesting... striving after something real, human, and decent rather than merely urbane.Rereading the above, I'm shocked by the harshness but stand by it. Remembering that it takes 100x as much talent to produce a poor novel as a superb critique. Nevertheless, I find the story lightweight in technique and theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an interesting read","review":"I thought this was poorly written over all. It's a rehash of \\"The Big Chill\\" for younger boomers. The characters are boring-most of them are involved in extra-marital affairs in one way or another, and none seem to have a conscience about it. And they are obsessed about a schoolmate who died more than 25 years ago. I lost several friends when I was a teen and young adult. While I occasionally miss them and talk about them with my surviving friends, none of us are obsessed with any of them. I kept wanting to say \\"get over it and move on\\".I like books that make one think. This book makes me fear for America if her portrait of self-absorbed middle-aged adults reflects any thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my 2nd Anita Shreve novel...","review":"and I can't say I am overly thrilled....I leave feeling there are many questions unanswered and almost irritated. I feel the context is good but the ending poor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholic","review":"The reunion of seven former schoolmates who hadn't seen each other in over two decades, on the occasion of a wedding between two of them, starts off some long ago unresolved issues and recriminations, where the concept of missed opportunities dominates. Most of them face these long forgotten issues with a heavy heart, because the passing of time hasn't alleviated them, as most of them previously thought. So the need to resolve, once and for all, what had been pending for so long culminates in a string of stunning revelations which eventually clarify things.As usual, A. Shreve's writing is somewhat dry but good, very good. The story and all its \\"ordinary\\" characters are captivating and absorbing. By reading this book, one cannot but wonder about the \\"what-ifs\\" of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"This book starts out with a bang and gradually fizzles out. I had the feeling that she lost interest in the characters and plot and just wanted to finish writing it. I kept reading it with expectation but was sorely disappointed as the plot deteriorated into a boring, silly narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am not encouraged to read any other Shreve novels","review":"This was the first Anita Shreve book that I have read, and I am certainly not dying to read more by her. There is no real story, nothing happens and I couldn't care less about the characters. What a disappointment. I'm glad someone gave me the book and I didn't pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soooooo boring","review":"this book is sooo boring. The ending is not well done and there is no climax at all. i couldnt wait for this book to be done"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Back at Their Lives We see Our Own Past","review":"I think that after we reach a certain age we all look back once in a while to life's decisions, loves, mistakes or simply what-could-have-been's. The premise in this book is just that, six friends who haven't seen each other in twenty-seven years have gathered for the bitter-sweet wedding of two of them who were lovers before but now with years, marriages and children behind them have rekindled their romance. The wedding is bitter-sweet because the bride has advanced, terminal breast cancer and is suffering from the side effects of the drugs and from fear.The book is classic Anita Shreve. The story is engrossing and serves to illustrate the ways that all of our lives take unexpected twists and turns. Her characters are people we all know, with some of their aspects falling very close to home. This book will continue her string of excellent books that force all of us to think about our own lives. There is little more than one can ask of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment........","review":"I was so looking forward to Anita Shreve's next book, as I have read everything she has written. I wanted to love this story, but couldn't even like it. I am half way through the book at this point and will probably not finish it. The story within the story that Agnes is writing ruins the original story which seems to drag in any case. Oh well, maybe next book..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow","review":"I do have all of her books and like her as an author, however this one fell short. It takes place over 2 days so that right there tells you it's a slow mover. Unfortunately the subject matter isn't exactly a mood lifter either. But I know they all can't be :( I do think this book may resonate better with people in that age group, perhaps in your 40's and 50's. Maybe that was all it was for me. I just couldn't really relate. I don't think you get the chance to know the characters very well given the short amount of time in the book. There are some sub plots but it is just very choppy and doesn't quite fulfill you in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a first draft","review":"I have never read Shreve before and thought I'd give this a try. I love literary fiction, both contemporary and otherwise, and can appreciate books that are slow-paced and purposeful. That said, this was slow-paced, but by accident. Characters spend all their time thinking and rethinking, yet they still come off one-sided. There is no one to root for. So much drama and attempts at heart wrenching, and yet I didn't care what happened to anyone in this book.I read a review that said this seemed like Shreve took all her unused story ideas and put them in here, and I couldn't agree more.There wore some beautiful phrases in this book and some potentially good ideas, but most of it was drivel. It needs serious revising. I gave it two stars because I finished it, which I guess means I found something redeeming in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, dull read","review":"I've enjoyed a few of Shreve's works but this one lacks imagination and emotional intensity. It also contains the most preposterous literary device I've ever seen. The idea of a man, in the age of internet and cell phones, sitting down in a hotel room to hand write a seven page letter to his wife (which conveniently sets up the plot and fills in all the background) is just absurd. I was embarrassed for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually reshelved this one less than 1/2 way through!","review":"This book was hard to get into, right from the beginning. I forced myself to read about 1/4 of the way through just in case it got better, but it did not. Finally I admitted that I did not care about any of the characters, and some I just plain didn't like. Not sure what Innes was all about; there were enough characters in the REGULAR story without adding a completely different story inside of this one. I did want to see what happened, so I skipped to the end, realized it was as bad as the beginning, and put the book in the \\"sell to Half Price Books\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good writer, a lousy book","review":"what happened to anita shreve? i used to love her -now it seems like they will publish anything she writes, so she's stopped trying. instead of telling one story well, she tells nine stories poorly. woven together are totally disconnected narratives (including a ww2 era tangent) that never fit together. i didn't care about these characters. the dialogue is just plain awful. the story is predictable and melodramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not An Inspiring Book","review":"I have been somewhat of a fan of Shreve but I did not find this book one that I would pass on to friends with much excitement. I found the characters gossipy and critical of these supposedly good friends from high school - good enough friends that they would gather some 27 years later for a second wedding of two of the classmates. The constant appraisal of what each one was wearing or how they looked was disconcerting - especially coming from a male friend of the group. I thought the book was depressing with no redeeming value. I finished it in two days, however, which tells how caught up I was in the story. It was the aftertaste that bothered me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service from SF Planet!","review":"My husband ordered this through the SF Planet website (which will teach him not to order through Amazon!). Their website indicated that it would work for a 5th Generation 60GB Ipod Video. When he received it, the package indicated that it was for a 30GB Ipod Video. When he sent them an email, they responded by telling him to open it up and his Ipod would fit. It didn't and when he sent them an email asking for help, they never responded. A waste of money and terrible customer service.

The piece works fine and does look nice. It holds 2 larger toothbrushes and could hold a couple of tubes of paste.My displeasure was with the rust staining. If the bottom gets wet you are then left with a rust stain on the vanity. It is going to get wet since we use it near a sink.Another issue I have is with space consumption. I have limited counter space on my vanity. This product does not make the best use of space as the bottom flares out while the actual holder part is smaller.Please see my review for the soap/lotion dispenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Young Moon","review":"So many times I find myself describing movies, books or music to friends in terms of \\"what it's like\\". Well, when it comes to Young's Astronauts in Trouble, I just can't do it. I can tell you what it's not like... it's not like anything else I have ever read and not being a \\"space\\" enthusiast it seemed to hold little for me, at least on the surface. I guess that's why we have the old adage about not judging a book by it's cover.So many things are going on here, is it sci-fi? After all we are dealing with space travel (and cows!).How about intrigue? A millionaire industrialist is planning a covert colonization of the moon.Murder mystery? Yes people are dying and due to a radical element attempting to sabotage the rocket launchings even more my do so.And did I say there are cows ...in space!This book is entertaining, inventive and most definitely worth your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"On of the best stories I've read in along time. Larry Young does an excellent job of creating interesting characters and binding them to a well written story. You can tell the love that Larry has for the subject material it shows in the detail he uses and the plans he's created. His sense of dialog is great.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones","review":"Well these are the third pair of headphones I have ever bought.

I do get a headache from wearing them for over an hour but otherwise I recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of decently priced headphones. Great for games as well as movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best quality you will find for the price.","review":"These headphones are great if you want inexpensive headphones but still decent quality. They have adjustable sizes and the earpieces even rotate to fit you better. They fully cover your ears, which is a big plus for me, and block out sound pretty well. The sound quality is decent and the volume goes up nice and loud (my last pair of headphones were far too quiet). The cord is very long, which can be convenient.The only drawback is that they are a bit heavy and just a bit tight on your ears, but this is because of a sturdy design that looks like it would take a lot to accidentally break them.You can find better headphones out there, but they will cost 2-3 times as much. Best bargain headphones I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but it isnt at all !","review":"I bought Labtec 835 going by the reviewws , but now i have stopped believeing reviews and specificationgs...., these headfone are bad , no real volume with clarity , sick bass , i mean only u can listen to something like a lecture ...! good thing, these headfones are real comfortable !But then pay 16 $ for that ???

The film is way to long and parts of it doesnt even make sense. The killings are bad as you can tell all were done poorly with CGI. The last death with the man getting his legs crushed did look pretty good. I do not recommend this to anyone.

How do the writers stay awake to write this junk? How did they find investors to make it?? I guess it's just a cheap horror flick so I couldn't expect much. BAAAAD acting, unbelievable dialogue. All the actors had sort of \\"coached\\" voices, so it didn't sound real.I turned this boring movie off 15 minutes through. The final straw was this one scene in a restaraunt where this snotty RUDE customer complains, swears, and shoots his mouth off to the waitress, then punches the guy who gets in the middle. And nothing happens to him- he just walks out! I won't watch something when people can behave that way and not get their dues.

Like the elevator floor breaking off. Two deaths in this movie effected me, the first was the guy who was thrown from the 87 floor and is seen splatter on the ground, the other was when the elevator floor collapsed and we see kids that are like 5 years old fall to their death. Why did these effect me? Wel they brought back bad flashbacks of 9/11. You know people jumping from windows and stuff. So if were on the spot were 9/11 occured, I strongly recomend not seeing this. But for the rest of us, well the acting is terrible, so is the dialogue (I mean how many times do they really need to use the F word?), and the whole premise of a computer ship made from human cells being put into an elevator and coming to life is just plain stupid.

I don't think it gave me anything new of any substance; it is basically a rehash of everything that is either in the CoV manual or online in the official forums.Quite some time ago when I bought City of Heroes (just before release), I also ordered the Prima guide for it... although a lot of the information was basic, it was hands down better than the CoV binder guide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Prima, Sad","review":"As with the City of Heros book this one was a great idea and then Prima in their great marketing skills decided to not print updates for customers.

Cassandra's mother does some things that you will not believe, but Cassandra is determined to be a good mother and raise her children well.The older Cassandra gets, the more she realizes that she needs to expect more from the people she deals with. She can look back and see the progress that she has made over the years.Cornelia Gibson's \\"Surviving Broken Promises\\" tells the story of what many young women go through being a teenage mother.

A brother and sister team has worked out a scheme where houses are sold and resold illegally, with even the conservatories being removed overnight and sold again.

When the stove is very hot, placing a pot on top of one of these helps keep the food from burning. This design has very little contact with the stove though, so--unlike a little \\"cereal\\" trivet rescued from an old McClary Charm wood stove--we can't use it to make cereal over a typical fire (does not let enough heat get to it).

On the other side, times I thought he might've had an infection and made a dr appointment, he was fine. I figured even if it didn't work, it was worth the money to give it a try. I was surprised by how easy it is to use.The scope is very easy to see through. It does take a little practice (I recommend looking through while your children's ears are fine to get used to what they're supposed to look like). I believe it runs on 2 batteries, but they have lasted so long I don't remember. There are 3 different sized probes to see through any ear. As I've mentioned above, this has saved me a few trips to the doctor, so it has easily paid for itself. I would recommend these scopes to anyone - especially to new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful to medically untrained Mom","review":"I'm not medically trained in any way. But with three very young children, I often suspect ear infections or ear aches and wonder if it's worth the trip to the doctor's office. I got this so I could start to learn what an infected ear looks like to help me know whether we needed to go see the dr or not. I am very impressed with how easily this otoscope allows me to clearly see their eardrum. One peak and I can see a normal, healthy eardrum. And while we haven't experienced an infection since I bought this product, I have full confidence that I'd be able to see the difference after seeing a healthy one so many times.I didn't buy this to diagnose or self medicate in my home, but just to save us unnecessary trips to the doctor's office when my son is tugging on his ears and being fussy because of teething or a cold or something that doesn't need medical attention. For that purpose, I find this to be a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, simple to use, but poor execution","review":"The item is beautifully simple and a great product in theory. But it illuminates just about a few millimeters too short to be of use. I tried it on DH and he tried it out on me, but we got similar results. You could see the inner ear canal clear as day and get more clarity on earwax than you would ever hope. But the eardrum itself looks like a slightly illuminate white thing just barely out of reach of the otoscope, no matter how far you stick it in (and quite honestly -- it's not comfortable nor recommended if you push it that far). I thought maybe it was because it was that our adult sized ear canals were just a bit too long and tried it out on my sleeping 2 year old. I had the same problem, but compounded by much more earwax in her ears.I really had high hopes for this product. :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wel","review":"Don't be afraid to buy this model which is less expensive.

He suggested keeping the batteries full so the light is as bright as can be. He liked that you could see the ear drum clearly and that it was a reasonable cost. He had other patients he was going to recommend purchase this item because it could be really helpful and he encouraged me to use it.

He dropped it a distance of about 2 and 1/2 feet and the it broke OFF at the knees!!! Much crying insued. After a quick trip to get glue we tried to fly the darn thing. It never flew. This should be more correctly termed a glider at best and definately not for children under say 14 or so.We were able to return it thank goodness.

Okay so this won't win an Oscar, but that's exactly why I rent or buy a film -- because some academy says it's outstanding. I like realistic movies and this is one.

And why does Hollywood continue to greenlight such garbage? This story has been told a thousand times before-and better too. Ford plays a bank network security chief. His family is held hostage and he is forced to steal millions of dollars. There is no intrigue, no plot twists. One-by-one, the aging Ford kills off the bad guys and claims sweet revenge. Not only is it unbelievable, it is completely boring. This was on a hybrid disc so the HD DVD portion was crammed onto 1 side and the picture quality is not great. This one is not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrison can do better than this!","review":"Harrison Ford is my favorite actor. He's done this type of movie a thousand times before, and done it way better than this! I was struggling to stay awake the first hour. The action only picked up within the final half hour. I had to keep fast-forwarding, I was that bored. The story line was so far-fetched it grated on my nerves. A bunch of loser criminals (led by Paul Bettany---he can do better than this too!) try to computer-hack-rob a bank of millions by kidnapping Harrison's family, coercing him into helping break through the firewall he invented.

Some of Ford's best films, such as \\"The Fugitive\\" and \\"Patriot Games\\" have the same themes that are present in this picture but Ford makes his characters believable and this film is no exception.

The last 15 minutes were straight out of a macho mexican western. Old and decrepit Han Solo was brawlingas the script ran out of ideas, reminding me of Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Premise. This movie is bad...and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic to the max","review":"Pretty dismal film offering one-dimensional characters, boring dialogue, manipulative but failed attempts to shock the viewer, predictability at every turn, absolute absence of humor, and not much of visual interest. Usually Harrison Ford brings a modicum of charm to his roles, but he seems to have descended to the level of the film and seems rather cloddish throughout; I was barely able to drum up a twinge of sympathy for his character. The only redeeming elements were decent production values and some reasonably affecting acting by the supporting cast. Should have just turned it off, but I kept hoping (unreasonably) that it would get more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the informatics platform works out as a boomerang !","review":"What if you are a respectable Security factor and domain all the most unexpected corners in the complicated universe of informatics and suddenly the most unthinkable fact makes you display and undertake the epic aim in order to start all over again and try to act as hacker in your own job ?The normal state of things simply will collapse when a well organized band take the control and push around a patter family kidnapping his family to take certain maneuvers and so subtract 100 MM$.

What it suffers from is a long-winded, predictable storyline and too little action for a movie starring one of the greatest action stars in the past few decades. The action that was present in the movie was hokey and paced in such a way as to be uninteresting.The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because I stayed until the end. Honestly though, I am not sure if I stayed because the story was at least good enough to waste some time with or because I had already spent the money for the ticket. A truly disappointing notch in the belt of some fine actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"This movie started out like many action/hostage movies I've seen, but as it progressed, there were some original situations. I like the 'saved by the dog' twist that comes in an unexpected way. Overall, this is worth watching though some might be reminded of other suspense flicks they've seen with a similar plot. Keep watching...there are some unique parts.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, unsavoury techno-thriller","review":"\\"Firewall\\" is a hostage thriller with an IT bent. Sadly Harrison Ford is not convincing as an IT geek who can bust heads when he needs to and Paul Bettany is flat and uninteresting as the ruthless villian. Contains the usual off-hand brutality of this type of film and really, how much fun is it to watch a family being held hostage?\\"Firewall\\" adds nothing to the techno-thriller genre and isn't Ford getting a bit too old to be playing these types of roles?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I did not think i would like this film especially after reading some bad reviews for it. I ended up liking it, though. A lot of people have a problem with its unrealistic sequence of events, and im definitely not going to say that it could happen, but it is just as realistic, if not more realistic than most action movies today. As far as the plot, i found it pretty cool seeing all the steps the criminals in this movie go through in pursuit of the perfect plan to obtain $100 million. The action at the end, even though it is unrealistic to have a man Harrison Ford's age end up defeating 2 younger men in combat, it is really good action. I think that this movie is one where you have to have a certain taste for the movie genre if you are going to like it. So if you like sci-fi/action movies id definitely recommend at least renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"Its a mediocre film based on a mediocre idea turned into a mediocre script.

The only standout elements in the film were Jimmy Bennet's role as Ford's character's son, and the wrestling match at the end. Otherwise, a wasted effort with a lousy script, poor direction, and a misdirected emphasis on corny effects (the explosion at the finale says it all).

All around a nice product, but I will say that you should shop around a little, this was a pretty hard product to find....The only reason I gave this 4 Stars instead of 5 is because the unit does slip out of the base easily, but this does not provide an even moderate inconvienence for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice functionality but sound quality and coverage is poor","review":"This unit was easy to connect to our two line phone and configure for compatibility with the phone.But, its sound quality was poor.

You can actually see when you watch the films how his explanations are plausible. I recomend this to anyone who is interested in filmmaking. If you value the illusion, and are interested in keeping the awe, read it anyway, but if you want to have the mysterious edge that his films are famous for, Dont read this. It is pretty much a tell-all about what he did in his films.Did you know in Notorious He placed a lightbulb in the glass of supposedly poisoned milk Cary Grant was carrying up to his wife?

Of course, no other director has a more impressive filmography: over 50 feature films in about 50 years, with many of them merely great, and several landmark films that stand above all others.

Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago. The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.

For the most part, this publication is one long lengthy interview and is approached from a director's stand-point. Truffaut explores every aspect and Hitchcok took the time to explore and explain why he did what he did in his films, from his cameo appearances to the trick shots.

They work very well for this and I am good for at least another ten degrees. They do have some insulation, but principally the gap between them and my jeans as well as keeping the wind out seems to do the trick. I am not rating them overall because I haven't had them long, but I am well satisfied so far with the warming performance as well as the fit and the construction. There is one possible down side. The ankle closures look as though they should pull the elastic out of the cuff from both sides, they do not, so don't pull too hard on the side toward the zipper. The elastic actually only comes out on one side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pants","review":"Company shipped the pants really fast. They are nice quality and are not too thick or too thin. I really like the pull cord on the bottom of each leg which helps from stepping on the pants when I am walking around the house without shoes.

Then the whistling started. Started in the right ear, as reported by others. Vibration seems to be the problem. As long as I sit perfectly still everything is fine. However, now even walking makes it whistle. Covering the right earcup with your hand really makes it loud. I had the Bose ($$$) for five years without a problem (had to replace them only because I left them in a cab). Spend the money for the higher quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning my 2nd pair - Noise & feedback","review":"I received my first set as a gift and experienced the low frequency noise in the left earphone others have described here. After a few minutes of use (in active mode) the feedback in the right earphone was unbearable. I was forced to turn these earphones off to use them. I can buy better headphones for this money without the NC technology. I returned the first pair in hopes this was a defect. My second set (brand new not refurbed) exihibit the same problems.The background noise seems to build (sounds like thousands of crickets on a hot night) until they break a threshold level and begin a high pitched squeal of audio feedback.I am in the process of returning the second pair and requesting a refund. Luckily, I have all of the paperwork.I'm very disappointed Sony let this product get into the market. I only gave one star because there wasn't a choice for zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise Generator !","review":"This device has a terrible issue with generating feedback noise (hissing sound) after a few minutes. Instead of quieting down our surroundings you have to contend with this extra noise. Avoid, this products. It seems I'm not the only one experiencing this issue (see other reviews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to Bose QC2.","review":"These head phones sound incredible. The sound quality is like a speaker system, and they are a great companion with my iPod video. These cancel out a large percentage of noise, but not as well as the Bose headphones, of course they cost 3 times as much. With the noise cancelling feature on, i cant here a TV on at a regular volume in the same room. It is near immpossible to hear other peoples conversations, and they effectively drain out all car and plain noise. These come with adapters for a plane and stereophone, which come in handy, and also a case. My only complaint is that while wearing them for an extended period time, like a 2 hour car ride, they can become uncomfortable. Namely the top strap can hurt, and even give you a headache if it is in the wrong spot. The ear cups are perfectly comfortable. Overall I would reccomend these for someone who wants a cheaper version of the Bose QC2 set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad/Faulty Product","review":"I bought mine with the anticipation that they would be as good as or better than the Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones.I was wrong.I received mine today, and eagerly opened the package. I hastily pulled my old Altec Lansing headset from my computer and plugged these in. I found a battery and put it in and turned these bad boys on! MY EARS!!! The feedback in these 'phones was TERRIBLE. I was also experiencing a very low hum that was literally shaking the left channel. I couldn't take it. So much for good noise cancelling headphones by Sony. I turned off the noise cancelling and just listened to them regular. I was disappointed to say the least. This set does not have very good bass response. The mids sounded thick and muddy. I also did not experience very crisp highs. I am hoping I got either a bad or faulty product. To put it shortly: Do not buy these headphones.Now I get to evaluate Amazon's return services!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Product","review":"It did not take long for me to decide on returning this set of headphones. They are totally lacking in output and quality. Bass is weak and muddled, mids are distorted and highs practically non-existent. Sony rarely seems to market bad products but, in this case, that's what they are.The noise cancelling is OK but sound is important, and these do not deliver. More generally, people should be sure they really want noise cancellation with their phones... it adds to the cost and subtracts from the quality. For only occassional use I advise sticking with traditional sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"These aren't Bose headphones and they don't cost $300. I used them on several flights - both international and domestic and they proved to be of quality.They don't filter out all of the airplane noise, but do reduce is dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I recently purchased this set and used it on several trips (aircraft)They did not perform as expected, got a popping noise in the right speaker when listening to music and noise canceling at the same time. Decided to try a pair of Bose (more money of course) but wow, what a difference. This sony product was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I should have spend little more money and bought BOSE QC2 or QC3. These headphones crush my head and ears.

So do not need to worry about the look.For the sound, where shall i start?1. without the noise cancelling function turning on, the music sounds flat. not good at all.2. with the noise cancelling function turned on, the music sounds better. (whyt?) the noise generated by the headphone does a pretty good job in cancelling most unwanted noise. this is good. however, it also adds 'hiss' that is discernible while you listen to the music. this is bad.3. in general, the loss of music details is significant, even when you turn the volume all the way up. in a quite room, i would use the sony headphone coming together with my CD player.my conclusion is that if you do not care too much about the music details, this is perfect for you. noise reduction is very nice and effective, but at the expense of sound quality.Does my review sounds like one of the past reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing - 2 sets - 2 failures","review":"I saw the same problems as others. First set had rumbling in the right ear, and screeching in the right ear whenever I moved around (like walking). The defects seemed to get worse the longer I used them (about a week). I ordered a replacement set and they had extreme rumbling in the left ear right out of the package. Obviously a problem with this model. Stay away from them; save yourself the aggravation. I'll start looking for a different brand/ model now . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on What You Want","review":"If you are buying these headphones to be able to listen to music in crowded room, these are NOT the headphones for you. They work great at reducing background noise, but you can't hear the music very well. The sound is low and distorted. We returned these headphones the very next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought $30 headphones that are much better","review":"I was really excited to use these. They are nearly as well reviewed as the Bose. Unfortunately, they don't work so well. They just collect dust on my shelf. The noise cancelling works well BUT if you are in an environment where the noise fluctuates, you'll notice that. For example, a window seat on an airplane. Which is pretty much what I bought them for. Not acceptable. Bass distortion makes them unlistenable. For a while I just assumed that's the way it goes. Then I tried my girlfriend's $30 in-ear fontopia headphones and I couldn't put them down. MUCH better. No bass distortion and I don't miss the noise cancelling AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent effort, but still lacking","review":"I purchased these headphones because they were less than half the price of the Bose QuietComfort 2. Seemed to have decent specifications and reviews, so gave them a shot.The headphones are comfortable, with soft earcups, but they don't fit over the ear like the Bose, they rest on the ear. I found them to be comfortable, but just something to be aware of.The biggest drawback was that mine had a slight hum when they were plugged in and turned on, but not playing music. I assumed initially my set was defective, but upon exchanging them, the second pair exhibited the same noise. Even for a $20 pair of headphones, they shouldn't have any noise or interferance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money - nice to get it on sale","review":"Used my headphones connected to my ipod on a recent 2 hour flight. The noise canceling feature is very good and will surely make future air travel more pleasant. The monitor button also came in handy; can't miss out on important announcements from the captain. There are comfortable.The carrying case does take up some space in carry-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good noise canceling, good price","review":"I bought a Coby noise canceling headphone but the arms broke in my first trip, so I decided to buy a better one this time. I didn't want to spend $300+ on something that I don't use that often, so I choosed these Sony ones.$120 is a good deal for these headphones. The noise canceling performance is excellent. The only thing is, as many reviewers mentioned, the left headphone gives out some funny noise if you don't put it at the right spot, and it is kind of annonying. But other than that, everything else is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MDR-NC50 Noise Canceling Headphones","review":"Head phones worked better than expected. You can really tell the difference on an airplane when you hit the unmute button on the left ear phone.Much more comfortable than earbuds and quality is much better than the airline supplied headphones.My problem was that when I stood up to let someone out of a middle seat I pulled the jack right off of the headphone cord.

The whistling sound in the right earphone grows louder and louder with use. I've notced changing to a new battery helps -- for a while, a short while, then the whistling is back. Pushing in on the outer ear cover really sets off the whistle. especially on the right side. As an engineer, I'd say it's a design problem. As a buyer, these are just another pair of earphones with noise cancelling off, so why not get a pair without that feature and save yourself some money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Squealing ruins these headphones","review":"I have the same problem many people have. When using the noise canceling feature there is a squealing in the left ear. This ruins the headphones. An email to Sony yielded no response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and reasonably priced","review":"These noise canceling headphones do the job: they are not too heavy, have a good sound and fit well on small/average size heads. The case is functional though not sure it can still be part of a carry-on. It is probably not as good as the newer Bose system, but at less than 1/3rd of the price, it is for sure a better deal especially if you are just using them to travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I bought the headphones to make air travel more pleasant and to be able to hear music and other audio better on commercial flights.I am very pleased with the units.They do not, however, cancel out all noise - far from it. They reduce a lot of the low frequencies, where a lot of the aircraft noise is. They made it much easier and comfortable for me to hear the in-flight audio.They don't do much to cancel out other cabin noise, like people talking and such. The ads for these show people with loudspeakers for heads all around a user, who is sitting there in blissful silence - this is misleading in my opinion.So don't expect silence. But like I said, it made it much easier for me to hear the in-flight audio without having to crank up the volume and mash the earphones against my ears like I've tried with regular earphones. It also made the flight a little more pleasant even without any audio source plugged in to them.I like the fact that you can completely remove the cord, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud feedback noise","review":"I bought the MDR-NC50 headphones because they were half the price of the Bose QuietComfort 2 (which I unfortunately broke during a trip) and seemed to have decent reviews. However, I am having very bad feedback noises in some circumstances. (e.g. with kitchen fan and in trains). It had never happened with my previous Bose. I read some more reviews and apparently I am not the only one experiencing this issue. It seems to be a quality problem, and I do not have the patience going into a test hunt to find a working one.So, unfortunately I am sending these ones back, and I am going to spend the extra $$ on the Bose ones.If you have the extra $ and not much time, I would recommend Bose. (Bose headphones seem to be more fragile though).So, in short, the MDR-NC50 does reduce ambient noises, but at the expense of more annoying feedback noises (at least this was my experience). Sony should do more product testing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MDR-NC50 headphones","review":"I spent a lot of time comparing the Bose, Sony, Panasonic, and other noise cancelling headphones, and I determined these Sony headphones were the best value.The noise cancelling function works great, and the audio quality is very good as well.

Unfortunately, I am getting the annoying high-pitched feedback sound that another reviewer indicated. I do not know if I have a defective unit or if this is a bad design. The feedback is intermittent and changes pitch and is only on the right side. Sometimes I can force it to happen by applying moderate pressure to the right side of the unit but it will occur on its own as well. It happens with and without music attached but only when the noise cancel is activated. They are going back to Amazon today and I get to evaluate their return policy!I do really like the ability to remove the cable and the monitor button is a very nice feature. I wish the rest of the unit worked as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ear-piercing feedback","review":"I bought these to reduce in-flight noise when I fly. I did a side-by-side comparison in a store with my wife's Bose headphones. I couldn't hear much of a difference. They sounded great in the store.They were useless on the plane.Like many others, I heard ear-piercing feedback when I turned the headphones on and tried to listen to the in-flight movie audio. I tried adjusting the fit and the volume. At best, there was still a faint bit of feedback. Even without the movie audio -- with just the noise cancellation on -- the headphones gave me a headache. I switched to my wife's Bose set for a while and had no trouble at all -- no headache and no feedback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancels noise...but cancels quality!","review":"I debated hard about purchasing these phones after reading all the reviews. Now I have to decide about sending them back. The noise canceling works very well and I will try them on a plane. But the quality of audio is very poor. Bass distorts and treble cracks. At low volume, they're not bad....but I like to crank 'em up and these headphone just wont cut it. I will purchase another pair that are designed just for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy these!!!","review":"It says in the instruction manual, if not worn correctly, will cause howling. It sounds like feedback. You have to absolutely wear them perfectly. You can't move your head. You can't yawn. You can't walk. The howling hurts since it is such a high pitch. Plus, the audio is not really high compared to my other Sony headphones. With these headphones, I have to turn up my mp3 player at position 17, whereas other speakers play loudly at 12. The connection is usually loose as well, especially if you turn your head. I wasted my money at a Japanese airport in Tokyo, where I thought the quality would be great. Sometimes Sony makes flawed products. I will do my best to get a refund for the 19000 yen I spent (roughly 190.00). I thought it would be an equivalent to the Bose speakers for less. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT better than the Bose headphones","review":"I've owned the Bose QC II's for some time and decided to try these based upon the spotlight review that says that they are way better than the Bose.It just isn't true.

First i would like to say, im a normal kid, not an audiophile. These headphones didnt mask a single sound, and believe me, for $200 I wanted them to work.

The book has everything a beginning writer needs and I recomend they buy this before any other book. But for a slightly more experience developer it has little to offer.

Julie's site (ThickBook.Com) is also an excellent resource for bug fixes, etc. The installation of Apache, PHP, and MySQL can be tricky for some, and it might be best to simply upload to your own website for testing if things are appearing not to work on your own machine. Most of the time they work fine, it's just a problem with your installation. With this book, you'll be writing your own PHP scripts as soon as you start reading, and you'll be itching to write more.

You will want to sit down in front of your computer and dig in! Examples support both the Windows and Linux OS. In the first chapter, you will use the CD-ROM included to set up your own Apache Web Server with PHP4 and MySQL! This make the entire process easy for anyone to use, right on your own machine. Some basic knowledge of open-source programming is helpful as details on errors that you encounter are pretty skinny. The book assumes that each example works and moves on. PHP does help you through this as each error will echo a parse error indicating the line that you need to fix. With a little patience and some basic knowledge of scripting such as Javascript or Perl, you will learn to use PHP4 in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I actually bought \\"Professional PHP Programming\\" out of Wrox Publishing as my very first PHP book to help me learn it.

In short, if you are an Inu Yasha fan or are wondering why you should be, don't miss this DVD!The Inu Yasha series features moderate violence and occultic/horrific themes based in Japanese mythology which are probably too intense for small children.

There's no doubt about it. So then why do I give it a 2 star review? This is because of Viz's decision to release three episodes per disc. While the three episode format is fine for a short thirteen episode series, it is simply Unacceptable for a series like Inu Yasha, which is 90+ episodes and still on air in Japan.

Yes, it is a Halloween movie, but it's also Rob Zombie!I personally think its his best film so far. I expect ridiculous dialouge and gore. That's what he is all about. But, the thing is, I actually found this movie to be scary. I'm what I'd call a new horror \\"veteran\\". I've seen the classics. This isn't Michael Bay. This is Rob Zombie. What Michael Bay has done with his remakes is insulting. This is a sequel to a true imagining, and though it is brutal, it is truly origial as opposed to the generic and disrepectful tripe we've been fed so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie, but doesn't do the series justice.","review":"I've been a huge fan of the Halloween series of movies since I was a kid. And Rob Zombie's interpretation of the first Halloween movie thrilled me, as it delved into the history of Michael Myers that the original didn't. After seeing Rob's first Halloween, I was very eagerly anticipating this second one, since Halloween II was my favorite of the original Halloween series. However, this one seemed to miss the mark with me. It wasn't a BAD movie. It just didn't expand on the original like the first one did. Rob's Halloween II seemed more centered on the violence aspect and was closer to a \\"Torture Porn\\" genre than a true \\"Slasher\\". Also, there was a lot of just plain weird stuff in it that made it hard to follow.Overall, as a big fan of the Halloween series, this was worth watching. If for no other reason, just to see someone else's take on the movie. But, next time I sit down to watch Halloween II, it will be the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the worst","review":"Dreadful sequel.

When did the ghost of Michael's mom turn evil and insist on dragging that poor horse around? What was she spouting, apocalyptic nonsense? Who wrote this insanely pretentious dialog?

Bad.","review":"I liked Rob Zombie's first Halloween, but the sequel is horrible. Rob destroys the coolness of Dr. Loomis for no apparent reason other than the fact that he was given creative control over the series.

Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst remake ever","review":"If you want to hear a whiny ugly teenager cry and say F**** about a million times and watch the Halloween story completely ruined, more so than the first remake, this movies for you.Bonus complaints: Once again every character speaks in fowl language and acts completely void of any decency what so ever. 100% of the film is meaningless whining, insults, vulgarity and grunts (NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO STORY) You end up feeling no sympathy towards the characters whatsoever since theyre so deprived from a soul or any kind of identity. Very boring, pointless remake. Makes Michael more like Jason than in any other film in the series. Humanizes Michael completely. Adds psychotic visions into play, I hate that in horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Eat's A Dog...Im Serious","review":"Where to begin on this piece of s**t movie. Never ever in life have I came close to walking out of a movie, but between this & The Spirit my will power was tested. 1st what makes Michael Myers who he is IS THE MASK but for some reason the director didn't feel like he needed the mask. For most of the movie Michael is without the mask & jump suit (this time he wears a thousand hot a** jackets) & he grunts so much you start to think that at one point he's just going to flat out start talking. The kill's in this movie are way over the top to the point where you just start thinking to yourself are they serious. The sister he's after is 10x more annoying in this one than the last one, Dr. Loomis doesn't care about trying to stop Michael anymore he just cares about selling his book, for some reason there is a white horse that pop's up whenever the mom does & yeah he eats a dog...im so serious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have happened!","review":"This remake should never have been made.

Don't waste your money on this junk","review":"This was such a horrible mess. Hopefully they won't ask Rob Zombie to do anymore Halloween movies after this crap. His remake was enjoyable- I really liked it- but this was just HORRIBLE. There is no suspense element whatsoever to this movie- he just walks up to people and slashes them to death. It's so overdone that you know it's VERY VERY acted without giving it an element of realism. He should have done another movie with his ideas and left Michael Myers completely out of his idea for a new Halloween because it just doesn't work at all. I doubt they will be asking him to do another Halloween movie since this one bombed so bad. I AM very happy I didn't pay theatre price for this trash.

The whole movie was pretty good & I own it. I can see why so many people think this movie is atrocious, but they are failing to see the symbolism in this movie. At the beginning it gives you the symbolic definition of a white horse, which is a sign for purity. The visions in the movie that Laurie have are showing her connection with Michael and they are not just pointless. This movie was pretty good but nothing can compare to the first two. I like how Zombie took a different approach to the story instead of just re-doing it as we have seen before (Friday the 13th, which I thought was awful.) HIs take on it adds a whole new perspective and people need to realize that. Great movie, just wish there was more of Michael chasing Laurie whic freaked me out in the first place with the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroying a classic","review":"I grew up watching Michael Meyers. I loved all the Halloween movies even the most hated one Resurrection. And i aint gonna lie Rob Zombie did a OK job with the first one, but he totally missed on the second. Making Michael have flashbacks of his mom and a white horse. This was just a lame way to put his wife in the movie. The story just bores. The characters are stupid. Why do you have to show Michael without his mask so much. Meyers is suppose to be scary. By the end of the movie you lose interst in fear for him.And why does he happen to look like Rob Zombie himself without his mask!?! Not to mention the Picture quality of this blu ray is awful.

It's just more of the same \\"in-your-face-Texas Chainsaw-Massacre\\" techniques that old Bob The Poser seems to have ripped off yet again.

Do not get me wrong the more blood and violence, the better, but did the actors really have to use the \\"F\\" word every thirty seconds? The other major deal to me is Michael Myers (Tyler Mane)grunted every time he killed another victim. C'mon every true Halloween movie fan knows that Michael never spoke in the originals. Just one last note, if you saw the previews on tv and some of the different ones they were showing on different internet sites, you pretty much saw the movie. To me this one stinks just as bad as part three did."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie","review":"The movie was suppose to be agreat movie for me the second encounter to Michael but unfortunate it wasn't it was not a good copy so I'm having to send it back to the person I got it from.

So I'm going to have to get a better copy of the movie and hopefully it want show dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror gone bad!","review":"This movie was horrible. A needless remake and one of the reasons that people say sequels suck. I went to this movie on opening night thinking that it was going to be as awesome as the first one and boy did I want my money back. The whole movie was nothing but stab this a few hundred times and make it look like you are over powered and pissed like Jason. It was not worth the money I sank into it and I cant believe that it made 80 million dollars at the box office. I did like one part of the movie and that was when the credits started to roll. This movie took almost two hours of my life and I want them back Rob so I can go watch something better. Stay away from this one it is not even worth renting when you have been drinking. Two thumbs down into the bowels of hell thats how bad this film was. It had one of the most messed up stories and competely ruined this franchise for a lot of people. Do not watch this craptacular movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money!!","review":"This movie was quite possibly one of the worst remakes in the history of cinema. It wasn't scary, it wasn't suspenseful, and it wasn't even interesting. What was it? I could write an essay, but I'll trim it down for time restraints: pointless, boring, unwatchable, horribly directed and acted, just to name a few. The movie was an insult to the original horror classic \\"Halloween\\". Shame on you Rob Zombie for directing this trash and shame on the creators of \\"Halloween\\" for allowing him to. If it were possible to give negative stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats with the hate?","review":"Halloween II is another good add, but the problem is that in the end I was thinking about the third Installment, I was surprised by the ending and I applaud Rob Zombie for the surprise.(KEEP HATING HATERS!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than RZH1 believe it or not!","review":"I hate the remake and somehow loved this film (minus the ghost mommy and white horse) I think you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"I totally loved what Rob Zombie did with the Halloween subject the first time out, especially being a massive fan of the original film itself. But this sequel just plain sucked. I found myself laughing out loud at the pitiful acting (\\"Breathing excercises? BREATHING EXERCISES?!?\\"), and the needless, excessive gore was just - well - just that: needless and excessive. Was there even a plot to this flick? In the end it just seemed like a back-and-forth marathon of over-acted crying scenes with the girl playing Laurie Strode, then a ridiculously gory murder, then the crying, then a murder, and so on. Skip this. Seriously. \\"Saw VI\\" was Gone With the Wind compared to this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"Zombies films can tend to become bizzare very quickly and this movie it does so the quickest I have seen. Margo Kidder's mask like face is more hideous than Michaels, which is a shame because she cannot take it off. I guess ole Rob see's all of America as a cess pool of trashy people, barely worthy of being considered human. The original Halloween 2 has people you might care about, might want to not see killed, but this version portrays everyone as such pathetic scum that death is a release from their tortured exsistence. Death only counts if you care if the people die; here the deaths are meaningless due to the sub-human portrayal of the chars.

It is crass, vulgar, boring, tasteless and Taylor Scout Compton is a deuchebag and a really terrible actress.

His music is good and normally his movies are too. Halloween 1 by Rob Zombie was an astoundingly fresh take on the decades old Haddonfield horror story. It was dark and reminiscent of the 70's. Rob is obviously sentimental about this period like me. You had to be there for you young uns. However H2 severely let me down because the lives of everybody in this movie were so disgustingly trashy that you were hoping for them to get killed and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been dragged through the gutter. It is very depressing and just makes you want to throw it off like a coat that's too heavy. We forgive you though Rob because we know you're capable of much better. Try again and maybe we'll give you another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh NO","review":"I love the original Halloween and Halloween II, I also thought the remake of Halloween was OK. This movie was pretty pathetic. I just wish Rob Zombie would have stuck to the hospital environment in the original part 2. In this movie the character of Laurie is changed, she's foul and hard. There are flashbacks with the usage of another child actor to portray Michael and the kids does a terrible job. Overall this movie was a mess. I was so eager to see it and so let down once I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"MICHAEL MYERS R.I.P. PLEASE","review":"i think it's really time to bury the Halloween franchise. While Rob Zombie's first rehash was reasonably well done, this one's just a bloody mess. Starting with a script that is 95% profanity and a perverted mysticism involving Mikey's mama and a white horse, the movie just drags on with brutal killings, wasting its formidable cast's talents. John Carpenter's original is still the best and I see no reason to continue this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"shouldn't be called halloween 2 / big disapointment","review":"understand that this is completely rob zombies take on the Halloween franchise. after being disgusted with the first, i gave it another shot hoping at least something was learned from the first mess. why is this even called Halloween 2? there is almost no similarity between the original and this.

At first I thought a remake would be interesting with Rob Zombie as the director, but he totally blew it on both movies, especially this one. It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared. This movie is really not even worth watching....even if you are a devoted Halloween fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"RZ, just stop!!","review":"Zero suspense, just a lot of blood and hillbillies. This is the movie my 15yr old Nephew would make. RZ is laughing all the way to the bank. He doesnt care what the true John Carpenter fans want. RZ couldnt hold Carpenters boom mic. Well, he wont be getting another dime from me. I couldnt even finish this one. Absolutely terrible! The first RZ Halloween was ok I guess, but now this one is just ridiculous. BTW, I also hated all of the halloweens between 2-H20."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely unexceptable","review":"This movie was not only the worst Halloween movie but one terrible movie. Rob Zombie should never touch any established franchises ever again, this is not Michael Myers not at all none of the famous score is in it theere some much wrong with this crap he doesn't even where a mask for most of this movie. Terrible oh yeah and he has a voice WTF? even though the original franchise wasn't getting any better at least it was Halloween its a shame Moustapha Akkad passed away the holder for this franchise and now apparently any one can touch it now. Rob Zombies not directing part 3 thank god lets just hope its not a season of the witch remake and hes back for 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"The suspense is DEAD here, not a true Halloween Myer Film","review":"I don't know where to begin... this movie was nothing like a Halloween movie nor did it feel like a Michael Myer film. The film is so lacking and not creative as in any Halloween theme. I seriously think Rob Zombie was a wrong candidate to remake HALLOWEEN and ruined any good chances of saving room for any sequels to follow. He also ruined the whole Michael Myers character too, very misleading and using his wife Sherrie Zombie just makes it all the more worst... Rob should have never been given the opportunity to remake HALLOWEEN because he RUINED IT... I hated the whole hillbilly and atmosphere look of this movie... so poorly done and so hard to follow through... this one should be scrapped and remade again by someone with better talent in scriptwriting... MAN I am so bummed out by this film and absolutely hate it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and pointless","review":"to say i was disappointed in Rob Zombie's followup to his 2007 Remake of Halloween would be an understatement.this thing is no nowhere near as good as that film was.for one thing,its about as exciting as watching paint drying or grass growing.it also goes straight into bizzaro land on more than one occasion,which doesn't really belong in the movie.it doesn't really fit,in my opinion.Zombie really had something going with his first attempt at breathing some much needed life into the franchise and putting his own spin on things.maybe he should have have just left it at that.all i know is he took several steps back with this misfire.for me,Halloween II (2009)is a 2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brutal","review":"I had to turn it off 17 minutes in. It's just too brutal to watch. After the black woman in the hospital was stabbed repeatedly & Michael Myers left the knife buried in her head, I realized watching that scene actually depressed me. I think most people who feel human feelings would feel depressed after watching that. I've seen hundreds of horror movies, this is one of the only ones I had to turn off. I don't mean that as a compliment. I had to turn it off because I felt like less of a human being watching it. No movie is worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob, please stop directing movies.","review":"This movie was nothing but trash. One reviewer said to mention this to your enemies. I wouldn't even do that!! That would be inhumane. Not only did this completely trash every character ( loomis is now a money grabbing opportunist. Really?! ) Not to mention when it comes to blood and gore, those things alone does not a good horror film make. THe amount of gore, violence, profanity is ridiculous. This really should have been rated X and not R. The good side? At least in this one zombie doesn't promote teenage sex like he did in the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure failure!!!!!!","review":"Rob Zombie should have never tried to remake a classic film with such classic characters and actors...even with that said he worries to much about the slasher aspect of things versus the storyline which is why the remakes of this film and the first one so horrible. Rob Zombie needs to stick with coming up with his own ideas adn stay away from classic films espeically. This film is a waste of anyhones time and money. If you want to watch a good movie watch the originals, even though they are older they are still far better than this crap being shoved off on to the new generation as horror remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it a half star?","review":"I am huge fan of Rob Zombie. Music is great, Halloween was good, Devils Rejects/1000 Corpses good. Halloween 2....total crap. My wife is even more into horror than me and she walked off half way through.

I'm sooo disappointed it is hard to articulate. Total crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST REMAKE SEQUEL EVER!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the stupidest and worst movie ever made. The use of blood and gore is so disgusting and overkill. The actors/characters are horrible idiots. Don't waste your time or money on this POS. Zombie is a moron not a film maker. It's amazing why people would put up money to make such a POS. John Carpenter should sue as*wipe Zombie for taking his movie and ruining it with this waste of film...I'm just happy I didn't pay to watch this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have and should have been better","review":"After watching the remake, I was looking forward to the sequel. It has elements from the original sequel, but goes off in various directions. I was not thrilled with the casting of young Michael in the first film and even less with the updated version. The depth taken to reveal more of young Michael was unnecessary and distracting. As were the spirit sequences with Michael's mother; which to me seemed forced to give Mrs. Zombie more screen time. In addition, the older Michael just didn't seem like Michael. It's definitely more gory and dirty than the first; overall long and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"This movie COMPLETLY slaps the original Halloween II right across the face.I don't have ONE good thing to say about this god-awful disaster.It's trash all the way through.Now,I have to admit.I did however liked the 2007 Rob Zombie remake version of Halloween.I thought it was a decent effort from him.It wasn't as good as the original 1978 horror classic of course,but it was still pretty good...but this movie.Oh my God! Did I mention how terrible this was??? The story is just way out there and does not make ANY sense at all! The acting is absolutley horrid.And what the hell is \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic doing in a Halloween film anyway? Let alone a horror movie.Overall,this movie is a huge waste of time and you would get more entertainment by just putting this dvd around your finger,twirling it and watching it spin around.DO NOT waste ONE single cent on this piece of crap.Buy the ORIGINAL Halloween from 1978 and the ORIGINAL Halloween II from 1981."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to making fine music!","review":"Great to see Margot Kidder working but I really wanted to see her pull out a knife and stab Laurie over and over and over and then cut off that nasty nasty hair in the video at the top of the page.

Awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Horror Remake Ever","review":"What the hell were they thinking. This sequel remake was the worst I have seen thus far. I have no problems with blood and gore, but the changes made to the characters was ridiculous. In the original Halloween 2 we rooted for Laurie, but in this remake I just wanted her character dead. She deserved all she got.Just another example of a remake that destroys what we loved about the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob Zombie should stick to music videos.","review":"The title of my review says it all. Zombie is a music video director, and his jumbled, and downright unlikeable movies, with their overkill cursing and almost comical vulgarity for vulgarity's sake, fall flat on their faces time and time again. I love horror movies, Rob and I probably love many of the same movies. But, the injustice that he has done to a classic, TWICE, is no homage. He needs to learn from the past instead of trying to mash up genres and loosely hold them together with trash film-making. How these movies end up in theaters round the country is beyond me...Wait, no, it's solely on the name Rob Zombie that he is given so much freedom. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Bad","review":"First let me start off by saying that up until this point I pretty much loved everything that Rob Zombie did. The first Halloween was a great movie and a refreshing take on a franchise that had seemed to run its course. This movie is just plain horrible, and not in a good way. Why is it that he has to throw his wife into everything he does now. Her part in the movie made no sense and seemed like it was written in so that she could be in this movie. Michael Meyers as a hobo? Come on this is a real stretch. After watching this movie I was actually upset that I had wasted all that time to watch it. I think I'll just stick with House of 1000 Corpses and use this DVD as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallotrash II","review":"Dear Rob Zombie,A horror movie doesn't have to be over-the-top, overdone, and in your face plus filled with profanity to be effective.

This movie compared to that, makes this movie look.........well....not well written or directed. i love Malcolm McDowell, but his role in this movie was not good. Really dissapointing.

The plot is soooo far removed from the original {& far superior} Halloween II, that it should of died a quick death right from its conception. True, you shouldn't make a remake EXACTLY like the original, but that doesn't mean you should stray TOO FAR from the original. Actor Malcolm Mc Dowell's awful portrayal of Dr. Loomis is appalling. He makes Actor Donald Pleasance's BRILLIANT portrayal of the good Doctor cringe in embarrassment. Same with Actress Scout Taylor Compton, who portrayed Laurie Strode. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis should be shaking her head at disappointment at her psycho performance. Along with the also GOD AWFUL Jason X, this movie ranks a great horror stinker, that makes the original cry in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as you have heard, and then some","review":"I am a huge Halloween fan and I wanted so much to like this movie.

Anyhow, HORRIBLE as you actually WANT Laurie to get killed! She was as unlikeable as the White trash scattered throughout the film. The language was appalling. This was Haddonfield, not Rob's home which he obviously after viewing his other so called films grew up around. There was NO need for that profanity from the lead character.

The first thing you'd do is stretch the picture so the character's faces were distorted and elongated. That is what this remastering sounds like. The sound is stretched and distorted away from the original mixes. It's like the audio version of watching a 4:3 show on an HDTV...

There's something extraordinary - almost Shakespearean - in Delany's ability to capture fundamentals of how we function and think as humans.

Yes, the plot of Nova has strong echoes that resonate in a line straight from its 1968 creation right down to Iraq today.

I found this book to be very thought-provoking, fair, and unbiased in presenting the reader with a story that could happen in any city (and probably does happen to some extent more often than we wish to think).

If you want to read about Abe Glitzky and the lady Senator (an old flame) then get this book. If not, get his 'Nothing but the Truth'.

Quality is top notch and it looks good too. The sub sounds awesome with deep, tight and powerful bass but the sats are a little bit disappointing.

The images echo the sleek modernist space station in \\"2001\\", but with an exacting, crisp interlocking of elements. which brings me to the drawback--the photos are too small by far, and often spread over the center crease--and this is not a book that folds flat open easily. i'm sure there are other books with these pictures, but i don't know what they are. if you research it, bear in mind that this book does contain a preface and article that are quite illuminating, and the compact nature of the book does make it kind of darling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job but designed with planned obsolescence","review":"I have used the 40 watt Pondmaster units for several years. Generally they do an excellent job of clarifying the water. Three units keep my 6000 gallon pond very clear.

After using the unit for a few years, the gasket becomes distorted, lets water into the electical fixture, allowing the ballast to burn out. A replacement ballast costs over $100 and is difficult to find. I have a collection of four or five burned out ballasts that can't be repaired. Since bulbs last about two seasons, it generally costs about the same amount to buy a new unit as it does to replace all of the parts (ballast, quartz sleeve, and bulb).

However, there are lots of little things that have decreased the enjoyability of my experience, this game definitely lacks polish.The most critical thing for me here is the lack of stability. During the beginning of the game, it is very stable and fully playable; but the further I progressed, the more and more it crashed on me. It is very frustrating to lose the results of a 20 minute battle (assuming that you save between every battle) simply because the code just isn't robust.There are plenty of other pet peeves that I have with the game, but they are relatively small, and numerous.

I played it as soon as i got home, expecting a fighting game where you could actually control how the character fights and moves. but instead it's a game where the characters move in an almost chess-like manner. and the dialogue is very very slow. luckily, i also bought LOTR The third age, where you can at least go through the game without menu-surfing 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever played","review":"Where do I even begin to explain how terrible this game is. First I'll start with the dialogue. I don't think they could have put less effort into it. What makes it worse is that they talk about 85% of the game just jabbering away in a monotone voices. I thought that I was gonna be running around killing guys in a wrestling game kind of way but with swords. Boy was I surprised, you make moves as if you are playing chess or something. You're character is stronger than everyone else so you just exchange blows with your enemy until he is dead and the only thing that plays as a variable is boxes, whoever is higher hits harder. I tried to get a little into the game before I made a judgement on it, but that didn't change my mind at all. If I haven't changed your mind yet, rent it from blockbuster they have it there. I do not doubt that you will be greatly disapointed with this terrible video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Equal","review":"This movie is what the Matrix could have been if it actually had a quality lead actor and a story. The action scenes sting you with ferocity and originality, and you can't take your eyes off Christian Bale.

This movie more than made up for that. This is the best science fiction action movie I've seen in a LONG time. It's incredibly intelligent. Every time I thought I knew what was about to happen there was a twist. This movie is totally unpredictable unlike \\"The Matrix.\\" This movie is better than \\"The Matrix\\" in every way possible. The fight scenes in this are so brilliantly done. I've never seen gun battles like this. It reminded me of some classic Japanese Animes I've seen. But \\"Equilibrium stands completely on it's own. It's completely original and I want to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved The Matrix, you'll love this movie, too!","review":"I don't know how this movie went below my radar all these years, but I just finally heard about this movie for the first time, the other day, when looking at a filmography of Christian Bale. What an excellent movie! I compare this movie toThe Matrix, as both of the movies feature lots of guns, martial arts, swordplay, and secrets. Both are loaded with action, have unexpected betrayals, depict life in the future, and mankind as a shadow of its former self.In some ways I prefer this movie over The Matrix, and in some ways I prefer The Matrix over this movie. Both of them are excellent action movies, and both were produced at about the same point in time. If, like me, you missed out on this, make sure to look for it the next time you're in the mood for some great sci-fi action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equilibrium","review":"Excellent movie with lots of high packed action and creative fighting scenes. This is one of those movies that didn't make it to the big screen but should have. There's a few comedy skits depending on your sense of humor. Christian Bale is very handsome. I thought Taye Diggs role was smug, but his overall performance was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold-Blooded Action","review":"This movie is very... very cold. But that's a good thing. Christian Bale gives an amazing performance. Other reviews slam this movie. It does not really have references to the Matrix. The only true similarity is the clothing that Christian Bale and the other \\"clerics\\" wear in the film. This is also the movie with the highest number of kills by a main character. By some accounts its 114, by others its 96... its still the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Surprise","review":"Equilibrium is an utter surprise. The action scenes are breathtaking and genuinely original. The practice of Gun Kata, although patently rediculous in real life, was fascinating and fun to watch.The Orwellian plot was interesting and kept the film tight.

Almost everything about the production was quite good. But as so often happens with productions like this, it lacks philosophical depth. The conflict between parties is made too black and white. It would have been a much more interesting story if we knew the suffering that drove humanity to that condition, if there was some room for doubt that the protagonist was doing the right thing. A excellent movie leaves you with something to think about. This one does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-See\\" for Action and/or Sci-Fi fans","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

I regret wasting the time watching it. I hoped, vainly, that it would get better but it did not. Matix made you think about our world and our reality.

While the idea of [chemical substance]-induced \\"numbness\\" is an interesting one to explore, it rubbed off on the performances and photography too much. The script is dull and pretentious, and develops as intelligently as Mortal Kombat. \\"Let's get this character from point A to B and then have him fight and move on.\\" This film is dumb, boring, uninspired, pretentious, slow, illogical, too \\"serious\\" and an otherwise complete waste of time.

Unfortunately I can't give it anything lower than 1 star. The action sequences are not very good at all in comparison to the Matrix. So even these, as a potentially redeeming factor, in the end leave the viewer unsatisfied. I don't know why there are so many reviews here giving this movie 5 stars.

If that wasn't bad enough, Bale can't act and the gun scenes are truly absurd. I don't know how people could have found the action scenes impressive--blips of gunfire around a completely black scene (you see, close study of geometry tells the protagonist how to shoot people in the dark!?!)Perhaps teen boys might like it--it has some positive reviews here, but honestly I found it the dumbest movie I've seen since I rented Battlefield Earth.

This after all is an average/ok film. Its not better than the Matrix, its not even in the same league. It is however ridiculously derivative of the Matrix, lets face it, it would not exist if the Matrix had not been made.Yeah its ok - Bale is good but then he's a good actor. The fight scenes are sometimes a bit silly, but sometimes entertaining. Its a low budget Matrix wannabe. If you view it like that then you may enjoy it.Its like every Steven Seagal or Van Damme film, rips off a genre and never quite makes it out of the B-List, straight to DVD category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative, rehashing of existing stories","review":"If you have read the classics and/or even watched the movies you won't find anything new in Equilibrium.

Christian Bale is the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few under-rated movies, or major movies compare","review":"When I first heard of this movie I thought it sounded cool, nothing special. I rented the movie and then immediately had to buy it. Stand out performances by Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, not to mention stand out fight sequences and a plot that ANYONE could go along with. It really is a movie that has to deal with the base nature of human beaings: our emotions. The story is captivating and the emotional content is almost over-whelming. I highly recomend just buying this movie because it has a lot of value when it comes to watching over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equilibrium","review":"This movie was so sweet. The fight scenes will blow your mind. Even though I hate how action movies always compare themselves to the matrix this one was better than the matrix"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"It is easy to see that this movie is low budget and that many of the ideas were borrowed. However, the message put forth and the quality of action are astounding. Personally I think the action sequences are a step up from the Matrix Reloaded because I'm not one for CGI. This is the real deal. The gun kata is an amazing concept. For anyone who has taken martial arts, they know a kata is an organized series of forms that could be used in a multiple attacker situation. The fact that guns are used in this type of form and you still remaining in a stationary position, you just have to see it. Then with the story, well, its a bit slow. The message is there though right in your face. This is definately a movie that will make you think and due to the low budget, a cult classic for this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best action movie since The Matrix","review":"Forget what the people who gave this movie bad reviews said. This is movie was a limited release in theatres, ... Dont get me wrong, The Matrix is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but this surpasses the Matrix in its style. It has a good plot, that will keep you entertained in the non-fighting scenes, and the fighting scenes get better througout the movie. By the end of this movie you will be blown away, at how amzingly well made, and how satisfiing it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dystopian societies are cool . . .","review":"I saw this movie at the end of a Utopian Philosophy class. For those of you familiar with these books you will probably appreciate the message of the film more than others. It was fascinating to see elements of 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 blended in a Matrix-type action film. Christian Bale and Emily Watson do a terrific acting job, although Taye Diggs could have used a bit of help on the whole \\"emotion\\" thing I'm sorry to say. Admittedly, some elements within the movie were technically incongruous. For example, if there is no emotion in Libria, why is Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) ALWAYS smiling? For those who don't care about the whole philosophy bit, the action scenes are worth the money. Wait for \\"it\\" at the end . . . you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't just look at the surface.","review":"I went to the official site for this movie and was STOKED to see it in theatres. Funny though, how it never actually made it there. It seems that too many people compared it to the Matrix for the studio to see it as a profitable vehicle. If you accept that the Brothers Waichowski and Kurt Wimmer drew from the same influences in realizing their seperate visions it's EASY to see that the films are otherwise nothing alike.The people who say it is are the same tunnel visioned close minded lemmings who say all rap music sounds the same and once you heard one country song you've heard them all.This is a great, action packed movie. It may be thin on story, but the story IS present. What it happens to lack in story it makes up for that in punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"no surprises","review":"there was a reason this film never made it to the theatres. now, i know why.it's not a terrible film, but it just doesn't work. the action scenes aren't particularly believable, even with suspension of disbelief, they just don't ring true ... and that false note carries on through the rest of the movie, as well. everything seems forced. the plot just doesn't have a good flow. it's like a building constructed by a little kid with high-tech building blocks; nice material, but it doesn't hold together well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice the second time...","review":"I have seen this movie for the second time and, I can say...I have changed my mind about it...I dont think it is as horrible as I described it the first time, but I still think it's pathetic to have the slogan :\\"FORGET THE MATRIX!\\" In it's cover!The story is quiet good, and the acting OK, but it took me 2 times to realize this...I recommend you this movie, but if you have not seen The Matrix trilogy, buy the 3 (The Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions) now!!!Dont you ever forget The Matrix!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Equilibrium of the Bowels","review":"This book makes my bowels settle every time I read it, and it's not even a book!

Christian Bale gives one of his signature performances as a Bell's Palsy sufferer. Sean Bean glowers. Still, the movie is well-enough crafted to prevent outright laughter at the concept of \\"gun kata\\" - a futuristic \\"martial art\\" wherein a highly trained lone ninja/priest standing in the center of a circle of gunmen spewing bullets can simultaneously avoid the intense crossfire while dispatching all of the surrounding adversaries - obviously a concept created by someone whose lost touch with reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equilibrium","review":"This was an excellent movie. It deserves 5 stars for sure. The action was excellent, the movie was creative and the story was excellent. This by-far was better than the matrix. The main character could ACT, and the action segments were excellent for any film. The concept was pretty original, and the acting was excellent. Unlike the Matrix, this was a trully good movie, and not just perceived as good because of hype. And this clearly couldn't have been a Matrix rip-off because it was in production the same time as the Matrix. I gave this movie 5 stars because it is just so much better and more creative then the Matrix and any other action/sci-fi movie i've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equilibrium is a must see","review":"Equilibrium is basically a modern mix pulling from the motif of Fahrenheit 451 and the action of The Matrix. I enjoyed this film because it hits on the philosophical argument of what causes man to commit acts of violence against fellow man. Equilibrium is basically a satyr of where humanity would have to go in order for man to stop this primal urge that spawns violence, and how we would have to live in a society that strips away our humanity. Emotion would become a crime because it is the primary factor that leads to violent crime. The protagonist battles with himself through out the movie to determine if the price of emotion and feelings out way the consequences that he realizes they can lead to. I also enjoy the fact that the action is good but is there to support the plot development, rather then the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics Should be ashamed","review":"I viewed this with my partner as a mistake, and was utterly surprised by the fusion of the Metropolis Genre and Orwellian despair.This alone was worth the view.Naturally I was stunned by well done \\"Gun Kata\\" and actions scenes. Critics panned it, well I'll pan the critics then. Their ignorance clearly a result of over stimulation and a bubble gum culture dummed down for the masses.The matrix, among a few has done well to dull the minds of the critics (which they incidently panned in the UK as well) but this alone proves the critics missed the point of the movie altogether.The superb action scenes were incidental to an excellent plot and a harsh social statement of the human condition. I find it ironic that the point of determining what matters in life was ignored by the critics in what mattered in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected, well worth the rental fee","review":"Pay no attention to the opinions of semi-literates, or their landlords. This is quite a decent film - hardly groundbreaking stuff, but not just the takeoff of The Matrix/Bladerunner that you might expect. The camerawork was excellent, interesting use of light and shadow to illustrate the bleak setting. The acting was decent, the plot not completely predictable. Most amazingly of all, the fight scenes actually included (what I thought were) some unique elements, quite an achievement when so much has been done already by the Matrix etc. The irony of characters, supposedly incapable of emotion, shouting at each other and banging furniture with rage etc was obviously lost on the director, but this is my only gripe. Worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"The fight scenes and its possible physics was clearly explained and justifed earlier in the movie.

With every movie that I have watched so far on Amazon's streaming service there has been the same problem; lousy sound. I mean , I have to turn up the volume so much just to hear the voices that the feedback through the speakers produces background noise that makes what the actors are saying almost incomprehensible. This is not the film's fault, but that of the provider of the streaming (Amazon). I do not have this problem with videos and movies downloaded from Itunes.

The plot scheme and motifs in Equilibrium are almost identical to those found in George Orwell's classic. However, in an attempt to make the story more contemporary, this work resorted to excess gun violence and underground dealings as cheap thrills for a certain age demographic. Probably the most painful ting to watch is the acting; the dramatic stances and mundane voices just scream \\"Matrix\\" and come off as a very poor performance. The overall aspect of the film was enjoyable to watch if you don't exactly want to witness something more creative and just want the \\"SparkNotes\\" version of 1984.In short, you will enjoy this film if you liked the book 1984 and don't want to watch something that builds upon it. But if you are a diehard Orwell and 1984 fan, this is the film to pass up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog was cute.","review":"Equilibrium starring Christian Bale is kinda like The Matrix but the message of the film falls flat.

Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it. \\"Equilibrium\\" is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters in this movie. \\"Equilibrium\\" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well. It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Blu-ray!","review":"Another Echo Bridge Blu-ray, another crappy 1080p transfer.

For me, besides the truly awesome action scenes, the gradual psychological development of the main character (Christian Bale) was very well played out and believable.The director, in my opinion, did a marvelous job to allow this movie to transcend well above a mere 'kick-butt' tale.

Christian Bale is one of our top young actors. Just watch his performances in The Machinist, American Psycho, Batman Begins and one of the best child performances of all time in Empire of the Sun. Everything in this film fits perfectly. The futuristic style, brooding score and unique action scenes are fresh in a genre full of sameness. Equilibrium may bare resemblance to Gattaca and 1984, but it's like those films on steroids. And by the way, Gun Kata is about the coolest style of fighting ever created for a film. I really hope they make Equilibrium 2, but after seeing Ultraviolet (by the same director) I think a sequel will only diminish this already cult classic. They don't need to go The Matrix route."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECIEVED PRODUCT!!!!","review":"I sent an email asking about my product because it had not arrived yet, never recieved a response.

Do not waste your money or time with it. If I could give it a negative star rating, I would.The premise of the film isn't original at all. I watched, waiting for a final twist, but it ended in the usual way. To compare this to the Matrix is an insult. It also trys to compare itself to Minority report. This does not ring true either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Names - Bad Plot","review":"There are an awful lot of well-known actors in this movie: Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen, William Fichtner..... *Sigh* What a Waste.The plot (such as it is) is that Bale, Bean, and Diggs are something-or-other \`Clerics' in a futuristic world; their job is to slaughter anyone with feelings. Preposterous, especially since the movie is filled with them constantly saying things like \\"I think\\", \\"I want\\", etc - ALL EMOTIONS! Duh!Full of self-congratulatory flashy camera shots that are obviously trying to imitate The Matrix (Too bad Bale didn't play Neo, he can actually act AND he looks better in the black soutane) Would probably be bearable as a comic book - But as it is - I commend your strong stomach if you can sit through to the ridiculous end."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-Movie plot that tries too hard, wrapped around nice visuals.","review":"This is a B-Movie plot that doesnt know its a B-Movie plot. It tries too hard to be relevant and serious, when its all a bit silly. You cant help but be knocked over the head by the intellectual points the film tries to make. So in the end all the plot and seriousness does is take you out of the film and make the whole thing seem a bit silly.The visuals are great, and action is great. If a bit too derivative of the Matrix.Really what is action though if you cant get into the movie? Its all a bit empty.And at final blush this movie doesnt capture you, so its all a bit of a wasted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER","review":"This is the best action movie i have ever seen, sure there are some visible flaw but who cares. the story, the action and everything else makes up for it.BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gun Fighting done right","review":"Forget The Matrix, the action scenes in this movie (done with no wires, bullet time or slow motion) absolutely blows everything else away.This movie demonstrates how to blend martial arts and gun fighting perfectly.The story is good, but its the fight scenes (which unfortunately only take up maybe 15 mins of the whole movie) that makes it so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done, albeit derivative","review":"\\"Equilibrium\\" borrows heavily from the ideas and styles of other \\"dark future\\" science fiction movies, including Brazil, 1984 and The Matrix and its symbolism is often heavy-handed.

The evolution of the story supports our disbelief and as we near the movie's climax we are RE-lieved to see where we are heading. Then the stunts and graphics folks re-visit Matrix to get us to the final scene.

No deleted scenes or behind the scenes except for a ridiculously short promo piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sitting on a Sleeper","review":"This movie was incredible. I was heartbroken to find that I was only able to see it the one time. I consider myself lucky to have had a chance to see it however.

I bought this as a present for someone who requested it. This movie was one demensional. The bad guys were all stupid, the plot and storyline were poor at best. I like Christian Bale, but can't understand why he would agree to make this movie at this time in his career. I would compare this movie to a \\"B\\" movie or a made for video movie.

If you haven't, go to a library and check them out now you hooligan. The movie has some dull parts yes, but these are not only outshined, but blown out of the stratosphere by action scenes. The action sequences in this movie really wore out my rewind button on my DVD remote, because I had to know HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT? Absolutely incredible, sets a new standard for action.Fun movie, most definetly. Not for the squemish in some parts. (hey did he just break someones leg and snap their arm in half? Why, yes he did!). But definetly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie, so no sequels, please.","review":"I think most everyone who saw Equilibrium would agree it was the most pleasant surprise of 2002. It's first-rate entertainment that pretty much had it all: a solid story, a stellar cast, visually appealing sets, and the most wildly thrilling action sequences of its kind since The Matrix.Thus, it is inevitable, especially considering the movie was financed by Dimension Films, the purveyor of realising schlock straight-to-video releases, that a direct-to-video sequel will be proposed to cash in on this movie's burgeoning fan base. As a huge fan of Equilibrium, I cannot emphasize what a terrible idea that would be. This is a movie that clearly concluded its story and left just enough for viewers to chew on their own time. Don't disgrace this film with unnecessary sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix-like with a shot of andrelanine.","review":"I knew nothing about this film. I went based on ratings I saw online, since I trust regular smoe's I went. Me, along with my 2 friends were blown away. I saw it yesterday and I am still shaking me head in amazement. At first I thought it was going to be another 1984, thought provoking, weird film, then the film went from 1st to 5th gear, skipping the others inbetween. Camera angles and uses were extremely well done and I suggest you RUN don't walk, but RUN to go see this movie. Pass the world around, it did not get much adverstisement. This is the film that hollywood should make. It takes the Matrix type ideas and gives it an andrelanine shot. BRAVO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the negative hype.","review":"The action in this futuristic parable on censorship (of mind, body, and perhaps soul) is by far the best I've seen in a long time. The idea of gun katas is genius and inspired and Christian Bale was obviously tapped to be the next batman after someone saw this film. Sure the future world isn't perfect, as several critics pointed out, but then again it is a parable NOT a REAL view of the future. So if you go in looking for a good action/drama/parable then you will definitely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix meets 1984","review":"In a world where feelings have been outlawed, the underground recruits the ultimate insider to bring back our humanity.No one can miss the intense action, or the kickin moves that our beloved new Batman shows off for the audience.

You hear it a lot, but this is a true 'must see'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"One of Christian Bale's best movies by far.

I was entertained for the entire movie. I even liked Bale in this more than in the final Batman movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my 5 favorite movies of all time","review":"It's an absolute tragedy to me that this movie is not more popular. With a plot based of some of the best pieces of classic literature (1984, Farenheit 451, Brave New World), how could it not be amazing. People said it was a Matrix ripoff to me, but then I actually saw it and realized it was so much better than the Matrix (which I love). The script is pretty much perfect. The special effects aren't perfect, but they still look really nice. The gunfight at the end in particular is amazing. Christian Bale's acting by the way is a pretty subtle example of greatness. Overall, this to me is just one of the most underappreciated movies of all time, and I think it's a real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie in the Matrix style.","review":"I like Christian Bale's work (American Psycho, Batman Returns) but hadn't seen this movie until a friend recommended it. WOW, you completely understand his awakening after going off \\"the dose.\\" Fight scenes remind of \\"The Matrix\\" but with their own twist. You must add this movie to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they dont make movies this good anymore...or so I thought","review":"I shant talk about the plot or what goes on in this movie, however, I will say that apart from the lord of the rings trilogy, this is the most satisfying film I have seem in the longest time, strong storyline, perfect action and beautiull acting.I can safelly say that people who dont enjoy this film should seriously re-evaluate why they like films in the first place. I cant wait for this dvd, since my first reaction after seeing this film was the urge to walk right back to the theater and watch it again. A definite must for anyone who enjoys a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden treasue","review":"Take a great story like 1984 and give it a small action twist without making it corny, and you'll have Equilibrium. The acting was good, the fight scenes were well coreographed and worked with the story, and the plot was intellegent. As far as its comparison with the Matrix goes although the feel of the movies are similar the stories are different, and don't be fooled into thinking this is just a martial arts flick. The martial arts while fun to watch are really a side note in this movie. I highly recommend checking it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did anyone else notice the huge plot hole?!","review":"With everyone debating whether its a copy or good action film I'm really suprised nobody pointed out that they accidently put two scenes in the wrong order! I won't mention what they are, 'cause it destroys the purpose of the film.The scene order aside, it is an excellent film. Made even more so by the quality produced on such a low budget. I highly recomend the viewing of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY CRAP","review":"ok, this movie is just EXTREMELY cool. If the new matrix wants it's title back for coolest fights ever, heck lets be honest, it won't. This movie is simply the coolest thing I have seen in years. It sends you on an adrenline rush from the first fire fight, and you still feel it in your veins 30 minutes later when your still shivering and trying to comprehend how damn cool this movie was. We even saw it for a second time DIRECTLY after seeing it....then we ran out of free cash. And we are currently gathering an army and forcing them to watch it. I will hunt this down on dvd until..well...i find it....or steal the reel for it...yes...truly amazing. BTW, i loved it's fighting style. Completely original.

Maybe they should go into the fast food buisness, or perhaps moving, auto transport or relocating business because they are clearly not intelligent enough to deal with movie releases on Blu Ray.Original soundtrack mix was DD 5.1, Orginial aspect ratio was 2.35: 1This was released with GARBAGE audio and video quality, with only a 2.0 soundtrack as well.The Japanese import version has excellent DD True HD 5.1 and OAR 2:3, so that is the version we have to get until somebody releases a proper U.S.A version.ECHO BRIDGE, Do your employees wear ankle 'bracelets as well?

There is another one on amazon that has the 5.1 Dolby Digital and true 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It still isn't the best (the japan release has the best audio mixes.) But it is better than this one.Equilibrium [Blu-ray] That's the one I got. It is the Canadian release done by Alliance(has double sided box art one in english one in french) and is actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost-cutting equals garbage","review":"Don't buy this version of Equilibrium. It is garbage. The sound and aspect ratio is horrible and it doesn't come close to the Canadian version. i bought the Canadian release at a Wal-Mart in Ontario and it is superb! It is available here: [...]Spend the extra few dollars. It is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try you'll be surprised","review":"Within the first ten minutes of Equilibrium I was unsure if I would like it. I found myself giggling at the Matrix style fight scene in the opening act. Wondering if it was trying to be \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Farenheit 451\\" or \\"1984\\". And in truth it is a bit of all of these things. Pieced together amazingly well. So my giggling ceased and became slack jawed awe as the film progressed.This movie has alot to offer. Thrilling actions scenes that have you rewinding them to watch them again.The action in this film can be described as a beautiful violent ballet. I also found the story line to be quite engrossing, the plot twists truthfully kept me guessing. And the cineamatography is beautiful as well.I almost didn't see this movie because of the fact that I had heard it was a Matrix [copy], I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics, because I would have missed out on a fantastic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra Cool Gun Battles!","review":"This movie features not only the most impressive gunfight sequences in recent movie history but also some very stylish swordfighting scenes. An outstanding performance by Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire) made it all the more enjoyable. His convincing portrayal of the highest ranking Grammaton Cleric, an unfeeling, unemotional, near superhuman killing machine, draws you into the post-apocalyptic, prozac nation of Libria very quickly.Initially, the set designs took me aback; it wasn't as polished as the costume designs but that's quite understandable given the movie's budget. It's definitely no Minority Report nor The Matrix in terms of production quality but it succeeds in bringing its own memorable flavor. Despite the premise and some pretty weak moments along the way, I found myself being entertained by this little gem of a sci-fi action flick. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mindless Matrix","review":"Equilibrium strives to be a hybrid of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and The Matrix. Unfortunately, it lacks the powerful social commentary of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 and fails to achieve the technical mastery and philosophical underpinnings of The Matrix. In reality, director Kurt Wimmer has merely remade Logan's Run with the stylistic sensibilty of The Matrix. He should have called the movie Neo's Run.Sure, the gun fights are cool, Christian Bale is effective as a poor man's Neo and I actually enjoyed this movie. However, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that this movie even approaches the literary or cinematic greatness of the aforementioned titles. The sets are cheap, the CGI is poor, the costumes are cheesey and Taye Diggs is absolutely abysmal.In short, Equilibrium draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of superior sources and ends up being nothing more than a bit of mindless fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"In any good action movie, it is ok to create an alternative reality. However it is, at least somewhat, important that the movie tries to exist within the reality they choose to create.When the movie goes way off track already within the first three minutes, and the rest of the movie really doesn't unveil any new aspects to the action genre, nor does it even give any twist to the established action genre, I get really bored. The movie is filled with faults in the logic of its own plot, acting really sucks and the movie fail to present any ideas of its own.If at least the action scenes where any good, or at least somewhat entertaining, I would be willing to forgive some of the massive faults in this movie. But no, effects and fight scenes are uninteresting and boring.There are really not many reasons to see this film, and I would say this is 103 minutes of my life I never will get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"infuriatingly moronic","review":"The thing I couldn't get past with this movie was the premise. It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the \\"books are banned\\" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Only there, the premise worked. Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.I couldn't buy this for a second. According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets. In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban. Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie: antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taye Diggs?","review":"Thought the synopsis sounded good and saw how many good reviews this film got so I thought it would be worthy of my time. Wrong. This film is awful. The action is bad, the drama is bad and the acting is bad. The story itself isnt half bad but the director blew it. I watched this movie with three friends, two of whom had to go to bed before its conclusion. How this got compared to the matrix ill never know. To me it looked to be just another rushed attempt to make a film. Taye Diggs really shined in this one though hehe."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE UP!","review":"How about this: this film is based on the premise that the totalitarian society that Bale must reject and destroy is one which is totally devoid of emotions and will stop at nothing to keep things that way. If this is true - then what is the motivation to keep order? Without emotions we have no desires - so why would anyone in this world want to do anything? Why do all the bad guys in this film smirk and laugh? I thought they didn't feel anything. Why is everyone so suspicious of each other being sense offenders? What do they care? How does any character in this film have any motivation to do anything - let alone perpetuate their society or destroy it. Oh yeah - the action sequences are laughable - and if you look close at the editing the idea of \`continuity' is something that is also suppressed int he future. If you want good action - get something by John Woo when he was making good films in Hong Kong.

To shoot the puppy or save the little fella cuz it wags its tail and licks your face? To turn on your neighbor cuz he's not like you or ask what drummer he follows?Me, I enjoyed the drama of the government control, its keep-the-status-quo army of trained killers, and the \\"what works best for the good of all\\" plotline in general. Plenty of action held my attention throughout.Highly recommended for sci-fi/action fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashes of brilliance","review":"Yes, Equilibrium is, overall, a terribly derivative movie (1984, Farenheit 451, etc.) but it contains some truly original concepts and moments.One of director Wimmer's real masterstrokes is the sequence in which the villain DuPont carefully explains the theory behind the Gun Kata - in terms just plausible enough to allow the audience to accept the stunning action choreography. It's a seductive idea, beautifully executed by stunt choreographer Jim Vickers in all the action sequences.Another particular highlight is the leadup to the final confrontation between Preston and his nemesis, played by Taye Diggs. Wimmer has carefully established their rivalry to the point where the audience is salivating to see them go head to head ... then he surprises us with a twist ... then stuns us with ANOTHER twist that is, in itself, one of the most original applications of fight choreography I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this film- i predict this will be a cult classic!","review":"This film is truly one of the best sci-fi genre movies around.

Hospital Tycoon is awful. The plot is unexciting, the number of patients that visit the hospital is next to nothing, and there is little room for freedom and adapting to different hospital-community demands.

Do not be misled by its praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less fun than Theme Hospital","review":"I played this game in storymode for a day or two. Here are my main points of criticism:* There is an aerial view, but you can't use it to place new rooms.* Staff is hard to direct; you can't just pick them up and place them where they're needed.* The music is unimaginative and the assistant's Sims-like jabbering very annoying.* You can't speed up a patient's progress through the hospital by moving them up in the queue.* The cutscenes are too long and have little to do with what you're trying to accomplish.* You have no influence on how funds are spent.All in all the game is rather unchallenging (at least in storymode). You don't really have to manage the hospital. Once you have built the required rooms and staffed it, it basically runs itself (although that might be different in other game modes).Although it is much older, Theme Hospital is much more fun to play. I wish they'd come out with an updated version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"I bought this game after weeks of wanting it so badly. I love tycoon games like this.

It would load up Storybox mode halfway and then completely close down and say there was an error with my memory. I even had to clear up some disk space to supposedly get this running but no such luck.

But, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it becomes played out as a modern version of the Great Gatsby where the shallow characters become people you could care less about, and the dialog between those characters becomes increasingly abysmal.

This book was like that to me. Another reviewer said the final 50 pages were dis-connected from the rest of the book and the direction the characters were headed wasn't where they seemed to be in the earlier section of the book. That is one of the things I loved about this book. It is about infidelity, it is about love, it is about your life and what you can really do with it once you are a parent.

Take the time to get through the first, slower chapters in which characters are drawn. Some of the early pages seem stilted as Mcinerney illuminates protagonists' flaws and pretentions. But the story gains momentum in the wake of 9/11 -- not that every character is genuinely moved or affected by the tragedy. The shake-up ends up exposing people for what they are, for better or worse, and catapulting relationships into new shapes. One sudden, secretive romance that develops between two of the more likable characters is vivid and intense, and lets us see the essence of humanity behind the money, the social events, the real estate, and the private schools that had dominated pre 9/11 lives in this story. Generally the writing is strong and transparent -- well worth reading, especially if you are interested in New York City lifestyles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Letdown","review":"The reader feels that the author intended this to be a screenplay for a made-for-tv movie.

I got this pan because I like crisp edged brownies and for that, it's great. But they need to close up that hole!I actually did find a couple of other uses for it: Frying apples (put a slice in each individual wedge), making meatloaf wedges, and heating up various flavors of hot dip on the stove! (And then it goes right to the table)As for the reviews which claim that it sticks: All cast iron, including pre-seasoned, will stick the first couple of times unless you spray it generously with cooking spray, or grease it with butter or crisco.

I love the fact that it makes serving size portions. I make the best cornbread and scones in this pan. It's important to put the pan in oven as it slowly heats up with your preheat time. And also ALL sections of pan should be covered with whatever oil you choose for coating pan. I use coconut oil and it gives a nice slight flavor to my recipes and nothing sticks. There is a super delicious blueberry streusel scone recipe in [...] if anyone is interested. Just adapt recipe for a sectioned pan. I find that most recipes are more than this pan can handle so 2 pans would work well as this one is small or just do a second batch, which is what I do. Just don't forget to re-season pan. It's also very important (I learned this one the hard way) to not fill sections too high. Leave 3/16\\" from top so nothing is spilling over. Other than that you can't go wrong.

It ticks me off when Sony adds unnecessary plastic when the drivers inside the headphones can probably be packed into some regular street-style headphones. Take a look inside the cushion and see how small the actual drivers are.Thanks Amazon for letting me return these.Update: I love the haters.

I won't be! I was not carried back into time like the Ramses series, where I felt I was actually there. This book did not give me that feeling.

Also, when I picked it up I was really hoping for some insight into the civilization of the ancient egyptian people - a topic which I find to be quite intresting. Instead, I got a children's story that, quite honestly, could have been set in any time and been in any place. In fact, I think that I could count the historical facts presented on one hand.

The music is equally as captivating. I didnt' like her previous two albums (perhaps they were too underground for my liking). But this album is different-more listenable. It really shows Liz Phair's growth as an artist and as a musician.I was orginally attracted to this album because I'm a huge R.E.M. fan and Buck, Mills and Berry play on the Phair track 'Fantasize'.

While the frankness did sort of surprise me, It was the interesting way she made the record which made it for me. It just sounded....I dont know, fresh? Ethereal? Groundbreaking? Whip Smart had similar elements but seemed to play up the raunchy-riotgirrl suburbanite thing. Now, Whitechocolatespaceegg brings her out of the indie spotlight and to the bigtime and it sounds great. At first listen, It didnt seem all that strong, but now the catchyness of the songs is really obvious. I hope she really makes the big time. You go, girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like Exile in Guyville, but a nice change!","review":"I was quite skeptical of this album after having worshiped Exile in Guyville.

While I believe she has \\"sold out\\" to her true fans in this regard, She has made some new ones with her improved singing abilities. Liz's voice is truly, marvelous in this album. She's has found new notes and a smoothness in her singing. I've listened to this album numerous times, and each time I grow fonder of it.

("},{"rating":"2","title":"A very very complete album","review":"Liz Phair really shines with this new album. Perhaps one of the reasons people have a hard time with it is because Liz has not just written a bunch of songs to randomly place together, but she has written a whole album of puzzle pieced songs that work well TOGETHER, and not as well apart from each other.

But the whole damn thing is a winner. Wanna hear the sound of an artist coming of age? Compare this one to her two previous efforts. Here, Liz Phair mixes the sublime and the crass, the funny and the sad on a richly sung/played/produced collection of inventive and catchy songs. If there was any justice, Grammy would've given Liz a nod, and Sheryl Crow's latest disc could only be sold with a copy of Whitechocolatespaceegg to accompany it.

Totally now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, Sheryl Crow's new album?","review":"Exile was a masterpiece of rock. Now I probably should allow liz to expand her horizons and attack new ground. But this is too slick, clean, to sherly crow. no edge. I can't blame her for being happier, but the music is way too poppy and easy. I got bored with this adult contemporary crap pretty quickly.

But her follow up 'Whip Smart' failed to convince me that she was going or growing anywhere. 'Whitechocolatespaceegg' reaffirmed my suspicions that Liz Phair is, at best, a mediocre pop artist. Whatever elements of her anger and angst that might be hinted at in her lyrics seem ersatz. She lacks the energy to be a rocker, the musicianship to be virtuoso, and the conviction to be an icon. There are probably a lot of might-have-been Liz Phairs writing advertising jingles out on Madison Avenue right now. And some of those jingles have got more soul than any cut on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"profoundly sophmoric","review":"Deeply meaningful Gen-X kitsch sung by a performer without a drop of talent in her body. The lyrics are so bad that laughter is the only defense, and Liz Phair's \\"singing\\" suggests that she may be suffering from a terminal combination of stomach ulcers and sinus infection.However, if you have seen her perform in person or on television you will know that listening to the CD is only the second worse torture this person could inflict on you.A fitting birthday present for someone you loathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm starting a collection","review":"I am convinced that with enough money and support from concerned citizens in America, we can pay Miss Phair to shut up and never record again.

I was eagerly awaiting this album and felt like I was really let down. Some of the tracks seem very forced in response to her critics and meteoric rise, some grate wheras previous albums didn't have that effect on me.

Full immersion recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as the first two, but very enjoyable","review":"Both Exile and Whip-Smart are better, and I would recommend those two first, but this is a solid effort filled with many great tunes. Perhaps the best thing about Phair is how each of her albums is different from the others.\\"Polyester Bride\\" is good, but I don't think it's as good as some of the others, like \\"Uncle Alvarez,\\" a wonderfully subtle dig on braggarts, \\"Johnny Feelgood,\\" a song that might be taken the wrong way, but I think is a celebration of gray areas of relationships that some people paint in black or white, \\"Big Tall Man\\" \\"Ride\\" and \\"What Makes You Happy\\" are also great. I also think her voice is great. It may not be classically beautiful but she can convey so much with it, and she knows how to write songs that make the most of her voice, which is not something easy to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are 3 great songs on this CD !!","review":"How anyone could possibly give this CD 1 star is beyond me. I did not enjoy either of Liz's previous two efforts at all, but this is way different. Polyester Bride is a song that sticks in your brain for days. Johnny Feelgood is great - the message is unpopular but true in some cases (she is abused by her boyfriend and \\"likes it\\"). Lastly White Chocolate Space egg - a strange, but captivating journey.The rest is basically mediocre fodder. However, those 3 songs are now my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"I bought this CD a couple months after hearing Liz Phair perform live at Lilith Fair. I had heard a few of her songs before, but I never really took notice of them until I saw her at Lilith. I wanted to hear more, so I bought whitechocolatespaceegg, which is now one of my all-time favorite albums. There isn't a dud on the entire CD. There's something for everyone here: slower songs (\\"Uncle Alvarez,\\" \\"Only Son,\\") and gritty rockers (\\"Johnny Feelgood,\\" \\"Ride\\"). The album starts off with the solid title track and closes with \\"Girls' Room,\\" an admittedly hilarious little song...listen for yourself! I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes variety. Or just anyone. It's terrific, and that's all I have to say. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wo ho ho imaginary accomplishments","review":"The great Liz Phair does with Whitechocolatespacegg a similar feat to what Bob Dylan did with Blood on the Tracks: write a cycle of songs that reflects upon being an adult in the world, with kids, etc.and the strangeness of all the sudden realizing that you're in the same age your parents were when you were little and they seemed so old. Dylan's record is really more of a \\"breakup\\" album and is much sadder, whereas Phair's is more bouncy and upbeat and wry, and not a \\"masterpiece\\" on the level of the Dylan record. But they're both \\"adult\\" records, and a clear break from their previous work. And both just get better and better with repeated listenings, revealing interesting lyric choices and chord changes. It actually takes a lot of balls to write about how having a kid can change your life and still make great music out of it. ANd that's exactly what Liz has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Empress Has No Clothes!","review":"Over the years I've developed a healthy distaste for rock criticism, mostly because of its' genuflection at the altar of junk like this.

But it is not too bad for a first effort Ms. DeYoung's efforts seem to shine in her loving descriptions of Chicago. She also writes exiting action scenes well. However, if you buy this book my suggestion is to skip the ackowledgement page and also the back cover and get right to the novel. She spends way too much time drawing on the fame of her rock star husband. If she writes another she should concentrate on herself as a writer and forget about the other stuff in her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not Big Mountain","review":"Having the reputation of being one of Southern California's Premiere Reggae Bands I was really disappointed with One Love. None of the tracks are Reggae they are just classic pop love songs made to a real mellow rythym and in some instances rather bland. This album was never released in the US and now I understand why. Having said that, if you are a true Big Mountain fan the album is a good collectable, packaged nicely and still has the crooning sounds of Quino the Bands founding member."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Stone is not Third Rock","review":"This scarce film was originally sold at Radio Shack. They used it to demonstrate their TV's because unlike the normal 18 frames per second, this was filmed at a higher speed (24 frames?). Consequently, when water splashes, you see every drop. Rich music and only a smattering of dialog, the story is of an exta-terrestial child who's planet is doomed so he's been sent to search for a new world. A white Schooner guided by a spirit helper shows him the great Northwest. Sometimes I'll watch the film with the volume off and substitute music of my own.

Interesting on a thematic level (as one reviewer was generous enough to put it), but otherwise this is strictly by-the-numbers. Absolutely NOTHING happens until the last 20 pages and even then the action is scant. Maybe this was hot stuff back in the day, but I found it one of the most overblown books I had ever read and not enjoyable at all.

I was expecting to hear nothing but Raekwon but all I got was an above average MC with an average sidekick on every track (Ghost Face) It was supposed to be Raekwon's \\"Built for Cuban Linx\\", not Ghost Face Killa featuring Raekwon. On almost every track they start talking about stupid things that make no sense. This album ruins classic hits like \\"incarcerated scarfaces\\" and \\"ice cream\\" there are some nice hits but mostly everything is wack. Raekwon needs to learn from GZA on how to make a \\"SOLO\\" album.

It plays almost like a movie, with tight, no-frills production, and slammin' turns by Ghostface Killah, and of course, the Chef's classic lyrics. The LP clearly delves into fantasies about drug deals with Italians and Colombians, as well as assassination plots, but never crosses the line into outright stupidity.Unfortunately, imitation ain't the best form of flattery. In the year it was released, EVERYBODY was trying to \\"shark-bite\\" the \\"Cuban Linx\\" motif, and the LP spawned tons of imitators, to the point that De La Soul blasted them in their own classic, \\"Stakes is High\\" (the track \\"Itsowezee\\").

RZA's production on this album is his finest yet. The album isn't like 36 Chambers. It is more surrealistic, more sadistic, and more edgy.

But heard en masse, that proto-rock n roll boogie woogie shtick can get mighty old mighty quick.

He stresses the importance of safety and creating goals, and doesn't believe in restraining devices.Lyons explains his training methods, from the use of the round pen as a teaching tool, through halter breaking and sacking out, and correcting problems such as unwilling trailer loading. He describes the process to introduce a horse to its first saddling and first ride, and gives exercises for in the arena and on the trail for all levels.I thoroughly enjoyed the Introduction by Rick Lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important piece of the John Lyons Picture","review":"John teaches concept as much as technique and that is important. John encourages you consider broad principals and define your goals. Having participated in several symposiums and a clinic, most of everything I do was influenced by John Lyons and this book was an important part of that. The foundation for training my own Andalusian Stallion is largely based on concepts from this book. I believe you also need two important videos by John: \\"Round Pen Reasoning\\" and \\"Leading and Loading\\". John never claims to be the only enlightened trainer, but in my view he is one of the best. You can dedicate a lifetime to learning about horses, and this book is a great starter.

Game squad members have asked numerous times why do I sound so good using our TeamSpeak program, loud and cristal clear without a hint of distortion or background noise. Highly recommend for anyone into voice chat, team gaming, etc.My only complaint is that it completely blocks out your normal speakers, you have to go into your sound control and switch to your main speakers when not using the headphones, a real pain in a** as I don't always want to use the headphones.I've also started experiencing intermitent sound cutout in the right speaker, have to wiggle the cord to get the sound back in that earpiece.

The boning and elastic work great at smoothing out that muffin top and spare tire, but your excess fat is squeezed up to the top of the garment--creating the effect of an extra pair of breasts below the natural ones, as well as giving you back cleavage.The same company makes a similar product that looks like a modern corset (Flexees Women's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper #6868). This control garment works much better, except it has a tendency to ride up or down. However, it extends to the underside of the bust, creating a much more pleasing silhouette. Unfortunately it is too short to be worn with low-rise pants, but may be more suited toward wear with a dress or higher pants. When sitting down, however, the boning bends out unattractively.If you have a short torso, the product on this page just may work for you. Maybe.

I'm an out-of-shape/flabby size 12 and bought size large; didn't think the XL would be 'controlling' (tight) enough. Purchased 2 and they both went back. If you have this problem, try Flexees #3918.

The author attempts to avoid most of the major battles that have so often been the background for other fictional British naval heroes, and instead place Lewery in little known clashes. This is to be commended. However, H.M.S. Cockerel suffers from a lack of action and in fact, struck me as rather boring.

The movie ends with the tragedy of his death while test flying new fighter jets.The McConnell story showcases a period of time in America when the Cold War first turned bloody. It also shows the determination and courage of the American fighter pilots during the Korean War.The flying scenes are exceptionally good, and very authentic in the aircraft, the lingo and the procedures.

It's a fairly simple game, and the weapons are effective/not too effective so that you can have little bouts of panic that make the game fun.This is definitely not a kids' game, and I would be a little hesitant to let someone younger (below 14) play it due to the graphic-ness of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Px opening not 8\\" x 10\\"","review":"The photo display room divider seemed fine when I opened the box but when I went to put an 8'x10' photo in the frame I found the opening to be 10 1/4\\" x 7 3/4\\".

They promised a release \\"real soon\\" but half a year later, nothing. Nor does it look like they've changed their web site since then.

These were destroyed when I discovered that the book bore little resemblance to reality. Protagonist Ella, unlike most policemen, seems able to interrupt whatever work she's doing to jump in her car and drive to 'nearby' towns at a moment's notice. She always arrives ready and eager to tackle yet another emergency. Of course, the Four Corners region is huge, and travel between towns would have her driving incredible distances. The reader can't help but know that Ella possesses some sort of sixth sense because, in the first 70 pages, Ella feels 'uneasy' at least 70 times. Each colleague, (again mentioned repeatedly), gives great respect to her famous hunches. When an author repeates himself, it's usually because he doesn't have much to say.

Torie's mother was hardly mentioned and she was a great character in the previous stories. Also the violence level was definitely increased which I did not appreciate.

I am hoping Collette will settle in New Kasel, I love this character and liked the way she turned into somewhat of a side kick for Torie.

My only complaint is the voice of the singers is a bit higher than what I would like to hear in this music. I am not faulting him for his voice, rather I commend his ability to command the English language with a subtle Swiss accent. (which is why his voice sounds like he is about 18) I love this album and it goes right next to my Big 6, Guana Batz and Amazing Royal Crowns(still royal to the loyal!) songs.

The picture shown was an older Mirro press like I wanted. The stand is not as sturdy as the Mirro press and the cone and pestel is not as big and has a pointed end, not round for mashing.

There's way too much misery and death and not enough kissing and comedy. Which is why this movie gets two stars. Yes, production values could be better. A lot better. The acting is self-conscious. But its heart is in the right place, and so are its love scenes. The characters don't die. It has moments of amusement and some of the dialogue rings true. It's worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The production of this film looks very amateur.

Every aspect of this movie was dreadful. The acting, if such it could be called was pathetically amateurish, the story line overused, the script lame, the dialogue monotonous and the music was so clicheed that you could turn off the picture and still know what was happening on screen. There was no magic between the principles and nothing that I could see that would have induced a mature , sensible woman to make such a radical change in her lifestyle. I am a great fan of what is generally referred to as the \\"lesbian\\" gendre,personally I don't think it exists outside poorly made movies, and this one fits on the lowest rung of that category, along with \\" Girl Play\\",and Aprils' Shower\\", and too many others to mention.

The only downside to them is that the connection part wears out over time as the glue looses its integrity. Other than that the sound great for the price I paid for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sorta hate these","review":"I'm not fond of these headphones. The sound is pretty good, but they annoy me. First, the cord is way too long and it ALWAYS gets super tangled up more than any other headphone cord I've seen. I hate how the cord for the right headphone is attached at the left headphone, instead of them both coming from the main cord. It's really dumb and really annoying because you have this long, stupid looping cord just hanging out around your neck/chest that just dangles there and is really annoying when you run. The ear stems are a little funky as well. They are just hard to keep on, especially when I'm running. I definitely won't be getting another pair of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"these headphones are comfortable with good sound quality.(make sure the clip is actually attached around the earlobe, not just sitting on it.) the cord is long which is good. the only thing that isn't so good is that the two ear parts are attached to each other with a cord. this makes it hard to listen to with another person if you are to far away from them.but, other than that, these are great!!!oh, and the plates are kind of hard to change, but that's also good, because you know the won't fall off."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"He shipped it in the time he said he would and it got here earlier then expected.

They are a nice change of pace from the usual punk scene, adding the more immature and fun side in, similar to groups such as Blink 182 and Less Than Jake. Funny but well thought out lyrics, catchy beats and great guitar and drum work really make this one complete package. Harder edged songs like \\"Nowhere Slow\\", \\"Suffer\\", \\"Grow Up\\" & \\"Reflections\\" really pump up the energy level. On the other hand fun songs such as \\"All that you have\\", \\"Last nite regrets\\", \\"Surfer girl\\", \\"P**s off\\" & \\"Your past\\" entertain you from start to finish.

However, this band doesn't even come close to the likes of Blink 182 and MxPx. Yes, they do have some catchy guitar riffs and the rest of the usual pop/punk formula which should add up to an album full of catchy songs. However, the vocals on this CD are ridiculous and seem to get worse as the album goes along, and Homegrown finally reaches its lowest point with the last track \\"Reflections,\\" which is just flat-out embarassing. There's just something missing in this CD and its a good lead singer. Act Your Age is definately not worth buying. If your in to this type of music skip Homegrown and buy something from a good band like the Suicide Machines, Goldfinger, or Blink. Trust me, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Punks that put on a great show!","review":"I first heard of Homegrown a year ago when they were going to do a benefit show for the campus radio station. I heard they were real big in So-Cal and that they were pretty good so I thought I would try it out. I went and I am glad I did. I saw them at a place called the Zocalo room which is small and the boys from homegrown lit it up. There contagious lyrics and hijinx onstage immiediately got me.

This book would be used for quick reference for signal processing technology, and if you are in the front part of signal processing technology, you may need to use many of the formulas, so, it will be a great help for your task such as writing a technical paper, finding a proper use of formula, understanding quickly on a mathematics-related subjects and so on.

How disappointing that this is a another of those re-recorded versions that older bands who get back together decide to put out to jump start a stellar career that died long ago. I LOVED ARS and still do. I don't believe that they meant to decieve anyone as to the content of this CD. This appears to be a condensed version of \\"Atlanta Rhythm Section '96,\\" a CD that by its title implies 'remake.' The band for that CD had three original members left, including Ronnie Hammond, the lead singer during their heyday.

The third time I used it, the snowboard fell off the roof rack when I was driving on freeway at 60mph. Thank god it was an early morning and there's no car behind.

I wish the screws were a bit longer and the hand grips were larger. That being said, I used the quick release hardware and the racks had no issue on the highway for 100+ miles at 100+ mph.

Might as well spend the extra money and get a quality item from Thule or Yakima.

Yes, there is a table of contents so that you can zip along to the chapter involving comma's and such, but what you get is about 3-4 pages of examples (not always very good ones) of the usage. I appreciate the author is trying to simplify by writing a short book with all of the pertinent rules presented, but to me, it is just not enough of a reference. I almost feel as if I have to got back and skim through a \\"blog post\\" to get the correct usage. So you better remember it, or you will be searching through this one.

The first hundred pages were a charm, true brilliant Jo Beverely writing, sexual tension and honest plot complications from two people caught in their time, places, and circumstances. But, unfortunately, the book began meandering, the hero and heroine spent hundreds of pages apart, and the final wrap up didn't require that we go through the several hundred pages of proposals, engagements, elopements, kidnappings, et al.I highly recommend Devilish and Lord of Midnight for wonderful, wonderful Jo Beverely romances.

And crippled heroines have been done to death at this stage as well, as has the innocent and niave girl who asks a rake for tutelage in love.I also saw so many grammatical errors in this book that the whole thing struck me as slipshod and yet another book churned out to try to continue a successful series at the expense of commonsense and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hazard here","review":"I was charmed that the book was dedicated to the late Dorothy Dunnett.

The concept is simple and the results are good. The magnet is very strong, almost too strong if you need to move slow around objects.

The best thing I could say about this item is I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a very good and useful product.

If you have one tank, you could just leave it in the tank all the time. The cleaning part is like the hook side of velcro. A couple of people have mentioned it has scratched their glass. I find that nearly impossible to believe. I've been using it for 6 months in various tanks and not seen a single scratch. I suppose it could scratch an acrylic tank.The magnet is extremely powerful. That's good so you don't lose the contact with the cleaning side as you might bump into ornaments in the tank.

The construction of the dress was horrible-the little white flowers on the skirt were hot glued on, sequins and beads were loose and falling off the bodice, and it was not fluffy and full like the picture-rather the skirt was skimpy on layers. The sizes were also odd. I measured both girls very carefully, as these are flower girl dresses, and while the length was fine, the bodices were enormously too wide.

But since I most likely won't be buying a burner for awhile and considering there simply is no better brand than Plextor, I decided to get the PX-716. Obviously it works great. Very fast with everything, some very nice features (the 8mb buffer seems to actually help) and great support. I had a problem with CDs I burned wouldn't work in my car CD player, and emailed tech support in the night and received a response by 6:00 the next morning (the problem wasn't the burner's fault).

I tried using Roxio, and another CD writing program, and i would get errors from both. I tried switching the jumper from Cable Select, to Master, and then to Slave, nothing.

You would think that they would have an answer for a drive that does not read ANY cd's (music, data, games, etc.). I e-mailed tech support and there FIRST response was to RMA the drive!! This means shipping the drive back to Plextor at my expense! And then waiting forever to get a USED drive back! That's right, if you RMA a Plextor product you will get a REFURBISHED product back.

How he and some unexpected allies triumph and make their row an urban showpiece makes a fascinating story. Even the bully is redeemed, in a believable and unsentimental way.

With the exceptions of \\"Cold Water,\\" \\"Filipino Box Spring Hog,\\" and \\"Come on up to the House,\\" there's not much of interest here. Contrast this album with his great stuff (from Swordfishtrombones to Bone Machine) - it just doesn't match up. The ballads especially, while pretty, are boring and cause no emotional response (unlike his good ballads like \\"A Little Rain\\" from Bone Machine). Somehow I knew this album was not that good, which is why I held off buying it for over a year. Tom's stint as America's premier original musical genius might be done.

From the bizarre \\"Filipino Box Spring Hog\\" to the gorgeous \\"Take It With Me,\\" the music is fabulous. \\"Hold On\\" is inspirational at parts, surreal at others. \\"Cold Water\\" is a blues song...or is it? \\"Big in Japan\\" is not as awful as some others would have you believe. In fact, there's not a bad track on this record. If you ask me, Tom Waits/Kathleen Brennan are up there with the best songwriters of the century, i.e. Lennon/McCartney, Brecht/Weill, and anyone else you can think of.

The Rolling Stone magazine review of Bloodflowers by the Cure comes to mind. Well, Mule Variations is just such an album. This is the sound of Tom Waits coasting. This is Tom Waits giving the people what he thinks they expect from him. On this album you've got a little bit of everything that people have come to associate with Waits, but none of it done as well as in earlier days. You've got the depressing country songs, the \\"Going Out West-\\"type song, the screeching nonsense. The only thing missing is the big band stuff. None of it is done with the same panache and creativity as on previous albums. It's just a make-time album, the act of a man bored with his own career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags ass","review":"2 1/2Somehow Waits weaves a small spell by the time the whole album is through, but by and large this is the sound of someone, who made sounding tired so refreshing, sounding tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Waits seems to ...","review":"engender a strange form of elitism in his fans ... whoever listens to the most abstract or bizzare album wins.

So, because this album is more, dare I say, listenable to the average Joe, it's worthy of loosing stars? Ridiculous. And so what if Tom decides not to tread radically new ground? More power to him. I'd like to see any other artist who can be as dynamic as he!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a darkly beautiful album","review":"This album is quite a departure thematically from Bone Machine. The appocalyptic concerns have seemingly given way to a more deeply personal album.Mule Variations is full of elegiac songs about reconcilliations- with faith, love, the road. It is classic waits through and through. Instead of disturbing, though, it's stangely comforting. The record is about finding light and good in a dark, confused world. It's about coming home rather than leaving. In Raindog's \\"Blind Love\\" Waits wrote \\"if you get far enough away, you'll be on your way back home\\". That's what this albums seems to expound upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-crawl with demons!","review":"What can I say of the man's work that hasn't been said by all of you fine, reverential fans before? I've been sweating for this latest installment for the last six years, and now I can feel it in my veins, breaking my heart, restoring my faith.After listening to \\"Variations,\\" my assessment of this whole \\"they sound like earlier songs\\" debate is this: I think (unconsciously) Tom takes up the same song many times over the years, squeezes it, sniffs it, sees how it has aged, and then gives it a newer body in which to live. Call it reconstitution, call it creative reincarnation. How many other songwriters can honestly say that their songs deserve to be reborn every decade or so?Kind regards to all of you Raindogs out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big in music maladies.","review":"I heard \\"Big in Japan\\".

Just as Mr. Waits makes us think he is done, he comes back with this all-powerful record. 'Hold on', 'House where nobody lives', 'picture in a frame', 'Georgia Lee', and 'take it with me' all send an irresistible waves of emotion to you. I can tell you right now, if this man has experienced and bore witness to all he writes of, he is a much wiser man than I. Don't think the songs I didn't mention were poor, by ANY MEANS! They keep you listening with bluesy beats and guitar parts and truthful, disturbing, and sometimes even funny lyrics. This album makes me laugh, cry, and can even lull me to sleep. I cannot say the same for any other album or artist on the face of this earth. Well, Nick Cave, John Popper, and Pj Harvey can. Yet, they are all a DISTANT second to Tom Waits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup, it's an effort indeed","review":"Tom Waits' first REAL album release in six years sounds much more down to earth than, say for example, \\"Rain Dogs\\". Maybe it's the move to the countryside, maybe it's Tom getting older, I don't know, but it sure as hell sounds great... It's actually among his very best. Listen to songs like \\"Hold On\\", \\"Hous Where Nobody Lives\\", \\"Cold Water\\", \\"Pony\\", \\"Eyeball Kid\\", \\"Picture In A Frame\\", \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" or \\"Georgia Lee\\" and you can understand why he is concidered to be one of the most talented -if not THE most talnted - songwriters of our time. There's just so much humility and warmth in his songs. Especially the lyrics are genious in some places, and the sympathic sound of the instuments make their sound even more cosy. This is the best album of the last year of the second millenium. Ain't that something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenge to \\"Alternative Radio\\"","review":"Not that Mr. Waits actually *cares* whether his stuff is embraced by the masses, or that there's a chance in hell, but, wouldn't it be nice if all those baggy pantsed \\"hipsters\\" currently running alternative (yeah, right) radio actually put \\"Big in Japan\\" in heavy rotation?

Tom Waits is an extraordinary talent who takes snapshots of life at times disturbing and at times beautiful, but always moving. One grows to understand amusing facets of life and new twists on old emotions. Just when the listener is taken to the edges of despair and sorrow, she is lifted to heights beyond expectations.I hear sounds that I didn't know existed when I listen to Waits.Perhaps that is what I love best in the wonderful music of Waits. The music mirrors life with all its ups and downs. Somehow within it all one sees or feels the richness and variety and discovers profundity in it.Waits is a highly enjoyable talent constantly breaking boundaries, ultimately to the listener's delight. Buying this album is no waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately uninspired...","review":"Owning every Tom Waits album,I really wanted to like this one, but I didn't. It just falls flat.

Get Swordfishtrombones if your searching for a begining in his hobo-tramp years, or The Heart of a Saturday Night for his beatnik-piano-man years.I hate to let one song ruin an album for me, but \\"what's he building in there?\\" does just that. The song reminds me simultaneously of this old Saturday Night Live skit where Steve Martin repeated asks \\"what the hell is that?\\" and Bone Machine's \\"the ocean doesn't want me.\\" Both these skits worked the first time, but to re-hash them goes about as far as Weekend at Bernies II."},{"rating":"2","title":"great overall cd...classic tom.","review":"tom shows creativity once again.Tom is cool, bad, good and everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Un-Hits","review":"The new album from Tom Waits hit the US today. Us in Europe have been listening to it for a few days now.As his first album in 6 years it has been well worth waiting for. There is little that is revolutionary, or indeed evolutionary. It would seem that it summarises all the albums he recorded for Island. But the lyrical beauty is ever present.Go Buy it Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Noisy World of Tom Waits","review":"Imagine the noises that must run through his head at night.\\"House Where Nobody Lives\\" is Waits at his most touching. He can be syruppy sweet at times, and this is definitely one of those songs. I hope Faith Hill (or someone of her ilk) covers this song, makes it a big, big hit, and Tom gets the seriously huge royalty checks he so richly deserves.\\"What's he building in there?\\" is the spooky side of Waits. He goes from \\"House\\" and its middle class values to \\"Building\\" and its deranged paranoia, and we get to go along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness","review":"After all of these years this cd still gets weekly play.

The lyrics are interesting and insightful, but the music is hideous. I gave it 5 listens, and then dumped it. Just a warning to all that are new to this artist.

I'm one of the few writing in who HATES this album. Honestly, halfway through my first listen, my roommate threatened to move out if I kept playing it. I agreed with her. This is not even worthy of frisbee use. I'll stick with his early years albums, which are not as nearly as abrasive. Seems to me that he's just being obnoxious here for the sake of it.

Ennis and Dillon looked to change that, and succeded with flying colors. Not only does this book provide a good backing to many of the characters in the actual comics, but it also is a great standalone, a monument in an industry overburdened by flashy art and flamboyant characters.

WEll, first of all, the art is lacking. The writing is predictable and boring. And the importance of this work is nonexistant. Why bother telling the story of Arse-face, Saint, and such without telling something WE don't know? Why bother writing a special with no real significance? It's boring. It's ugly. It's silly. Preacher is one great series. This is one that readers could do without.

I love the dark humor, the pathos of the characters, the dichotomy of the overblown story set next to a really simple plot; the love triangle.What I didn't like about the series was this book. \\"Ancient History\\" single-handedly brought down my faith in the first three graphic novels. It destroyed completely the momentum and the feel of the Preacher series, and it cost me fifteen dollars in the process. The backstory, aside from the Saint of Killer's story, is completely irrelevant. And even the Saint of Killers doesn't really need to be explained; we all know he's a homicidal badass, right?My advice; save your money and your time and move straight in to Dixie Fried."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little sideshow in the Preacher saga","review":"This tome collects a few stories that do not really advance the dramatic storyline of the whole series. ¿Do you need to read it in order to understand the whole saga?

The origin of the Saint of Killers might be desirable for completists. Fun, but not one on the volumes I pull down to read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"A Jesseless collection, pretty much.

While some of the recordings by Dennis Day are a bit dated (made in 1940s), they are all rendered in a very appealing and sincere fashion, and Gary particularly shines in his wonderfully controlled, touching baritone voice with his marvelous 3-4 octave range and fabulous breath control.

I know they're cheap, but come on- ripping the first time? In addition, she said they felt a bit uncomfortable. She didn't have as much fun as she thought she would have with these. I thought they were kinda sexy looking, although they felt cheap to the touch.

The movie spends far too much time underwater instead of focusing on the magnificent scenery and wildlife on land. Why can't the IMAX producers simply let the gorgeous images of wildlife speak for themselves instead of dreaming up a tacky storyline about a beautiful marine biologist and her oh so dangerous explorations? At one point she rappels down into a cave and worries about the possibility that the rocks above her will collapse. I was in the Galapagos last month and visited the same cave (on the island of Santa Cruz) - what they don't tell you is that there are stairs into the cave from the other end!

The director had an interesting, unique environment he could have pointed his camera toward - the island's vegetation and wildlife are the two things I had hoped to see.

The programs included on the CD that came with the book did not work correctly. I could answer one or two flash card questions and then the buttons to move forward or backwards stopped working and I had to start over. I contacted the publisher for a replacement CD but never received it. Examples in the text and answers to many of the questions are wrong: 4 * 4000 = 18000 in one case, 24000/14400 = 9600 in another.

However, once envisioned, most start-ups/visionaries fail miserably to execute. Visions without execution are just hallucination!This book not only presents the what's and why's of innovation but also the how's. It details some solid guidelines for being fast and productive in an uncertain environment where disruptive innovations reign.I would recommend reading this book along with the following books:- Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen- Innovator's Solution, Clayton Christensen- Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore- Inside the Tornado, Geoffrey Moore- Harvard Business Review's Darwin and the Demon, Geoffrey Moore- Execution: the Discipline of Getting Things Done, Larry Bossidy et al"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep reading","review":"I think the book has many good insights but needs to be read with a lot of attention.It's kind of a textbook"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Brown","review":"I've loved the Browns since I was a little girl.

But not only that, the fabric is shedding, you can pluck the fur and pull the fur till it is totally bold. Our 6 years old bear survived countless washing, my daughter brings it everywhere she goes and sleep with it every night and it still has all the fur in place.I returned it and bought the identical to what we had on the e-bay.Don't buy it, it'll not survive a single wash or rough play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, way overpriced","review":"The is a good quality product that does a good job at cleaning algae. It is fairly good at removing light algae with 1 or 2 passes. Sometimes, more stubborn algae may require multiple passes and youre probably better off using a scrubbing pad.As a side note, the scrubbing side is actually the \\"hooks\\" side of velcro material. I also dont understand why the company calls each model by tank sizes. Just give the dimensions of the scrubbing area and let the consumer choose which model he wants to buy!I paid more to buy the Mag Float since as the name says, it floats. All the other magnetic cleaners Ive seen sink and require you tie a string between the two halves. I gave it a 4 because IMO, it is too expensive. Some other company should produce a floating magnet cleaner, it cant be that hard to make. Until then, this is probably the best you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh for a mild clean","review":"This magnet is better suited for glass aquariums that get a lot of algae on the surface of the glass. For day-to-day or average use, the magnet bristles are too harsh and will gladly host any particles floating in the water that will scratch your glass. So be careful, they way to use it is to rinse both surfaces of the cleaner (outside and inside) to make sure there aren't any particles stuck. Then, as you are doing a water change, use a sponge to wipe the inside of the aquarium making sure you eliminate any particles or sand stuck to the glass. Then use the magnet (make sure you pair it only once). If you follow this process you will reduce the chances that you will scratch the glass.

Waiting for Odesseus trully will keep you in the chair reading, it has many in depth parts that in The Oddessy never really went to describe much. Waiting for Odesseus is read through the eyes of the women of The Oddessy, i think its some what of a twist, Waiting for Odesseus gives life to the women who would have never been described as much.

Maybe I've become jaded, but has anyone seen a poorer excuse for a plot recently? There's barely enough time between things blowing up and unnecessary \\"bullet time\\" effects to tell a coherent five minute story. Clearly, the producers of this film do not realize that spending even half as much money and attention on the story would have saved them about $50 million in special effects.What happened to character development? 500 extra explosions is not a substitute for good dialogue, suspense or purposeful action. Even Goldeneye (with a remarkably similar superweapon) had more believable characters. And The Thomas Crown Affair was far sexier with great plot twists and momentum.The lack of chemistry between Brosnan and Berry is stunning. They're both likable actors, but have nothing to work with here. This series is turning into a very long commercial for Jaguar, Aston Martin, Omega watches, etc. Very disappointing from a big Ian Fleming buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Another Day","review":"DAD is the worst Bond film of all time. I won't go to far into how unoriginal it was, (taking scenes from other Bond movies and putting them together to make one bad movie), but Pierce Brosnan's performance was territble. Now don't get me wrong I like Pierce, but he's just not James Bond. He in no way resembles Ian Flemings character, not the way all of his successors did. It is time for Pierce to step down and hand the role over to somebody like Adrian Paul. Also the movies in general need a lot. James Bond is a Spy not a superhero, he has to stop saving the world all the time and start acting like a Spy. The new movies, which started with Goldeneye, are victimes of too much action not enough suspense. Up until Goldeneye the James Bond series was a Spy Drama, now suddelny its a pointless USA original action Flick.

Try to make the next Bond flick SUSPENSEFUL!Pierce Brosnan is a drip compared to Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Timothy Dalton did a better job.007 used to travel to exotic locales.

Mediocre special effects, and the most stupid of all gadgets, an invisible Aston Marton. The song is unhearable. Only the fencing sequence is correct.

This is the best Bond that Brosnan has done since he put on the Tuxedo. We see a much darker Bond and it works, there are more layers to James, kudos to Brosnan for showing them to us. Finally, James is growing up a little (not too much though, we want him to be eternally cool).There are some disappointing CGI sequences which take you out of the film a couple of times, and at times the movie drags, but with a Bond movie, you just suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.Loved Halle Berry and love the trend in the last couple of movies of having some of the Bond Girls kick some butt!

The movie has far too many stupid gadgets (come on, an invisible car that fixes itself?) What is with bond surfing? Bond scuba-dives, he DOESN'T surf. There is no real plot, so they had to cover that up with ... explosions. The villans are incredibly stupid, they could have killed bond countless times.

Save your money bond fans. This movie is pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Bond movie ever made!","review":"What is this? A video game or what? The whole movie looked so ridiculous and childish, lousy script and lousy acting. Pierce Brosnan if money is not a objection, bail out of it like Sean Con-- as early as possible. Because you've already like Roger Moore, whose heart was not in the movies he played as 007 only to cash in by acting tough. Brosnan is a very talented actor and he should not do one more of this Bond movie again. As acting Bond, his performance is more and more deteriorated. And also, you just looked so old and tired in this movie giving me an impression during watch that you could hardly wait to finish this ridiculous movie and go somewhere else soonest possible. Well, the feeling is mutual, just do it, pal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just die today","review":"This was the first James Bond that I ever watched, and sadly my last. James Bond is nothing more than a womanizer, and not a good spy to boot. The two and half hours on this movie are definantly a waste as James Bond seduces girl after girl, and tries to capture a man who is as poor an enemy as he is spy.I thought the movie was full of acting, acting you can tell is acting which made the movie longer. Besides, the chase scenes where just as boring. The hover crafts promised to be cool, but only managed to become drab and uninteresting after the first five minutes.In short, James Bond will never win my heart nor my vote of popularity in this review.Oh, well, he'll just have to try another day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole new level of stupidity is reached with this movie...","review":"SAd. I used to like James Bond movies. even with Timothy Dalton I liked them. even the first one with Brosnan.But this DIA ANOTHER DAY is a bomb. A utterly, silly, ridiculous \\"action movie\\", where Bond is not a character anymore, it's just a killing machine, an assasssin, a kind of RAMBO. We simply cannot care about his character and that of Halle Barry, so empty and, in the ultimate case, more cruel than the villains! The movie is an endless series of explosions, explosions, fire, death and more death. All that using a unbeliavable bad taste plot about North Korea, since the actual diplomatic situation with this country.I'll not talk about the lies, they were some of the charm of this franchise, but here they are so stupid that I wanted to puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond Fan","review":"I own all of the bonds on dvd, and this new bond (I hate to say it) is horrible. They have taken a great movie series that was liked by many young and old and turned it into a every day movie. the script looks nothing like a bond film (I.E. James Bond Does not get captured, slow motion fight sequences), it is more like a b rated action movie,this script does not have any bond roots what so ever. It does not look nor feel like a bond movie. Pierce Brosnan should have shoved this script back in the directors face and refused to have part in it. But sadly I will be adding it to my bond collection anyway, beause it is a bond movie and thats the only reaason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pierce Brosnan: Perhaps the best Bond, in the worst movies","review":"I rarely walk out of a theatre thinking, \\"I just wasted two hours of my life and $7.75 and I want it back\\". But this movie was abjectly horrible. Think about the old James Bond movies. They actually had plot... stuff happened. Half of this movie seems to be spent in the ice palace and around the ice palace, with total implausibilities and stupid plot elements. My overall summary of this movie: It has little of the originality and cleverness of the older James Bond films. It's all action, action, action: and that's not what it's about... or not what it should be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Are You People Talking About?","review":"This movie apparently has a lot of vocal fans, but dont let that fool you. This is a terrible movie. The movie rambles on for far to long with \\"action\\" sequences that get old very fast. James Bond gets captured and tortured. What is that? My final problem with this, and all other Brosnan Bond movies, is the Bad Guy. Why do they have to be lame. A bald guy who is entirely covered in metal flake silver paint isnt scary, its lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Ridiculous effects, ridiculous story, ridiculous dialogue... And Halle Berry can't act to save her life. The fact that the producers wanted to make a spin-off series with her prove they don't know what they're doing! When the studio execs (the ones who axed the Jinx/Halle Berry movie) are the ones with taste and commons sense you know you're in trouble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GUESS I'LL DIE ANOTHER DAY","review":"Are they insane? Seriously, this officialy 20th Bond film in the franchise has the worst story since the man with the golden gun. Of course, the movie has some good moments, but the promblem with the film is Pierce Brosnan. He is getting way to old to play 007. Another promblem with the film is the explosions and gadgets.They are just way out of hand. Lee Thamohari who directs this movie has no idea what he was doing. He just doesn't put the James Bond feeling in it. Another thing wrong with it is that the visual effects in this movie are really cheesy. No offence, but James is much meaner than the villians. I hope that the next Bond film, which is going to be the last that will be played by Brosnan is as good as Goldeneye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This movie really blows, I wanted to leave the theatre half way through but I was with a friend so I couldn't. What have they done to James Bond!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pointless action- but hey, it's bond!","review":"This movie was fun. there are no other ways to describe it. The plot was sketchy, but this is the Brosnan era- we've come to expect that. As for John Cleese as Q- a fitting replacement. He simply shines in that role- providing the adequate humor needed to lighten the entire movie. This movie was a fun excape for a few hours, especially when bond chooses to use the broken rocket sled as a kiteboard. I actually thought that that was funnier than it was a good use of resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Today","review":"This is the worst movie of 2002, totally crap. If there is one James Bond you should never watch then it is this. As all ways the James Bond movies never have a solid plot everything is routine this is no exception. So this movie really sucks don't bother watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking. Positively shocking.","review":"I have seen this film twice. One in the cinema and once on DVD. The second time was to see if it was as bad as I thought it was....Nope, it was worse. I'm a big Bond fan, of Sean Connery and Roger Moore, but this was a complete joke. It made A View To A Kill look like a classic.AN INVISIBLE CAR???? SWAP YOUR DNA FOR AN HOUR'S SLEEP???? A GLOBAL WARMING CAUSING (Diamonds Are Forever-another bad Bond film-ripoff) SATELLITE???? Bond can't tell his gun has been unloaded? Give me a break. Also the 'CGI' (I use the term loosely) look as if they've been made with a PS2. Also the jumpy editing did my head in.Brosnan looked bored, and the writers didn't seem interested either. I think that mostly the blame should go on the director, because at the end of the day he has to make it and could have changed it if he wanted to. The only jump cut I want to see is his face when he gets fired. Save your money and watch Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Bond movie","review":"I can accept the ridiculous dialog the writers give Halle Berry who apparently has shown she is capable of acting in other motion pictures. I can accept the head-scratching plot. I can even accept Madonna's bad techno-pop theme song.But I can't accept the incredibly horrible blue screen CGI special effects with Bond surfing on the tidal wave near the end. Get this franchise back into the hands of a capable director. Quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Another Day Not Up To Bond Standards","review":"This movie did not live up to neither its pre-release billing nor the bar set by previous movies in the Bond Franchise. The plot was very thin (Where did this Killer Death Ray Satellite and the Q-Branch-esque bad-guy's Jag come from?), and the character development was non-existant. Most of the time we at the very least get a briefing on a bad-guy before Bond circumnavigates the world to whack him! The guys at MGM need to spend less on getting big name actors and spend more on the Director and Screen-Play. And one more thing... Bond surfing? PLEASE! My suggestion: Hang-10 to the nearest video peddler and rent a classic (\\"From Russia With Love\\", \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"You Only Live Twice\\", heck, even \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is better!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOND! JAMES BOND!","review":"It's a shame that Pierce Brosnan chose not continue playing JAMES BOND! After Connery,Moore,& Dalton-Brosnan did an excellent job and to me this film would be his farewell to that role as going out in style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INSULTING BOND MOVIE","review":"Well, I honestly thought Brosnan would bring in a new swing to the bond franchise. Goldeneye was witty, action-packed, well scripted and actually quite dark too, but in a good way! However, things have totally gone to pot here. We have villains with david bowie make-up and glowing masks, enough digital mockery to shake a stick at, (then make it spin round in slo-mo then zoom towards the camera), and just generally ludicrous ideas - invisible cars for goodness-sake! Who on earth on the bond team thought, \\"YEH! and his car can, like, totally disappear\\". This film is like a computer game, when I saw Brosnan surfing a 10,004 foot wave I had to check my hands to see if I was holding an x-box control pad! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel Sorry For Pierce Brosnan","review":"Pierce Brosnan last performance as James Bond will ultimately be described as a joke. This movie is not that bad, but its hard for anyone over nine to take this movie serious. Ice castle? Invisible cars? The endless puns? Madonna as a fencing instructor? Need I say more? The director turned Brosnan's Bond into a cartoon character without Connery's sophistication, Dalton's hard approach, or Moore's humor. Its really sad, but its a hard fact that Brosnan best outing as Bond was his first in \\"Goldeneye\\". Let's just hope the new Bond (the brilliant actor Daniel Craig) will NOT allow the writers to reduce his Bond into a sad joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love James Bond","review":"Pierce Brosnan pulls it off yet again in his latest portrayal of Bond, James Bond.\\"Die Another Day\\" is full of action (it's James Bond, what did you expect?), but at points the storyline becomes a little dry. Halle Berry plays \\"Jinx,\\" one of James', err, \\"friends\\" in the movie. She does an excellent job as the latest \\"Bond Girl\\" and is a HUGE asset to the film itself.The story itself in general is actually quite a good one, one of the best in my opinion. However, particular scenes seem to drag on for much longer than they should, leaving the audience checking their watches every now and then. Overall, however, the latest Bond flick is a good one and fits in perfectly to any avid James Bond fan's collection. (And if for some reason you don't like Halle Berry, don't worry...there is an incredible blonde in the film also =).The 2 DVD set comes w/ hours upon hours of extra footage and things along those lines. It's a good choice for any action lover or James Bond fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hidden Racism","review":"It's interesting that Halle Berry's character , a government agent , would end up bed with James Bond after a 15-20 second conversation. This is the first time \\"Bond\\" has gotten a female ally into bed with him so quickly and Halle Berry , the standard of Black beauty , wastes no time jumping in bed with the \\"great' James Bond. Hidden racism at it's very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE","review":"I really can not believe how they destroyed the James Bond franchise with this movie. Way too over the top CGI effects, horrible story, and terrible acting. This movie started out bad from the first minute and just got simply worse. I don't know why anybody who is a long time Bond fan would even find anything good about this movie.Lets just hope they never make another Bond movie again if this is the direction the franchise is going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly forgettable","review":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE...........I felt I wasted my 6 (and the price of cinema tickets to watch celluloid is another review itself)............. How many baddies in this movie !? And the 'plot'..........not exactly easy to follow, if there was one.........where did the satellite come from half way into the film. An invisible car....guess why no one else has used that one before....because it isn't believable. Such loud explosions at the start of the movie too ! Now think about why there is more hype than usual.........Bit like when you see quotes on film posters.......think of some and decide if the film was any good.It is bad enough paying 6 for a cinema ticket these days. How often do you come out of a film these days and say that was good. I have warned you. I would recommend True Lies, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Last Boy Scout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop making these movies","review":"If you have seen one James Bond movie you don't have to see them all.

Not his fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, Seuol, it's a wonderful place!","review":"But cancel your trip to that health farm now, as a North Korean interrogation centre is the perfect place to get a healthy diet and those biceps rippling. Even looking like Jerry Garcia from the neck up is not necessarily a downside in some quarters.Rupert Graves boasts the most novel attempt at illegal UK asylum seeking since those guys dressed in that Rhino suit (helpful hint, guys: Rhino's don't talk.) Mr Graves' OTT sword fight with Brosnan is the best thing in this frankly peculiar picture.I saw 'Die Another Day' with my sister's eight year old and smugly lamented the fact that he would not have a clue where North Korea is, let alone any political background to the story. Later that evening during a news broadcast I drew an embarrassing blank when my sister enquired where Yemen was.

Could Halle Berry have given a worse performance? (Not that her character helps her any for the afore mentioned reasons). Could they please hire new writers so that they're making good films that attempt to match the quality of the early films. Could they also take some inspiration from Ian Fleming (who I think a lot of people who like this film have never heard of). Get a new director that won't make a video game... also, a new music writer would be good, I know John Barry left big shoes to fill, but they could get someone who's able to write a memorable theme for story and characters (if they had any!) Why not use John Barry while he's still alive? The only thing positive about the Pierce Brosnan films has been the guy who does the title designs... But other than that this film is painful, one star is one too many!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful beginning to a movie that fails to deliver","review":"Tnis 20th James Bond movie really fails to deliver on its promise. After a rather flat and tired precredits sequence the movie sets into a comfortable pace and looks to be heading to be one of the best movies of the series.But, somewhere around 007s arrival in Iceland the movie seems to lose both focus and intelligence and what we are left with is the feeling of a movie with a definite split personality. A great beginning and a terrible, boring conclusion.The writers also seem to be devoid of new ideas blatently copying ideas from previous entries. They called them 'homages\\" but I don't buy it. It's clear that Purvis and Wade are tired with 007 and just wanted a paint by numbers Bond movie to churn out.Very disappointing - especially after a three year wait following the (even worse) The World is Not Enough)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I never saw this","review":"I love the series and I love the novel's as well, but this turns Bond into a generic action hero and the celebrity guest spots make this even worse. Brosnan plays the character well, but the writing has been extremely hit or miss. Consider this one a miss, and I can actually say that out of everything, this is the worst film I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is worse than Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill","review":"I rather watch the Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill. At least they are not a bunch of copycats from the previous bond films. Bronsas looks bored with the role and he is just doing it for a paycheck. The bond women in this film were not interesting and not very sexy at all. They were in the line of trying to dominate than anything. The actions is ok, but not great. The locations are excellent, that's what keeps this film interesting. Also, the greatest point and giving it two starts is that Madonna was in the film. I own this on DVD and I don't even hardly watch it. I am glad the Bronsan is retiring as bond, he is getting to old anyway. He was good in Goldeneye and lost interest in the other three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring DVD","review":"I like Pierce Bronson but this movie bored me to death. I could not stay awake while watching it. It was slow getting into the movie and once it did pick up, the same traits as the previous movies were obvious. I think the movie was overrated. There was action but it is the same story as the others. Guy is a spy, sleeps with everyone girl he meets, uses spy gadgets, and in the end continue sleeping with the actress from the movie.

Disappointed in DAD from a Bond perspective, but an entertaining movie from Michael, Barbara and team. I shuddered when I heard that Madonna was to do the theme song, and I was correct. It was disastrous. I can sing the theme songs for all of the movies (Dr. No didn't have one). DAD was just a repititious ramble of \\"Die Another Day\\". Didn't particularly care for Ms. Berry. Bond movies are taken a little more serious with me. Bond movies should not be done with what's popular at that time. Lots of good actors around, e.g., Sean Connery as \\"M\\", since he probably would not do it, how about Roger Moore. George Lazenby might even be interested.

I saw the opening logo (gun-barrel logo), and thought this is going to be great. The opening logo, and maybe the underground tunnel with the old gadgets, was as close to a BOND movie as they got.The movie lacked it's usually bond qualities. I heard the BOND theme by Monty Norman played once I believe. Femme Fatatales were certainly there, but they also lacked the BOND punch. My biggest problem was that, I had trouble convincing myself that I was watching JAMES BOND. It was just an action flick with Pierce Brosnan to me.I thought before that the other BOND'S were far-fetched, but at least they were somewhat believeable. This film was almost totally sci-fi/techno/space-age garbage. Invisible cars? Robotic suits? Ice castles? Windsurfing on a sea of ice?JAMES BOND WILL RETURN!Thank God!

Hopefully they'll bring back more of the good ol' JAMES BOND for the next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Bond film I've ever seen","review":"I will say it now, I haven't seen ALL the Bond films. I recently became determined to do so, hence why this was on the slate. I think I'm up to 15 or so.If I had to compare this to anything, it's the \\"Schumacher's Batman & Robin\\" of the Bond series; that is to say, a cartoonish shell of our beloved hero. This isn't Bond -- it's pure fantasy, begging far too much of the imagination, which is saying a lot considering the trademark of all Bond films of being over-the-top.Brosnan is fine, and so is Berry. The problem lies in the script and production design. While there is a few good scenes, few are memorable. The opening sequence is terrible (especially the title song), the villian forgettable, the gadgets are more like Michael Bay's wet dream.Short of being a die-hard fan, this one can be easily ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Solid action; terrible plot, dialog, and acting (by Hally Berry). This movie proved to me once and for all time that Hally Berry is an god-awful actress. At least Brosnan delivers his shoddy lines with poise - Berry seems almost more comfortable with the throw-away prose.If you are dead-set on buying this movie also pick up a copy of \\"Catwomen\\" on DVD.

The first, and most distracting, is that the very powerful DTS audio track is noticeably out of sync with the video for nearly half the movie. I've tested two different DVDs out on three separate home theatre setups, and this flaw showed on them all. The other detraction is the fact that MGM broke the running DVD jacket layout design it had going for the Bond series. Now I have a very nice looking set of 19 Bond DVDs on my bookshelf that is ruined by this DVD. Add these faults to the fact that 'Die Another Day' was the worst Bond made since 'Moonraker', and this DVD is pretty worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desmond Llewelyn is turning in his grave","review":"For almost 40 years, Q-branch has managed to produce spy toys that pushed the envelope just enough that they could be fun if you didn't get too deconstructive. This movie blasted through the envelope with an invisible car and a holodeck, reducing Bond from a suave, almost believable secret agent to this decade's next sci-fi character.I was skeptical about Halle Berry being a Bond girl, as she is so well established and distractingly beautiful, but she held the movie together.I only hope that Ms. Broccoli is through with her experimentation, will fire her director, [fire] her writers, and continue the tradition of James Bond in a spirit more becoming of the legacy set before her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't die another day... do it now!","review":"This is one of the worst Bond movies I have ever seen. The plot was not all that bad, which is why I give it two stars, but the acting... my God, could it be any worse? I mean, Halle Berry had won an Oscar a year ago: why did she need to take on such a lame role? Sure she's got the looks, and she looks great, but that's about it: the dialogues between her and Brosnan are stuck in the same place of those cheesy ambiguous conversations between the super-agent and former Bond girls, only that it's been 20 movies now, and we're in 2003.There are a few pieces of contemporary action with effects that go in line with today's technology, yes. But what's up with the Robocop suit the villain wears toward the end? Or the Darth Vader-like performance??? All in all, it was a waste of money. You're better off going with some of the earlier Sean Connery Bond movies, if you absolutely must see one of these.

When I heard about it, I thought it was going to be another boring James Bond movie, with the same repeating action and some of the same lines used by Bond from other movies. Anyways, this was a pretty good movie with many new gadgets including a camoflauge car, a giant satelite that transfers heat from the sun's rays onto Earth, and armored hover crafts...could it get any better?See this movie for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy bad","review":"This has got to be the worst James Bond I have ever seen. The whole plot is cheesy and so is the horrible acting from both Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry.The whole sun machine thing was a little too Austin Powers. The stunts were also over the top. Racing the chinese dude with the stupid diamonds in his face through the hotel trying to save Halle and the rocket ship car thing outrunning the sun was ludicrous.This is a big doo doo stinker of a movie. If you gave it more than 2 stars then...I guess...Well I don't know what to think except you wasted your money and the boogey man will come and get you."},{"rating":"1","title":"triple zero seven","review":"this has to be the absolute worst bond movie ever. whatever happened to the decent stunts that so characterized vintage bond? the only remarkable thing i experienced about this movie was that i actually sat through it in the hope that anything would improve. when something as institutional as a bond movie descends this completely into bland product advertising with absolutely nothing else in the bag of tricks, there is no deeper hole to drop any further....what the heck was all that hype about? the script was ok (can it be anything else in a bond flick?)but every single other thing sucked the big zero. i'm only watching the next bond movie if it takes its cue from 'for your eyes only'. wake up, guys, be inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did they mess this up?","review":"Easy. The wrong director. Take a look at his track record and ask yourself why the producers (years of experience and unlimited possibilites) asked him to do it. The CGI is awful; the gadgets are dumb and the music is atrocious. I'm a Bond fan from the sixties. Every book, every video, every DVD and every toy. Sorry Pierce but it's not your fault. I'm sure you'll be back for 21 and it'll be outstanding.PS. Halle Berry's Jinx? Bloody right she's a jinx! Don't let her back into the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to put James Bond to rest???","review":"Well, at least this one was better than the abysmally bad \\"The World is Not Enough!\\" But the Madonna theme song has to be the worst ever. And Halle Barry as an armed agent?? Well, not quite as far-fetched as Denise Richards being a nuclear physicist, but still......Goldeneye was decent and Tomorrow Never Dies was okay as well, but the James Bond series should die a natural death. There's no point in continuing with them, since they clearly can't make them like they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this one","review":"This movie is terrible even by bond standards, what was Halle berry thinking? She looks awful in this movie, add some lousy dialogues and a plot that parallels Mission Impossible, you have 'Die Another Day'.Pierce Brosnan is at his worst, He looks totally out of shape.But the music was the worst in this movie, David Arnold showed some promise in Tommorrow Never Dies. But they should start with somebody different, or even go back to Eric Serra.The reason i give this 2 stars is cos, the movie is worth watching just for the 'Aston Martin'. and that too half the time, the damn thing is invisible:)Overall, definitely not worth $..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another killer Satellite!","review":"After Tommorrow, and World is not enough I though this would be a great film, wrong. The CG effects were terrible. I am also getting tired of a satellite being in the plot line(remember Goldeneye), Bond going rougue is another rehash. Halle Berry was under used in this film. Lines like yo mamma just make her character sound silly. IMO the worst Bond Film. Although he is good in this film, Pierce hasen't had a good film to work with since Goldeneye. Here's hoping Bond 21 is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Since Moonraker","review":"Worst Bond movie since Moonraker. I'm a die-hard fan of the series and this has to be the worst overall Bond movie in years. The plot was awful and any viewer could see the surprises' coming. Halle Berry is not fit for the series and a sequel with her character will bomb. Bronsan better come back to another one and redeem himself from this terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top, but unsatisfying","review":"I realize it's like saying you didn't have fun at Mardi Gras, but I didn't enjoy this movie. At times, I found myself getting bored during the stunt-a-thons, wondering when they were going to turn down the noise a little.I never \\"bonded\\" with the heroine Jinx, and wondered why Bond would even want to go back to the Ice Palace to save her. Guess it's so he could drive his invisible, bullet-proof car in a chase scene with the bad guy. I found Miranda Frost far more intriguing, but alas...The usual \\"talk dirty to me\\" repartee' is reduced to sophomoric, expecially in the diamonds-in-the-naval scene. This movie is more about technology, stunts, and cliche's than the Bond characters that keep us coming back after 20 films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Exit that Brosnan Deserved...","review":"There are Bond films that tend to divide the fans as to their qualities (\\"OHMSS,\\" for example, or even \\"Moonraker\\"), and then there are the Bond films like this one that are just tough to defend. Ugh. This entry starts promisingly enough - Bond is taken prisoner and foresworn by MI6 - so that one could be momentarily forgiven for believing it might be more emotionally charged and character-driven than its predecessors. But when Madonna's misplaced theme-song kicks in, followed by the laser beams and ice palace, hope falters. And then the bloody invisible car shows up. A little camp is not necessarily a bad thing (see the genuinely fun \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" for reference), but this picture presents excess at the expense of the franchise. Brosnan may not be my favorite Bond, but he deserved a better exit than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to bond","review":"In this the 20th installment of the wonderful series we see tons of action and \\"women\\" that make a bond film great. I noticed that this is Brosnan's best work to date and he is JAMES BOND. he has got the syle that has been missing since connery left the franchise. Halley Berry is wonderful.

I really enjoyed watching this film, but I will have to say that ever since Q passed away, Bond films have and will never be as good. Q really made Bond films what there were.Die Another Day had a very good plot with great acting. However, over the years, Bond girls have been getting too \\"sexy\\". I feel that this takes away from the film. Over all, this film was action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat. The car chase was very well done but the surf boarding was very poor. You could tell that it was done on a computer. Q could have done a better job! More over, I gave this film 4 stars. Well put together except for the surfboard shots. Trully a must have for the collector and Bond lover.Rest in peace Q. We all love and miss you. You were the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action film, bad Bond movie.","review":"If you watch this I recommend not applying anything you know about Bond films. Throw it all out, ignore it. The film is good for modern day, but lacks the feeling that something like Bourne Identity gives, true espionage! The days of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, etc are gone and will never return. High tech special effects and sci-fi gagetry are the norm for the new Bond films but that is what sells for the masses. The story is lacking and beyond believablity. Past Bond films were way out there too but still had a small amount of reality to them - with the exception of Moonraker.Its a good action movie and the homage it plays to all the previous films is fun to catch hidden through out the film. But still lacks the true feel of international espionage. As the cold war ended so did the good Bond films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is the first of the James Bond movies that I have purchased and I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

I was so disapointed.This is the first bond film ever made completly off scene. which means It was all made in hollywood and man can you tell! The movie lacks the good old fashon bond feel. it doesn't feel like the good old adventure bond used to go on, the movie doesn't take you anywhere and is only loaded with numerous sexual references (more so than any other bond film and they are very chessy).

Nothing of that.

It completely lost the charm and elegance that used to caracterise the earlier movies.All in all, it just feels like an expensive Hollywood movie made to entertain you for an hour and then forget about it. So keep in mind that this movie cannot even be remotely associated any other James Bond's. It's stands on it's own and must be kept on the shelf between Rambo and Batman.

Surely, when Bond is skiing away from thirty people down a slope, avoiding hundred of bullets from automatic weapons, we grin and inwardly accept that this is outside the bounds of reality, but it's not so far out that one shudders utterly. A lot of Bond is like that, and we're okay with it, but this movie went beyond the veil in this regard. We're given DNA shapeshifters and invisible cars. We're shown a weapon of impossible, unrealistic power and gadgets that upstage the movies plot and characters entirely. Far and away, this is the worst James Bond film ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halle","review":"The best of the 007's that Pierce Bronson was in.

Very disappointed with this Bond movie. Bad everything including very poor selection of Bond girls.

Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie dies another day","review":"James Bond's last pre-Daniel Craig adventure is long on the campy,short on everything else. Pierce Brosnan is able to drop witticisms (as well as trou for the lovely ladies) &have; amazing machines as the villain (Toby Stephens) plans to ice up the world. Halle Berry's character is a shallow Mary-Sue. She's got uber-special 1337 powers,able to match wits with 007, and she exists to be beautiful&enjoy; amazing intimacy with the superspy. There's also Emma Frost--who's icily virginal&isn;'t inclined to yield to any man (except perhaps her creepy brother),but she melts as well in the ludicrous ice palace. Talented actors like Judi Dench,John Cleese&Sean; Bean are left on the sidelines. There's the consolation of a campy Madonna theme song.\\"Die Another Day\\" is one of the weaker Bond films. It piles one ludicrous premise onto another,and the ending is anti-climactic (though not for Bond&his; ladylove) It's worth missing. A better bet is \\"Casino Royale.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Far Over the Top","review":"The film would have made a better spoof then trying to come off as a serious Bond flick.From the opening scence where we have Bond and a couple associates ride a monster wave to the car chase on a sheet of ice it is all too much. I would love to purchase a vehicle that does not sopin out on pure ice. Where can I get one? Note how Bond gets wet several times in teh film, yet his hair is always perfect.I agree with another review on this page, the scene of Bond parasailing on a big wave is a joke and an embarrassment to Bond fans.Halie Berry is as bad as it gets. Even though she looks good she is such a poor actress I can't enjoy watching her. Perhaps if she just kept her month shut it would work for me.A big disappointment that Bond did not bed Madonna. There is just something about her that makes it work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond...","review":"The absolute W-O-R-S-T Bond movie ever! I didn't think it was possible to beat The World is not Enough, Tommorrow Never Dies, or Goldeneye as z-grade [stuff] but DAD has done it. So bad I can't even begin to catalog it's hideous faults. Overlong, overbaked, ridiculous, insulting, stupefying, garbage. The dialog is so bad I thought I would cry. The humor is infantile - not witty - just crude and boorish. The worst Bond song ever courtesy of Madonna .... Why is a guy wearing a Nintendo game glove that shocks people exciting? Where did he get it? Why? Don't ask , it's pointless...."},{"rating":"1","title":"they're gettting worse and worse","review":"Not only does \\"Die Another Day\\" have the worst Bond theme, it also has the worst Bond girl. The plot of the movie is the same as any other, villians want to take over the world, blah blah, etc. And of course James Bond comes to the rescue once again, this time with a score to settle with the North Koreans. Basically the same plot as any other spy movie. The gadgets in James Bond have been getting completely out of hand. An invisible car? I mean, c'mon. What next, a cyborg that James Bond commands that will do all his dirty work? This is probably one of the worst Bond movies ever. Whatever you do, if you are a newcomer to James Bond, please do not judge the series by this junk! Start with Goldfinger and move your way up. Or better yet, skip this film completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond Fantasy","review":"All Bond films require huge suspensions of disbelief which are happily given for the ride. This one is no exception and delivers vast quantities of thrills and near misses. James does battle with Korea this time, one of the few remaining unknown evil entities in the world. Interestingly, one of the most engaging scenes involves not fantastic inventions but good old-fashioned swordplay between Pierce Brosnan as Bond and the villain, Gustav Graves, dashingly portrayed by Toby Stephens. For once, all the eye candy is not reserved for the men in the audience as Stephens plays the handsome baddie for all he's worth. And he is worth millions...in diamonds. The other kind of ice featured is a palace made of it, a perfect venue for an amazing car chase. Halle Berry and Rosamond Pike offer the stuff men's dreams are made of. All in all, a very entertaining trip to fantasy land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bondian Deja Vu","review":"The James Bond series reaches another crossroads with \\"Die Another Day\\" (2002). Despite some new wrinkles to the rather tired 007 formula, the reliance on computer-generated effects makes the film look like a cartoon. Pierce Brosnan remains a solid Bond, with a memorable assist from Halle Berry as Jinx. However, the actors and director Lee Tamahori are shortchanged by a weak script. \\"Die Another Day\\" offers some nice homages to previous Bond films, but cannot escape the overall sense of deja vu. Brosnan's 007 deserved a better finale and his recent criticisms about the franchise were justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"21rst Century James Bond","review":"I'd have to say this is one of the better James Bond movies.

This is a Bond film that is so cliched and cringeworthy that it borders on looking like a parody. This film seems like all the Bond films rolled into one - which might not seem a bad thing - but every line, action sequence, or plot development seems to be stolen from another Bond film.I suppose this film was at first somewhat entertaining and fun to watch, even if it was at times so cheesy you wanted to cover your eyes, but by the 80 minute mark I just wanted it to end. The extent to which Bond manages to survive anything is so stupid that you can only laugh.I do wonder whether the self-parody is deliberate - either way, there were so many lines of action/hero/sexual cringeworthiness it was unbearable.

The nonstick surface worked well, allowing me to slip the eggs into the water to finish cooking.Apparently I should have brought the water to a simmer before adding the insert and eggs.

He tends to use words and phrases that most would shy away from. And with his amazing voice telling his stories, the music underneath makes it that much more powerful.

GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freshman in the Music World?","review":"Hardly. This album packs awe-inspiring effects and transitions as well as totally original beats and tunes (albeit there is a*one* that copies \\"Psychadelic Furs\\"), the least of which is the simplistic \\"Freshman.\\" \\"Cattle,\\" \\"Photograph,\\" and \\"Penny is Poison\\" are excellent works, although a bit frayed at the edges. This album reminds me vaugely of \\"Recovering the Sattilites\\" (Counting Crows, for you philistines), although with a tad less compositional sophistication. This band is in its early stages, and, if it doesnt run out of insipiration, will surely mature into a top-rate choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love 'The Freshmen'!","review":"I really love The Verve Pipe...And I REALLY love their song 'The Freshmen'.

And this one\`s great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freshman was good, other than that it REALLY sucked.","review":"Sure, The Freshman was a good song, so you think other songs by Verve Pipe would be good, but NOOOOO, all the songs have boring, repetitive lyrics and no melody at all. Trust me just download The Freshman as an MP3 but do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if there's a connection between this group and The Verve?","review":"If there is I can understand why I really don't like this. It tries to sound like King's X, and I use the word tries. Most of the material is lame, and I wouldn't want to listen to it all the way through. Only 3 songs were good here. \\"Drive You Mild\\", \\"Penny Is Poison\\", and \\"Cattle\\". The weakest song on here was \\"Cup Of Tea\\" I feel that a big improvement would be if \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic would do a parody of that song, and title it \\"Chicken Of The Sea\\"(in honor of tuna). The rest of this album I have no use for, and say that I'm in a generous mood tonight giving it 2 stars. I know that about a year after I first heard \\"Cup Of Tea\\" I heard of the group The Verve, and their loser of a hit \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\". I thought it was the same group only switching gears, and trying to become more pop than alternative. I would like to know if these 2 groups co-exist, or if they're both different. Anyone out there please fill me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is repetitive, boring and lacks originality. I suggest you listen to it when you suffer from insomnia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Any album with Freshman is just GREAT with me!","review":"When I hear this album it takes me right back to my senior prom. They must've played \\"The Freshman\\" at least three times. It's such a deep song. I mean it's so poppy and yet so deep. You don't even know what it's about until you stop and really listen and think, you know. And that's the way I feel about this album. You listen to it and love it and sing it and then one day it just hits you. You realize just what they're saying and there aren't too many bands who can do that. A very intellectual band, a great album and some superb music. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, unoriginal, and a waste.","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I bought this for the Freshman. I thought this was a fine song, a long time ago. It still is, its got a lot of pathos and emotion. Yet, strangely enough, the singer somehow manages to deliver another ten or so completely generic, lowest-common denominator rock tunes. Its American music at its worst, barring Backstreet Boys etc. What a shame. Possibly the worst CD in my collection. I know it's annoying when people list their own favourites, but if you are looking for some really moving and adventurous music try Radiohead or Mogwai."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the Talking Head...","review":"I buy pretty much any band Jerry Harrison produces. I started doing it because we had the same first name -- a silly reason to buy a record, but I've bought albums on far flimsier pretense. I kept doing it because it exposed me to a bunch of great bands. Live, Crash Test Dummies, Rusted Root, and now The Verve Pipe. The fact that they're from Michigan is also a point in their favor. If you go by \\"The Freshmen\\" you might be disappointed by the rest of the songs, which have a harder edge and at times soud a little generic, but beneath the grunge there's genuine pop craftmanship. For my money \\"Cup of Tea\\" is the best song on the album, but others are excellent too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiff","review":"Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in an album in a long time. Granted the song \\"The Freshman\\" is a timeless classic, but the rest of the album is far from it's greatness. The album lacks melody and is infested with poor song writing. If you like \\"The Freshman\\" buy the single, stay clear of \\"Villains\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is the worst CD that you can buy","review":"It is terrible.The Freshman is good but all of the other songs are unbeleivably terrible.

Is it just a ploy to get us to buy the cd's or is it that just the people who love the cd's review them. I tried to think of a band that I, nor anyone else that I've come across, have liked. The Verve Pipe is it. 4 starts? Come on. These guys are really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept an open mind","review":"I'm going on record as to saying that most of these songs I heard on this album came from the samples. That's why I'm not going to completely pan this album. I found \\"Reverened Girl\\" to have some promise, but the rest of the samples were rather disenchanting. I heard the one song \\"Cup Of Tea\\" in it's entirity, and I found that to be one of the worst songs of the 90's besides \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", \\"I Am A Pig\\", \\"Fade Into Veiw\\", and \\"Brand New Day\\". I feel that Weird Al could make that song into a bonafide novelty record by redoing it, and naming it \\"Chicken Of The Sea\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're not fresh, but they're not villains!","review":"I must confess i bought the album 'cause i had listen to \\"the freshmen\\"! When i do this, most of the times i get disappointed, but not this time! This is a good rock album, with very good songs such as \\"barely (if at all)\\", \\"the freshmen\\" (of course), and the one i like most \\"penny is poison\\"!

In this he was cheating ranchers while buying mounts for the Cavalry, which his town girlfriend thought clever, but appalled the ranch woman.Reading a Western history it spoke of the terrible person Luke Short was, and I took a deep breath, then later learned the author's real name, Frederick Dilley, Glidden, he who attended college and worked in archeology.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREG BROWN FOR PRESIDENT!","review":"I concur with \\"autonomeus\\" - Greg is THE MAN, in touch with the earth, people, fish; he's sounding the pulse of America. Greg's out there, knows what's going on, and cuts out the [...]. This batch of tunes is very, very, good. Typically, artists put the best tune first, then the quality slides downhill; Greg's record starts out good then gets better and better. I especially enjoy \\"Eugene\\" and \\"Kokomo\\". I won't stretch this review any further - this CD is a real keeper and my word is good.Greg for President, now there's an engaging thought. He probably wouldn't do it, but he's the kind of fella we need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listening","review":"Enjoyed this album of Greg's as I do most all of his creations. I was playing this at work and someone walked by and liked the sound so much he bought the album as well. This album has a nice sound throughout. Little bit bluesy folk. A great sample of Greg's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Back","review":"I do a radio program(public radio KRBD) here in this little town called Ketchikan, Alaska. I feature Greg Brown's music often. I think I own every cd that he has put out and must say this one will be my favorite. Greg has played here a couple of times to a packed house.People here can relate big time to Greg's songs. Greg please come back and let me take you fishing in an Alaskan stream. I'll pack us lunch...Ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on Keeping on","review":"This is a very good collection fo music from Mr. Brown. I live for lyrics and and the feelings of rural America, real, lost or hoped for feelings.Greg allways touches these and this cd is no exception. I also love road trips that are completly unplaned except for a vague destination and he completly paints that picture in Eugene, I find a lot more useful and inspirational thouhts when I am not looking for them. Well worth the money if you can only afford only one cd save your money for food, if not this would be a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it get any better?","review":"I am a huge Greg Brown fan and have all of his recordings but I have to say, this is his very best. I've waited some time before making such a pronouncement because with each new CD I think he can't get any better but this man continues to top himself. That said, \\"The Evening Call,\\" after several years of frequent listening, is Greg's finest. The first three songs alone are worth the price of the CD. Do not hesitate to get it. In fact, get his entire CD collection. You will never tire of them and everyone will be impressed with how you always know the cool stuff, you're always hipper than hip."},{"rating":"2","title":"in awe","review":"First song I ever heard by Mr. Greg Brown was on some Montana internet radiostation in august 2006.

The song was \\"two little feet\\", and already when the intro began, I knew it was going to be so damn good.Immediately afterwards I googled for him, landed at Red House and he had just released \\"The Evening Call\\". They played a full version of \\"Joy Tears\\" on their site. No words to describe how overwhelming his voice and music are. I really have no idea why he's not a BIG STAR. Immediately ordered \\"The Evening Call\\". A treasure.Hope you will be doing some shows in our sincity one day.

It's bit short for the bed in both the length and width. The \\"wrinkly spots\\" show through my bedspread.

There is also much more direct interaction with a member of the Kurii, and we find that they too, have differences of opinions on what is to be done with Gor - the world they yearn to conquer or destroy. This is one of Norman's grittiest novels, where one can truly feel the desperation of the situation through his writing. It is especially the case in the portion of the novel involving his march to Klima.The frienship that Tarl forms in this book with Hassan the bandit is not quite as strong as in some of the others (Nomads and Marauders, for example), but overall it works quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My eyes were opened","review":"After reading the comments from all the migraine sufferers, my eyes were really opened to what these people must go through just to live their lives.

Having read dozens and dozens of books on World War II and viewed numerous histories, as well as having visited historical sights related to WWII, both in Asia and Europe, the information here was so politically biased as to be ludicrous in its anti-war stance. It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator. Insulting to the intelligence of the average person. Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth. One of the least accurate \\"histories\\" I have come across. The only saving grace of this DVD is the color footage from the time period.

While not one of my favorites (maybe yet), the album fits well in my stack of not so loudly rocking albums of JLT. Some of his work doesn't let you enjoy his range and depth. This album does. Nothing fantastic in ways of standout songs but nothing gross or irritating either...not that I'd say that about any of his solo records. \\"Hit the Switch\\" really has a great intro to it. Let me caveat this review by saying I listened to HTP 2 right before this album and this album was such a refreshing and pleasant change after it that I might be a bit more favorable. \\"Driving with my eyes closed\\" is a bit too screamo for me but it is fun lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner","review":"Sometimes you are just pleasantly surprised by something you purchase; and this is one of those times. We buy anything JLT or Glenn Hughes puts out before previewing the album, and have never been disappointed, but JLT is truly a magnificent disc!!

Osmotics does not. It really helps with thinning hair and lives up to its claims. I have a rare auto-immune disease and it can flare up in a number of ways. When I was going through a dermatology crisis that effected my scalp I experienced some upsetting hair thinning. This serum got me through and really helped by deterring hair loss and making my scalp healthier. I was also taking medication but this gave me the boost I needed. You do have to use it once a day and it is fairly expensive but when your hair is acting up you'll try anything. I would recommend you try this if needed. It works. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's pricey and doesn't last long. But I noticed a real difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful jazz album","review":"As the title of the album suggest, Jay Flippin and Gordon Towell have been friends both personally and muiscally for a while and when you hear the music on this CD that fact becomes even more evident. The two complement eachother so well and play with a shared intuition that can only come about from years of experience and playing together. With a mixture of standards and originals by both Jay and Gordon the album not only showcases the wonderful playing of the two but also their compositional skills. All of the music on this album is beautiful straight-ahead jazz from the hearts of 2 masters of the art.

His ability to blend musical styles; add sexuality, sensuality, and humor; and innovate, innovate, innovate made him my favorite musician. I tracked every song down I possibly could, even those given (sold) to other artists. Since Come, he has repeatedly fallen down, and failed to come close to his former genius. Please, please please... do not buy an album by \\"The Artist\\" if you are looking for the best of Prince. Around the World in A Day and Lovesexy are easily his best recordings. Obviously when \\"Prince\\" died, he took his talent and sense of humor with him.

But the Artist really became a superstar with 1999, Purple Rain and Sign or the Times!

As a long-time fan (almost 18 years), I was disheartened to listen to this album. Where is the soul? Perhaps covered up by the new power. Where is the melody? It seems that Prince's recent fixation with hip-hop is destined to limit his strengths - his beautiful voice and virtuoso guitar. I am saddened to see one of the greatest musicians of our time go the way of mediocrity. Prince seems to be more concerned about getting the legal rights to his old music, than in making new music for the ages. Let us hope that 1999 will bring revelation (or Revolution) to the Artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Powerful","review":"Newpower Soul finds Prince trying to get back to his funky roots, but also trying to update his sound by adding sampling and rapping.

This one really is for the diehards (like me!) only.PS. If you wanna check out some quality post-\\"Diamonds & Pearls\\" stuff by the Purple One, I would invest in \\"The Gold Experience\\", his most satisfying 90's collection or check out his latest, \\"The Rainbow Children\\" - a startling return to something approaching Prince form."},{"rating":"2","title":"precursor to radioactive-funk!!!","review":"this album is an attempt by the artist to reach a new audience yet keep another...this work is good for fans...funk is what we need!!!please send more.."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is very funky and fresh","review":"The Artist and the NPG really no how to lay down in your face fresh funk.

For those who have listened to the \\"Artist\\" as long as I have the \\"Newpower Soul\\" CD was very refreshing. Although it did not contain the soul searching songs of a \\"Sign Of The Times\\", it did have a few mind bogglers. The \\"Artist\\" revisited his on going saga with his former record compamy in the ear tugging cut \\"Mad Sex\\". Then just to show us all that funk is not dead, he hit us with \\"Push It Up\\".

First time ever I had purchased a book with a mega pugbishing error. So I give \\"One Star\\" for Berkely Publishing and Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's face it - a bad book","review":"I have no doubt that Joe Haldeman is a great guy, but this book is a stinker. The individual 20th century scenes are fine, but the overall story goes nowhere, and the technobabble is laughable. The (lack of an) ending is particularly irritating also.I have to complain about the refueling scene near the beginning of the book... the justification given for sending fuel in separate ships makes no sense, the writing is dull, and nothing happens. It adds nothing but padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by a cop-out ending","review":"As you'll read in the more positive reviews of this book, most of it is an enjoyable exploration of an interesting world, with decently developed characters, an intriguing history, some rather engrossing puzzles. Then in literally the last five pages Haldeman essentially throws it all away, with an ending so bad, so abrupt, so self-denying, that it reaches back and sucks most of the interest out of the earlier narrative. Not only are we not going to get the answers to the various puzzles, but the puzzles themselves might not really have existed at all. Or something.Not recommended, unless you must read everything he's ever written. Or if you can stop just before the end, and finish it better yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started slow, ended predictibly","review":"I had a hard time caring about the parts of the book that were spent in the \\"time machine.\\" I mean, what was the point? They were just like when someone tells you about a dream that they had. So what?The book didn't get interesting until about 100 pages into the story.Then the ending was rather predictible. This was readable, but left me feeling like I had wasted my time reading it. That gets it two stars from me. Because some books just aren't even readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I rate this 1 star because normally I can finish a book (unless it is the Da Vinci Code). This boring meaningless wander into nowhere left me grasping for a reason for it being written and to find any sympathy with the characters.I read about two-thirds and just had to give up. He might be an award winning novelist, but not with this dross. I never liked the later Star Trek incarnations particularly because of the Holodeck (you can do anything to fill up time, create any sort of maladventure) and basically that's what this novel is.I didn't get from other reviews that it's ALL about virtual reality, and that the space ship part has hardly any relevance to the story (at least as much as I read).Boring, meaningless, and I couldn't get into the characters (BTW, they can change sex at will as well - Jeez!).Some of my SF muscle has been used up for nothing :o("},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing ending","review":"I'm glad I picked this up at the library rather than spending my own money on it. _Old Twentieth_ starts off with a gripping beginning to an interesting plot (outlined below by numerous reviewers) and the book has some good twists. But the ending left me furious. The teaser on the cover of the paperback edition advertises a great twist at the end.(((SPOILER ALERT))))At least one reviewer below notes that the great twist is similar to a certain Keanu Reeves movie trilogy. This book is more than similar - it mimics the trilogy flat out! A machine controls the humans in stasis, providing a series of complex virtual reality images to their brains as they travel through space until one human (again) realizes what is happening and the machine resets everyone's internal storyline back to a shared point in the past. Worst of all, this book was published in 2005, well after the aforementioned movie trilogy appeared. Didn't anyone else see the similarities?Thoroughly disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"was very slow","review":"The story was very slow, I had to push myself to keep reading and not abandon it. It finally got more interesting & picked up a little further than the half-way mark. Though it finished better than it started, I'd rather have read something else. Oh, and something else I don't like about Haldeman's books - he always has to have sex in them - I do like his writing otherwise. But after two books in a row (Forever war) I've had enough. I like sci-fi for the sci-fi - not for some author to try and titillate me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and fun to use","review":"I bought 3 decks: Exotic birds, Sea & Coastal birds, and Garden birds.

This volume can be seen as a very careful argument on the nature of aesthetics. However, Alexander is aiming higher than just breaking new ground in understand aesthetics. He sees the subject as being inextricably linked with the nature of life itself.This is a book people may well be studying two hundred years hence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlos Castaneda meets Architecture","review":"Having read three out of the four books in this series so far, all I can say is that if you are interested in arbitrary and very personal pseudo-metaphysical remarks about architecture, this is a sort of must-read for you.Do not expect however to find the teachings of a guru at all. It is more like a collection of simplistic gut feelings for architects and designers avid for incense and self-help manuals.These books read like extracts from a personal new-age diary. Read while listening to a Cafe del Mar CD.For all the great existing philosophical and metaphysical ideas on Architecture, the two most extraordinary things about these books are the extremely poor quality of the photographs of Alexander's own work and the exaggerated reviews it is rapidly accumulating in certain circles.If you are really interested in the topics which the title of this book implies, keep away from it and head to Derrida, Deleuze, Moles and keep going from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon L.

I realize there are some terrible men out there, but this books generalizes that all men whose wives have bailed out are abusive. This book is degrading to men. That's what happens when you try to fit all men into the same mold (or all women). Most men aren't villians, most women aren't victims. I'm tired of these so called Psychologists/Professionals making it out so. People have to remember: The only people who go to shrinks are people in desperate situations.

He points out that Jesus spent far more time healing the sick and wounded than calling sinners to repentance. It requires his whole book to develop the concepts of guilt, shame, anger, justice, confession, reconciliation etc. Even those with theological training will find these discussions inspiring, and useful.This book properly belongs under the head of practical theology. It is a masterful synthesis of wisdom and revelation. The understandings are basic to effective pastoral ministry whether one is involved in the task of proclamation or of personal work and counseling.I highly recommend this book to anyone involved in Christian ministry. The principles are universal and need to be adapted to children's ministries, family ministries, youth ministry, church polity, evangelism etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I wish it was longer.

May be more fun online but the storyline part of the game is way to short. And it seems as the higher you get the worse your car's handling becomes. Blacklist was ten times better and Underground 2 was 5 times better. There are a decent amount of cars and customization but the gameplay is really lost in this one. The idea for Carbon Canyon was good but I find that there are certain aspects of the canyon that are just stupid. If you skip a race and come back to it later they still have the same car and if you are driving a Lamborghini you can not overtake them. And they never crash off the cliff and you cannot make them crash. When playing in co op mode half the time in the upper levels my team-mates cost me races by stopping in front of me or by taking short cuts that get me hit by other cars or the short cut slows me down.

I needed the rest, too. Recently married with a new baby, he just wouldn't leave the case alone. This drove his partner and wife to distraction. Yet, this doggedness results in the crime being solved. This is a wonderful debut novel. The characters are complex, the mystery seems baffling and the suspects are plentiful. The plot does chase some red herrings, which is fair, but there is none of the often found solutions in new mysteries - the detective learns something that we, the reader does not. That is unfair. Fortunately, this is not the case in this mystery. The clues are laid out for us, just as Insp. Green gets them. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother reading it.","review":"This book started out very boring.

So I sent the earrings back with a picture of the earrings that I had ordered. Finally someone got back to me in the mean time and said they would look into it. After a week, I wrote again stating that I hadn't heard anything and wanted to know what was going on. The reply was that if the earrings were in stock they would be sent to me and if not my credit card would be refunded. After a few days, I got an email from the same person stating that my earring would be shipped that day. A little over a week later, I got an email stating that my credit card has been reimbursed.

I was almost at the point of giving up hope altogether... then I purchased this book on a whim, after reading a recommendation of it by an on-line sex therapist. Let me say I have NO regrets!! It was one of the best buys of my life.The style is easy to understand and the tone is compassionate; but it is not patronizing, like some other self-help books can be. On the contrary, I found it to be quite educational. I have learnt a great deal about relationships and dealing with my emotional baggage, in addition to all the detailed stuff about my physiology and how to press the right buttons.On the whole, this book has boosted my confidence in the bedroom ten-fold. To anyone who has problems achieving the big 'O', I couldn't recommend it more. Ten thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for most women, beware!","review":"I got this book hoping it would have some new insight and excersises to help me reach orgasm more frequently with my lover. However, I soon discovered everything in the book had already been thought of. You see, this book is aimed at women who have NEVER ever had an orgasm before in their lives, at women who are afraid to look at or touch themselves, at extremely religious couples who need to be TOLD to loosen up, and so forth. It just wasn't for me, and it isn't for most of you who are seeking more fulfillment in your sex lives. Secondly, the illustrations are drawn by a man, and they look more like bimbo models. I'm sure he enjoyed being paid to draw masturbating women. The pictures are not helpful, they're offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medically Correct","review":"What I appreciated most about this book was that it was NOT pornography in disguise. Most sexual 'how to' and self help books can be quite degrading, graphic, or base. This is a text book. These two doctors know their stuff and went to great lenghts to write medically accurate and proffionally. (Still, I got a giggle that the doctor's last name is Heiman.)I like the fact that this book doesn't have a right way, only way, or quick fix formula. It helps one explore all possiblities for sexual dysfunction and helps the woman better unstand her dysfunction.The tone of this book is very encourageing- just what women need to hear, that your problem does not isolate you or make you different.

Make Love! is what Bruce himself calls an auto-biographical novel. This book is about him, in his own life, but most of the events never happened. This is what makes this read fun. It is a \\"what-if\\" kind of book. However, unlike Chins, this book is mostly just for fans. If you are unfamiliar with his work, you may find this book to be \\"uninteresting\\" to say the least. Although, even being the mild Campbell fan that I am, I still found this a joyful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off par from its predecessor","review":"I tried Bruce, I really tried. There is a parallel between this work and his old pal Raimi's film \\"Army of Darkness.\\" Both had that type of unexpected success with previous attempts at their craft, unfortunately further attempts to capitalize on that success fell short. I don't wish to be critical of those that enjoyed the aforementioned, but high expectations have a way of making an otherwise lukewarm piece seem that much more disappointing. I'm a Bruce fan and this book is a must have for any of you wishing to delve deeper into all that is our favorite, unsung and oft neglected Hollywood hero. However, caveat emptor; especially if you're searching for that groovy sentiment we've all felt before."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't really want fiction from BC","review":"Bruce Campbell still rules, but the book is cheesy in more than a passage.

I had high hopes for it after reading his thoroughly entertaining and interesting autobiography 'If Chins Could Kill.'Page after page after page was so cringe-worthy that after a hundred pages I realized I was still waiting for it to get good - to get funny - to get entertaining. Well, a hundred pages is my limit Bruce. I just dont have that kind of time to waste.Bottomline: There's barely a coherent storyline. The laughs are nonexistant. And the writing style is along the lines of a Curious George story.

He should stick to non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, and so silly","review":"This story is not a true tale, as was Bruce Campbell's first book, 'If Chins Could Kill,' rather, it tells a story that might happen, were Bruce to try to make an A-list film. Quirky highjinks and utter disasters occur as Bruce's B-movie 'curse' infests and destroys the whole production. Injected with a heavy dose of Campbell's off-beat humor, and helped along by a series of strange, definately photoshopped pictures, this book manages to be hilarious while, at the same time, nearly believable. This is a must for all Bruce Campbell fans, and those people who just want something entertainingly ridiculous to read on a plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Book","review":"Funny Guy, liked him from Burn Notice, and never knew he was in so many films.

With the extra attraction of photo-manipulated illustrations that seem quite homemade and lame. And a poster-sized typeface that made me double-check to see if I'd accidentally gotten the large-print edition. If you are a die-hard fan of this actor, you could probably justify the purchase of this book, but for the merely curious, check the library or wait for a possible softcover edition--it isn't worth the money in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down after Bruce's forst book was so great...","review":"This book is akin to really bad fanfic, with the author inserting himself into fictional events that just don't gel. I slogged through this snore fest for about a third of the way before I just gave up. It was NOT funny. Bruce's life, career, and his experience in the business are fascinating.

Unlike the Draka, who are cartoonish, the Chosen are much more believable as a totalitarian warrior caste complete with the inherent weakness of such regimes. The Santander Republic is also believeable and shows the good and bad of a free society going to war.The bad news: There are still the excessivly cute references (PT109 being rammed & \\"Gridley\\", for instance) that jar from the story by reminding of the authors presence. And a lot of the technological details get glossed over. How BIG are those airships anyway???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine read...","review":"I'm a fan of Stirling's for the chief reason he, like a handful of other military sci fi writers(Pournelle and Turtledove chiefly) write convincingly. I was disappointed by the Draka series not because of the eventual outcome but by the one sidedness of the conflict. The Draka were so much more advanced ALWAYS that it became a joke. The Chosen however set a stage between two opponents that were far more realistic with strengths AND weaknesses which the Draka series didn't have. At least the serfs showed up as real people not just household artifacs. Also it is not so technology driven to abstraction as the lopsided Draka series was. The Navy actually had an important part in the book too. I have always enjoyed reading of the 20s/30s time frame anyway and the Chosen played that up well. It had it's cutsey parts which detracted from the book but that was minor. I too would have liked to see more character development but it was a fine read and throughly enjoyable overall...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother ordering this book from Amazon","review":"Just a warning that while it says it ships in 1 to 3 weeks, I have had an order for this book outstanding for over 8 months (since August 2005) and still no sign of it ever shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"35ft vac hose","review":"We needed 5 more feet of vac hose that Nutone could not provide.

The book is aranged by chapters according to the type of mate (bank rank mate, queen mate, rook mate ect). The problem with this mates in two are mixed with mates in ten. So you never know the diifuculty of the current problem your trying to solve. The diagrams are very unclear they happen to be the old drawn out stlye so its hard to tell the diiference between black and white pieces.

Unfortunately this is all the book does. There is very little text to support anything, just a brief overview of what type of checkmate that each chapter is going to cover. There is no text to support any of the solutions just notation on how they do it. The actual physical quality of the book I received is horrible. By page 12, 3 pages had fallen out of the front of the book and 2 from the back. The reason the pages in the back of the book are falling out is because you have to keep going to the back of the book to see the solutions to the checkmates. I have not been rough on this book at all, and in fact it is still in good condition except that the pages are all falling out.

The Polish officer is a very believable look at the travails of a WW2 spy. He gives you a real feel for the constant pressure of living under cover, and in my view, does a great job of characterization. My only quibble with the book (and what keeps it from receiving 5 stars, is that it just sort of dribbles to a close.

With each episode tending to be more gloomy than the last, you can't help but appreciate the authenticity of it all. Occasional reprieves and periodic victories from a slowly emergent resistance provide some relief, making the story so compelling that putting it aside is almost as difficult as the struggles recounted within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wartime suspense and romance.","review":"A most interesting novel about a time when the world was very different. There is a good amount of history as a basis for the work and the story line is skillfully intertwined with actual historical events.

As always, his tremendous knowledge of the era is on display, as well as great descriptive writing. You really feel the bite of the wind in the Polish forests in winter. And there's always a phrase or two that makes you say, \\"That's it exactly.\\" For me it de Milja's describing the Germans as \\"War's own children.\\" Perfect !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal of behind the scenes WWII resistance","review":"Not Furst's best novel, but a very enjoyable expose of the drama behind the front lines during WWII. The Polish officer in question goes through Europe doing his spycraft and the reader gets a good overview of what was going on in the Resistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Polish Officer","review":"Had read another novel by Furst and enjoyed it. Tried The Polish Officer, did not finish it. Found it tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort but flawed","review":"Like most who have read Alan Furst's books I was captivated by his prose and his character development.Where he lost me was having the RAF flying Lancaster bombers in the fall of 1940. No doubt the late Roy Chadwick who developed the Lancaster is turning in his grave as the Lanc's first test flight in January of 1941 and it did not fly operationally until 1942.Furst is often given praise for his research but this blunder is something that should not have happened"},{"rating":"2","title":"weaker than the others in series","review":"This book is a standout considering the average level, however, Alan Furst can do much better.Also, there is an annoying trickle of minor errors in environment: Makarov is a post-war automatic, there were not that many jeeps in England in October 1941, there were no organized Soviet partisans in Western Ukraine until 1942 and no organized Soviet partisans in October of 1941 at all, hence, there were no anti-partisan forces with tanks, PPD is pronounced \\"pepede\\" (not \\"pepepcha\\"), and production of \\"pepechas\\" was just barely staring at the time etc. etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Huh?\\" Ending","review":"This is one of those books where you get suddenly to the end and gasp \\"Huh?!\\" I didn't see an end coming at all, and what a let-down when it did. I listened to the audio version of this book and was never very engaged by this novel (perhaps I was distracted?). The subject is interesting and educational, but I didn't get a sense of direction for this book other than a Polish officer who goes around fighting the Nazis while snagging \\"quality time\\" with women along the way. In the end, this book just didn't do it for me, and I would avoid further Durst novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just did not like it","review":"I just didn't like this book.

This doll does nothing. Just a lump of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes straight to the top of the list","review":"I've been buying recordings of Pines/Fountains since about 1950 and must have twelve of them. This one goes straight to the top of the list, although I wouldn't want to give up those of Munch, Bernstein, Toscanini. This Cincinnati orchestra is an unknown treasure. The very soloistic music is amazingly served by the Cincinnati principals (I'd like to single out the solo clarinet, English horn, and trumpet), the string section (shades of the old Philadelphia Orchestra!) is especially rich, and Lopez-Cobos's tempi are very well-judged. The Metamorphoseon is like a 25-minute Concerto for Orchestra where the orchestra and its soloists continually shine. Telarc's recording puts this at the top of the class acoustically as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Both sonically and artistically a masterpiece from one of the world's great orchestral ensembles. Destined to be regarded as one of the finest stereophonic recordings ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sonics, average performance","review":"Soniclly, Telarc has done its usual excelent job of providing a near-perfect (for CD)recording. The performance, however, was just average. While 'Pines' was adequate, I found 'Fountains' to be somewhat flat and lacking in emotion. Having said that, I still recommend this album for the sheer sonic pleasure of listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"One thing this release has going for it is very good audio engineering. The recording has great dynamic impact, very natural tonal balance (firm low bass, strings and brass appropriately bright) very good imaging). However I'm afraid I don't find Lopez-Cobos's interpretation of this music to be utterly compelling. This is not music that profits from an understated reading. I would say this effort compares very unfavorably with the best known interpretations, such as Maazel's brilliant recordings with Cleveland and with Pittsburgh, Karajan's Richly evocative Berlin recording or Reiner's tour de force with Chicago. So much for the Respighi warhorses. As for the \\"Metamorphosoen\\" that rounds out this release, I would say its obscurity is well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"I have always enjoyed listening to Bobbie Nelson's piano in the background on Willie's music. This CD is a wonderful - I haven't removed it from my car CD player since it arrived. Her piano version of \\"Crazy\\" is incredible. Other highlights are \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Laura\\". This is also great traveling music, as her honky-tonk piano makes you want to hit the road. There are also 2 new songs from Willie you won't want to miss.

It features some great music on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hold off, you NEED this disc!","review":"OK, imagine that the Beatles started out in the late '80s as a country band. That gives you a HINT of what F&L were like at their best. Radney Foster (lead vox, main songwriter) was pure Texas, Bill Lloyd (guitar whiz, hook maestro, and singer-writer)added the yummy mix of almost-cliche'd cowtown country riffs and British invasion feel. They could pay homage to the past, but they weren't simply 'retro' or redundant--these guys were crafty songwriters who knew how to do things right, and did it with a smile for everyone to boot. These songs come from that heady 5-year period that included Desert Rose Band, Highway 101, Dwight Yoakam, Steve Earle... Too pop for Nashville and too country for pop radio (back then), don't miss out on F&L now, like radio did a decade ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for covering a port-wine stain birthmark!!!","review":"I have been using Dermablend for years and there is NOTHING that I have found to be even close in comparison to this product. If you take the time to find the right color for your skin, you will get excellent coverage. To find the color that is best for you, you may wish to visit a large department store, like JcPenneys or Dillards, that carries this product in stock. The associates working at the make-up counters will help you find the right color. Once, you know your color, you can buy Dermablend online and use it without a problem. My birthmark is called a port-wine stain and covers nearly half of one side of my face. It's bascially a deep, dark purplish red color. Dermablend successfully covers it! People that I know are always shocked to find out that I have a birthmark on my face, especially once I tell them how much of my face it covers. This product works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same thing as Cheap Concealer Sticks","review":"This was a big disappointment to me. It is the same stuff as the cheap sticks you can buy anywhere- the greasy stuff. If you put on a little, it is okay for awhile in certain lighting.

Also, do remember that only the slightest amount of cream is necessary.We like to use it to erase a small redness that occurs from time to time, while a friend wouldn't be without it to cover a recent scar.

Not to mention messy and time-consuming.However, I could deal with all this this if it actually worked like it was supposed to.

I'll have to wait until I get a bit tanned in summer for the colour to be perfect.This one is excellent for scars, spots and pimples.

I tried the venerable Hohner Special--not bad. I tried a Marine Band version and then tried a Lee Oskar. The light plastic frame, the ease of \\"bending\\" a note and the fluid transition from note to note make this my choice of harp. The Lee Oskars are not commonly found in local music stores, so it's wonderful to have a place to order them. You need several harps--because diatonic harmonicas are tuned to a key and then, if played \\"cross harp\\" are really in the key up a fifth from the listed key. Anyway, you need a C, a D, an F and a G usually and an A is not bad to have, either. These are nice little harps.

Finally, the clock face is backlit, but ONLY if you depress the backlight button, then the backlight illuminates for about 2 seconds. Unfortunately, if you need the backlight, the tiny button is too small to find in the dark. This might be a good clock for a traveler - it is relatively compact and lightweight, and was clearly designed to be used with batteries.

Ironically, the two songs that I enjoy from the CD are the 'inspired by' selections (Anjelique Kidjo's rendition of \\"We Are One\\", and a song that is mysteriosly attributed to Lebo M, \\"I Want to See the Moon\\" (Lebo is nowhere to be found in the song, save far in the background near the end).Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride","review":"This book was not what I expected... but in a good way.

And by the end, how happy I was that I'd not spent a penny on it. This is, quite possibly, one of the worst books I've ever read. The protagonist is a selfish, vain, hateful girl who -- I would assume -- the reader is supposed to sympathize with. Everything she does -- every horrible, malicious thing -- is purely for her own pleasure, and to advance her own status. Never once does she think of anybody else as anything other than a stepping stone, and abuses everybody she comes in contact with and then cries out to the universe for pity on her.I seriously only read this book to the end in the hope that when I got there, I'd get to see the protagonist die a horrible death."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is filthy!","review":"I have read many of Philippa Gregory's books and enjoyed them all, until this one.

The characters kept having the same conversations over and over. Not much here but sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why, why did she write this ending?","review":"I absolutely adored The Other Boleyn Girl, and I finished The Constant Princess in a few very looong nights. Perhaps it was foolish of me to assume that this book would be as amazing as the others, but when I was finished I was angry that I had devoted so much time to a novel that was not only slow, it had terrible resolution. Really, there's not much to recommend about this novel.

It was so bleak and discouraging that I didn't even want to put in a yard sale. It was so depressing that I felt compelled to write about my feelings before someone else read it without warning. I have read many other books written by Philippa Gregory they were all insightful and intelligent. The main character Alys is not a female character that I would like my students to explore as she is so weak and her choices mere reactions to her circumstances. She is a puppet to the whims of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"The only other Gregory book I have read was Respectable Trade, which I enjoyed and thought was well written. I chose Wise Woman because of the subject matter, it sounded intriguing. The writing was awful. I mean, the story is supposed to take place in England in the time of Henry VIII. Did they really use expressions like \\"he was hot for the wench?\\" It would be laughable if it wasn't so sad.

I agree that Alys is not a likable character, even thought she kind of redeems herself (in my eyes) at the end. The sex scenes and witchcraft is so twisted that it gave me the heebie-jeebies. However, I think it was necessary to create the plot, and make Alys' story unfold into one of desperation and regret. Gregory does a good job in making this crazy story work and showing us inside the character's minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I love philippa gregory's books and bought this one to tide me over until the white princess is released. It was okay for the first third, bad for the second third, and terrible for the last.

Alys lost my sympathy somewhere along the way, and when you can't root for your \\"protagonist\\" anymore, you know something has gone a bit wrong. I wasn't even able to finish this book all the way. I began to skip around and eventually just read the ending because I lost interest.Let me just say that I am an avid reader and pretty much always finish a book I'm reading.

I agree with everything here; not a character you like, a totally unsatisfying ending, although, if you make it to the end, you won't care. Even the sex was weird and blah. The worst book I have read in years. AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she go on an extended vacation?","review":"I would not recommend, and I have read the Philippa Gregory Henry the VIII series, to the point I could not wait until they were published.I was angry when I finished this book because I made myself read it despite the idiotic twists and turns. I cannot believe Philippa Gregory herself wrote this book. She had to have had someone else write it. It is awful. No one with an ounce of talent, and this includes Ms. Gregory, had anything to do with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I own all of Gregory's books and have enjoyed her genre for a long time. But this book was chore to read--too dark and without any break in the portrayal of evil. I found no character that I could relate to or cheer on. Very disappointing. The unrelenting engagement in evil left me exhausted and rather disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witches Spells Ambition","review":"A story full of twists and emotions. Pity, anger, lust and love.

For me, this particular book was hard to follow and very confusing, even more so than some of her other books. I will keep this book in the library to complete my set but most likely will not read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading several of Gregory's other novels, The Wise Woman was disappointing.

And as I like to read books over and over again I never give them away. I was so disappointed in this one that I sold it in a garage sale as a protest as to how bad it was. The characters were not belivable, their was no sympathy or understanding for the main character and dark is not the word I would use (as I am also a Stephen King fan). It was just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gregory's Best","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed several of Philippa Gregory's novels. However, I did not like this one. It started out interesting enough, but just got weird. When I finished this book, I just shrugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've read other Philippa Gregory books and found them extremely well written. But this one was very disappointing in the fact that she goes far beyond anything that could be called reality. I like to read things that at least \\"could\\" have been true for that time period. This was NOT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, creepy and gross - not the usual Phillipa Gregory","review":"Having read many Phillipa Gregory books, I decided to give The Wise Woman a try - I am so sorry I did. It was just plain gross. It is full of witchcraft, weird graphic descriptions, and gratuitous sex. Come on, Phillipa Gregory, you are much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Philippa Gregory really write this book?","review":"I have read almost every book that Philippa Gregory has written and I know that she has dealt with some rather dark themes in some her novels like Wideacre. I am all for authors seeking to plumb the depths of the human psyche, but I am at a loss as to why the author thought this book was worth the effort of writing. I say effort because it seemed to me that Ms. Gregory was trying really hard to complete this text out of obligation rather than for the sheer joy of writing it. Some of the text seemed forced and the plot bordered at times on very bad romantic fiction. Honestly, I barely got half way through the novel, before I got sick of the lead character and her odd voodoo candles."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've read almost everything she's written and loved every one of them.

This was pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Oregon","review":"What a disappointment! I am a big fan of Gregory's work and have read most of her other books. This one, however, delved into the occult in a sickening way. Unlike \\"The White Queen,\\" which makes the supernatural a beautiful, mystical background, this one left me disgusted and shocked. I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually recycled this book with my daily newspaper!","review":"I have never read a book that I wouldn't, at least, put on the bookshelf at my beach home for someone to enjoy... even books that I did not enjoy. This is the first exception and it is possibly be the worst book I've ever read.I am a huge Philippa Gregory fan, having read most of what she has written. This book is uninteresting, has unsympathetic characters and is really poorly written. I did finish it by skimming through the last 150 pages because I assumed that Gregory would redeem herself somehow. She didn't.Read any other Gregory book, but skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have kept this on the \\"out of print\\" list","review":"I mistakeningly bought this thinking it was a \\"new\\" Gregory novel. Then I looked at the copyright date and discovered this was one of her earliest. It should have been left on the out of print list rather than being resurrected. The book drones on and on, often using nearly identical sentences and phrases -- poor job on the part of the editors. The book could easily be 50 pages shorter. It is so unrealistic, the characters are uninspiring and dull. I loathed continuing the read but kept hoping it would get better. My husband usually reads the Gregory books and I told him to not waste his time with this one. Such a disappointment compared to her other fantastic novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not So Wise Woman","review":"I am generally a fan of Philippa Gregory and have enjoyed reading her historical fiction as great vacation escape novels. However, The Wise Woman left me wondering if it was, indeed, written by the same author. In addition to having an extremely contrived plot, a totally anticipated ending and some fairly twisted horror, this book had no redeeming characters. There was not one character in this entire novel I was rooting for and there were several times I toyed with simply closing the book and walking away out of total apathy for the outcome. I continued to the end simply to make sure my earlier assessment wasn't incorrect. But, having finished this total miss on Gregory's part, I have to say this time the author was unwise and so was I to spend time reading it! Perhaps the fact that it was an earlier effort had something to do with the undeveloped characters who all turned out to be despicable folks. By the end, who cared what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be a fool - avoid The Wise Woman","review":"I normally enjoy this author's novels, but this one was too weird for me.

I have read all her books and this one was not anywhere near as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A friend told me Gregory's work was good historical fiction but it is not!This is just a Jackie Collins novel set in medieval England. Not only that, the \\"wise woman\\" is obviously based on a curious mix of traditional stereotypes of a witch and new-age info. Why go into details about the clothing and food and then appear to get your occult information from a Dennis Wheatley novel?Not one of the characters is either interesting or likable. Worse still, you don't even hate them, you just end up not caring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan this time","review":"I love Philippa Gregory books and am a huge fan of her royal historical fiction novels. This one seemed much too inconsistent and slow-paced in comparison to the other ones. I detested Alys and found her incredibly unrealistic and outright crazy. I had much more sympathy for the so-called villains of the novel and by the end of the novel was glad to have been rid of Alys' story. It's a shame I feel this way about this book; I hope her other books I haven't read yet will not disappoint as this one has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Philippa Gregory's Best Work","review":"I am a huge Philippa Gregory fan and have enjoyed all of her \\"queen of England\\" novels, so I was totally prepared to like this novel, too. Unfortunately, \\"The Wise Woman\\" is not one of her best works. In other Gregory works where the main character is less than sympathetic, her incredibly story-telling still captivates one - a prime example is \\"The Red Queen.\\" Unfortunately in this case, neither the characters nor the story are engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel about gay youth","review":"There are two books in gay romance fiction that I consider to be the Holy Grails of that genre: E.M. Forster's \\"Maurice\\" and Patricia Nell Warren's \\"The Front Runner.\\" All other gay romance novels, whether they are \\"coming out\\" stories or not, must be weighed against those two stupendous novels.Cody is not either, but it is certainly a worthy, well-written, and believable romance. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and found them real and believable. Oddly, I found myself recapturing my own youth while reading the book, because so much of the story rang true to my own experiences. This is not one of the most multi-layered character driven novels I've ever read, no. It's a very good quick read though and one I do recommend. The ending is definitely not predictable and THAT alone is worth spending a couple of hours getting to know these engaging characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, irreverent, thought provoking, heart breaking","review":"From page one, we grow to love \\"Trotsky,\\" (the narrarrator.)

The characters felt so real, you were happy with them, sad with them. The progression of Trotsky and Cody's relationship from just friends to something romantic was very realistic, and sweet. I don't want to spoil the ending, all I can say is that I cried when I was done reading it! The book isn't cheesy or anything, and I couldn't put it down until I was finished with it. I can't stress enough, the characters are definately the best thing about this book. You feel their pain, you cheer for them, you feel like you've known them for ever. This is such a great book, just read it already! It deserves much more recognition than it has. One of my favorite books of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This is a impressive story. Trotsky, Cody, his friends, his brother Freddy, Mark and trotsky's and Freddy's mom: all together in a story mainly about feelings. Impressive, powerful and painful.

All the tropes were there and they were interestingly, entertainingly done. I loved the characters, and the way the author wrote and the \\"voice\\" of the book.It was more than just a \\"gay coming of age\\" story and it rose above my expectations. I've grown used to a rather low bar when it comes to a lot of \\"gay\\" fiction and this is a good book regardless of the sexuality of the characters in it.I'm not expressing myself well. I've only just finished it. I already want to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I hate criticizing anything that could possibly be a beloved piece of work. But I must warn you: you might not like this book. Certain people certainly do--if you agree with its particular kind of existential philosophy and admire the kind of youngsters Trotsky and Cody are, notebook-scribbling free thinkers--then gay or straight you will probably appreciate this novel. If not, then stay away.

I found myself continually trying to find free time to absorb myself in the story, because it is so enthralling. Uris's character development is the strongest aspect of the book - the reader truly begins to KNOW the marines in the story.

Go back and get Summer Lights, Blue Moon, or Home Fires, then come back to this selection. Georgie needs the therapists couch and quick, or Nick will be looking for greener pastures. There were many sections when I'd just shake my head and think, \\"If this were my husband, and I was this neurotic, he wouldn't want to put up with me!\\" What's with cutting the cake during the Fireworks display on the 4th of July?? These women need to get a grasp on reality and learn to deal with change.Now, after writing all that as though these characters were real people (ha) the book had a pretty good flow and kept me reading.

The fact that the men were so willing to give up their own families, and become dependant on their wives family is totally unbelievable, and also have dinner together all the time come on how stupid.

Well I do recommend the author, but not this book don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I like Luanne Rice and have enjoyed her books. This book simply wasn't believable. Yes, you can love your family, but her portrayal of this family was over the top. My mother has dementia and is in an assisted living home. It is a wonderful, compassionate place. Georgie's obsession with her husband and family just got sickening as the book went on. Rushing home from Nick's family to be there to cut some cake wasn't fair to his family. Her other books are much better.

I picked it back up and starting reading it one night when I could not sleep, thinking that it surely would put me to sleep. Wrong! I was so engrossed with seeing Smitty through his bombing missions.

The good thing is that there are a lot of books to read on the subject, unfortunately this is not one of them. While I was very curious about what the author wanted to say, the poor writing style caused me to give up by the end of the first chapter.

This is without doubt one of the best World War II pilot books I have ever read and I have read hundreds of them. The B-17 copilot/author is clearly a very intelligent, gifted writer who must have kept a detailled journal or the equivalent. In a most engaging way, he tells you about his day to day life, as much at the air base or on leave in London chasing girls or enjoying his friends as in the air. But he vividly and comprehensively recreates the life of his ten man crew and his flying job as well as the rest of his fighting the war but living in England on the ground experience.

The book catalogues his combat missions - as well as his off-duty \\"missions\\" when on leave to London and to \\"Flak House\\" in the country on the southwest of London.

The Remaster from 2006 is clearly better sounding than this release. Even when I adjusted the volume of the 2006 remaster and this new version, the 2006 remaster still has a cleaner crisper sound. Warner Brothers also messed up Atlantic Crossing at this time. When they expanded the live album awhile back, they also messed that up. My original had much more punch.

I was looking for an Osprey treatment of the wars centered around the late 1000s in Spain with a particular emphasis on the battles and campaigns of El Cid and the monarchs and rulers he served. What I got instead was a boiled down version of a survey course on Spanish history over three centuries and little mention of the Cid (OK, there's *A* plate of him and his death and a couple of other activities are mentioned in the chronology but since he was the lead in the title I had expected more than that). If you are a historian, avoid this. If you are a wargamer, get it only if you need a few of the illustration plates for the period. I don't really feel like it is worth [what] most people ask for it used.

The themes are similar in some ways to her other novels (cheating husbands and the wives that learn to pick up the pieces of their own lives). This novel is both humerous and heartfelt.The one thing that bugged me (repeatedly) is that the dialogue of the Americans in this book was completely British, save a few obvious American slang words. It's hard for me to believe that this book was editted to retain such British sounding dialogue coming from a 13 year old kid or the American doc. Even the doctor's diagnoses weren't spoken as an American e.g. \\"compulsive obsessive\\" instead of obsessive compulsive.Still, this book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps moving","review":"this is an excellent book and keeps you interested to the final page. i enjoy this writer and will read more and hope to get some on CD for traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airball","review":"The author bravely attempts to bolster Arnold J.

This tool did the trick right out of the box, without the need to buy any accessories. The included flexible shaft was very useful for carving. The quality of the tool and major accessories seemed as good or better than any power tool I've had for under $50. The minor accessories - carving bits and the like - were not high quality, but were useful and met my expectations for the low price point.This tool does not include an adjustable chuck, so it wouldn't be good for jobs that call for frequent swapping of the bit. It's not very powerful so I wouldn't use it for heavy duty work. For shaping pinewood derby cars -- which are about 7 inches long and 3 inches wide -- it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Handyman Tool","review":"I bought this for carving and light grinding/sanding. It works very well on wood and metal, has nice assortment of grinding/cutting/sanding bits and the flex shaft is just great. The edge clamp stand with hanger works well.

Great fun for projects and hobbies. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unit for the price.","review":"I've had this for almost 1 and a half years. I bought it here on Amazon. It works well. I've used it to sand my dogs nails down as he doesn't mind it as much as clipping with the nail clippers. I've also used it to grind down metal nail tips (protruding through wood) and it worked well except the chuck kept on slipping causing the bit to work it's way out. I had to stop every minute or so to push the bit into the chuck and retighten. I ground down about 12 nails in that one use and applied quite a bit of pressure down as I was grinding; it handled it well other than the slipping of the chuck. I've also used it for small jobs such as cutting plastic using the cutting wheel with no problems.It's not clear to me which Dremel tool accessories will work with this. I want to buy a chainsaw chain sharpener attachment that Dremel makes but it's not clear whether the screw on attachment will fit this rotary tool.

With the exception of \\"Too Many F**kers On The Street\\" - which really rocks - this album is just SAD. The other reviews seem to keep saying that the band has grown as songwriters, but it sounds like they've been castrated as songwriters. I've seen this band live many times and they perform high octane, tight, fast and fun garage rock like nobody else. While I can understand a band wanting to spread their wings and try something new, this one is a giant miss.

It is not a pleasant, relaxing experience, nor is it unpleasant, exactly.

This will wake you up in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected but still great.","review":"Well maybe I went into this album thinking the wrong thing. I expected a dark ambient version of Venetian Snares & Hecate's collaboration Nymphomatriarch. Now that I look back, I see that the only thing these two projects have in common is they both extract and manipulate sounds of a sexual experience.While it wasn't what I expected, it is still a very good pick up. It reminds me a lot of Zoviet France as well as some of Lustmord's older works. The unsettling atmosphere created on \\"F...\\" works not only on the conscious level but also the subconscious level which helps to create an almost nightmarish effect on listeners.All in all, a great album and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Cover, It's Not Representative of the Novel","review":"Ignore the cover and the complaints about it. Yes, the COVER is grossly inaccurate, but the NOVEL is a decent work of historical fiction.

Be warned: this is by far the most sympathetic and favorable presentation of the Empress Wu.

In other tracks, she sings with what seems malicious intent. In \\"Lady Scarface\\" [on of my faves] a haunting jazzy song about the seduction of the young and innocent.

Wulfs rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like the setup","review":"Just my opinion, but I hate books where the heroine has a child other than the hero's. I don't like it and I fail to see the romance in it. When the female has just had a baby, I can't imagine that the hero can think of her in a romantic way. And, when the child is someone else's, that goes double. Remember, this is the Regency period. Things like that were not accepted and were certainly not commonplace.

Seventy six days of survival and ingenuity - I found it interesting and inspiring as well as providing a unique perspective on civilized life from the point of view of suddenly having nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Inner Strength to Endure","review":"This book is as inspriing as it is graphic. Callahan provides a very verbose log of his fight to survive. In reading this book you definitely appreciate how remarkable a man he is and how much knowledge as a sea man he had to have in order to survive. Sometimes in reading a tale of survival it is possible to project yourself in the situation and imagine if you would fare as well as the author. After reading this tale, my response most certainly is that I would not. This doesn't make the tale any less exciting to read and gripping to imagine, it simply leads one to further appreciate the remarkable accomplishment of survival by a remarkable man.This story has been presented on TV on Discovery or TLC as well and it is very interesting to get the detail offered in the book that wasn't provided in the TV story. Callahan provides some wonderful drawings and images in his book that add immeasurably to the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a page turner.","review":"This book is an in-depth story of survival and starvation told first-hand by the experienced sailor who lived through a most trying ordeal. I enjoyed the book a lot. Having just previously finished Unbroken (another story of survival against considerable odds) it was inciteful and intriguing to read the similar experiences in the stories (sharks, vivid dreams concerning food etc.). I yanked a star because of the considerable amount of typos in the kindle version (not the author's fault) - a minor distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Pearl recommendation","review":"As a 72 year old woman, I don't usually choose to read macho male adventure books. However, since this one was listed in Nancy Pearl's Book Lust To Go, I checked it out of the library. It was so good that I read it out loud to my husband and he ordered it as a gift for a friend. The author, Steven Callahan, describes in detail his many McGiver-like inventions that saved his life. It was a fascinating and engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"A GOOD READ....I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE WAYS HE \\"RIGGED\\" THINGS UP (EVEN WITH DRAWINGS) BUT FOUND THE BOOK HARD TO PUT DOWN.

How can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and slow","review":"I'm a big a survivalist fan as any, but this story felt like it was just way too padded with fluff. I would guess a good third of the book consists of metaphysical musings, which become tiring when repeated every few pages. There's little room for the actual recount of the trip; this might be understandable given that there are only so many ways you can describe being on a raft for 76 days, but it just means that buyers interested in survival may want to reconsider picking this up. It's as much of a book on psychology and religion as on sailing or extreme situations.Avoid this book and pick up another instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naval Aviation Water Survival Instructor's view","review":"Steven Callahan's story is masterfully told. This was a book I could not put down. As a Naval Water Survival Instructor the knowledge gain by his experience will help me to prepare others who may find themselves in like circumstance.

Completely absorbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Scary Tale At Sea","review":"Steven Callahan is a blessed man. This true story is one of the most harrowing accounts of survival in a truly hopeless situation. He capsizes in minutes in the middle of the night with a raft and not much more. Nobody knows he's missing. No one is looking for him.Told with desperation and some much needed occasional humor, Callahan paints a story so real and frought with fear that you can read it in one sitting. It is difficult to imagine what one would do in a similiar situation and the very thought of it is spine tingling.This is a tale for every person who ever took to the water and every adventurer who feels safe in thier environment. You will never take the ocean for granted again after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring, sorry!","review":"It would have been a nicer book if it had 1/3 of the actual pages; it did bore me. Perhaps the way he writes does not do for me. Very interesting story though, and encouraging all the things he had to do in order to survive, never gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very recommended book","review":"Many of my friends recommend this book to me.I will write more of my experiences after I read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving at all cost","review":"A remarkable tale of disaster and survival over the open ocean. The author loses his sailboat to a nasty storm in an Atlantic crossing and is forced into a life raft and set adrift. The ensuing tale of survival is a testament to the human drive to survive through suffering, pain, starvation and dehydration. The story is well written and gripping, although somewhat repetitive at times. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, But Not as Much as I Had Hoped","review":"In the end, I did eventually thoroughly enjoy Adrift, however, I had to force myself to pick up the book once or twice to finish.I found myself stumbling along through Adrift. Yes, I did enjoy the book, however, a liberal dose of sailing terminology and a stream-of-conscious writing style made the book harder to read than necessary. I am a writer, yet I found myself having to reread passages just to ensure that I had the correct visual image.Much of the book is devoted to technical fixes of gear and his raft; any techies out there will appreciate the appeal to the hacker in all of us.I initially gave the book three stars, but just upgraded it to four. At the price, the book is worth burning through in a couple of nights. If you do any sailing or spend a lot of time on the sea, I highly recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner!!!","review":"I bought this book for my mom to read while she is staying in the hospital to oversee my dad's stay in the hospital after surgery.

As a beginning coastal sailor it was interesting to see the challenges encountered with an ocean passage. However, more important than this, this book showed the strength and determination of the human spirit for survival when encountering unbelievable odds. Added to this is Steven's spiritual bond with the very nature that threatened to take his life. Well written and a must read for the adventurous soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Perfect mix of reflection and action.

I'm torn between wanting to read on and on past my bedtime (uh oh!) or limiting myself to one delightful chapter at a time. If you've ever found a spanking story arousing -- or have wished to be involved in adult spanking -- this is the series for you. The spanking activities and reactions of all involved are quite realistically presented and the characters grow and achieve more depth throughout the series. The author really does understand the female point of view, but I can attest that it comes from his being a wonderfully bright and funny, safe, sane, and consensual, experienced male top who definitely knows how to spank a bottom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Pump","review":"This thing works OK - I bought it for dish soap in my kitchen. Unfortunately, the bottom of it rusts and leaves a nasty stain on my sink. I am buying a stainless steel one to replace it. Don't waste your money on this one unless you like looking at a rust stain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but leaves rust stains on counter","review":"I purchased both the soap pump and the cotton ball holder in this set - together, they look very stylish. Unfortunately, the soap pump developed nasty, encrusted rust along the bottom ridges after about 6 months of infrequent use in a guest bedroom's bathroom. This was visible from the outside and left indelible rust circles on my bathroom counter. Would not buy again. Next time I will look for stainless steel instead of chrome.Note: the cotton ball container did not rust, most likely because it was not being touched by wet hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"The piece looks nice. There are 2 problems with this product.The bottom leaves a terrible rust stain if it gets wet. It is going to get wet since we use it near a sink.For some reason the soap bubbles out of the top of the pump where it screws on. I thought I was overfilling it but it doesn't matter how much soap I put in there. It will leave soap residue all down the side.All in all this is a poor functioning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great story, a very poetic and lovely romance between two great people. Addis and Moira are wonderful characters and two of my favorites of all time in romance. He is a total alpha male- strong, noble, and sexy! He's been through a lot in his life and he is the stronger for it. She is a very kind hearted, warm person who is very loyal and dear. I loved their story and really enjoyed the book. I would have liked to have seen more of when he realized she was the one who cared for him when he was younger, but that's a minor quibble. This is a great book with characters with interesting back stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This was one of the best romances I have had the pleasure of reading.The characters were stubborn, full of pride, and perfectly aware they must be together. Best part of this book; the author took time to give a background on both Addis & Moira, which made you feel you knew them.Yet it was entertwined so well with the ongoing story that there was never a dull moment. Favorite line-\\"I've loved you since I was twelve.\\" One of my all time favorites. Thank you Ms. Hunter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By Possession","review":"I am astounded by the lack of proofreading in the Kindle edition of these books. It looks as if the publisher used a Beta Version of Omnipage, then sent it directly to Kindle without any proofreading whatsoever. Errors abound, leaving the book virtually unreadable!His becomes Bis, / stands in for I, but can also stand in for, \\", three words become one, etc. I thought perhaps that might be the reason the books are somewhat less expensive through Kindle, but then, again, so are the \\"perfect\\" ones.I like Madeline Hunter's stories. I like her plots and (mostly),like her characters, though the female lead in \\"By Arrangement\\" seemed a little prone to getting herself into stupid scrapes. It is a shame that the e-publisher (whoever that might be) cannot publish a book without so many egregious errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"The two characters were likable enough, but the story was just too slow and boring. I didn't feel the heat that I like in a good romance novel. I just wanted it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the exciting title!","review":"I'm afraid that I have to agree with the other one-star reviewer. I didn't enjoy this book, and I just couldn't finish it, despite my best efforts. The beginning was not bad at all...it had potential! The story was different and original. But then, I'm sorry to say, it became UNoriginal and too far-fetched for my liking,(I'm referring to a scene where the hero just happens to come across the heroine about to be gang raped in the woods). From that point the interactions between the hero and heroine became quite dull. They were supposedly in conflict, but actually they seemed to get along quite well and as they spent a lot of time in each other's company, it all became rather boring and pointless. I may be wrong. After all, I didn't finish the book. But, I suspect that this author is simply not to my taste. Different strokes for different folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Had potential, but the way it was written was just flat and boring. Addis was also too...harsh, for me. I don't like Madeline's medieval books. I like her regency ones a lot better. Might be just me, but I'm not fond of medieval times anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uncommon love in a time of turmoil....","review":"By Possession tells the story of an umcommon love between Moira Faulkner who is a serf-born bond woman and Addis de Valence, a crusader knight and Lord of Barrowburgh. After supposedly being dead for 8 years, Addis reappears in Moiras life and everything gets turned upside down. The storyline has everything from battles and wars, and exiled king, enslavement, a childs birth secret, a treacherous brother and wife, to traitors who will try to corrupt Moira and Addis. All the while still keeping the love and passion between them. Nothing is missing from this exhilarating read. The only tiny flay is that I thought the book ended abrubtly but it still has a great ending nonetheless. Overall, By Possession is a freat historical romance that I would recomment for all romance lovers. I definetly give this book 4 1/2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit","review":"Moira and Addis are an incredible couple. Her characters scream at you from the page. Later you go back to the book, because it's so intense. This is not a fluffy, light hearted romp. This is intense and real. You will care about these two even when the book is done. Well written"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely magnificent!!","review":"Boy, can this author write! Wow wow wow! Another powerful story of true love set in the Middle Ages. Addis and Moira are warm, caring people trying to do the best for each other without getting too hurt in the process. They know their place in society and their love wants to break out of those imposed bonds but they know it's \\"not done.\\" A serf does not marry a lord. Their closeness, their friendship, Addis's \\"sense of peace and wholeness\\" whenever he's with Moira just endear them to the reader even more. The end is suspenseful and full of nail-biting action. Altogether a MOST enjoyable read! I can hardly wait for the wonderful character Rhys to have his own story in BY DESIGN, due out next year. Also try her former book BY ARRANGEMENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romance","review":"I loved the interaction between the H and h. They had great chemistry and the authors writing style was very eloquent and descriptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Possession","review":"I do not agree with the low rating some people gave. The book was heart wrenching. Knowing you can only be with the person you love for a couple of months and then have to walk away, because you believe it can never be. He is promised to another. There is no way you can watch him have a family with someone else, even if he loves you, and cares nothing for her. I loved the story and the characters. For those that cry at movies if may make you want to cry. It definitely will be on my reread list. I may have read a couple of her books when I was younger, do not remember, but will be reading some more as I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better..... PASSIONATE, TOUCHING, INTELLIGENT","review":"I bought \\"By Possession\\" several months ago because of the great reviews. It sat on my bookshelf gathering dust because I had \\"more interesting\\" books to read. Boy, was I wrong! It doesn't get much better than this.I normally prefer lighter Regency romances, but the story of Moira and Addis is SO BEAUTIFULLY written. I'm so glad I decided to try something different. Their struggle to come to terms with their feelings, sense of duty, and their respective stations in life, kept me enthralled. I could feel their anguish and intense attraction in my gut.If you're looking for a profound love story with interesting and complex characters, this book is for you. It's dark, but not depressing, and at times funny and uplifting. And NEVER boring.By Possession is an epic love story that you'll want to read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"Wonderful story, beautifully written. Loved the characters, enjoyed every page, couldn't put it down. Can't say enough of good things about this book.

It won't be long before I read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Historical, Good Romance","review":"Hunter's medieval series which includes \\"By Possession\\" is not your average, run-of-the-mill historical romance novel. Hunter provides social, economic, and political backdrop to her storyline that overshadows the efforts of other historical romance writers. This book has more historical meat to it than a lot of other contemporary authors, which is why I read the entire series and enjoyed it. Addis de Valence is a great hero and balances well with low-born Moira.This series is not one of those flowery, easy-read type of romance novels where it's a ton of steamy scenes interwoven with an occasional historical reference. This is a great love story in a turbulent period, with adventure, mystery, suspense, and of course, romance.I am more of a Regency-era type fan, but I was pleasantly surprised with Hunter's efforts.4 stars out of 5, because the book became just a tad bit tedious towards the latter 1/3. But don't let that stop you from reading this great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outsdtanding!","review":"Alan Hovhaness is one of the most amazing composers of the last century.

I dragged my family back into the theatre the next night - age range from 10 to 80 and they all loved it! Haven't seen it since until last night and I was afraid it might be way too dated for my 6 year old grand daughter. The charm was still there! She laughed at all the right parts, asked a ton of questions and my only regret was that I didn't wait another year or two. (I totally forgot about the rebel gunman holding school children hostage during the last half hour and she just started first grade this week!) Nevertheless, she asked to see the movie again sometime soon. Dated yes, but still sweet, innocent, funny and unique. (Wait till they're 8 for the relatively mild violence factor.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, humorous commentary on \\"civilization\\"","review":"I, too hope this movie is re-released. I saw it when it first came out, and recently found it on a shelf of \\"used\\" videos...but it was defective! I'm reluctant to return it though, because I can't seem to find a replacement anywhere else! \\"Gods\\" takes a look at \\"civilization\\" through the eyes of a Kalahari bushman. Very enlightening.

I agree we can learn a lot from the bushmen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not weathered well","review":"I really enjoyed this movie when it was first released.

I always hesitate to try anything commercial made with apples because they often use too much Cinnamon. And when I taste an apple pie or cobbler, I want to taste the crisp, clean taste of apples. This pie filling is great. Not too sweet, nice dominate apple taste and the apple slices are cooked perfectly, not mushy at all. It makes whipping up an apple pie for unexpected guests so easy. I highly recommend this product for their terrific quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely technical sound. Not for everyone.","review":"This band isn't really one I can sink my teeth into. In fact, sometimes everything about Starkweather can get pretty bleak and mediocre. But I feel alot better knowing I gave an underground band a chance. Now I'll admit there's nothing about Starkweather that would make them completely suck. But this band and album is only for the extreme fan of technical, underground and loud-but-not-in-a-good-way type of music. I feel much more comfortable and touched listening to Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Anthrax, Stabbing Westward and Godhead. I would advise anyone buying this album to not grow too attached to Starkweather if they're thinking about it. This band rarely gets along when they're in the studio together and they even admitted publically that they may not be together after their next album. Just a fair warning. However, anyone who can't help but grow close to Starkweather may want to also check out IDK, Coalesce, Wayward Pain, and Gouds Thumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst bok I have ever read.

Woe to the beginner who encounters an error but is inexperienced and thus doesn't recognize it - I predict lots of frogging! I'm far from being a beginner, but I've had to frog twice on one toy!My other complaint is the weird notation, e.g. \\"Inc 1 st in next and 3 foll 3rd row.\\" HUH??

Next project from this book will be the dalmation, changed to blue with white spots. It looks like it will tuck very neatly into my 3-yr-old son's arms.

Although the characters are fictional, they are not unlike the many migrant and seasonal farm workers who have come to Long Island over the decades and shared similar experiences. In all of New York State, Long Island produces the largest amount of money from agriculture-related business. This area has always depended on a large labor force without which its economy would suffer. In this novel, I present a realistic story of struggle, solidarity, frustration and hope.In order to submit this \\"review\\" I had to rate the book.

I remember taking it out of my fathers record collection as a kid and listening to it over and over. I had totally forgotten about it until recently when I rediscovered it while surfing the web. I was totally amazed that it had been remastered and put out on cd and immediately picked it up. Some might find it quite obscure to have in a collection of their own these days but I really think it's worth picking up. One of my favotite songs is by Tompall Glaser called put another log on the fire. As a child I had no understanding of the song but after listening to it again as an adult the meaning was obvious and hilarious. I won't tell it but suggest that you listen for yourself. With classic singers like Willy Nelson and Walyon Jennings on it you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"great selection","review":"I first owned this album back in the late 70's on 8 track, and I have wanted a cd for some time.

Pip first picked up a guitar in 1960's Australia, as therapy for poor hand coordination. Despite the limitations this fact seems to have put on Pip's playing, his guileless strumming and plunking is quite winning, similar in sound, if not technique, to the nascent plinking of such blues legends as Charlie Patton and Blind Willie Johnson. Add to this lyrics both intelligent and cryptic, as well as a certain innocent energy to the music (especially evident in \\"Jumped in My Rowboat\\", \\"My Gal Sal\\", and \\"They Took Us All So Kindly\\"). Devoutly indie and low key, Pip is an unique melding of rudimentary guitar work and childlike lyrics and vocals...and he was one of the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORIZONS","review":"Very compelling material. More in the direction of Free Jazz amd Modern Classical without losing structure and a groove. The drum dynamics in the second track (cowbells + cymbals + drums)is full of ideas, nuances.

This album, a short compilation of her greatest hits, was the album that introduced me to the legend that Hyman was and forever would be. Songs like \\"Gonna Make Changes,\\" and \\"Betcha By Golly Wow,\\" showcase the true vocal talent his singer had. Unlike many of today's soul singers, Hyman's vocals are pure innocence and her style can never be reproduced in today's world of sythesizers and sampling.If you want to discover one of the greatest jazz voices the music world has ever known, then by this album. Let me warn you, that once you have listened to this album, you will be craving more and more of this talented vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"The zipper on this boot is very cheap.

I've often said that DC has done nothing but destroyed everything once great about it's universe and Superman is sadly an example of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite low point in the Superman saga","review":"This was deadend story by a creative team that had run out of ideas after the \\"Death of Superman Story\\". The costume is ugly and the premise is weak. All they really accomplish is make Superman whine alot about not understanding his new powers.

It's a great song and would have been interesting to see if it had made it to the album as a fully finished product. \\"Yer Feet\\" is a live version of the song. It would've been nicer to see a studio version, but I'm not even sure if one exists. All in all, it's a great cd from start to finish, even if it is just 3 tracks.

Although the author obviously has a love of her job, there is not one recount of a positive experience that would explain that love. The reader has to pause in wonder at the author's fear of mice, squirrels, iguanas, and even some cats. If you're a lover of ALL animals, or you if you're looking for advice on how to start or improve your business, you'll find this book seriously lacking in substance. Written in second (yes, second) person, and full of uninspired language wrapped around poor attempts at humor(ie.repeated use of the phrase 'no pun intended'), this is a disappointment by any measure.

I expected to get some insight into the world of pet sitting and unforeseen problems that might occur, but instead was told about the obvious (losing keys to clients homes, etc) again and again.

I'm thinking \\"Wow, what happened?\\" Turns out that when she gets to a house to care for a pet, she has a bit of a panic attack in the car over whether or not she has the house keys with her. Um...I'd be checking that sort of thing BEFORE you leave your house. Or a couple of times when she had trouble with the client's house alarm system.

She outlines each of the three primary perspectives on the family and politics by stating the reasons why the family is in crisis, what the consequnces of the factors on the family, and what this political perspective indicates are the public policy solutions. The book has \\"readings\\" from each point of view on issues of interest like abortion, crime, etc. The reading are very enlighting and useful. I gave it four stars because she only provides one reading for the liberal/feminist perspective. I do believe they somewhat different and should get a \\"reading\\" each.

Both books looked forward a hundred years to 2000. Each author gave his vision of the future. Astor imbues this book with a somewhat polemical slant. [As indeed did Bellamy in his.] The result is a book that may not be the most gripping of reading by current standards, but which still gives insight into a mindset of that era.The contrast between the two books is reflected in Astor being a successful inventor. No doubt this gave him a very rosy tinged worldview, unlike Bellamy's socialist leanings. And that is the value of these two books considered as a pair. One uses the dominant value system of its time, the agressive capitalism, and the other speaks forth from the resultant opposite.Interesting to see Steve Stirling edit this book. He has done good research for his science fiction novels, and perhaps that led him to this, long obscure text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and Funny","review":"Terry Reed's first novel is an impressionistic coming-of-age story about Boyce Parkman, a girl in a large family living in Shaker Heights, Ohio in the 1960's and '70's. We experience the world through Boyce's eyes, at first accepting her parents' political and social views without question, then meeting the outside world in the form of a smart-mouthed girl from the other side of the tracks and then a boy (!) who is good at kissing.Consequences ensue.

I have never been to Shaker Heights (the affluent suburb of Cleveland the book first takes place in), but now I feel as if I have driven up and down its streets, gone to parties on the polo grounds, looked out from Tudor homes. All this is described with the greatest irony, sense of humor and wide eyed smart sweetness by Zu, the young narrator. Raised by a Protestant father keen on showing social injustice to his children, and a chic and crazily devout Catholic mother who has them pray for success, Zu navigates all waters while trying to answer some big questions of her own.

You may get some drill ideas from the material presented here for training against each of the styles, which is good, but I'd say it's probably not worth the price. Too short and too basic with not enough dynamic energy in the video. One other thing that could have made this video better is subtitles as Grandmaster Park is sometimes difficult to understand. The DVD also promises much in terms of each styles weakness, Taekwon-Do's strengths, etc. but it fails to deliver anything extraordinary.

He talks of people's villages \\"littering\\" the landscape; refers to languages as \\"dialects\\" without seeming ever to recognise the incredible complexity of the culture in Senegambia; patronises the people he meets; never bothers to learn the correct names for things (\\"tom-toms\\" is not really a term used for African drummers) ... refers to how he likes his African musicians \\"wild\\" and gets dismayed when they instead start wearing \\"modish trousers\\" in Paris ...

I dont want to jump to conclitions but I think its somthing to think about. I really like in the book how Christina wins Gratis's trust in racing, and Vince likes her. I think it really was for the best that she raced againsted Star, and the best horse did win. But i do miss all the old characters. I think in a future book Cristina should take a really good jumping lesson on Sterling and win an event or somthing, but still be with Star. I really think they should have a few more jumping books.

But now since other authors have taken over the series, first of all they don't get the facts right, like it wasn't Ashleigh that won the Kentucky Derby on Wonder, it was Gilly. Also, they are changing the characters. For instance, Christina used to want to have nothing to do with racing. Then she met this nice, strong, fast, and calm horse, (and even that right there is pretty hard to come by i would think.) Anyway this horse changes her dreams, makes her sell her good horse Sterling, and turn to become a jockey! I just think the change should have been gradual if anything. I think that they could be a lot better if the author took more time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This book was okay. I still think these books should be about WHITEBROOK. I wasn't pleased with the Gratis plot line one bit. I thought Christina was so dedicated to Star and wanted to ride him so much, so in my opinion, in sticking with the character that's she's been created as, she would have ridden Star. But the plot twists were interesting. The books are much more realistic then ever. However, some parts were still lacking in detail. Also, there still seems to be a lack in relationship between Star and Christina. Too much time is focused on the races, there's little character development outside the track, and there aren't really subplots any more. Subplots make the book interesting, and can be insightful. Other then that, this was an okay book, but I think that two weeks of the series' time shouldn't have been wasted on this plot. Please oh please more Whitebrook! We wanted racing, not just races!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Christian Mysticism","review":"This is a good introductory text regarding Christian Mysticism.

Though it covers only 1956, that was his biggest year in that decade. This is mostly a combination of his original albums ELVIS PRESLEY and ELVIS, minus the Sun Studio recordings of 1954-55 that were on those albums (which you can get separately). At 22 tracks it's quite sizable, and emphasizes rock and blues along with a few slower ballads. It's also got a nicely-done booklet with many photos. There's not a lot of unusual material here if you've already got most of his '50s stuff, but of the alternate takes of \\"Shake, Rattle, and Roll\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" the latter is especially interesting. Sound quality is unusually clear, and the packaging is attractive. This album gives good evidence why the Beatles were huge Elvis fans in the '50s."},{"rating":"2","title":"1956","review":"This CD features 22 songs that Elvis Presley recorded in 1956. What more need be said? I guess I can add that the version I have has some great pictures of Elvis taken by Alfred Wertheimer. Seriously, these are the best pictures anyone ever took of Elvis.

LaHaye loves to hate those who disagree with him and is dying to see nonChristians to get their so-called just punishment in the Tribulation. The Biblical evidence to support his position is scant, and furthermore, LaHaye intreprets parts of Scripture that contradict his theory away as allegorical and subverts whatever the meaning of the text orginally was. LaHaye says we should read the Bible literally, but then turns around and ignores the \\"literal\\" (or even sensible meanings) of passages. This book is dangerous and insidious: it tries to convince Christians to believe a poorly supported lie and then will make nonChristians think Christians are a bunch of kooks, of which LaHaye is a perfect example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazement","review":"I was astonished as I read your lengthy review of your peer's book, \\"Are We Living in the End Times\\" (Tim LaHaye).

Far from bearing witness to non-believers, the books written by these two appeal only to those who want to see in print, no matter how shoddily-written, what they already have decided.

Unfortunately it plays the evangelical card - \\"we are good Christians who believe the Bible - therefore you should trust our easy and simple methods.\\" Alas, to the unsuspecting reader this evaluation of the end times is riddled with cleverly disguised dispensational presuppositions. It also includes misrepresentations of conflicting viewpoints - encouraging the reader not to examine the evidence for themselves but to take LaHaye's word for it.

LaHaye and Jenkins instead give us an excellent, sober, and intelligent, line by line cometary of the Book of Revelations in an easy to read manor; they also being in scriptures from all the Great Bible Prophets (both Old Testament and New testament) as well as from the Lord Jesus Christ; and tie it all in to what is happening in the world around us. This Book is a must read for all Christians to promote Holly Living in an evil age and to spur evangelism; and IS A MUST READ FOR ALL NON CHRISTIANS AS WELL.

Although this book is obviously packaged to appeal to readers of the series, there's real meat here, much of it derived from two earlier books by Dr. LaHaye on the book of Revelation and the on-going debate over the timing of the Rapture. Christians familiar with biblical prophecies of the end-times will find this a handy reference, while readers with no real Bible knowledge will find a lot to think about. Both groups will enjoy the historical references and background, particularly those relating to the modern-day regathering of the nation of Israel after so many centuries in exile. Agree or disagree, no one will be bored by this book! Read it, ponder it, then ask yourself: \\"Could all this really happen in my lifetime?\\" You may be surprised by your final answer.

The story does have alot of difference than the anime which is a good thing if you are like me and seen the anime in its entirely. It still keeps you on your toes because even though the first couple of chapters are similiar to the anime they are still BIG differences! Buy this book!!!! Buy all three of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brothers Elric","review":"From the creative mind of a woman who's also a big fan of B movies comes \\"Fullmetal Alchemist,\\" the manga that inspired the hit anime currently airing on the Cartoon Network's late-night block.There's not much to tell Hiromu Arakawa's manga apart from its TV adaptation; the manga just moves at a faster pace. The Elric Brothers, Edward and Alphonse, still get maimed while using alchemy to resurrect their mother. And as agents of the military, they still search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone that would make them whole again. But the journey isn't any easier in print. To claim the prize for themselves, the Elrics face the same challenges and the same high stakes (and Ed still throws a fit over his height-or lack thereof).Indeed all the action, comedy, and drama of the anime remains intact in its source material. Despite what the law of \\"Equivalent Exchange\\" says, owning this masterpiece won't cost you an arm and a leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing! :D","review":"i started reading these when i was 13. now i'm 14, and i know it doesn't seem like much, but i've been hooked to this series! =DD the characters all have unique personalities, and the plot is completely packed with suspense. i am going on to book 17 when it comes out, and i treat my collection with great care. : ) i let people borrow my other mangas, but this one is special- i never let it leave my home unless it's in my hands. o_o;i know.. i'm a freak. :9if you're looking for a good new manga to cherish, you should definately pick this one. :Dby the way!! the books are BY FAR better than the anime. if you've seen it, i regret to inform you that you've been cheated.

A very flimsy little plastic peg, about 3/8 inch long and smaller than the diameter of a wooden match, is all that is supposed to support the rod in the base.

In fact, there is a great deal of misinformation. For example, the genetics section contains incorrect information regarding the breeding of albino cockatiels, treating albino as if it were one gene instead of a combination of lutino and whiteface. Another good example of Mr. Vriend's use of archaic information is that he recommends peat moss in the nestbox, which can cause fungal growth leading to aspergillosis, which is a serious lung disease.My recommendation: read a book written by someone who has recently bred cockatiels."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"Got these for my wife and her friend to take to work with coffee in the morning.

I noticed that the picture was not printed on as soon as I opened the box and I don't think it would fool anyone except in a photo. Also because of the paper picture, the mug must be hand washed so that the paper doesn't get wet.

It didn't.Never in my life have I read a book where there was so much \\"He/she doesn't love me, or does he/she love me?\\" Thea was tall, overly giving, with a poor self-image.

A terrifying experience for the orphans. If you're interested, there have been several true books written about the orphan trains, some by children who rode them.St John blends this into a romance story that is heartfelt and realistic. A marriage of convenience becomes much more. While the heroine is a bit too good to be true at times (never thinks of herself) she is easy to identify with, and the hero is a big, handsome war veteran who reads true blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The loss of the Lady Lex during the Battle of the Coral Sea.","review":"America had only six carriers at the beginning of World War II. The oldest was the Lexington, the second carrier in the U.S. Fleet after the Langley. She was build on the frame of a battle cruiser, had a good crew headed by Sherman, and a good record. During the Battle of the Coral Sea she was lost after sustaining multiple torpedo and bomb hits which exploded ordinance inside here. The author details the history of this mighty ship and the last eight hours of her life.I like the insight the author put into this book. He interviewed a good number of personnel from the Lexington before he wrote this account. This shows the didication the personnel of the ship had towards saving her after her many hits. It also shows the death of many while fighting the fires and then abandoning the ship. It is a great story about a great ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only glutenfree snack I crave","review":"I've never tried other ones, but this is our favorite.

If I had Celiacs disease I might consider having these around but you can't serve these to guests without a lot of explaining and some really sharp cheese. Be wary of making a 12 box commitment. Also these crackers come in a bag which means between 10%-25% are broken and they cannot be resealed which means they go flat very quickly. If you bought these and don't know what to do with them try opening the box and leaving it in the bathroom when you shower, it reduces the choking hazard.

Can't find them in the stores where I usually shop & I've checked quite extensively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"These chips are delicious, nutricious & healthy (no added salt!).

They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique flavor/smell; Explosive packaging","review":"I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I rely on reviews when making decisions on purchases. So I felt it was important to leave a review myself.I love sweet potato chips, but this product is not good at all. I thought the small bags would be good for portion control, buy I couldn't get through the first bag. The chips tasted stale. Unfortunately it was a bad purchase for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"too salty","review":"Wow way too salty for my taste. They really need to cut back on it or just do it natural without salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Great taste. But why do they insist on saving money using safflower oil instead of canola oil. They say may contain 'canola or safflower or...etc'. But they always contain the cheap oils that I'm allergic to. I'd be a frequent flyer on these chips if they'd just do them so I won't get sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely heavy weight","review":"This socks are extra extra cushioned; so be carefull with show size.

There is only 5% stretch nylon in the composition, but they're tight around the tops. Only my index, middle and ring fingers slip inside the top without stretching the top of the sock. That resistance is too high for anyone with swollen ankles. They're really great quality--thick and plush, but won't work if you're looking for a non-binding top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I was looking for a comfortable, thick, high quality product and this meets all needs.

The extra large size fit my size 12 feet well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only give these 1 STAR","review":"I gave it 1 star because there's to many 5 stars.The socks are real thick on the bottom half like these lovers say, but they didn't say that the top half, ankles, are made like CHEAP DISCOUNT STORE GRADE SOCKs. They FIT TIGHT & CUT YOUR CIRCULATION. They are fold over and stitched at the top cutting off circulation to your feet. I don't care if they are so thick you don't need to wear shoes. If you have a deep groove around your ankles you are cutting of blood flow to your feet.I am keeping the one pair I bought to see if I have some use for them but I won't buy more. The bottoms are so thick you couldn't wear with the shoes you have. You would need a size larger shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Socks that are comfortable and safe to wear","review":"As advertised, these socks are thick and comfortable. Important to me, they are also 95% cotton, as advertised. Quite often, when I look for clothing products -- especially socks, for some reason -- dealers present misleading claims about being all-cotton, and it turns out they are % synthetics or some such. I have psoriasis, so this really matters. These socks are a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socked","review":"One pair of crew socks was included in the sale. This wasn't made clear in the product description, especially since most others come in multiple pairs. This item is very expensive and not much better in quality or comfort compared to the less expensive crew socks I've tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"This book was a chore to get through. I finished it all, but there were some points where I wished it would have just ended. There was a lot of reiteration and not enough interpretation of events and personalities by the author. The reader can form their own interpretation of Ivan early on in the book and after that it just drags on and on. This book could have been great, it wasn't terrible, it just needed to be shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking...","review":"I wasn't impressed by this slow read. It is very dull at most points which one would think would be hard to do considering the antics and terror that encompassed Ivan's reign. I think there are better biographies, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and interesting world","review":"Isiah's long life is dedicated to ensuring balance is maintained. Sometimes, that makes for some nasty work, as is told in this story. I found it a little hard to get into at first but it was well worth the effort as it rocketed toward an end that wasn't at all clear. The moral ambiguity was interesting and the baddies were really, really bad. Fast paced, interesting and a satisfying read.It should be noted, however, that there is discussion and at times dismissal of organised religion and if that sort of thing pushes your buttons, this probably isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a well thought out tale","review":"I liked that this story had believable characters and explored faith (or lack of), it's origins, etc. It had a lot of deep themes. The characters were well thought out. The plot was engaging, and I liked the whole idea of a superhuman who could kick the devil's ass. While reading this, I kept thinking it would make a great action movie or comic book too. I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Realmshift is action packed and keeps you wanting more, with a plot that builds to an exciting crescendo. The characters are three dimensional, and you find yourself caring about what happens to the \`bad guys' as well as the good.The clashing of various religions and philosophies adds another depth to the story, and seems to draw influences from a huge number of sources. From Moorcocks view of Hell, to the humorous Angels in the likes of the film \`Dogma' and Pratchett and Gamens \`Good Omens', a dash of Mayan culture with some Zen philosophy on the side, Baxter keeps the reader both interested and amused.If you, like me have found yourself getting tired of the usual stuff being churned out by well known authors, then give this book a read. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced exciting read!","review":"I read fiction to relax and escape, and prefer a rollicking, fast paced adventure novel, and Alan delivers on that in RealmShift.I enjoyed the supernatural themes and religious comment that was intertwined with the gory action. The anti-hero was compelling and I am keen for the next instalment!My only comment would be that the women in the book were typecast and could be more complex - they could be evil as well!Thanks Alan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Or Not.","review":"This book was NOT HOT! It came off as uninformed and I just don't think it is a good Idea to present a social situation like that when Kit was not the main character. It is impossible to understand that situation unless you have been there so the book felt phony and unrealistic in reference to the overall mood. And Kit was obviously immature and unable too raise the baby, yet she kept her child. What kind of message is that sending to our young people? I would not want my daughter read this book because of its unrealistic plot and questionable morals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but predictable subjects, not so god plot","review":"This book had controversial subject matter and everything you need for a teen book, but i didn't think it was very good. The plot didn't really draw you in in the beginning, and it didn't get any better in the end. i have read MUCH better books, and I thought this one was amateurish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawman / kentuckian/ Unforgiven dvd","review":"Another great performance by Burt Lancaster(Lawman). I Ordered the dvd to get Lawman,and got three good films for the price of one. This bundling films together is a great idea.Thanks seller for being prompt with your delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD for my father who loves westerns. The westerns on this DVD had actors my father enjoys and for the price I couldn't pass it up. The whole experience with ordering, shipping and quality of the DVD was excellent. I highly recommend it to other western lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music theory book","review":"This book is excellent. In my opinion, the best characteristic of the book is that it is easily understood. The book is divided into 3 sections. Each section contains 29 lessons. Nearly every lesson concludes with a set of exercises that effectively reinforce the information the lesson provides.Since reading John Brimhall's book, I've started reading another music theory book for beginners, and the difference in how easily understood John's book is in comparison to the new book is remarkable. John's book blows my other music theory book out of the water, as far as being an effective teaching tool for beginners is concerned. If you are new to music theory, as I was before reading John Brimhall's \\"Complete Theory Notebook\\", then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuplés with a real heart","review":"When I couldn't find Sarita Montiel's \\"La Violetera\\" CD, I compromised. I bought this CD by Nati Mistral, expecting little but nostalgic for songs of my youth. It was a true revelation! I really enjoyed this singer's interpretations. In fact, I went back and listened to Sarita's original LP and, whether due to the CD's greater quality of Nati's greater voice, I preferred Nati's. I'm not familiar with Ms. Mistral, up to know I have lived unaware of her art, but from now on I'll certainly search for more of her work. I recommend the CD and the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good in extreme conditions","review":"I had this player for one year without problems until it just stopped dead one day in the middle of a run. IRiver replaced in twice and the next two players didn't even last one week each!

Maybe they should put this as a disclaimer on their product--\\"Not good for use in a southern summer!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"My player died after 6 months of very light use at my desk. I would take quality problems into account before purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it...","review":"It is a good mp3 player for the money. It has good sound quality, holds plenty of tunes for a workout and doesn't skip a all. I found that once you get it playing push the hold switch on and it will play on and on without anything to stop it. The battery life last me about a week of use with the one AA. The FM Radio is good enough for use in the gym but it's doesn't have great reception for picking up stations like my car radio does. The only real complaint is the arm band and case in the package are useless. You will need to get the armband and belt clip accessory. On another note when I first got it took me about 2 hours to figure out how to use all the functions, since then it has been easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Until it Breaks","review":"I had the same problem as KB from Ohio, except it happened to me after just 7 months. The unit just stopped dead, no display, in the middle of the run, middle of a song. Though I had only a few days before replaced the battery, I assumed that was the problem and changed it again. It started again, so no problem. Next run, it stopped after about 30 minutes, just dead. I did not replace the battery this time, and when I turned it on a couple of days later lo and behold it started again. Buth then halfway through my run it stopped again, dead as a doornail. This happened two more times and I gave up. Looks like I just have to get a new one. Those over priced warranties might be worth it if you really want this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if it works...","review":"When I began shopping for a small MP3 player to use during workouts at the gym, I looked at the same things most people would look at: features and price. The iRiver 256 MB Player seemed to meet all of my requirements, so I bought it. Then reality set in. I took it home, installed the music management software on my PC (running Windows XP), and then the nightmare began. Try as I might, I couldn't get the software to function properly. Essentially, it refused to recognize the player when I plugged it into the USB 2 port. I tried everything I could imagine, but no dice. So....I decided it was time to call tech support. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that iRiver's tech support hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Coincidentally, those are my office hours! Once it appeared that I was never going to get the software to work, OR be able to contact tech support, I packed it up and returned it. I chose a Rio 256 MB player instead, and haven't looked back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A key present for my girl friend...","review":"She is delighted with it.

But in behalf of my girl friend i can say it is very easy to use, the battery last is great, is easy to carry, taking and putting files on it is a breeze, the accesories that come with it are beautiful and practical. I'd tell you, she is demanding.

I am really enjoying it. I am glad I bought this one. It's not to expesive, yet it has what I wanted & then some. The 5000F Scanner had a little to much for what I needed it for & the cheaper scanners didn't have some of the programs I needed. I would recommend this for people who wants a scanner for just home used. I like how fast it scans & how I can take the red out of the eyes. I also like how fast I can send a picture by email. The picture quality is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for just a little while","review":"I bought two canoscans 3000f The troubleshooting manual was worthless -- and you'll need it not long after purchasing the canon 3000f.

This book is the bible for medieval reenactors and anyone interested in ancient combat techniques. If you think the Asians have invented throwing, kicking and swordfighting then this book will be an eye opener for you. The illustrations are very detailed for a fifteenth century book and the techniques have really been used to kill each other at that time. But beware you need some experience and understanding to follow those pictures. Often you have to guess what happened between them and you should know that some of the techniques can only be done with chain mail gloves or relatively dull swords (e.g. holding it by the blade and hitting with the hilt)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures with no substance","review":"This book contains ancient illustrations with no real substance.

There are many other books out there that paint a real picture from real dancers.Maybe the Author should go and shake it herself and then she would get the real perspective about the job.

I wished I was younger so I could stay in the business a lot longer.Check out my reviews to see what books about stripping are the best...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"As a stripper for 7 years, I did not find this book very interesting. Many of these stories seem a little exagerated. It is pretty evident that the author went from striper to stripper and asked for their stories, then went back and wrote the book. I guess it could make for good reading material to someone who has not clue, but even the average person can read this book and get the feeling that it is not write accurate.Stripped is nothing more than feminist work: The insights into the work and private lives of exotic dancers are vague but it moves far beyond notions of strippers as exploited or empowered to uncover more hidden aspects of this world--its burdens of emotional labor, social stigma, exhaustion, and boredom as well as experiences of athleticism, ego-gratification, intimacy, and even spirituality.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust Big Business.

The important sounding \\"Council on Science and Health\\" is in truth a PR group that represents the food processing and chemical industries.

In their book, they take Ms. Whelan to task for (amongst other things) downplaying the link between a high-fat diet and heart disease, while receiving funding from Oscar Mayer, Frito Lay and Land O'Lakes. She also defends saccharin while receiving money from the soft drink industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to approach sales","review":"Rocking the Ages is a beautifully writen book.

Though uniquely Canadian, 'Corner Gas' delivers broad appeal to anyone who's ever wondered what life might be like in one of those blink-of-an-eye towns that pass by our car windows as we travel from one place to another.
