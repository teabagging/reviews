Dessi is no more than a pretty voice coping with a role that doesn't quite sound right for her. Bartoletti tries to keep the massive forces under control and succeeds at times, but interpretation only comes in fits and starts.

Of course, after reading it, there are still those who choose to argue it is \\"too influential on the young minds who have been subjected to it\\" True, the book does tell you to live your life as you want, not setting down any specific boundaries.

This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning about Satanism, and possibly seriously pursuing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an antithesis, but a replacement.","review":"A work of eclectic philosophies and humanistic concerns, LaVey's only significant flaw is his lack of credit due to Ragnar Redbeard for \\"Might makes Right.\\"The book entails a very egocentric religion suitable for those of us who prefer not to bow down before any being higher than ourselves. A mixture of hedonism and 'tit for tat' reactionism, this text sets forth the precepts of the Church of Satan, and dispels many of the myths that have sprung up around it. The book sets forth not an antithesis to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc., but a replacement with a human at the wheel, but retaining the dogma on which so many depend.The most impressive point of the book, however, is its use of emotive language to draw the reader into its philosophies by transferring the third-person view onto the first-person view, through explanations of \\"The Satanist,\\" intended to be seen as an extension of the reader, who gradually accepts \\"The Satanist\\" as a title for herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"The book is very disjointed and lacks a real depth of information.

All in all, 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered-down bull.","review":"The 9 Satanic Statements are derived from Ayn Rand. The book of Satan, part one of the \\"bible\\", is from Ragnar Redbeard's \\"Might is Right\\", almost verbatim. Half the book is Enochian calls from the Golden Dawn. I have read elsewhere that LaVey's wife wrote a lot of it, along with different church of Satan members. The philosophy is sort of a dry Nietzsche-meets-Butthead. There are about 500 exclamation marks!!!! trying to spice up the rather mundane style. This 8$ book is going to make you a superman? Elitism doesn't work--why? The strong cut out the weak, OK, there is a new base of weakness. Cut that out, OK, now there's a new set of weakness, on and on, ad nauseum. This book is for people uneducated in philosophy and unhappy with their lack of success. Although dated, I DO like its directness as opposed to the overly corny fluff of new age and feminist wicca.

If you have no idea about the subject of Satanism but think it would interest you, then I recomend reading 'The Devils Note Book' by Anton Szandor LaVey first, sort of, as an introduction to the subject. 'The Satanic Bible' is full of usefull ways to view every day topics, like Love and Hate. A good 'Hand Book'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun bit of common sense followed by a lot of yak dung","review":"I will admit that I have not read the entire thing. ONLY BECAUSE I CAN'T. The first half consists of the whole satanist philosophy, but then Anton LaVey proceeds to contradict himself by adding an extensive section on rituals. This is the part I could not swallow. (but hey! I tried to open the gates of hell on my TV screen, and when I turned it on FULL HOUSE was on, so it might not be all bunk after all!) Overall: VERY interesting the first 100 pages, But just a silly coffee table or toiletside book after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaVey: Satanist or Freudian?","review":"LaVey's Bible should prove typically life-transforming for those looking for someone to articulate their heretofore nebulous criticisms of mainstream religion and society or to legitimate the ethics of their previously unreasoned egoism. The book should have special appeal to agnostics who crave spiritual baggage. Read \\"Civilization and Its Discontents\\" before giving LaVey too much credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"All I see here is a watered-down version of Nietzsche and other philosophers combined with the trendy \\"Satan\\" tag.

LaVey is nothing but a theif. He stole and basterdized many other works of liturature. his pathetic nine satanic statements were actually stolen from Ayn Rand. He used and abused Redbeard's Might is Right, and half the freakin book is stolen from the Enochian Keys of Aleister Crowley. His puney idea of what satanism really is, is nothing but a hoax. He knew that all you \\"deprived\\" children would follow his idiotic and moronic idea of the devil if he labled it satanism. Do you Marilyn Mason listeners actually believe that real satanism is not evil and that the devil is not evil? GIVE ME A BREAK! Stop believing Lavey's stupid lie.

A brave man saw this hypocrisy and took it upon himself to expose those cracks and the lies confined in them.This book is a revelation; it cracks the shell of accepted stupidity that envelopes traditional religions in lies and deceit. If you are tired of looking at the flaccid tomes that litter bookstore shelves, with their white-washing of magic and their fear-laden dribbling between the fruity covers, then this book is an explosion of immense proportions.

All this book does is use \\"Satanism\\" as an attention grabber and then twists it to become a psychology lesson on introspection. The book is poorly written and jumpy, but to give it credit its very imperfection leads the reader to ponder on his/her own. This is the ONLY redeeming feature of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, silly nonsense","review":"Lavey gives a bold paean to hedonism (sort of an Ayn Rand without the production of anything actually useful), but that's hardly an honest exegesis of Satanism. Until Lavey is willing to state one of the key elements of Satanism--enjoyment of and search for pain and destruction--he will only be a weak sister to the real thing.And to all you wanna-be tough acne-faced adolescents looking for meaning, who think that by reading this book you might actually find something to guide your rudderless lives, better to study Satre or Kierkkegard, to understand what true existentialism is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find out what Satanism really is.","review":"This book gives the reader a basic understanding of Satanism. Unlike what you may have heard from the media, this book tells you what Satanism really is. I really enjoyed the book because it is written by a Satanist, not a Christian. So you really get the insider's perspective. Read the book for yourself, do not let fear of the unknown keep you away from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I found Anton Lavey's \\"bible\\" for Satanism to be pretentious and annoying, with most righteous or agreeable ideas being taken from the works of Ayn Rand, Ragbar Redbeard, Aleister Crowley, and Friedrich Nietszche, only without the brilliance of any of them. Just naming the ethical philsophy within the book \\"Satanism\\" is ultimately contradictory and obviously only there for shock value.Not a suggested read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satanism Without the Nonsense","review":"This is truly an amazing book. LaVey brings Satanism out of the shadows and reveals what it truly is. There are no demons, no Satan-worshippers, no supernatural aspects of any kind, just pure and simple self-indulgence. You will find no flimsy \\"turn the other cheek\\" mentality in this book. Satan stands as a symbol for the carnality of mankind, for the law of \\"might is right,\\" and LaVey blasts the life-denying quality of fundamentalist religions, with their proscriptions and their guilt. If you're a thinking person and an atheist, you'll love \\"The Satanic Bible.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an affirmation of humanity.","review":"Readers will find THE SATANIC BIBLE exposes those \\"dark\\" inherent qualities in a human being, and brings them to \\"light\\". LaVey is not a gentle man in his writing; rather, he is a truthful man. Touching on subjects such as altruism and psychic vampires, he reveals a philosophy that could be considered the cornerstone of christianity -- being that it is everything they shamefully deny. LaVey introduces us to a philosophy that allows us to be human -- without guilt or shame, but with the call to be full in our humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of modern Satanism from the man who invented it","review":"I read this book as a curious skeptic, and athiest.But from the urging of some of my Satanic friends, I managed to locate a copy and read it. It changed my life. This is the book to read for ANYONE who has ever questioned Christan values. If you are one of those many people then READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Colorful and Interesting Point of View","review":"Anyone who believes in the literal existence of Satan is delusional, just as anyone who believes in the literal existence of God. Both are creations of the human imagination. As such, they are both charged with symbolism. Symbolism is useful, and as ritual is the acting out of symbolism, the rituals presented in this book could be considered useful for those who agree with the philosophy of this book. The philosophy is sound in that it points out the defects of Christianity and its repressive tendencies, and offers a colorful alternative. Readers should make up their own minds. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book to ANYONE.","review":"This is quite simply one of the best books I've ever read. The foundations of Satanic philosophy are what you will find here. I strongly recommend this book because it is actually logical and I found it to be quite enlightening. In the words of LaVey : \\"Probe no further, here is bedrock.\\" --For those of you complaining about how you think the rituals , infernal names, etc., are just worthless garbage, you have not reallly paid attention to the whole book have you? The reasons for these fantasies (from the Preface : \\"Herein you will find truth--and fantasy. Each is necessary for the other to exist; but each must be recognized for what it is.\\") are explained in the chapters \\"The God You Save May Be Yourself\\" and \\"Some Evidence of a New Satanic Age\\".-- REGIE SATANAS!

I don't feel that humanism is wrong, but I do think people just try to get away with to much and try to blame it on someone else. This book is something yet to be truly explored.

There is no reason to call it \\"Satanism\\", particularly in light of the emergence of religious Satanism (actual worship of demonic 'gods'), unless you count the unrelenting slag on Christianity. He does provide some fun, sarcastic shockers in his statements and in presenting sins as virtues, but there is really nothing original or innovative here. Critical readers will be amazed at his dogmatism and morality while claiming to abhor both. Serious occultists will be appalled by his absurd translations of the Enochian Keys. Teens can keep a copy on the shelf to cheese-off mom and offend the neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Philosophical Work minus one star","review":"All the pretenders are blown away, and I do mean all of them, by LaVey's brutal honesty and realistic outlook of life and what people really are. I suspect the people who criticize LaVey subscribe to the religious dogma that places man on a pedestal. Every word he wrote is truth and he had a real gift for getting his ideas across. I gave it a minus one star because of the content on magic. How such a brilliant man could also preach hocus-pocus I'll never know, but my guess is he did it to make a buck and develop a following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practicing Satanism","review":"I went into this with some idea of what I was getting into. I never followed a religion and I questioned multiple things about the existing religions that had been out there. After read LaVey's Satanic Bible I realized I had been practicing Satanism without knowing it. I think many people are practicing it and they don't know it or they are turned off by the \\"negative stigma\\" that Satanism has been given by those who have not educated themselves on it. It is an exrememly well written book. I've enjoyed reading it and learning about myself in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new under the sun","review":"In a nutshell, a lot of fluff and no stuff. i expected much more, this \\"bible\\" was a lot of hype and trype. The basic premise is that satanism is misunderstood, that it isn't blood sacrifices of animals and babies but that it is simply the worship of the self. So Levey simply bithered on about hedonism and threw in a few spells and rituals. The whole text just seemed to be borrowed information; an admixture of hedonism, theosophy, philosophy,crowleyisms, etc... etc...and all of this presented in a very superficial overly simplified way.There was nothing in the text that prompted the reader to think or ponder as many spiritual concepts do. In fact, it seemed very kindergartenish in comparison to christianity, budhism, zen, taoism, just to name a few. i wouldn't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"I am more than satisfied.

Much better than the Christian Bible","review":"This book is Satanism incarnate, as the title implies. This is the essence of the Church of Satan and what it still stands for. If you're under the impression that Satanism is pure devil worship that involves the sacrifice of animals and mutilation, I implore you to read this book. It's a book about free-thinking and opposing hypocrisy, as well as a great criticism of the human race and their religions. It is also a book on black magick, which is a carnally-based process involving no spirituality of any kind. In my opinion, one of the most important books ever written. It doesn't wag its finger at you for being lustful or enjoying your life, but it encourages it. It does, however, heavily discourage abstinence. It's about time someone did! Check it out! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand with black robes","review":"If you like this book I recommend The Virtue of Selfishness. Lavey makes interesting points concerning how \\"god\\" can do things people aren't \\"allowed\\" to do, ego externalization, sexual preference,Psychic Vampires,phony \\"white\\" witches, ect. It's a manifesto on hedonism. I give it a 4 because it's a great book, but I found it an easy read. At least 10th grade level. All in all simple but informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about Satanic philosophy","review":"When I came upon this book, ...I never bought the book or flipped through it, it just captured my interest.

There are people out there that think Satan is this guy who's red all over, has horns on his head, forked tail, etc. That is utter nonsense,made up by wives tales and myths.Satanism is more like a philosophyyou can apply to your daily life.Basically, it's taking Christianityand turning it upside down. For example, indulging in something instead of abstaining from it. Satanists are not child molesters,murderers, or criminals. It is taking care of yourself and those that you love who deserve it. Thisbook really explains the truths about Satanism entirely. If you arecurious, then buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"well its like this","review":"well i should start by not biting anyones heads off, as ive seen people do when reviewing this book, however this book asks many questions and makes you think about your spirituality. I did in fact enjoy this book as it validated itself very well. This book is surely misunderstood but without it what would christianity be- nothing, I think that all christians should read this book. also Mr. LaVey reveals how christianity warped the identity of many pagan gods making them out to be evil when thats just nonsense-----This is a great read!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not a Satanist, Christian, or Wiccan","review":"If you want Humanist ideals, be a Humanist not a Satanist, if you want no institution be an anarchist(go to anarchy.org good site)and anyway if Satanism is against institutionalized religion, why is it an institution? and why does it have all these uneccessary rites(I have been to Satanicchurch.com and YES no matter what a Satanist tells you, they are into rituals and stuff), if you are a strong supported of individuality don't be a conformist, all of their ideals are contradictory to others, or you don't need their religion for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Perfect","review":"Honestly, after looking for a religion of sorts to follow, but finding none that fully matched my beliefs, I found it. LaVey is a skilled writer, and his book is simple to understand and is more down to Earth than most religions. It's also short, so it's not a rambling religious rant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible","review":"The sourcebook of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, a must read for anyone interested in the CoS and what this misunderstood religion actually stands for. Read it -- you might be surprised to find out it has nothing to do with the mindless crap spewed by Geraldo & Oprah about human sacrifices and whatever else they were saying. A monumental work by a true visionary of his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought someone could make Satan look stupid.","review":"This book is not fit to be torn into pieces and hung on a nail in an outhouse. The basic \\"Satanic\\" premise in this book is to hold dear the flesh rather than the spirit. Clearly a takeoff on the Gnostic belief that Spirit is Good and Flesh is Evil. His \\"magic\\" is an almost blatant plagurization of the Enochian keys of Aleister Crowley, but he at least made the effort to replace the names of the angels with some Satanic-sounding names. If you're looking for an idiotic rationalization to do what you want, then this book is for you. If, however, you are interested in Magick or Satan, look elsewhere. I can't believe this book has stayed in print as long as it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"the satanic bible is a veery good book I will give it 5 star","review":"I have read the satanic bible countless times. I have my own copy at home. I enjoy reading it and doing a few of the rituals. If anyone needs a good book of the church of satan. It is this one. It teaches many things you need to know. It is a very good book. I enjoy it very much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Most people think of this book as a \\"worship Satan\\" book, but it's not. Contrary to their beliefs, it would probably do them good to read this book. The basic idea of the book is being responsible for yourself. It expresses opinions most people are afraid to express due to fear of being rejected or otherwise tormented. I highly recommend reading this book, it will change your outlook upon yourself and other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best source to start your own satanic thoughts.","review":"The Satanic Bible is the best book on the market for thestudy of satanic philosophy. It has sold more copies thanthe Xian bible. It is by all means the foundation of truesatanism. I strongly believe that this great book willindeed open your eyes to what we really are. We are nothingmore than beasts nothing more, nothing less. Every one needsto buy this book to open their eyes to this Xian world thatwe live in. Buy it,read it and learn the law of humanism froma man who know what it really means to be strong. Dr. Rev. AntonSzandor LaVey is in fact the greatest man to walk this earth, readthis book and you will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"It took me 5 or so hours to read this book. No, I'm not incompetant or a slow reader, it's just that I was laughing more than half of the time I was reading.I am not a whining christian, feeling threatened by more anti-god blasphemy. I am an atheist. I do agree with some opinions expressed throughout this book, but it's nothing original. Only more of Nietzsche-like philiosophy peppered with violence and set upon a flashy background of LaVey's choice.And I have no clue what the hell he was thinking when he wrote the third chapter. Horrible, incoherent ramblings of black magic and crazy rituals.Overall, I feel this is better time spent with more renowned philosophical materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting thoughts, but barely scratches the surface","review":"When I first saw the book, I was surprised to see how little and/or thin it was. But I thought \\"quality over quantity.\\" While there are some interesting philosophical thoughts, it is VERY shallow. I thought LaVey would at least be indepth, and insightful, but there's not much new information here, and I don't think anything he wrote hasn't been written before him. Add to that the completely laughable ritualistic descriptions and it's hard to take this book seriously. I mean, I didn't think I could shoot fire from my fingernails after reading the Satanic Bible, but I didn't even get any real insight into man's deepest, darkest thoughts and desires. Maybe in the '60s counter-culture movement this was considered extreme literature, but by today's standards it's not very shocking nor is it very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOT ME KICKED OUT OF BIBLE STUDIES!","review":"There I was in bible studies class reading my cool new SATANIC BIBLE!! and just as I finnished the Chapter on Killing my parents and biting the head ff a chicken MY stupid Bible studies teacher took it from me!!! Well long story short she took the satanic bible and gave me a real bible. Turns out the real bible is more violent than that dumb book. So what do I recomend..? READ THE REAL BIBLE!! if your into some grusome stuff I recomend the part ware jesus beats the LVING TAR!!! out of the money changers for working on sundays LOL!! GO JESUS!! damn that man had a right hook that even tyson could not match. So in conclusion if your looking for a reason to do drugs rape kids and pretty much have a copeing methoid to do unmoral crap read this book.

La vey uses Satan as a mean's to lure you into buying his book! If anyone out there had studied true satanism they would know that this guy is a money wanting freak who degrades satanism into a Darwin based religion. Just stop and ask yourself, if he is a satanist how can he then in the same breath, say satan and god do not exist!? He is no better in my book than preacher's that use God's name to make money, when they couldn't belive in it if their lives depended on it! If you want satanism don't listen to this guy!! He is a humanist, naturalist, darwinist, all of the above but not a Satanist! Hail to true Satanism, Hail Lord Satan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The path and philosophy of gratification of the base ego","review":"It is despicable how LaVey includes the Enochian Keys as part of his system. Now many people actually associate the Enochian system with Satanism or black magic. I give this one two stars because it definitely keeps your interest, and almost everyone at one time in his life -- usually in the teenage years -- can identify with some of the philosophies put forth in the Satanic Bible. But these things are meant to be outgrown, as one learns the tremendous setbacks of a fundamentally self-centered mindset and lifestyle. The rituals -- particularly the curses -- will in all likelihood blow up in your face and cause you some species of misfortune if you choose to practice them. The strength of this book is in LaVey's personal philosophies and insights -- not very far off from Ayn Rand's Objectivism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Rich Book","review":"The most interesting prose in the book are poor imitation of Nietzsche's work. Unless you're interested in Satanism, this book will be a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"Why do people see this as a chance to preach to all the people that are interested in Satanism and the teachings of Anton Szandor LaVey? Obviously the peoson who tried to tell us that he was LaVey, could have at least humored the rest of us with a good story. Instead of not even getting his facts right. If you have read this book you know that Anton LaVey passed away on October 29, 1996. Although his death certificate says October 31, 1996. All of the people who are here to criticize The Satanic Bible should research what you are defending. Maybe actually read the book. Hail Satan"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book.","review":"I hav read this book three or four times and it is really a very good book.

I am proud to call myself a Satanist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Full Truth about The Satanic Bible","review":"The Satanic Bible written by Lavey, who dropped out of high school in his junior year, is foul. Lavey complains about other religions' hypocrisy, all the while this book is filled with it. Lavey only tells what intelligent and wise people already know about humans. The rituals leave much to be disired. All in all, I was extremely disapointed I wasted money on this book, even if it was only seven dollars. The only book written by Lavey I would recommend is The Satanic Rituals, because it contains rituals from orders the likes of the Illuminati, and the Freemasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intresting but...","review":"It is quite intresting to see how originel Satanism has become a pure product to sell.Satanism has more to teach and is not that heteroclite from the point of view of all the religions that formed La vey's opinion(for it is an opinion not a religion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic.","review":"I don't understand how anyone would look away from Earth's beauty and unto the depths of hell.

However, look deep into the book. The philosophy put forth here is warmed-over, simplified works of other philosophers. Even more interesting, is the more you read, the more you see how Anton Levey seems to support the same hypocracy that he attacks. An interesting commentary of this book and Levey's Satanism is found in Cornerstone Magazine's August 1998 issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for free thinking individuals","review":"The kind of Satanism described in this book is nothing like the kind that you hear about on TV.It's for the most part a very rational, useful, uninhibited, often wise, and life loving philosophy for getting the most out of life.Who would have guessed that the \\"devil\\" would be the one telling the truth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"opened my mind","review":"I had always been a skeptic regarding the other \\"Bible\\" this book has really changed my perception even though in my heart I knew that I was being lied to coming from a Christian upbringing ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much gibberish","review":"The first third of the book (the philosophy part) is interesting, although there's nothing new or original there, but it's good reading nonetheless. From there on, it's a lot of adolescent-appealing-terror-inducing rituals and gibberish in an \\"ancient magic language\\" called Enochian, in the very tradition of the dark magic scripts of Eliphas Levi and the like. If you like this kind of discourse, go for it, but if you are a rationalist like me, that's probably not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Book","review":"My conception of this book is \\"Satan Sells\\". It is just a packaged commodity with \\"Satan\\" stamped on it so as to appeal to the person looking for meaning in his meaningless life. This book is just another American commodity; its whole purpose is to create a false sense of superiority in the reader; that of wanting to 'belong' to an elite (the Satanists). The book as usual relies on the doctrine of the 'other' (the hypocritical Xtian who is suffering from spriritual pipe dreams) in order to create the much needed adversary of Satan (the Adversary).I remember when I first read this book. I remember how agreeable it was. I have learned to be weary of books you agree too much with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh. Open your eyes, people.","review":"Jeez, people. Open your eyes. Satanism teaches you to believe in yourself. You all need to check out the 9 Deadly Sins of Satanism, and the 11 Commandments of Satanism.Regardless, this book was fairly decent. It wasn't as good as I had hoped it to be. But for those who would like a good read, or are interested in Satanism in the least (perhaps it has piqued your interest), or just something to read for the sake of reading, pick this book up. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way of the Flesh","review":"Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey was the first to codify Satanism into an applicable religion, and this book marks down the basic formula and doctrines that such a religion offers. Satanism is best defined as the glorification of the material world through the indulgence of carnal desires. \\"Satan\\" is by no means a literal being, he is more of a personification of the natural (and dark) powers of nature, and the universe.This book is logical, concise, and its rationality will astound many. It is the bible of realism and Undefiled Wisdom. There are no false and fraudulant ritualistic creeds to be found here, all are based on what is experienced in this world, and what has proven successful. Welcome to Darwin's Inferno!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, OK, Whatever","review":"Let me first start out by saying for the record that I am a Satanist. I became interested in Satanism through the Satanic Bible, and at the time I read it, this book impressed me. However, the reason I give it two stars is that half the book is common sense that everyone should know already. The other half is just (...) made-up languages and silly theatrics disguised as powerful rituals.There is so much healthy and vital about Satanism, and while this book may be a good primer for it, it should NEVER be treated as a \\"Bible,\\" only as an introduction, and one opinion out of many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Epicurus instead!","review":"I've always thought of myself as an agnostic, and, after reading this, I really feel that religion--of any sort--should not be left in the hands of devout practitioners. This book is a bum-wipe hedonist's guide for self-destruction. Furthermore, haven't we learned from Hux and Bill Lee Burroughs that pleasure can be used as a method of controlling weak-willed individuals?Viva la Existentialists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moisturizing Toner","review":"I started using this after a friend suggested it to me when I was in the dry mountains of Colorado last summer.

However, it does not smell good. My husband always prods what product he's smelling -- and not in a good way. I myself don't care for it. Also, it hasn't done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have. I know my acne is hormone related since I just had a baby and am nursing, but this still has done nothing to help. I will not buy this again. I will go back to using Neutrogena's alcohol free toner. It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic aftershave and astringent!","review":"Witch hazel in general is a great product for your face, but a lot of witch hazel out there contains alcohol.

Be sure to follow up with a LIGHT moisturizer, as this will dry out your skin a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is good except the cap","review":"This product is a good toner with a fair price.

The smell is ok, not my favorite, I have another scent by this brand that I enjoy much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Nice and refreshing to use.

For 10 years, I struggled with special education experts who pretty much decided that my daughter's problem was me. Finally, at the age of 17, Julie was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. When I heard the diagnosis, part of me wanted to find those experts and say, \\"I told you something was wrong.\\" The other part of me selfishly mourned and still mourns the loss of my dreams for my daughter. Julie fits right into the descriptions given in the book. She may be 19, but emotionally and socially she is 12. Thank you for helping me understand a little better what lies ahead for Julie and for the rest of our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling it like it is","review":"Gena Barnhill does an excellent job pulling back the curtain and letting us see inside life with (and as) an Asperger child growing into adulthood. As an adult dealing with the disorder, raising a son with it, I found myself looking both in a mirror and a crystal ball.Barnhill's down to earth, real life writing style lets you in where you really feel you know the principals.The book is not (and is not meant to be) a medical or psychological manual. It is human and real and gives a real world view of what the disorder is and how it affected Barnhill's son, and her family - and how they dealt with things. A very interesting and useful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asperger Syndrome?","review":"This is a very personal story of a family dealing with the struggles of a teen/young adult who does not quite fit the definition of \\"normal\\". For any family dealing with this in their lives, this book is a good read. However, the descriptions of the teen in the book did not lead me to believe that he has Asperger Syndrome. This is somewhat addressed in the book in the early chapters while the parents were trying to find an appropriate label for their child. If your looking for something specific to Asperger Syndrome, I would look elsewhere. If, however, you would like to share in the experiences of a family who struggle and want the best for their child, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this one at the top of your list!","review":"Review of \\"Forever Yours\\"By Donna LairdJune 11, 2004Reviewed by Sonya JebsenAuthor of \\"Thief in the Dawn\\"Five Stars for Donna Laird's - Forever Yours.I was captured from page one of this exceptional novel as I traveled along the journey of character, Samantha Kane.Moving from a small town in Arkansas to New York, she hoped to escape the pain and heartache that her father had etched into her heart.There had been other reasons as well, - one being the betrayal of Michael Foster, the man she'd given her heart to.Hoping that New York would fulfill her lifelong dream of being an actress, it seemed the logical place to escape to.Ms. Laird's writing is superb, as she takes you through the journey of Samantha's pain and passions, with a new twist lurking around every corner.

There is NEVER a single skeletal warrior in this movie. It's a bunch of fat, old, ex commando types getting revenge on some old guy. None of the actors know how to use a gun. People die constantly, and you never really figure out why.Basically, this old guy gets killed, then his son gets angry, then the guy that killed his dad trys to kill him and hits his wife. Then the guy gathers up his fat friends to kill the old guy. However, the old guy they wanna kill is apparently trying to build some chemical weapon. I have no idea why they threw this in.

I can get to ch9 and ch19 with the instant ch9/19 button on the front of the unit, but the only way to get so a different channel is to scan and hope it stops when someone is talking.

Not so good. Tuned into truckers' channel 17 (for North-South traffic) and heard mostly noise. There was very little discernible language so I squelched out the noise and waited...and waited. I called out for a radio check and got a comeback--loud but not clear. The speaker in that hand held CB is awful. It's abrasive to listen to.It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road. Perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying. I was looking for a portable system for temporary use, but the Cobra HH Road Trip CB is pretty poor.

The majority of the tracks here are slow and full of deep dark electronics and droning strings. The first two tracks, however, are a bit more upbeat and dancy. One quick glance at the English translations in the bokklet is enough to make your stomach churn in anquish at human misery and cruelty. The songs are sad, full of deceit and murder but do try to offer some kind of moral lesson. Emma sings with a gutteral precision placing a strong emphasis with certain words and phrases so the Swedish lyrics don't sound as smooth as Danish contemporaries Sorten Muld.

Short summary of the plot.This is a perfectly satisfactory live performance that features two top singers, Montserrat Caballe and Placido Domingo, both in good form. On that basis alone, this set fully deserves five stars.Having said that, I feel obliged to point out that Opera d'Oro has another performance of this same opera that features not just two great singers, but four: Olivero, Corelli, Bastianini and Simionato. Moreover, Magda Olivero, a true and fiery verismo soprano, is simply a better Adriana than Caballe, who is a great technician but not by any stretch of the imagination a verismo singer. In just the same way, the other set's passionately intense Franco Corelli is better than the lush-voiced but too-generalized Domingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very patriotic!","review":"This VHS tape by GOODTIMES is not enhanced in anyway.

It is supremely well worth watching with actors such as then Lt. Ronald Reagan as well as Kate Smith and many more.

It is just as entertaining today as ever. The ensemble cast is terrific, the physical beauty of Monument Valley is striking, and the musical score is haunting.

They have sales of over 1 million worldwide, which makes their US anonimity a travesty of justice. They mix the instrumental quality of Dream Theatre with a touch of the neoclassical, and a more mainstream rock feel and vocal style (Dio meets Styx meets Maiden) This live album was recorded in Tokyo, and is basically the studio album Paradox straight through. There are subtle differences, but as the whole thing is so well orchestrated, there is very little difference. My favourite track is always River of Pain, the melody is fantastic, the playing superb - great song.Personally I'd get the studio version, but the production is surprisingly good, and the band are so tight that there isn't much to choose between the two, so for the fans out there, go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed with Results","review":"After searching high and low for something that would help my 5 year old black lab's arthritis and elbow displasia I was convinced I had found the solution.

I now am leery as to whom the actual writers of those reviews are. My dog has been taking these pills for nearly 6 weeks now and has shown ZERO improvement - in fact, I actually think that he has started limping more.I am thrilled if some of you have success and are able to help relieve your dogs pain - just wanted to be sure that potential buyers know that this doesn't work for everyone.

It gave a great illustration of what true Spiritual Warfare may look like. Frank Paretti uses similar descriptions in his books (This Clear and Present Darkness & Piercing the Darkness) of what goes on 'behind the veil'. I found the arguments in the classrooms both thought provoking and a great help to myself in the struggle to open the eyes of 'those that do not see'.The only thing I disliked about this book were all of the typos! I read the Kindle version, and I have never seen so many typos in a published book in my life! Misspellings, combined words, just plain wrong words-as if spell-correct was reaking havoc on this manuscript. Please fix this! This is a great book that shouldn't have such terrible editing tarnishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Begin to Understand Spiritual Warfare...","review":"I don't think I truly understood the concept of spiritual warfare until I read this book. If you have ANY curiosity about spiritual warfare, this book is a non-threatening and compelling way of starting to explore it - AND it's a great story. I think the author was brave to take on a main character of a college student; I can't think of many experiences/situations more challenging to a young person trying to be true to their beliefs (with the possible exception of entering the military). I had some difficulty with the portrayal of the angels and demons, but the real-ness of the characters and their struggles more than made up for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I loved this book. Sure, some of the dialogue and ideas are simplistic. But current christian fiction rarely has this books combination of history, charachters living out the love of Christ, facing the realities of the secular world, and recognizing spiritual warfare.

The Puritans fled England were it was \\"join the official Church of England or die.\\" They landed here and treated all non-Puritans with the same contempt. Their idea of religious freedom was freedom for Puritans alone. Their idea of truth was Puritan truth alone. The author falls into the same trap many others have.

It sounds like the guys hurriedly threw some songs together just to put an album out. Stephen's voice is getting tired, Bobby's beats are mundane and it seems as if someone pushed the 1/2 speed button on Warrens' playing. He's gone from \\"shred\\" to \\"kick back\\" with his licks. The hooks are bland and boring and the songwriting is VERY poor. This new album is terrible. The only decent thing about it is Warren's guitar tone. Don't buy it if you are looking for the tradional Ratt sound. You won't find it. Uggghh, I'm glad I only paid a few bucks for it.

This actually sounds like a real Ratt album. Just had to get that out of the way. Although it sounds like Ratt, it is missing something. It's hard to put my finger on it, but I am disappointed with this. \\"Over The Edge\\" is a pretty cool tune. \\"Gave Up Givin' Up\\" is ok. \\"We Don't Belong\\" is the ballad here. It's not bad. Doesn't quite live up to \\"Givin' Yourself Away\\", though. \\"Dead Reckoning\\" is maybe my favorite cut from the CD. I really like the guitar riff and the bass at the beginning. The rest is ok. Not great, but not bad either. I would recommend this to a serious Ratt fan who wants to hear something new from the band. Otherwise, pass on it and get one of their older releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"RATT deliver their best ever!","review":"RATT returns with a CD that should propel them back to the top, if the Record Gods could be appeased to get them some airplay.

While the rest of the disc has its moments, it does not quite stack up to the intro (however the CD continues to grow on me with each listen). The production on this CD does not seem to be quite what is was in the earlier days (i.e. Invasion and Dancin Undercover). I feel Steve's vocals and Warren's guitar licks could have been sharper and mixed better. This CD reminds me of 'Reach for the Sky' and seems it was released before its time. This CD does have a lot of potential and I wish the Ratt gang would have taken a few more months and smoothed out the rough edges before shipping it to the stores. However, as a loyal Ratt and Roller I am glad I bought it and recommend it to other Ratt fans.

I think the songs on this album are awesome and seem to coincide with their previous albums sounds and styles...a little bit like all the previous albums. I recently saw Stephen Pearcy in concert promoting himself as RATT...he was terrible.

The Blotz is solid on the drums as usual, and Pearcy's vocals are solid as well. Pearcy voice sounds deeper/more throaty than in the early RATT albums and there is less use of reverb on his voice causing it to sound deeper.This album is an evolution of RATT's sound to a slightly more modern sound, and Warren;s guitar work focuses less on raw speed and more on musicality.This album is a must buy for any RATT / 80s rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Ratt albums ever!","review":"Ratt is one of my most favorite bands.Everytime I listen to them I feel good!

I'll admit John Travolta did a good job same with Robert Duvall but the movie is too low grade for them. The plot is about a town where people are dying of a possible contamination in the water. Thats where clever lawyer John Travolta comes in. At first it seems like the case is too good to be true so e immediatly signs on... Well it turns out it isn't that easy and the company Jonny-o is filing against isn't backing down... On a rating of A+ to a f I'd give it a C+.

Don't get me wrong: I like a good long movie when there is a good build-up of suspense or maybe an in-depth character study that really gets you into the movie. \\"A civil action\\" had neither I'm afraid. Although I really like Robert Duvall a lot, I have to say that the character he plays in this movie is just too strange to be more than fleetingly interesting. The story winds down from a good start to a very disappointing anti-climax.

Also, the entire firm was working on this one case, so no income was being generated.How did this all work out? Well, you'll have to see the movie.

Miranda Otto and William Fichtner both give wonderful performances. Julie and Henry's relationship troubles, together with their son's illness and the family's struggle to define itself both spiritually and emotionally, make the movie very moving. It's about trust and forgiveness as much as it's about faith. Alexy is a sweet weirdo, vulnerable and lonely, trying to work out his own issues and the sudden, earth-shattering presence of Julie in his life. His side of the plot was left very unresolved. He appears to have walked out of Julie's world as abruptly as he entered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of these reviews discourages me!","review":"If this version of the Alamo story equates with that of Allen Huffines' extreme version, then I won't buy it! A few years ago, Huffines was a consultant for another \\"Alamo\\" movie - the movie was a flop!Discriminating Customer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and needs a summary","review":"The book is set up as a series of accounts from numerous sources. Some are verified accounts and others are third-party accounts.The oldest discovered accounts are at the front of the book and the newest discovered accounts are at the back. As you might imagine \\"history\\" changes over time so that the older accounts tend to be believed while the newer ones are mostly fiction.Unfortunately this makes the reading after about a hundred pages irrelevant as the author believes the latter accounts to be false, which makes me wonder why I would want to read those accounts at all.The other aspect is there is no summary of all the accounts to give a clear picture of what really happened. I know that the author's intent was to be unbiased, but he could give the accounts then make a summary based on his investigations. This would wrap up many loose ends, which would make the book complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah's Suggestions","review":"So far, I have found this book to be a good tool for focusing on some positive ways to reconnect with my truly creative self.

Jacie is not sure what to think of the new girl, Hannah, who is a little strange. She is a good Christian...but maybe a little too good for Jacie. Meanwhile, Jacie is struggling with her art, trying to get into an art class...but is she good enough? And, how will she be able to witness to others if she freezes up every time she has the perfect oppurtunity. Will she live up to Hannah's expectations and get into the art class? And...what about her relationship with the \\"bad boy\\" at school? Read it and find out. Also read fast forward to normal. These books are great for girls ages 11-14 but older teens may enjoy something more complex like the Christy Miller series.

Boy, was I wrong. I'm not sure if it was because this book was written years ago and teaching might have been different, but there were many things that Claire did that would NEVER have been acceptable nowadays in the school system. Also, I'm not sure if this is because this book is one from a long going series, but I felt like the relationships between the characters (especially Claire and Peter Rosen's) was very unrealistic and didn't seem to have much substance. I also felt like there was much detail lacking in the story.

At first I wondered why it was never released theatrically, but when I rented the DVD, I understood. Stephan Jenkins gives one of the absolute worse performances I've ever seen. I hate to have to say that, because I love Third Eye Blind, but it's true. But it is not entirely his fault; the rest of the performances are awful as well, as are the script and the direction. Third Eye Blind hasn't released an album in three and a half years, and I cringe at the thought that part of the reason I've waited so long is because of this movie.Oh, and Stephan's co-star is Joyce Hyser, who bore her beautiful bosoms in the great 80's B-movie \\"Just One of the Guys.\\" Rent that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"art of revenge","review":"this is totally rubbish.story ok.but the shooting is unbelievable cheap. i think this is the cheapest movie ever made.the picture is the lowest quality ihave seen in bluray dont buy this film cause you will regret it for your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Seige","review":"I have just begun to read Coonts and I enjoy his books. This one was a lot less technical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finale Fizzle","review":"This book may deserve a better rating because it is a monumental story and very well written, however the ending and some of the reaches the author makes throughout this epic make is very unsatisfactory and disappointing. I personally did not read anything else by this author after being an avid reader for many years. The ending is that bad.Also there is the very 1980's steep to the whole work. It is very anachronistic today and would have been had it been written in the 70's. Much has happened since the depths of the drug wars in the 80's and we have a new understanding of the dynamics involved today. Parts of this work hinge on the desperate fear Americans had then of destruction at the hands of drug cartels which was displaced Cold War apprehension.No doubt a tremendous work, resurrecting familiar characters into an unlikely setting, the stretches and total collapse at the finale earn this one a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOUSY COONTS","review":"I have read most of Coonts' books but if I had read this one first I would have stopped completely. This story is so unrealistic is doesn't even merit fantasy. The characters are stilted and unbelievable including their names. The beginning is poor, the plot line is terrible and the ending is totally devoid of any semblance of literary know how. I have great praise for most of Coonts' other works but would recommend this one for use as a door stop only or perhaps in a writing class on how not to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Grafton novel","review":"I have enjoyed all the books I read in the Jake Grafton series. Unfortunately despite its billing, Under Siege is not one of them. Grafton's role in the story is very minor and has little to do with his skill set. In fact the most extensive involvement in the story is where he is doing something outside his military skill set. We never get to see any real Grafton decisions or actions.Overall, the story is a mediocre action story. I might have given it two stars, but I reduced it to one star because of the misleading characterization as a Grafton novel. I definitely feel I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY... Buy separate","review":"This package is WAY over priced.

Is there trickery, perhaps mass hallucinations, or has someone really raised the dead?There are some sidelights about the Washington Redskins, and an argument about who was the best quarterback of all times. Disagreement with Kate can give men a bad itch where gentlemen don't scratch.

I've purchased and used many Lexar products and have been very happy with them, but this Secure Digital unit was very disappointing.This item IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS XP, and trying to get some kind of sensible answer from the service department at Lexar about this was a joke.

Shortly thereafter, the computer would recognize that it was plugged in, but the device could not be accessed through Disk Management. It exists; it does not exist!Technical support at Lexar was no help at all. They kept skirting around the issue by sending me software to place on a device that I could not open to place the software on. When I asked if they would allow me to send the drive back to them, and they could then send me a replacement drive, they sent me another copy of the software that I couldn't use.

If you get one of these, be sure to back up any data on another device. I realize that is good advice for any medium but is especially true for these drives.The drive is so wide that it blocks a port on each side of it on my USB Hub.

On one drive, the secured files suddenly became inaccessible.The idea is good but the excecution is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I was really excited to get the JumpDrive because of the reviews I read. True, it is a lot more durable than many flash drives, but I've had so many problems that it's entirely not worth it. From day one I was unable to use it with most of the computers at school because the JumpDrive tries to install its \\"secure\\" software onto whatever computer you plug it into. Most public computers will not allow this due to all of the computer viruses going around. Unfortunately, if the software doesn't install you can't access the drive. Another problem that I've had while using it with friends' computers is that it will occasionally delete entire batches of files! I've always been careful to properly eject the device, but more than once it has deleted numerous files that I had recently saved onto it. I generally like Lexar products, but not this.

Also, as others have mentioned, this drive is so thick that it can block an adjacent USB port in addition to the one it is plugged into.

Now after uninstalling and reinstalling the software it still won't eject safely, and yanking it out of the USB port is risky. I like the idea of a secured partition, but this just isn't ready for prime time.

The way Charles Grant wrote these 'beings' was clever, because you never really know if they're human or not, even at the end of the book. You have to decide.There are spooky moments and the book was written nice and smooth. The only thing I would have liked was for a little more written on the Jackals' night prowlings. The main story line is defense against them and not more sprawled out, giving you a chance to see behind the scenes of one of their prowls.

Luckily for Bob Scharpf he moved down to Florida, far far away from Route 28 and his borderline friend Michelle.

It has examples of the many sides of Mr. Ray although it is heavy on the novelty tunes with not enough of what I think made his style so memorable. I would have liked to have seen a little more blues and jazz numbers. Nobody could deliver a soulful lyric like Johnnie Ray. However, as a collection it is still worth while if the collector does not cheat themselves out of witnessing what made this performer so great, his passionate delivery of heartfelt blues and jazz. Don't let this be the only Ray Cd in your collection, but search out the others that are more representative of his unique style. Dispite the reservations due to the subsequent boxed sets available, this is an excellent CD and well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tool that Can Change the World","review":"The media is a weapon.

Then I read the comic book series (And that was awesome!!!). Then I saw the series and sank.... I was expecting the same action packed storyline with twists and cool characters as the comic books. But it seems that the anime series was the prototype for the real story. Not only does the anime series and comic book series have different views on what the characters look like, but it is missing some of the great twists and events that the comic book storyline has in it. Then I realized that the comic book was made AFTER the series instead of BEFORE.I believe that the anime series not only has some of the worst animation I have ever seen, but definitaly the worst voice acting I have ever heard (English Audio).If you really want the GOOD Escaflowne experience instead of the AVERAGE one, Watch the movie then read the comic books and totally ignore the TV series. In other words, Don't waste your time watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a little flimsy, but it's better than nothing :)","review":"I decided to buy this \\"perfect collection\\" because I don't want to spend my entire life hunting down the older, really awesome boxset, and I don't have tons of dollars to spend on it once I do.

It has all the episodes of the show on 7 discs (I think it was 7, I'm too lazy to check), plus the Escaflowne movie. You're getting everything you want (except the really awesome box) for a price that's pretty reasonable :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Escaflowne is beautiful","review":"I watched this series when it was on Fox Kids and also on YTV in Canada.

After trudging through the first third, I realized life was too short to waste additional time, and left the book on a restaurant table for somebody else to salvage. After all, unlike a cat, I don't have nine lives. I wish I could have rated this novel with \\"0\\" stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat and boring!","review":"The story is flat and the main character Tag does absolutely nothing in the adventure. He is not exactly a hero or an animal you can understand or feel along with. Several things in the book are not explained and stay vague throughout the end, like why are the queen and king so important and who are they? For me, reading this book was a big disappointment. I saw people make comparisons, but it is in no way like Tolkien and it doesn't even come close to the quality of Tad Williams' 'Tailchaser's Song'. I will NOT buy the sequel, the golden cat - that tells you something about The Wild Road! I can strongly recommend Tailchaser's Song which has a similar storyline, but is worked out so much better with characters that will really touch you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I purchased this book because I was under the impression it would be similar to \\"The Ghatti's Tale\\". This book was very hard to read and I didn't even finish it. It jumped around and didn't seem to have any point. Not only did I buy this book that was such a disappointment, I also bought the second book and now I have two books that I won't read and wasted my money on. While I did not read the second book, I have no doubt it is as bad as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I think that some people like fantasy novels just for the sake of reading fantasy novels - regardless of the talent of the author. This author clearly has no talent. He starts off well, the story moves along, but he gets a bit too carried away with the language, to the detriment of the reading experience. Phrases like this kept popping up, \\"The sky was romantic with rain\\". What the hell is that supposed to mean? It did not tie to the story in any way - I suppose he was trying to be lyrical, poetic. Sorry ..... this kind of off-the-wall, out of left field stuff leaves me cold, takes me right out of the story.

I really did not like it. I read it to the end because I kept thinking \\"maybe it will get better and it will all have been worth it\\". But no. The main cat character was very juvenile and annoying. He is a young cat, so maybe his characteristics were \\"realistic\\", but it was still annoying. The whole \\"wild roads\\" concept was extremely strange and just not \\"believable\\" fantasy. A fantasy world needs to be built up in such a way that the reader is drawn in and finds the world believable and compelling. This was not the case for me. I scanned a few of the reviews and several people seemed to really like the book, so maybe it is a \\"loved it\\" or \\"hated it\\" book. I am still searching for a quality \\"Tailchaser's Song\\" or \\"Watership Down\\" type book. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book you CAN put down","review":"This book is, well... all I can say is FLAT. The plot is too hyped up, the characters flatter than a pancake (and just as interesting as one), and the whole thing just monotonous beyond belief. I love fantasies AND cats, and thought this would be a good one, but... well, I have to admit I put it aside many a time to re-read other novels of mine. This was ONE SLOW READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end!","review":"This book combined an animal story with some mysticism and perhaps some sci-fi. The author(s) were obviously owned by cats and loved them - studying their many traits to record them in this book. It was fun to look at things from a cat's perspective. As soon as I finished this book, I had to read the sequel, The Golden Cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"a heartwarming \\"tail\\" of cats","review":"This is right up there with Tailchaser's Song, another great book. I laughed and cried, and I was reluctant to put the book down. I especially loved the characters \\"Marsebref\\" (Mousebreath), Sealink, and little Cy, as in \\"Sign here\\" or \\"Cyber\\".It is worth reading just for Cy's dialogue! lol! She calls Tag \\"Jack\\" and \\"Silver\\" and acts strange, mostly because of the spark plug in her head (one EVIL DOING of the ALCHEMIST!!)This is great for cat lovers and especially animal rights activists who HATE people like the Alchemist (read the book to find out who he is!).This book is \\"the cream of the crop\\" in my opinion, like Tailchaser's Song. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me while I cough up a hairball","review":"I am a cat lover and a lover of good fiction. This book fails to do justice to either subject. King gives us no reason to care about his flat, uninvolving and derivative characters. There is nothing new in this so-called tale and it appears King felt compelled to repeatedly reach for a thesaurus to pad out the gruel-thin narrative. No discernable threat or villain is made clear within the first few chapters. If the so-called protagonists's mission is ever explained, it must be past the first few chapters I managed to wade through. Tell us who the \\"King and Queen\\" are and why they are so important, for instance. Nothing any of the characters do within the first 60 pages shows any sign of backbone or heart, nor compelled me to care. Comparisons to Richard Adams or Paul Gallico here are just plain pompous. The author earns one star for finding someone willing to publish this tedious morass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, I'm not impressed.","review":"Not a bad book, by any means, but not a very captivating one either. Had to make myself sit down and read it just to get finished.

Even if you -really- like cats..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Road","review":"Excellent sequel to The Golden Cat. This one picks up where The Golden Cat left off, only this time the reader is living the lives of three special kittens.

One can't help but cheer for the cats in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter who is a lover of all things Cat! The book was supposed to be for the nine to twelve age range (my daughter is nine and an advanced reader) so I felt it would be a good choice based on many positive reviews. However, about a quarter the way through the book, my daughter brought it to me and said she was uncomfortable reading any further because a cat was going to be raped! I assumed she was incorrect, but after reading the page she was at, there was indeed a potential cat-on-cat rape scene being set up. Although the character does not actually get raped, the word \\"rape\\" is used, and I don't feel this is the most appropriate subject matter for a little girl. This may very well be a great book, but parents of younger readers should be aware that there is some fairly heavy subject matter in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized technical reading...","review":"Although this book has accurate technical content, the organization is ill-thought and amounts to little more than numerous papers stapled together under a pretty cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"not so big not so smallPerfect size I would say, goes well with dark clothes of coursethe Material is pretty good, it if gets dark then just polish it a little bit and that will be all"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good early Verdi opera.","review":"This is a must for lovers of Verdi opera.

It helped me realize I was requiring him to be collect prior to him gaiting well in a loose rein. It helped me figure out what I was doing wrong by requiring him to collect and gait before he was ready. I wish the video would have been more instructional such as giving close up shots of the exact bits they were using. I also think I would have gotten more out of the video if I had watched Part I because they made reference to certain parts of that video which then lost me.

You get to see her one last time. She's old now and looks weak, but she still SHINES! She steals every scene that she's in. Unfortunately, she's not in very much, she quit the movie after only one week of filming. Once she saw how she looked on film, she was very unhappy and did not want to go on with it, she just walked off the set and never returned. If you are a fan of Bette Davis, i would say, go ahead, buy this film, just to see and have it, because it is her last film and the little bit that she is in it, she still SHINES! After she turns into the cat, though, i would say, turn it off, the movie makes no sense. Just buy it to get to see BETTE DAVIS in her last film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"The plot was jaded with little substance.

At this date...it is not on DVD yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL...EXCEPT","review":"The two previous reviews are correct: this movie was worse than bad. I was one of the unfortunate people who shelled out money to see it when it came out in limited release in 1988. The plot is ridiculous, the acting even worse. The one funny part is when Ms. Davis' stepdaughter looks at a picture of her late mother and says \\"Oh Mom, you were so good.\\" The woman in the picture is none other than Joan Crawford !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad chaos","review":"This film was Davis' last, which she left after filming for only one week and after she saw the resulting footage. Viewing the result, one can see why she left, and it isn't because the film is bad. Davis here looks haggard and old, and can barely walk or speak intelligibly any longer. The camera can no longer hide how ill she really was when this was made. It is cruelly obvious. She still manages to be magnetic and throw off sparks, however, even while standing still. The picture, a botched jumble, is memorable for only one thing: a final Davis signature line, addressed stumblingly, but with something of the old Davis clipped delivery, to a dog: \\"Are YOU a ve-ge-tar-i-an, too?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 100 Worst Film List","review":"Widely considered one of the most atrocious films of the 20th Century, \`Wicked Stepmother' lives up to all expectations.

Davis died before the film was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burning One Just For You","review":"Long time I was looking for this DVD. Came in the mail and I opened it up and what's that smell. Wow. Freshly burned DVD. Had to throw the case out as it smelled so bad. Took a while for the DVD to stop smelling. Using a slow speed disk on a high speed burn usually causes excessive heat.

The plot is very weak, and Bette Davis definitely showed good judgement by quitting this film. If you are a fan of Bette then you should by all means purchase or rent this film, as it was her last. It's the same deal with Joan Crawford fans buying Trog, as that was her last & definitely worst film. That's the only reason I bought that film & the only reason I bought this one too. . . How odd that the two actresses noted greatly for their excellent films & hatred towards eachother would both end their careers with very poor films. Incidentally this film is worse than Trog, at least that one has some campy value to it and is mildly entertaining. As I said before, this film has only one decent asset to offer: Bette Davis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"good product, but I over estimated my strength when i got this.

My morning outmeal tastes vaguely rancid with Designer Whey Natural. But, a far worse problem is its mixability. Compared to the other whey supplements I've tried, Designer Whey is by far the worst.

Also, I was wrong in my original review. Mike doesn't really sound like Nuno. Nuno was tight, precise and had a ripping technique.

I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"I held this for a while after reading some of the reviews but I actually ended up quite enjoying this book. It was different, not the typical cookie cutter hist. romance, so I liked that. Initially, I thought the heroine was going to get on my nerves...I was wondering where her gratitude was, but she eventually redeemed herself and the book improved as it progressed. I agree that the love scenes didn't leave me breathless, but I just liked the diversion from the typical storyline. The hero was a great character all the way through, both strong and compassionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really got stronger with each page!!","review":"It started a little slow for me - I did not expect to get so drawn in as I was by these two Leah and Devon. But by the time he had birthed her baby and willed them both to live - and they did I was so caught up in Devon. What a warm, sentimental caring man this rake turned out to be. And, did I say forgiving, because he certainly had more than most men to forgive of Leah. Of course at that point you do not realize how important being a father to baby Ben is to Devon. These two people just might have been destined to be together - their families at odd for years - and this baby brings them together. This really is a several hanky book by the end. Leah and Devon are a special couple and you really do feel their passion and their love!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was the first book I'd read by CM.

I didn't connect with either characters in the book and had to force myself to finish it. I have read a few other Cathy Maxwell books and found them enjoyable, but this one was a disappointment. I thought Devon was a flop for a hero and Leah wasn't much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scandalous Marriage","review":"Leah and Devon seemed so real to me. When Leah was having her baby, I felt every one of her pains, and then all her joys. Mostly, it was the uncertainty she felt about her future, yet her determination to succeed despite everything that seemed so real to me. It's been so rare lately that I can pick up a book and loose myself in the story. I really cared alot about the people in this book. I don't know if it's the way they were written that brought everyone so much to life, or if the story was just so good that I was able to loose myself in it. Or a combination of both. All I can say is I hope I find a husband someday that will love me and care about me as much as Devon loved Leah. Their feelings for each other were so strong. It was as if they were real people. I've read several books by Cathy Maxwell and have liked them all. This one is very, very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I loved this book and everything about it.

(gasp!) If you want a good laugh, this is the book for you. The love between Leah and Devon is extremely dramatic and similar to a soap opera. Leah is the typical helpless lead, weeping and swooning in the tan muscular arms of her macho Devon. Without meaning to be, the drama of this book is extremely comical because it is clichéd and fatuous. My two friends and I read this aloud to each other over the summer, and we rolled on the floor laughing. If you want a serious romance, I would not recommend this. However, if you want a light and humorous read, give \\"A Scandalous Marriage\\" a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bed money can buy!","review":"My toddler has been sleeping in this bed for 2 months now and she loves it!

It won't last through another child. The drawer never would line up quite right (one side came out more than the other due to imperfections in manufacturing) and wasn't very sturdy feeling when opening - now it hardly works, though perhaps some new screws could make it feel less flimsy. The slats that go across the bed to hold the mattress are mostly broken - I have placed a board across them to hold the mattress. The wood is soft and has some scratches in it, which I think is to be expected of a wood product and is not *that* noticeable. Unfortunately it just isn't going to make it through another child and all the broken slats are not easily replaced (if at all).

His self-titled album showcases his glorious soulful voice and proves that he can master many musical styles. What's most refreshing is that he worked with a team that encouraged eachother to explore music and try new, even risky things. The result is an outstanding album with a fresh sound while giving classic tunes a new life. Jordan Knight's debut album has all the qualities of becoming a classic itself.

I was dissapointed in that the album was not nearly as commercial as anything he sang or wrote with NKOTB.As an example, when you hear the song \\"I like it that way\\" by the BackstreetBoys -- you instantly have to sing along -- and it's incredibly infectious.Jordan's songs on this album lack hits. There is no song on the album you have to listen too again. They are all nice -- but not songs you will be humming along to after you listen to them.The album will sell well, only because his marketing dept. is working overtime and he is getting a lot of air and videotime.Sorry Jordan, I look forward to your next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"JORDAN SLIPS ON SOLO DEBUT.","review":"Jordan Knights first single \\"Give It To You\\" is the bomb, and so is the second cut \\"A Different Party\\", but than the CD falls from there, with weak ballads like \\"Separate Ways\\" which really has no melody to follow, further more the last cut a remix of \\"Give It To You\\" destroys the song with a rap medley and slip shot mixing...other than that try his NKOTB bro - Joey McIntyre, HIS album is much stronger than the first single \\"Stay the Same\\", also McIntyres vocals are much stronger. Sorry Jordan, you came out strong with the first single, and \\"A Different Party\\" may give you a little more time, but after that this CD fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive and not worth the wait","review":"If Jordan Knight did not have connections because of his former group, I would bet my bottom dollar that this cd would not be released or find radio play. \\"Give It To You\\" is simply awful, a highly unimpressive song for the first release (isn't the first release suppose to knock your socks off?). I can see why this song has struggled to even break into the Top 20. Jordan, take my advice, find another producer for your next album or look for another job."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing distinctive","review":"Being a talented musician and writer, I have to say this Cd was not worth the money.

The song \\"Give it to you\\" is a whole new sound for Jordan. It is sexy and exciting! No one would of thought to hear Jordan Knight singing about wanting to have sex! He also has a lot of other songs on his cd like \\"I can never take the place of your man\\" which is slow remix orignally sang by Price. You have a great variety of songs that really show off Jordan's talent, the cd is worth getting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan did a great job","review":"I was never a Jordan fan when the New Kids were out. But I decided to buy the album because I thought the first single was good. I figured the rest of the album would be good too. I was right. It was not only good it was great. Love this album and even if it was 3 years ago it came out I still sometimes take it out and listen to it. I really love how much Jordan showed his maturity in this album. He showed that he can really do good music. I can not wait for his next album. I know that it will be just as good as this one was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound - would be better together with his old band","review":"Totally a good record. It'd still be better if he were with his old band, the NKOTB, but this shows that he is ready to prove that he is still there and making good music even without his band. The only song out of the eleven (or twelve in European edition) which has the old band somehow involved is \\"Don't Run\\". I have two different versions of this. The one that I bought from Amazon in July because in our country the release was no earlier than September, has 11 tracks, and the one released in our country has 12 tracks. The 12th track \\"Can I Come Over Tonight\\" improves the record and is one of its best songs, along with \\"Don't Run\\". I also listen very frequently to \\"Give It To You\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It absolutely blew my mind.....","review":"Jordan Knight's new album is absolutely nothing as to what I expected.

(Maybe its because i enjoyed the harmony created by the mixture of their voices.)Over all this was a good attempt but some of the songs u had to listen to a few times before finding it catchy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is he hot or what?","review":"Though I don't necessarily care for the content of \\"Give It to You,\\" I must say that Jordan has done very well with the transition from NKOTB to solo artist. (Better than Joe, though it pains me to say it.) The tune itself is catchy and it's nice to hear Jordan's voice sans falsetto. I always wished he'd take it down an octave. He finally took the advice from someone. All in all a good song--can't wait to hear the rest of 'em. And the years have been EXTREMELY kind to him! He and Kyle Chandler (\\"Early Edition\\") are now tied for #1 on my list of fine-lookin' men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"The song, \\"Give It To You\\", takes on new meaning to \\"acceptable radio music\\" today.

As she played me \\"Close My Eyes\\", I thought, \\"Hm. That guitar sounds a lot like Kansas' 'Dust In The Wind'.\\" But then I heard \\"A Different Party\\", which, it turns out, rips off an ENTIRE BASSLINE from Sugarloaf's \\"Green-Eyed Lady\\". Try it yourself here at Amazon--listen to the sample of \\"A Different Party\\", then go to the \\"Best of Sugarloaf\\" and listen to the first track. Is any credit given? Of course not. Apparently Jordan subscribes to the Puff Daddy school of \\"song-writing\\". It's not the ripping-off that bothers me... it's the passing it off as his own. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak","review":"give it to you was catchy.Jam&lewis suppling the production on this Beatles/Queen meets Timberland type of song.but aside from that it's 3rd rate George Michael Material.he turns Prince's classic I could never take the place of your man from a rocker to an after hours cocktail lounge song.very dreadful.the guy has a alright voice but this material is way below average and is lacking any kind of feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry..","review":"Jordan has nothing on Joey McIntyre. Jordan's vocals are bland and the lyrics are an atrocity. I meant to write this 4 years ago, and oh look - now I have.Stop with the music Jordan, please spare our ears.If you want quality, purchase any one of Joey's [McIntyre] Cds - which are far better then any of the crap Jordan tries to pass off as quality. I'm only sorry I had to give this 1 star, 'zero' wasn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"so boring...i sold it as soon as possible","review":"the song \\"give it to you\\" was a rather unthoughtful, yet catchy number. however, it proved to be just another stupid pop song. except for one other unmemorable song, this album is unlively drivel, sung by a man who...cannot sing. it was one of the most boring albums i've ever listened to. if there is good r&b, i suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD was a plesant surprise!","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this CD, I mostly wanted it for \\"give it to you\\" and since the full CD was only a few bucks more I figured I'd give it a shot...well was I ever surprised! Jordan has a GREAT voice and the material is really different. I just leave it in my CD player and listen to it all of the time. Really worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His album was better than ever I expected !! GREAT !!","review":"well, I was a bit confused to buy Jordan's CD cause Joey's album was less than I expected.. but I was totally surprised by his musical maturity and developement conspicuously !!!!! esp his felasto is the best ever I heard..and I'm sure of his huge success !! Success doesn't come overnight. I think Jordan did his best to make this album ..I love this CD so much and I highly recommand this CD for everyone who loves music.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth The Wait","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD. I was a New Kids fan when I was younger, but lost interest in them a long time ago. When I heard Jordan was releasing an album I went ahead and bought it figuring it was worth a try. I thought it would sound like the old New Kids songs, but I was pleasantly surprised. This album has a much more mature sound. I absolutely loved the remake of \\"Never Take The Place of Your Man\\" finding it far better than the original. It's difficult to make a remake better than the original but Jordan seems to pull it off, giving the song a tenderness that the original did not possess. \\"Give It To You\\" and \\"Different Party\\" have a very interesting sound to them and make great dance songs. \\"Broken By You\\" and \\"When You're Lonely\\" are wonderful ballads with beautiful lyrics. I did find the other slow songs to be a bit monotonous though. Overall this is a great album and I can't wait to hear more from Jordan Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"This is quite simply one of the best albums ever produced. Jordan Knight is a severly underrated vocalist and has a falsetto that could rival anyone's. It has production by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Robin Thicke (formally Thicke) and by JK himself. If you are a fan of melody and true vocalists this album is for you. Don't let Jordan Knight's past allow you to miss out on this wonderful masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Male Artist!","review":"The reason I say best male artist is because I of my personal opinion. Anyway, this is one of the greatest CD's I have ever heard. It has great songs and I don't know what CD the people who wrote it was bad because it is unbelievable. There are many songs with really good lyrics. My favorite track is \\"Change My Ways.\\" And the CD is very easy to like right from the first time you put it on. I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful CD. Jordan Knight is one of the most underrated and most talented artist today."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Grows On You!","review":"Well, the first time I reviewed this CD I only gave it three stars... but after seeing Jordan Knight live in concert the other night, I must say that he is one great performer. His songs are incredibly amazing and full of life when sung live, and now the songs I once bashed are now growing on me and I give this CD two more stars! The songs/voice are impressively diverse and definitely full of emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ears are spoilt by his music","review":"He is back, finally. He is still damn cute. And he is still a good singer with a high voice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a surprise","review":"I was so skeptical about buying this CD because I thought it would be a showcase of what \\"trying too hard\\" was all about, but I was (still am!) in love with \\"Give it to You\\" so I decided to give it a chance. This CD was quite simply the best one I bought in 1999. The range and depth of the songs are so amazing. I was totally blown away, especially by the second half of the CD. Songs like \\"Separate Ways\\" and \\"Close My Eyes\\" are such beautiful songs about lost loves. This CD is amazing. There are no other words for it. Kudos to Jordan for making a CD that means something."},{"rating":"2","title":"half great","review":"I was never a fan of the New Kids but I love Jordan's voice and half-love his neo-soul CD. The Jimmy Jam-Terry Lewis cuts really outshine the other stuff, although Finally Finding Out and the Thom Bellish When You're Lonely are very good. Next time, Jordan, hire Jam and Lewis to steer the entire enterprise. You make a great team. They get many more interesting shades out of your already interesting voice. P.S. Best single of the year so far: Give It To Me. Broken by You and Close My Eyes are outstanding ballads, despite what the main Amazon.com review says. Close My Eyes should be your next video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning for different book on type","review":"This book seems to give a good history of type, but was hard to read for me. Pages were very busy with lots of sidebars, making it difficult to read, and many good layout examples were small and in black and white. I'm returning this book. If you want one good, easy to read book on type, get Ellen Lupton's \\"Thinking with Type.\\" Less information, but much easier on the eyes to read, concise and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content, beautiful layouts","review":"As another reviewer has said, every designer (and anyone who works with designers -- developers, copywriters, etc.) should read & own this book.Contains an excellent combination of history and advice that will make you a better visual communicator. The sheer breadth of content makes it relevant to students and old pros, and White writes in such a way that it's accessible to any reader.Couldn't put it down when it arrived, and have referred to it several times since. Best book on type out there. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I've heard everything the puppets released except for three records (forbidden places, monsters, and too high to die), and so far I rank this as their worst effort.It's a much more radio-friendly effort than their earlier works. That in and of itself is not always a bad thing, but this cd really bores me.I guess Automatic Mojo is decent, but I MUCH prefer the version that appears on LIve in Montana. As far as I'm concerned the only essential song on here is Sexy Music.The rest of the album is OK at best. Bad Love and Dry Rain are my least favorite puppets songs ever. How anemic can a chorus get?Instead of Huevos, you should get Meat Puppets II or Out My Way. Live in Montana is also very good, and I also really liked their debut album (although not recommended for beginners, as its incoherent mumble/scream vocals might turn some people off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh yeah, Party Rock, Wow...snore.","review":"This is the one I could never, ever warm up to. The album sounds like it was written AND recorded in four days, by ZZ Top's little brothers no less. Buncha dumb, more-generic-than-Bad Company rock tunes written for the band to play live and, I imagine, live out their adolescent Rock God fantasies on stage. Sorry, but I'm a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tai Chi video","review":"This is a great video for anyone new to tai chi. Multiple angles are used to take into account that you are doing the movements from home. The instruction is clear and there's a great warmup segment that describes the correct way to do the exercises. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE EMPOWERING WORKOUT- TAI CHI","review":"This is an excellent workout video,focusing on healing Tai Chi movements. Very good for back pain. The video is also quite visual, with nature videos playing in the background of the instructors. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tai Chi DVD","review":"I was surprise at first because i didn't expect this DVD to be as complete at it is.Great teacher and the extra are amazing really completi recommend this DVD 100%"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good color and fabric","review":"I ordered the sage color and it's just right. The fabric is good...not flimsy or thin. The instructions were easy and I was able to put it on quickly. After ironing and fitting/tucking it just right, it looks wonderful and cost much less than re-upholstering the chair. This is an antique so smaller than most wing backs made today so I was concerned, but the tie backs in the back help give it a tailored look and after tucking fabric into the \\"wings\\" and around the seat cusion, everything looked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I thought from the picture that natural was white but it is actually more like tan. The fabric is notgreat, barely feels like cotton. Does not really fit tight on the chair. Does definitely not look likethe picture that advertise this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality fabric - little better than muslin!","review":"I bought a cover with similar description several years ago, and it is much nicer, heavy-duty fabric. This doesn't lay or drape well at all because it is so flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected.","review":"This slipcover was not at all as pictured. It may as well have been a painter's dropcloth from the hardware store. The color was drab, and the cover itself just did not fit well. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unexceptional gathering of current stars in the field","review":"Hartwell's not a particularly adept editor. He's taken with a lot of star power and evidently lets a writer's prestige be the only criterion for inclusion in his anthologies. Most of these stories are competently written, but they lack spark, that sense of wonder that used to fill the field until about 15 years ago. It's like a lot of rock music these days: great talent with nothing much to say. How some of these stories made it into a \\"year's best\\" book is beyond me, but one thing is clear. The science fiction field is running dry. No story here has a decent (or even a twist) ending. Nothing here is genuinely memorable. I so much wanted these anthologies to be a counterpoint to the drab Dozois anthologies, but they aren't. If this is the best we can do, then I'd say we're in trouble. (And the sad part is that younger readers don't know how good science fiction used to be.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Having the measurements of the items was really helpfull.

I placed my order on December 5th. I waited and waited, and it never shipped. Ten days later, on December 15, I contacted the seller, asking if and when they were going to ship my item. No response. Three days later, on December 18 (one day after the delivery window according to the seller), I wrote them again, saying if they didn't respond by December 20, I was going to file a claim with Amazon.

I ordered this with several other films. The packet states that it has English closed captions.However, it does not and I was unable to watch the movie because of this.I really wish that DVD companies would learn what the word \\"closed captioned\\" means before putting it on their DVDs. I also wish they would remember to put the English captions on.This is about the 10th time that I have bought a film and found out that it isn't captioned despite having the \\"CC\\" signature or the \\"Closed captioned\\" phrase on the back cover. Why can't DVD companies remember to put the captions on when they have it on their \\"Extras\\" list on the back of the DVD cover????I have to say that experiencing this error several times has really made me appreciate the good DVD companies that actually do put the closed captions on their DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Beautiful!","review":"I wish I had the money for the copper Enclume potracks, but this one was equally stylish, functional and within my budget.

The only problem I had with this book is that some of the stories were repeated and I had to stop and think \\"Okay, she mentioned that in Chapter 2\\" and go on. When she describes the day she picked up her new daughter and cried upon taking her in her arms, I cried too. If you are considering adoption in China, start with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Highly Recommended","review":"I ordered this book after hearing the author interviewed on NPR. I was not disappointed. Although this book is about many things (the author's own experiences with the Chinese adoption process, for instance), the most truly valuable aspect of the book is the insight it gives into the Chinese political and cultural situation that has led to the current child abandonment situation. Evans presents a culturally sensitive explanation of the history and the culture. This book has helped me answer many of the questions that I frequently am asked about Chinese adoption. I'm considering buying several copies to give to family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves you wondering","review":"I just finished this book and after about the 10th time of hearing about there not being enough girls to match the quota of young men in China I began to wonder if the author was for or against adoption from China. According to her there will be a war breaking out when these boys grow up and have no girls to marry. I really liked the book at first - but the repetition got old and harder to read about midway through."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the father of a newly adopted Chinese daughter, this book is Fantastic!","review":"If you are remotely interested in adopting from China, or have an interest in the the policies of China and their view of girls, this is a must read book. My wife and I recently returned from China where we adopted the most precious beautiful angel. This book outlines the gut wrenching agony of mothers who do not want to give up their daughters, their struggles and their frustration with the China policies. It also follows a family from San Francisco as they wait and wait for the process to happen and they joy the experience as they receive their child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"The book \\"China's Lost Daughters\\" is part memoir part history lesson into the dynamics of American families adopting Chinese girls. Evans weaves her own adoption journey with the eco-socio-political environs of China. Her research is thorough, though I found first-hand snapshots of the society from the local Chinese lacking. Though she covered most aspects of the East-West adoption, there was no firsthand experiences from the mothers who gave up their daughters. Evans uses secondhand knowledge, from the workers at the orphanages and the Chinese adoption officials, and her imagination. The other aspect of the East-West adoption that is not addressed is the effect on the adopted girls who are only grade school age. The limitations of the book are due to its purpose as a public memoir for her daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Daughters of China","review":"Since my own daughter is in the process of adopting a baby from China, I thought this book would give me insight in the whole process. The author is from the Bay area so we had much in common.The book was very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening!","review":"This book is very eye opening. Evans paints such a clear picture of the problem with the one child policy in China while at the same time telling the story of her journey to adopt a daughter from China. This book was both heart wrenching and heart warming. After reading this book, I felt as thought I had just experienced a long talk with a close friend about her personal adoption story.This book is great information for everyone, not just those interested in international adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and still timely","review":"This is still the preeminent resource. I have read so many memoirs, stories, studies and the like in this subject area. I want to be very informed as I have adopted from China. I read this one before I went to China and was awaiting our referral. Some of the material is a tad dated but the essence still holds true. There isn't a better resource to read in my opinion. The Children Can't Wait by Laura Cecere is also fabulous but more stilted but well worth your time if you can find a copy. The Lost Daughters of China is fabulous and worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a question...","review":"I haven't seen this...please tell me the word in the title is home, not ho...Thank you...it will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Thomas at his best!","review":"Typical fantastic writing of Don Thomas.

Some of these I had forgotten over the years since they are generally not played on most of the radio stations and it was pleasent to hear them again in their original form. If you like the kind of Christmas songs from those times, this album will be a plus to have when you're in the mood for some holiday nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Needs To Warn This Is Region B","review":"Unfortunately I did not read all 107 customer reviews before I ordered this to discover that it's actually Region B and will not play on most US players (the US is region A).

Kenneth Clark succeeds in making philosophy, art, architecture pleasant and easy to understand to everyone.A must to understand better the History of European Civilisation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever charming and inspiring","review":"I first saw this landmark series in high school over thirty years ago. It opened up a whole new world of art, archtecture and culture for me. I've watched it numerous times since, and have now finally purchased my own copy (all of which I viewed in two days!). I find Kenneth Clark charming, with an unusual combination of humility and confidence. The episodes are all filmed on site in Europe and are accompanied by music of the period. Very civilised entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civilisation by Kenneth Clark","review":"Civilisation es una de las mejores series sobre la cultura occidental que he visto. Los acertados comentarios de Lord Clark sobre cada uno de los periodos de Europa occidental, así como la belleza de las imágenes mostradas a lo largo de la serie hacen que tener esta serie valga la pena. Lamentablemente solo esta en inglés, pero aún así se puede aprovechar los subtítulos para los que no entendemos totalmente este idioma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality DVD","review":"Although the substance of Lord Clark's epic series remains bright, the medium does not. This is a series about great art, yet the BBC made no effort at all to remaster the original for these DVDs, which leaves the viewer with little art to appreciate. The colors are faded out to the point that sometimes it is difficult to see there is color at all; sepia is a dominant color and lush landscapes look barren. Some of the scenes have those old film cracks and scratches. It looks like it was merely duped to DVD from someone's 30 year old VHS tape.Bad show, BBC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"To my regret I have discovered that these Blu rays are Area 2 and unplayable in the U.S. Nowhere on the set does it say anything about area; it merely lists the format as \\"BD50x3 & BD25x1.\\" However the BBC's website lists the set as area 2 -not the U.S. It is conceivable that some U.S. players will play these discs, although my Denon DBP-2010ci will not. Of course, Amazon is good about returns, but they should investigate and change their statement that the discs are playable in all areas. Very disappointing because it was a wonderful program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Spain?","review":"Spain was, during the Middle Ages, a place where Muslims, Jews and Christians coexisted. While in England, Jews were expelled in 1290, Spain gave them the possibility of conversion in 1478. Spain gave economic support to Christopher Columbus to discover and christianize new lands in 1492. Juan de la Cosa traced the first world map including the new territories of America in 1500. However, Martin Waldseemuller made another one in 1507 naming these territories America after Americo Vespucio. Why Vespucio and not De la Cosa? Spanish professionals have been frequently ignored throughout history. Spaniards kept an Empire that dominated all of the American continent from the south of the US to the Southern Cone and a large part of Europe. Spain had a golden age of art giving artists such as Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca, Miguel de Cervantes, Velázquez or Murillo. However, that is not enough to include at least one chapter on Spain. Thank you BBC for sponsoring the Black Legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I remembered this series when it first aired on BBC, it has not aged well. Kenneth Clarks opinions do not seem relevent now. The CDs are great quality unlike some of the reviewers stated, just not worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"This program was intended for the British television public and therefore is slanted at the 15 year old level. As a result it is mostly visuals of buildings and paintings with superficial comments. The Lovejoy program had more detailed statements about art than this program.The commentary of the producer on the last disk reveals that the entire purpose of the program was to show off color television. This explains the concentration on architecture and paintings with inane commentary at the high school level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"It is ridiculous to call this \\"civilisation\\". The whole thing is glorification of White Christianity, with no importance given to any other religion or non-white part of the world. Kenneth Clark is also a very boring presenter, and the script does not help.Words like \\"barbarians\\" are used very freely. Mr Clark is a personification of a bigoted white christian.There are much better choices available to give an overview of some of the periods covered by this set, e.g. \\"The Medici Godfathers of the Renaissance\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work on our Blu-Ray player","review":"We live in California and bought a Magnovox Blu-Ray player about 3 years ago. This player has played all our fifty Blu-Ray discs without a hitch until we received the \\"Civilization\\" disc. We can can hear the audio but there is none of the program video. The box does not appear to have a country or region code. It does have the number \\"2\\" above the word \\"Entertain\\" on several sides of the box. It may need a player capable of playing region B formatting. Another reviewer reported that it works on some more up-to-date players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating History","review":"This is a personal view of the history of civilization by Sir Kenneth Clark.

He views himself as somewhat divine and claims that Yeshua is black. Whether or not Yeshua is black makes no difference to me, it's the premise that the color of Yeshua's skin is an understanding that is paramount to belief in the \\"true\\" Messiah.I am a Messianic Jew and an avid reader.

All 26 episodes of the complete series are spread throughout 4 DVDs. The qulity, while not remastered, is excellent. The insert- with info, bios, and interviews supplied by August Ragone -may contain spoilers but is a wonderful addition.

She also is far and above most contemporary writers, touching on more complex topics than \\"I'm 30 and still single -- yikes!\\". Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zeitgeist Writer of Our Time","review":"Candace Bushnell is one of the great zeitgeist writers of our time. Sex and the City was a groundbreaking expose of the 30-something woman's quest for love; 4 Blondes expertly described the 4 types of women that you don't want to be friends with; and Trading Up was a brilliantly insightful characterization of the \`modern day celebrity'. I've been dying to see what Candace would come up with next, and I wasn't disappointed.Lipstick Jungle is a novel about three powerful 40-something women. It explores the changing dynamic between men and women in our modern day world. In this novel the women make more money than their husbands, they have high powered corporate jobs, and families. This novel is a wonderfully insightful look into the lives of powerful women today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This novel was a great read.

And then it's as if CB just felt like stopping at that particular point (the end). I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am not a fan of this book.As with Sex and the City, we are led to believe that this book is about women who value themselves, their careers, and their friends, and I certainly support that. However, in this book, one character lies to get her manager's job, although he hasn't done anything wrong, while she is busy cheating on her husband. Another woman hardly knows her own children and is upset when her husband wants to help take care of them, who we are clearly supposed to dislike. A third woman gets drunk and trash-talks her future boss.I have enjoyed books before when I didn't like the main characters, but Ms. Bushnell made no effort to humanize any of the characters in this novel. All the characters felt two-dimensional, and most of them were whiny or stupid to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"In Sex and the City fashion, this book is a great read about the female movers and shakers in Manhattan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tad disappointed","review":"I wanted to like this book. Started it with a lot of anticipation. But was rather disappointed.Somehow the characters of the three strong women - Victory, Wendy and esp. Nico are nice in the beginning. They are strong independent women who are doing well in their careers. Great - we get that. But beyond that, the only thing the book tries to do is preach that women have it tough in the corporate world and that they should stick together and encourage other women.Not too bad but just bland is what I thought this book was. Maybe the series is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and the City: REPEAT","review":"Just because she is the brain behind Sex and the City, doesn't mean she should have copied herself again...lipstick jungle is a wanna be Sex and the City - I kept wanted Carrie to show up or Samantha...been done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from a page turner","review":"This book was rather dull compared to the last one. I absolutely loved 4 blondes, trading up was decent, but it wasn't good until the end. This book is a far cry from the others. It lacked the passion and excitment that the other books and sex and the city held. I really liked Wendy Healy's character, and I thought the only interesting plot in the book with her divorce, but after while it was depressing. Nico's affair was hot, but only a few pages were wrote about it. Overall the characters in the book just had a bunch of boring problems with their careers, which was rather repeatative. Although I do get bored with the constant man problems in books, she didn't have enough romance and scandal in this book. Frankly after this book I think that Candance Bushnell, is starting to lose her young audience.Vixenchick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Lipstick Jungle was not a great read. It started off with interesting characters, but the women ended up being superficical and inconsistent. The part that I hated the most was that Candance Bushnell developed difficult circumstances for her characters, and than appeared to get tired of the story, and just resolved all the problems. I mean she went from one chapter where everything was terrible to the next chapter where everything was \\"just peachy!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent and uninspired","review":"While this book continues along the lines of a \\"Sex and the City\\" type atmosphere of girlfriends, their boyfriends and/or husbands, and the high life of New York City, Bushnell is unabashedly blunt in her feministic intentions. It seems the book is written solely for this goal; you start to get involved in the plot, only to be drawn back to the reality and transparency of Bushnell's feminist intentions with an ill-timed comment. The idea that women can be successful and multi-talented in the fast-paced business world of big cities, while juggling friends, emotional issues, and familes, is a good one, but these ideas of woman-power are poorly executed. They are juxtaposed strangely with the plot--any inspired reader would understand her motive without these ill-placed, blatant reminders every other page or so, which I found distracting.Aside from that, the plot was OK, but not the \\"page turner\\" as labeled by Publisher's Weekly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nitwitlit","review":"A co-worker loaned me this book and it failed my \\"first paragraph\\" rule which is, if I'm not hooked by then I usually pass. But I gave it a try for the sake of camraderie. How does the stuff Bushnell writes get published? Do her editors actually read this pap? It's not literature, it's nitwitlit. My rating? Two eyelids down. If amazon allowed a rating of less than 1 star, I'd give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More money, more problems...","review":"Candace Bushnell's latest novel takes us once again inside the penthouses on the prosperous streets of New York City. Nico, Wendy, and Victory are some of the city's power players, but unfortunately, they also have some power problems. Lucky for us, since these problems are what ultimately drive the plot of this escapist novel.What I appreciate about this novel, and about Bushnell's characters overall, is that no matter how prominent or important her female protagonists are, they are friends. The talk show style backstabbing is left to minor characters so that readers see true female friendships grow and develop.Lipstick Jungle is a fun and delightful read that ultimately leaves readers wondering if money and power is all that it is cracked up to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Every woman knows that you need to combine two men to make one decent one.\\"","review":"..so says Victory Ford in Lipstick Jungle, a wonderful novel by Candace Bushnell.

Victory Ford is a top of line and in demand designer. Nico O'Neilly is considered one of the most powerful women in publishing with her role as editor of BONFIRE MAGAZINE. Wendy Healy rounds out the trio as a leader in the movie industry. These three women must navigate these male dominated worlds with the power, intelligence and drive that they all possess. This is a wonderful novel that allows the reader a glimpse at a world full of power, seduction and scandal and the women who run it. It has been reported that this novel is in production to be a television series. Candace Bushnell certainly has her finger on the pulse of what women want. We are very much looking forward to all of her future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIRST EDITION OF THE ART OF WAR?","review":"If you are a Candace Bushnell fan, or just looking for an enjoyable fun read, this book fits the bill.It could have used some more careful editing. Nico, one of the main characters, tries to woo an advertiser to her magazine by spending $1,000 to buy him a FIRST EDITION copy of the Art of War (by Sun Tzu). Pretty neat trick, considering that this book was written about 2,500 YEARS ago in Chinese!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really what women have become?","review":"I know this is a work of fiction, but apparently it was based on real women the author knows. I cannot imagine wanting to know the three female lead characters in this novel. If you enjoy reading about cheating, scheming, whining, selfish women, then this is the book for you.

I'm sorry I wasted the time and the $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candace Bushnell","review":"I am a young woman and I cannot accept that Candace Bushnell is a feminist.

Ok, so I was expecting too much from the author after Sex and the City, but please - this was not a page turner. I forced myself to keep reading till the end, hoping that somehow somewhere the creativity and talent I know Bushnell possess' would somehow come out. It didn't and I was completely let down! The women are powerful and rich, but they had absolutely no substance, they were your typical women fighting to be successful, you can pick up any magazine and read about the same struggles women have everyday in real life. The only thing compelling about this book was that I was compelled to throw it out after reading it, as I didn't have the heart to pass this drivle on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling drivel","review":"No way you can keep interested with the rambling and roaming.....The characters are never really 'met'.

How can anyone identify with these super-powerful and rich women? Buying your ex-husband a flat right next to yours so you can both be next to the kids? And so unimaginative.

Read it if you have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lipstick Jungle","review":"Pretty decent book, the show doesn't do this book justice.

Each woman's story is embedded with trials, tribulations, but because of their moxy they survive. (Can you hear them singing \\"I will survive!\\"?) Cynthia Nixon's audio version was quite well edited, and Nixon does an excellent job with characterizations. I enjoyed listening as I tooled back and forth to work. I would recommend this audio book. I'm thinking maybe I'd like the novel, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tired really hard to enjoy it","review":"I tried really hard to enjoy this book. I kept reading even though I was bored out of my mind. I got through about half of the book before I realized it is not going to get better, and I should not waste another minute of my life trying to finish it. I gave it away to a friend to see if it was only me who thought it was stupid and trite. My friend could not get through the first 3 chapters, and she gave it back to me.I donated it to the local library only because I did not want to waste the paper it was printed on. As much as I hated it, there are people with different tastes who might enjoy it. Cheers to you if you do, it was just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This novel is about success, friendship, and believing in oneself. Every woman who dreams about making it big should read Lipstick Jungle. And the great thing about Candace Bushnell is that she gets her message across with flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Precious Time: BORING","review":"Sometimes you just want to read a trashy novel, full of gossip and twists and scandal. Not so here. Promises are broken with this novel from the \\"Sex and the City\\" famed author.Boring is the word to describe this, and possibly ludicrous. Kept waiting for someone's husband to turn out gay, or someone's lawyer or P.I. to catch someone doing something, but NOPE... even though she kept edging closer and closer to a decent scandalous twist, she never delivered.Save your money and time and read some old Olivia Goldsmith for a good trashy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, cliché, thoroughly ridiculous","review":"The lack of imagination in this book is incredible (it is, in fact, the only incredible thing about it). Ms. Bushnell merely takes clichéd ideas of powerful, wealthy men's lives and applies them to four women. The result reads like a collection of phony Playboy short stories -- only with female names.There is really very little character development. I had no feelings one way or the other for any of the characters.Also, there is no development of the relationships between the women. There's just no glue there -- it is as if it were written about three unrelated strangers.Additionally, it's one of those books where you keep waiting for something to happen -- and nothing ever does.Sorry, but I really found nothing entertaining in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why three plot lines?","review":"Candace Bushnell wrote \\"Lipstick Jungle\\" from the perspective of three different narratives: Wendy, the movie executive, Nico, the editor of chief of Bonfire magazine and Victory, the fashion designer.At times it gets sort of confusing who is who and the reader is left with the feeling that the author had three good ideas for three new books and somehow put them all in one. It is interesting however, to see Selden Rose, a character from \\"Trading Up\\", reappear in this novel, good to know that he has recovered from the failed marriage to Janey Wilcox.All in all the relationship between the three main characters remains unclear throughout the entire book, they just seem to be acquainted with each other for no apparent reason, occasionally talk or lunch together and talk about their individual lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettably DULL","review":"What a boring book- and believe me, I read it till the BITTER end. Ms. Bushnell is not creative nor very talented when it comes to writing. She has potential, but it remains untapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Scared By the Women Who Liked This Book","review":"PLEASE DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN if you enjoyed this book. The world doesn't need anymore neglected kids. This book made me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same city, lame story!","review":"For years and years, we've hungered for the stories of the rich, the famous, the powerful. Some of the stories end up becoming great literature, others more forgettable yet still highly enjoyable. This book sets us up for a yet another fairly predictable SEX IN THE CITY version of the world and of women's lives and yet miserably fails even that two-dimensional, whiny and petty world. In just the first chapter, the characters and the all-too-predictable nasty events to come are offset by breathless, insider observations to make the rest of us feel like we're in on a great big secret world. Unfortunately for Ms. Bushnell, she's written a book for a world that few of us really care about, and not particularly well. Don't bother with this. And please, don't paint it with the \\"chick lit\\" title. It doesn't deserve to be alongside some truly splendid and involving novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For the most part, I found this novel to be lacking in character development and devoid of any significant themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"A very lightweight, predictable look at three fortyish, attractive, and achieving women who are at or near the top in their fields of movie executive, magazine publisher, and fashion designer. There is no plot per se. The book mostly consists of a series of scenarios for triumph and enhancing status, generally at the expense of devious and loutish men. The few difficulties that they have, ranging from their own infidelity, divorce from, of course, a no-account husband, or overbearing executives, are easily overcome with reputations and situations remaining intact, if not improving. Of course, their own shortcomings are largely unquestioned.The author creates a fantasy world of implausible, even cartoonish, people who are immune from everyday realities and consequences and float through the world of the rich. Despite all of the celebritiy emulation, the book has no pizazz; it's just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"What sort of racist trash is this? As an Asian, I was extremely insulted by the occasional racial slurs against Asians in this book. Chinese people like nothing better than eating dogs? Japanese men are still saying outdated sexist things like \\"Men know better, women no listen?\\" I stopped reading after the first few chapters, which I only read because I was bored out of my mind. I'm a big fan of chick lit, but even I thought it was pretty damn bad writing. Sex and the City may have gained fame by being incorporated into a TV series, but that doesn't have anything to do with Bushnell's writing skills--it's just about the plot. Yet another brainless book by a talentless hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Awful.","review":"Bushnell parenthetically inserts herself three times in this book to explain various trite phrases this way: \\"It was a cliche, but it was true.\\" This whole book is a cliche. And it might be true. But by the time it's over, you won't care. You'll just be glad to be free of these half-inch-deep characters.Sure, there's the average writing. And the unbelievably obtrusively contrived \\"twists\\". And the way that you can look across the book to see the ending the way you can look across Texas to the horizon. But mostly I was overcome with feeling very sorry for Bushnell, if \\"Trading Up\\" and this book represent the way she views people. And I felt horrified for her husband, to whom the book is dedicated, because there's only one male (man or boy) in the book who isn't a cuckold and/or a complete jerk, and that one is a cardboard cutout.That was the last book of hers that I'll ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing","review":"I just didn't love the characters. I didn't believe in them, despite my love of chicklit on occasion. It all felt got-up, as if Ms Bushnell had gone out and read a lot of books on how to be a dress designer etc. It also felt absolutely feral with slavering envy and that's not comfortable. And some of it just seemed incredible. I am now leaving my computer and going to Manhattan where I'm hoping my English accent will net me 150 k a year as a nanny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"CB's latest book is 200 pages of repeating \\"women can have a job and a family and succeed in powerful careers\\" said in many different ways. Although I agree w/ the author that it is possible for women to have it all, she presented three characters who are not unusual. Their jobs were unique, but one woman was single with no kids, and the other two had kids, but also had stay at home husbands. Point is, they were working all the time, but they had as much help as they needed for their personal life. On top of that, the plot goes just about no where and it's not even that fun to read.

Prepared to risk it all, Paul rose to the challenge of the emotional and physcial aspect of being a firefighter. Rather than allow herself to be a \\"victim\\" of the system (as too many minority probies do) she trained to become a respected firefighter.

I also felt implicated by the larger story, wherein Paul prosecutes her own preconceived notioins about becoming one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco - and thereby nailed all of us who presume right and wrong are easily defined by color, gender and court order.

The idea for Carbon Canyon was good but I find that there are certain aspects of the canyon that are just stupid. If you skip a race and come back to it later they still have the same car and if you are driving a Lamborghini you can not overtake them. And they never crash off the cliff and you cannot make them crash.

He just can't stop himself from ramming his opinions down the reader's throat. It reads like a novel punctuated by political speeches from his student days.

A typical customer would need a Ph.D. in TV-ology to tweak the multitude of settings available for optimizing picture. At the very least, it is necessary to change the \\"vivid\\" picture mode to \\"normal\\". Others (on similar Samsung TV's) have suggested \\"movie\\" mode but the color scheme is very yellow and washed-out. The HD broadcasts look quite nice, but anything else, including DVD's via component cables from a progressive-scan player, are very disappointing. Not surprisingly, standard-definition broadcasts (digital, via satellite in my case) looked terrible. Also, the contrast ratio should be much better for a small TV at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Picture!","review":"I bought this display primarily for a computer monitor and secondarily as a HDTV for my daughter's dorm room. It's a GREAT HDTV and a so-so monitor. The 'stretched' appearance of everything takes some getting used to and I have yet to find a control that allows me to adjust horizontal and vertical display size. It does have the ability to adjust position but, not size. (Important for computer monitors as typical computer graphic display output resolutions do not correspond well to TV resolution.)

Frankly, I don't see how, because it gets on my nerves after 15 seconds. It makes this squeaky \\"yip\\" sound about 3-4 time per second (yes, per SECOND), and it's obnoxiously loud.No, you can't turn the sound off, but I was able to take it apart and cut the wire to the noisemaker inside.

I mean all of this in a brutally honest fashion to let you know how much fun this is for kids. The track comes apart with a bit of nudging and sometimes it's not straight enough for the penguins to go all the way but you just tweak it as you go no problem.

Juice sounds great on 17 of the 19 tracks. (Why the 1975 single \\"Love Is A Word\\" was included, I'll never understand.) Juice has one of the most versatile voices in music, easily slipping back and forth from rock to country. Still, if you're only beginning to cut your teeth on Juice's music, I would recommend the Cd \\"Juice,\\" which is amazing or \\"Ain't Gonna Cry,\\" which is currently out-of-print but definitely worth the hunt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good for a while.

I am personally sorry I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have if you appreciate Korn's talent...","review":"...and not just their raw energy and ability to pull off a really great live show. LAPD features James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer, David Silvaria,and Fieldy from Korn, as well as an otherwise unknown vocalist who tends to be very--well--annoying. I got it mostly because I wanted to hear Munky play lead guitar. It's too easy to dismiss Korn's guitarists because they don't play lead like so many bands with only one. It's very apparent that the three Kornsters in this band are very talented even outside their eventual genre. David plays a less hip-hop drum on this album, Fieldy has far less of the clicky bass that Korn fans are accustomed to, but I personally thought the real treat was Munky's inventive leads and powerful riffs that eventually translated into Korn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn before they were Korn","review":"Believe it or not this was the band \\"KoRn\\" before KoRn exsisted. It is evident in the powerful riffs played by James \\"munky\\" shaffer that he influence a lot in Korn's first and later albums. The high energy almost-disco-like drums brought to all of us by David Silveria (now the drummer to korn) are so much influeced buy grove music you can't help but dance. And of course the low clicky bass sound buy Regginald \\"fieldy\\" arvizu just leaves us in awe at the end of every song. So if you like korn and want to hear the earlier stuff (w/out Jon Davis's awesome, pain influenced vocals, sad to say) then get L.A.P.D. Some if it will make you giggle but you cannot help but appreciate their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not KoRn, but its not bad, not bad at all...","review":"It was very hard finding this album and when I found it I had to get it to see what Korn sounded like before they were really Korn. On some tracks you can hear a lot of Korn sounding heavy riffs. For example there is an interlude on the song \\"Excuse Me\\" that sounds like it was used in the song \\"Need To\\" on Korn's first album. Musically the album is a cross between hardcore thrash metal and funk rock. There are some tracks where the band sounds like a heavier version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but most of the songs are powered by James Shaffers crunching guitar riffs and David Silvera fast paced drumming. The singer however is horrible. Well not horrible just nothing next to Jonathon Davis. As for Shaffer's lead playing, its nothing special. I think he's a much better rhythm guitarist. Fieldy's also got some phat bass lines on this album. Anyways its a good album and I recommend it to fans of Korn."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Only for KoRn fReaKs! *","review":"Everything except the singing in this album was good.

Well at over 500 pages it's NOT taut! I realize people reading financial thrillers envy their protagonists (the \\"wannabe\\" effect), but the portrayal of the protagonist here is annoyingly silly and shallow: keeps gloating about his Ivy education, berating everyone else, travelling the world etc etc etc.As a result the FEW chunks of financial and political plot (the dynamics of distressed debt default in syndicated loans, elasticity of oil with other markets, the details of algorithmic trading by what is known today as VWAP, TWAP etc.) are watered down with too much annoying, long winded, completely inconsequential tripe pertaining to the \\"high culture\\" of the protagonist. You get the idea. Bleah. The tripe to plot ratio in this book is over 60%. This book could be a \\"good\\" 200 page read. Instead we are treated to the author's diarrhea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, charming read","review":"A penniless and isolated small-time London actress suddenly finds that she has inherited a lovely old home on the coast of Devon, and insists on living there, despite its isolation and her lack of money to maintain it.She finds marvelous people and overcomes her shyness and unhappiness. The story is set entirely in England, with no Scottish characters or influence, which is unusual for the author, a Scotswoman. It still has herkeen sense of the beautify of the land and water. While a minor work, it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way It Should Be","review":"The nicest thing about this book is that Elfrida is not a gullible idiot as so many heroines are.

That is not to say that in between certain cracks of space, sparingly throughout this indie mess, there are not a few moments that possibly grip-the attempted raga's do their best to engage without pummeling listeners over the head with how \\"different\\" it is (at best, as in the bombastic second half of track 9, the band comes across like a cheap Godspeed knockoff), but on the whole this is one of those album's that you end up becoming embarrassed owning in retrospect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was what it claimed","review":"This product is exactly what it claimed.

In the reviews some complained about no \\"detent\\" or \\"magnet\\" in them. Those features aren't really necessary anyway. I popped one into my Skil Mini Cordless Driver (which by the way holds the bits with it's own magnet) and it fits like a glove. Perfect set for precision work too! Only one trivial complaint...the holder has the size markings kind of off-set so the bits are not \\"over\\" the right size. Also, these bits are \\"really, really hard to remove\\" from the holder! It'll wreck your fingers so use pliers. But A+ overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They work well","review":"They work well but I would not call them professional quality (reflected in the price too though).

The holder has an integrated belt loop and is made of some rubbery/plastic material that seems like it would take some serious effort to damage. Not that I care, but for prosperity, the holder also doesn't say 'Tekton' but rather 'nut driver belt' in what I can only imagine as labored English. It does list the sizes of the sockets in order, but the lettering does not actually line up with the sockets themselves. No big deal to me, just FYI. The sockets themselves seem very sturdy - far more so than the driver I plan on using them with, so no complaints there.

First, the bits do not have a detent in the shaft to lock them into a power driver, so the only way to keep them from falling out is to put them in a magnetic extension, and even then if enough torque is applied to lock them on to a bolt they tend to pull out of the extension.

I was thrilled to see they even included a screwdriver so that one can easily put the handle in. That's until I found the thing was not prooperly drilled. The holes simply don't line up. I guess this is a problem. They include a note telling you to go ahead and drill your own holes. Next time, I'll provide the screwdriver if they properly drill the handle.

Keep in mind, you need to make sure you have some weight in front to steer -- but it is very easy to steer if you keep this in mind. I am back on Amazon tonight to order the pad now.

It's poorly made in China and not worth the money. The side grab rails are downright dangerous; they are too narrow and can trap and break fingers.

I have tried several different runner, tube, plastic and toboggan style sleds and this sled is the fastest sled I have ever rode. The unique plastic bottom with runners I believe is responsible for this speed advantage. The sled has the speed advantage on both powder and hard pack. Pivoting steering mechanism also works very well and really gives you good control. The longer 52 in model can hold more adults/kids and I think is the right size without being too big. The wood finish is spectacular and really shows the handmade craftsmanship. This sled is very well built and Mountain Boy has a good reputation of standing behind their sleds. Overall, I think you get what you pay for and with this sled it really seems that they really thought about how to build a better sled from many different aspects. I did not see any short-cuts in their design or build."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"The holes didn't line up to mount the steering bar.

GORT is sleek. GORT is no-excuses, no-nonsense Law Enforcement.The real GORT had 3 sensors under his chin. These are missing from my GORT, which is disappointing. Some people mistakenly think that sensors are breathing holes for the actor occupying the Gort suit. This is not true.

To Lewis' surprise, Uncle Jonathan turns out to be a wizard, and his next-door neighbor, the folksy, friendly Mrs. Zimmermann, is a witch--but both are on the side of good magic. Not so was Isaac Izard, the former tenant of Uncle Jonathan's house. In fact, Isaac and his repulsive wife have left a sort of time bomb hidden somewhere in the walls--a Doomsday Clock that could cause the end of the world. Lewis' adventures are exciting, blending the comfortable and the familiar with the terrifying and the bizarre, and as always with John Bellairs, there's a hefty dose of good humor.For those who are interested, there's a nifty 'Net site dedicated to John Bellairs and his work at http://www.pitt.edu/~jjast2/bellairs/cb.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HOSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS","review":"THE hOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS.THE SETTING TAKES PLACE IN nEWNEBEE.

A more relevant reading would in my opinion be D'Aveni's Hypercompetition, that takes the concept to its logical conclusion, which Hoult and Stalk misses.Unfortunately, neither of the authors are very entertaining writers, especially as this book is usually mandatory/recommended reading in most MBA classes on strategy.In conclusion, good, once revolutionary, but today mostly over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phyllis Diller's Household Hints","review":"I have always loved Phyllis Diller - but this book was just awful.

The most unrepresentative characters receive disproportionate attention; -- the most impacting contributions of mainstream Puritan New England lives, literature, industrial and cultural heroes (e.g., Winthrop, Mather, Bradstreet, Bradford, Adams, cod-fishermen, etc.) are too quickly sacrificed for limelighting the quasi-exotic.

The book contains numerous short essays about poor fisheries-management and suggestions about less harmful practices, and these are nice. But in terms of practical advice on fish-buying, the authors are trying to avoid all negativity and don't help the reader distinguish truth from fiction at the fish-mongers. And some of the fish varieties discussed can only be distinguished from look-alikes by DNA testing. Also, the recipes are all very fancy and beautiful but way too fussy (how many words does it take to say \\"salt and pepper\\"?)

Here are 150 recipes that deal with what actually swims in our backyards. It's time we supported restaurants who put such an effort into Slow Food (that is food that is environmentally, physiologically, and mentally the opposite of fast food like McDonalds). I say congratulations to the authors for putting such an effort together."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fish, Two Fish, Crawfish, Bluefish: The Smithsonian Sustainable Seafood Cookbook","review":"Not only is this an outstanding seafood cookbook, it is also an educational document explaining the importance of our oceans and an awareness of ocean conservation.

Most books on Wills only talk about Living Trusts, but this book outlines how some of the richest (and not so rich) families use Trusts to protect family money. It also discusses the downfalls of this practice, including causing legal battles for your next of kin. This guide not only explains trusts and living trusts, but also goes into details on being an executor, going through probate, handling executor fees and it discusses common problems within wills and trusts. There are many examples of legal cases throughout the book that illustrate issues and how they have been resolved by courts. It's definately worth reading if you're trying to get a grasp on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estate Planning and Trust information","review":"This book has practical information about estate planning and how to set up trusts to protect your loved ones.

The clip doesn't open very wide, and only has a little piece of rubber to help it maintain it's grip. The only thing I can get it to hold onto is a book. That would be okay, except the neck is too short to get it pointed so that the light actually shines on the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great accessory to your Sony Reader or book.","review":"I use this exclusively with my Sony Reader, though it does work well with a paperback book as well.

I had to change the battery twice because the light seemed to get dimmer after only a few hours of use. It was barely bright enough with a fresh battery. On day five I dropped the light while attempting to clip it onto my book. It only fell about 3 feet to the floor and the hinge broke--it didn't just come apart, it actually broke a piece off. The light is worthless without a working hinge, so I tossed it into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bright light for a book light!","review":"To be honest, I haven't used it for a book.

It has not held up well. The neck no longer stays where I want it to and the light has dimmed to the point it's almost useless (I only use it 1-3 times a week for half an hour). It takes a CR 2032 battery. When it dies, I'm pitching the light.I've used Might Bright lights for a couple of years and they've held up well (my husband and I each have one). They take 3 AAA batteries and it's easier to change batteries in the Mighty Bright (no screwdriver required)than the Energizer. The batteries last a long time too! Furthermore, you can find them with an A/C adapter and skip the batteries. The necks eventually loosen up but no so much it's a pain to use (as is the Energizer).For a few dollars more, you can have a much better product. Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fail....","review":"This clip light is hopeless....When we got it the batteries were dead, or at least we hope it's just the batteries that are keeping it from working.

The product had nothing to do with Energizer. I can't speak for the other sellers who claim to be selling an Energizer book light but I can guarantee that this company is involved with false advertisement.

They broke a good product!","review":"I owned a predecessor model of this watch for many years- wore out the band at least once. Finally the bezel cover separated, so time to replace. This watch is exactly the same function-wise, BUT, instead of two discrete buttons on the front to operate \\"start/stop\\" and \\"reset/split\\", there is now one intergrated, covered area with buttons THAT CANNOT BE OPERATED EXCEPT WITH MANY TRIES AND GREAT DIFFICULTY. Also, the changed strap design offers few adjustments, and would be very difficult to replace in the future. A classic case of ignoring the \\"if it's not broken, don't fix it\\" rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a bit puzzled by the overall positive reviews on this chrono. Two poor design issues - 1. The top info (Date/Day) or in Chrono (split time) are hard to see and partly hidden. 2. The chrono split and Stop/Start buttons are very small so...if you running (or whatever) you really have to concentrate to hit them. Not ideal. Also, the watch is not all that 'bright' - hard to read.

The gun seemed fine but i quickly learned that the hop-up feature made it very inaccurate and worse, the sight on the gun fell apart within a week. So i can't really recommend this product. But even more disappointing was the interaction with the seller. They were willing to take the gun back for a replacement but i had to pay return shipping; it took almost a month for them to ship the replacement item and then that item never arrived and they claim it was lost by UPS and they would not ship another gun until they resolved matters with UPS. They simply have no concept of customer service. Thank god for Amazon who are exactly the opposite and have helped me every step of the way.

Its so flimsy that the scope broke within 5 minutes of me getting the gun. Because it is spring powered it shoots one pellet at a time so it is not a sub machine gun.

Had I known I could get nearly identical stretching bars for about $8 total at my local mom & pop art shop I wouldn't have bothered. Most likely you will be able to find a better price in your hometown than online for stretching bars, because they jack up the shipping on this. Plus an art shop has people people that can answer all your questions and give you guidance on materials for your projects. But as far as stretching bars go. These are just that, good quality, but much cheaper to find elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy","review":"This novel by Danielle Steele was hard to put down once i started reading. The charcters are likeable and the story has many twists. However there were many spelling mistakes/ typos that i picked up on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read!","review":"Danielle Steel does an execellant job of showing the readers what a man like Oliver has to go through. She does a great job of keeping the readers attention. It was really hard to put the book down from the start. It has to be the best book by Danielle Steel. She takes the characters and shows us one by one how they all deal with Sarah's decision. She also does a great job portraying Oliver, who hardly ever runs out of energy. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more about how Mel felt about Sarah's decision.I found myself wondering how Mel delt with all of it. I thought the book ended to soon. Overall, I think that Daddy was a very worthwhile book to read if only it could have been a little longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy in Review","review":"This book was interesting. At first I didn't get the title because all it talked about in the beginning was Sarah. I thought they should have called the book Mommy. Finally after I read on further I realized why the book was called Daddy. Oliver had to go through his wife going back to school and raising three kids on his own. Ben, the oldest son, had to deal with his girlfriend and their soon to be child. Oliver's father had to deal with the death of his wife and the finding of a new love. You need to feel bad for the fathers because of all the hardships they went through with their wives/girlfriends. It is somewhat of a tear jerker. I give it four stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a heart-warming story! A must read!","review":"Like some of the reviewers, I thought this book to be about some screw-up daddy! But I was wrong...it's a ride of emotions that will put a tear to your eyes (if you're very emotional!) right from the start! It displays the strength of a father (Oliver) who also has to be a mother to all his 3 children after Sarah left them to pursue her studies. Double thumbs up for this particular \\"Daddy\\"! Cheers Danielle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantstically written!","review":"This book really plays with my emotions.

But then...I read Fine Things and then Daddy, I didn't like all two of them. I noticed that in these three books, that someone leaves and then their spouse quickly remarries. Kind of the same plot over and over!I feel that her best book was The Promise, the characters ended up together at the end (GREAT BOOK!)Happy Readings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is my favorite Danielle Steel book.

He pretty much took it all in stride. But I guess he loved her enough to let her go. It just struck me as kinda odd. Life manages to drudge on for the remaining fragmented Watson family and its ups and downs threaten the balance of daily life. But Oliver carries on and is finally happy in the end. And enjoyable read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for my son...","review":"I loved this book until we got to the end... it just proved to my son that he should be able to sleep in my bed every night! He is entering a phase in which he's scared of everything at night, so I bought this for him to try to help get him past his new fears. I hoped that it would help him feel comfortable and safe in his own bed. I wish I had read through it myself before we read it together! The empathy that he feels for Little Mouse validates his concept that his bed is definitely not the place to be at night! It was a very sweet book, but a bit unpractical for parents with children who have nighttime fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"We adore this book","review":"I think most parents can relate to what Big Mouse is going through with Little Mouse and it is so much fun to read aloud. We all love the pictures too - Jane Chapman is an amazing artist and has done so many fabulous kids books.

You can even creat your own fighter with custom button arrangements and special moves. The new version of Konquest is much better than the last one I played. This one is actually fun. The \\"kreate a fatality\\" finishing moves has its ups and downs. The up is that the fatalities are totally cool and very brutal. The down is that there is no character fatalities, ie. Scorpion doesn't set anyone on fire. So far this is my favorite game in the series. I've spent hours playing and I'm not even close to finishing this game. Just do the math: say it takes you about 30 minutes to beat the game with character... you'll get 30 hours of gameplay, not including the Konquest and the time you'll spend building your own player. This game is great fun for any MK fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game foe MK fans","review":"Even though this is an old game, I enjoy this game due to action.

It's obvious after reading The Ten Questions that the author meant to keep his explanations short, concise, and unintimidating. And, there is a LOT of information packed into these pages.Each question (for example, \\"How am I going to pay for my kids College?\\" or \\"How do I get out from a heavy debt load?\\") is answered in a style that makes you feel as if you are in a room talking directly with a financial planner.The advice is sound, practical, informative, and easy-to-understand.

Both were likeable characters and Ms. Ashley delivers a good read. The only fly in the ointment, for me anyway, was James. I didn't like his character one bit, and needless to say I won't be reading his story. While I understood his behaviour in the beginning, I didn't like the way he treated Alexandra towards the end and I would have preferred him groveling on the ground. But him aside,the book was enjoyable and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"I read this book as part of a reading challenge. Until then it had lingered at the bottom of my TBR pile. I liked the characters, even the villains. I liked that the story remained in the presence, despite that all that unfolded had roots in the past. The explanations were kept to the minimum needed to continue with the story. Many \\"events\\" unfolding in the story where so outrageously unlikely and impossible that there was never a question like \\"really?\\" It was pure fun and entertainment and I will order at least the next book in the series,The Pirate Hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirate Passion","review":"This was a great read I love historical romances and this one did not disappoint!

Although the listing shows it as various artists, it's actually played by pianist Carl Doy. He plays so wonderfully beautiful! THE best piano music on the planet, period. I'm always ecstatic to find his music, especially since he's not readily available. These cds were well worth the wait. The arrangements are perfect, from the first track on disc 1 to the last track on disc 4. Tonight is quite different from other arrangements, yet it's still true to the song. Sealed With A Kiss is played to perfection, with lush strings, light percussion and great piano playing. Same with Killing Me Softly, it's tear jerking beauty. All of the tunes are. He really knows how to get beauty out of a piece. Out of all the many pianists out there, he stands out; in a class all his own. Very romantic but also relaxing. Put these cds on and suddenly all the badness in the world seems to go away.

I initially thought that the can of air was 'bad' or something had gone wrong during its making, but after reading the front label 3M has put a bittering agent in it to prevent huffing. When I called the 3M hotline they said not to shake or tip the can at all and the agent would not come out. They also said that you should keep 'dairy' products on hand in case the smell/taste bothers you. WHAT???? Seriously? Some areas where dust resides requires you to tip the can and I can't keep 'dairy' in my office fridge. This product is a good idea, but it punishes people who aren't intending to use it incorrectly. I'd recommend you buy another dust remover without the agent, because its a lot of money to spend to punish yourself with the smell!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: BITTER AFTER TASTE!!","review":"As the previous user already stated. After the first few uses, I would notice that my lips tasted bitter. I couldn't figure it out for the longest time. Then I noticed on the can that it contains a bittering agent to deter people from inhaling it. Now every time I use this stuff, the agent would attach itself to my hands and lips. It's very annoying to say the least. Good idea as deterrent, but definitely not practical for normal users, like myself. I will never buy this or any compressed air with a bittering agent again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter experience but I found a use for it!","review":"Wow... this product sucks!!!! For weeks on end you can type on your keyboard and still ruin your sandwich!!! Happily, I've found it works as a squirrel deterrent... they don't chew holes where I spray it, so that's nice.

He is really too young to really appreciate it, so I'm writing the review. I'm not a collector or anything so I'm writing from the point of few that this is something to play with and not something that stays in its box on a self. For thirty dollars this is a great set of action figures that I think will hold up to some abuse. The comic while a good read is pretty flimsy. The cover fell off the spine as soon as I opened it. The characters are very articulated and come with stands that you can pose them on. They are heavy and seem durable.

His \\"piano leads\\" are not well thought out and rather boring; his bass lines are too muddled; and the overall album takes you nowhere. David Benoit he is not; usually selecting or writing instrumentals that are uninspired. He could use a melody writer to lock him in to something more recognizable to the listener next time around.

But it's not going to be a peaceful voyage. Someone murders the Russian Ambassador. Potential assassins seem to be everywhere until Eleanor, with the aid of young John F. Kennedy, son of America's Ambassador to Great Britain, unravels a maze of deceit and danger to trap the killer. As in other Eleanor Roosevelt mysteries, the First Lady solves the murder with grace and brilliance. Along the way, we meet a covey of famous people and get a look at real luxury in travel.

Unforunately, because the unreleased stuff could have fit in one CD, instead, we need to get yet another studio version of Purple Haze, Little Wing, etc., to get to the stuff we Hendrix fans are interested an pay for a double CD. The liner notes suck, why does Experience Hendrix has to pay people to tell the same Hendrix bio over and over again? Some of the highligts for Hendrix fans are the alternate versions of Stepping Stone and Izabella, and the live Fire, Foxey lady and Red House.

All of these EXACT songs have been previously released on LP, cassette and CD except for \\"Foxey Lady\\". If memory serves correctly, the song was acually released on the \\"Rainbow Bridge\\" DVD making this release 100% exploitation. Also note that most copies come packaged with a sticker stating \\"As Seen On TV\\"! I do give it 2 stars for sound quality and layout.

One song which is new; an unreleased version of \\"Foxy Lady\\" recorded at the Maui Hawaii concert on July 30th 1970; With a running time of 4:25, can in no way justify the price of this two disc set. If you are a completest like myself, you will enjoy the nice packaging, but as for the music... You own it already. This release shows the Hendrix family has little respect for Jimi's fans, and the arguments they had with Alan Douglas's indignities were superficial at best. \\"Pass\\" on this collection, if only to send the message that \\"WE\\" (Jimi's Fans) deserve better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I bought this book because the title really caught my attention.

If you are patient, you will be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems incomplete, too teacher-dependent","review":"This book is not divided into lessons and Part 1 (theory) has little or no references to the exercises in Part 2. I find it impossible to use. It is useless for someone learning on his own and I would expect that even someone learning with a teacher would be too dependent upon the teacher. On the other hand, Shearer's earlier \\"Classic Guitar Technique\\" is a good choice for self study, as it does not have any of the shortcomings mentioned above. An even better choice is \\"Solo Guitar Playing\\" by Noad, the best I've seen so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE B MOVIE","review":"I liked this movie because it was really good fun to work on.

It has all the tactical situation you would need to learn. It's a magnificent book and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine resource","review":"This books is a very well written introduction to tactical themes.

If a player is rated higher than that, it should be a snap. It's one of the three books I recommend to any new player at our chess club. After 1200, it's still a nice confidence-builder as one moves forward in his or her never-ending pattern-recognition quest. It's a mix between basic tactical motifs and various (and easy) checkmates. Get through this one and move on to \\"Learn Chess Tactics\\" by John Nunn. I don't know if I go along with the maxim that \\"Chess is 99-percent tactics,\\" but it's essential, and this is a great book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid Tactics book!","review":"This is a good solid tactics book with a pretty good selection of tactic types, and a focus on intermediate level tactics.If you're looking for extensive description of the tactics your probably in the wrong place, and I can also see this not meeting the needs for both beginning chess players and advanced ones. But its kind of hard not to be enchanted with this book.limitations include; quite alot of prompting of the solution with a vague organization of similar motifs and a focus on rather forceful tactics.In short this is just the kind of tactics book to go over and over until you are able to solve most of the problems in short amount of time (and quickly recognize the pattern). This has been my goal, I know this isn't the ONLY puzzle book on tactics, but it IS a good first one, and a figure I can graduate to something that offers more complexity and less hints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"This book will definitely help an intermediate chess player greatly improve their tactical thinking' and, consequently, improve their overall game. I really enjoyed it. Easy to follow. Very logical. I've read the book several times and I still make silly mistakes in my games, but it's not the book's fault. I just tend to play really fast without in-depth thinking. When I take my time, the tactics taught in this book come to mind and I'm able to stun my opponents. I wish I had read this book first before any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A girl chess player . . . ? You betcha!","review":"This is the only chess book I have ever seen that was written by a woman.She has impressive credentials and has written a book that does not give a great deal of advice, but let's the reader discover for herself how to evaluate chess positions and through sound tactical reasoning, become a better player or even as the title suggests, a champion.

This method works! This book is far superior to Bobby Fischer teaches chess in that there are more diagrams, more themes, and a lot more very important subjects. This, with the plethora of examples, makes this the book to get.Remember, chess is 99% tactics, so practicing all the puzzles over and over will improve your ability to see tactics and not drop pieces to them.

I ended up going with my instinct and got into all my schools.As others have said this book really shows you how to write MBA essays. Make no mistake, you may be a good essay writer but MBA essays are a bit different. There are special things you need to showcase is a special way.This book is the only this you need.

Overall the book is useful second or third resource but definitely not a definitive source for MBA essay writing.

The font is the worst device font I've seen in years. But if you can struggle through its basic operation, then you've got a pretty useful device.I do hope they have a ROM upgrade that fixes some of these UI issues and new manual would help too.I would buy this product for someone who's resourceful, but not for someone who needs something very simple to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good voice recorder","review":"I purchased the Ripflash as a voice recorder and it works. The internal microphone works well and can record soft voices. However, I could not get enough volume from my external microphone. If you use the internal microphone, it will pick up any movement of your hand on the recorder. Voice activation works reasonably well. Documentation is not good but the machine is not that complicated.

I use it as a recorder, mostly with a line-in jack from a telephone. The audio volume on playback is low (and yes, I do have it turned all the way up!). The software for transfering files to PCs is clunky - a real Windows 3.1 feel about it.Worst however is that if the battery runs down while recording, it will trash not only the file you have been recording, but every other file. Even with recharged batteries, the unit is completely unuseable until it's been reformatted. There is a battery indicator, but it doesn't give you very much advance warning. The 10 hours playback time may or may not be accurate, but it certainly does not translate to anything like 10 hours of recording time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the music","review":"Is an excelent book to understand David Sylvian music and try to get why he wrote what he wrote. If you're looking for some gossip or some unknown data, this is not your book. You will only find records he made and some quotes about a personal state of mind, no more or less than that.Great book for fans of Sylvian music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Treasure","review":"Woody Shaw fans will love this recording. Louis Hayes is a great drummer with a superb band on \\"The Real Thing.\\" This disc flows beautifully from end to end. The gorgeous \\"Nisha\\"is 9:22 minutes of pure beauty. With Woody on open horn and Ronnie Matthews' sparkling ivory, this ballad sets up nicely with a gentle swinging groove. \\"Loose Suite\\" opens with a spiraling Rene Mclean Soprano solo right before Woody blows down the house. \\"My Gift To You\\" has a great Trumpet/Sax bi-line, while \\"Marilyn's House\\" picks up vibes from an earlier McCoy Tyner band that Shaw played in. Louis Hayes swings hard throughout this session with great support from Stafford James on Bass and Slide Hampton on the 'Bone. This disc fits in well with many Woody Shaw recordings including \\"The Woody Shaw Concert Ensemble at the Berliner Jazztage\\", \\"Moontrane\\" and \\"Rosewood.\\" Thanks 32 Jazz for releasing this hidden treasure. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip van Dinosaur","review":"This is a sweet kid-pleaser of a story about a little dinosaur who falls asleep and wakes up in a strange new world (our own). Little Rip is confused by the things he sees and is glad to be home again. The black and white outline drawings are perfect for copying and coloring and the simple rhyme of the story is quite natural. While it is a bit long for toddler Story Times, older children will enjoy hearing the story read to them and creating drawings of their own interpretations of the story. Little ones will enjoy snuggling up for one-on-one reading with mom or dad. Rip van Dinosaur will become a favorite children's character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnogaja","review":"I saw Hypnogaja play at the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco recently.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"I have a lot to say about this CD. Firstly, I totally stumbled onto Hypnogaja when I was watching the show \\"Las Vegas\\" and I heard their song \\"Voodoo Baby\\" in one of the scenes. It took me a while to find out who did the song and I finally found it on copy of a European CD - \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" - so I bought it. I was really impressed with the band's depth and originality, so I bought this CD. It has to be one of my favorite albums ever. I listen to it all the time and really enjoy the personal feel of the words. The singer just seems to be singing about my life. My favorite songs are \\"Nothing Box,\\" \\"The Spaceman\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\" I can't wait for the next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide!","review":"Mr.Williams never ceases to amaze me.

I know William Sanderson can act better than this, I've seen him do it, so even the directing is terrible. Alan Smithee wouldn't even put his name on it. I really feel for the people who have to lose hours of their lives just to rate garbage like this. I had high hopes seeing that horror guru Tom Savini was in it but the effects, like the acting, seemed like something from a hogh school production. If you truly like H.P. Lovecraft check out \\"From Beyond\\", \\"In The Mouth Of Madness\\" or \\"Reanimator\\". This DVD makes a great coaster,incidentally, but at 20 dollars it's a bit excessive.

This is an awful movie. It tries to be psychological by constantly bombarding the view with shaky images of bloody stuff. The movie steals all the clichés of Asylum movies and throws in a few scenes where high school level acting is attempted. If you want a better Lovecraftian adaptation, check out the movie Dagon.

Lovecraft reader, and my expectations are high. I'm always hopeful when the title of a movie \`says' the film is inspired by HLP. But . . .The writer/director was really--really trying, but he lost control from the beginning. The film began with a series of disjoined images and dialogue which were startling, but there was no suspenseful build up.Okay, it's difficult to put Lovecraft on the big screen anyway, but the stilted dialogue didn't help. The range of acting ability was uneven, and that didn't help. Also, using black and white, well, why? B&W; can be used to build a great mood and suspense but this film had neither so using B&W; footage was pointless. And the blood and gore just for the sake of it . . . better luck next time.If you want to watch Lovecraft on film, rent the \`Resurrected' with Chris Sarandon or go back to \`Re-Animator.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrible acting...but no worse than twilight","review":"Ok this movie's acting is bad but I find this movie amazing.

I will say unlike a lot of the decent reviews I am not a HPL reader never had the privilege. This however is a good movie held together with crazy editing and bad acting. The bad acting I think makes the movie it makes u kinda question sanity which sounds dumb but if you like b rated movies watch it and if you like it good for you.

Sadly, there are extremely few films that stay true to Lovecraft's writings. And, this one is a prime example. It starts out with a few incoherant murmurs of the original story, then quickly devolves into a mess of self-agrandizing scene-chewing.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!

I was sadly mistaken, it was so bad that I just finally cut the movie off about halfway through. I almost asked for my money back from the video store, it was sooo bad and sooo boring!

Her career spans decades, and she continues to grow and make music that, amazingly, is better with each new record. Alas, as her bank account has grown, her political fervor has dwindled and, today, she's a right-winger in the Bahian establishment.

I read this book and found it mildly amusing, but trusting Caldecott felt the children's reaction might be a better gauge of it.I've got to say, this book read to a group of children was one of the highlights of my year. Kids who don't normally react (or even sit still) were engaged by it. Others we had barely heard a peep from in group laughed out loud. It's great for them because there's not too much happening on each page but they are asked to participate in the story by not letting the persistent pigeon have his heart's desire.Enjoy it with your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This simple yet intriging book was enthralling. My surreal mind was captured in the essense of the pigeon. If you ever read this book to little kids, their reactions are hysterical. If you enjoy laughing at little kids, that is. This book was very \\"IN YO' FACE\\" and laid back at the same time. We especially enjoyed the part with the spazzin' pigeon.The reason we gave this book four stars instead of a five star review is because the pictures are somewhat below par.

You can't drive the bus!\\" Maybe I still have the mind set of a preschooler, because I found it just as entertaining, so much so that my best friend gave it to me for my 43rd birthday.

This is for classroom , it's not a handheld book that I can read in bed with my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But Didn't Live Up to Expectations","review":"This book is OK, but certainly wasn't as amazing as most reviewers seemed to think it was. Really too simplistic for anyone over 2 years old. My grandkids were not too entralled. Would not buy in this series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for older kids.","review":"This book simply didn't keep my 2.5 year old daughter's attention, and she LOVES books. I didn't like the writing personally, and it just seemed akward. Very strange for a kid's book. I'm still not sure why it's so popular!ETA - I wish I could change this to 3.5/4 stars. I still don't LOVE this book, but with an older child I get the concept more. It's a fun romp for the kids though. I have a pretty advanced reader but she still didn't really get into this book until around 3, if that helps anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is hilarious!","review":"This book is hilarious and down right silly! Even with the simple drawings the Pigeon's expressions are priceless. All kids will enjoy this book, especially early readers. This is a great book to help build their confidence. As a teacher, this is a great read aloud book because children can interact by trying to help the pigeon drive the bus. The book has great illustrations, large letters and uses a simple vocabulary! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful Book!","review":"My 2-1/2 year old son received this for Christmas and four months later we still read it several times a week. My husband, son and I continue to get a kick out of this book. In fact, my husband and son role play the book with each other. One will come out with a line and the other will respond with the next line. It's interactive, fun and a joy to read. Very different from your 'typical' children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite book!","review":"My 3 year old son heard this book at a local storytime and laughed so hard I thought he was going to fall off his chair! We bought it and read it so much he had it memorized in just a few days. We love all the Mo Willems pigeon books, but this one is the silliest and still our favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids LOVE saying \\"NO!\\" to someone else for a change.","review":"When the bus driver leaves to take a break, a playful pigeon appears in hopes of taking the bus for a spin. He begs, wheedles, and manipulates in hopes of getting permission, but it's up to your child to keep saying \\"NO!\\" The pleasure of shouting \\"NO!\\" to someone ELSE for a change was an eagerly anticipated treat for my daughter and her lively, inquisitive friends. For extra fun, read this to a group of kids (ideally, a Pre-K or Kindergarten class!). This book also provides a fun opening to discuss WHY the pigeon shouldn't drive the bus, and why we have rules about things like safety and not stealing.Another favorite by Mo Willems: Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale, in which a toddler accompanies her father to the laundromat, and the adventure that follows when a special \\"somebunny\\" gets left in the drier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pigean Brings Families Together","review":"Grown ups may not see the appeal because of its simplicity, but throw in a few funny voices and wild actions and kids will really love this book. I bought it for my five-yeara-old, but my older kids (ages seven and ten) loved it too. It's a great to have a book that all my kids will sit and listen to, and that's what I like most about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a grandson favorite","review":"Three of my grandchildren are especially fond of this authors books. When you read one, they call out responses to the pigeon or giggle at the craziness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"Mo Williams does a great job writing the pigeon books. I laugh out loud reading these stories to my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book for a 2 year old","review":"My Mother-in-Law got this book for my 2.5 year old son. We are avid children's book readers, but I had never heard of these books before. I saw it had a Caldecott Award, so figured it must be pretty good. I asked my son to go get it so we could read and he said \\"no\\". I tried again later and he reluctantly went and got it. As we were reading I could see why he didn;;t want to read it. There is no story to follow. Just a stupid pigeon acting out because he can't get what he wants. This book flew over the head of my 2 year old, and completely bored me. I don't understand why this book has such great reviews. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor pigeon - we didn't enjoy his sad story","review":"I've only read good reviews of this book, and was excited to buy it. Once we received it, I knew my 4 year old boy (who is admittedly a \\"sensitive soul\\") wouldn't like it. Throughout the book, he just felt sad for the bird who desparately wanted to drive this bus and who was repeatedly turned down, for no stated reason. I even switched the ending to indicate that the pigeon gets to drive the truck at the end so that my son wouldn't feel badly for him. Mostly, through story-reading time, my son would say \\"Don't worry, pigeon, we'll let you drive Mommy's car\\" etc.For an adult, the pigeon's comments were very funny as he tries to convince the people to let him drive, but I wouldn't recommend it for a preschooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Sorry but this book stinks. It's boring. It's not clever or funny like some people have said. It's just boring. My kids haven't given it a second glance. I have no idea how this book won any award of any sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a painful book","review":"We got this book as a gift... What can I say? Am I too old-fashioned? Colors are awful, illustrations are horrible, but most of all - text is painful! There is nothing for kids, not even a story, there is absolutely nothing that goes for this book! (Sorry author, but this is ONE ugly book for kids!) We ended up throwing the book in the garbage, because we didn't want any kid to be exposed to this"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for littlest ones","review":"Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pigeons can drive a bus?","review":"I picked this up as my daughter liked the other two books. It's a funny little story where the pigeon trys everything to drive a bus that the reader has been asked to watch.The artwork is what makes the story. The expressions of the pigeon are funny.I was surprised my daughter isn't as interested in the book like the other two. It may be a case of hear reading skills improving and or simply her interests have changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Hilarious","review":"A sheer delight for kids and grown-ups alike, the witty illustrations and arch text make for a near perfect reading experience. My daughter loves to shout \\"NO!\\" at the appropriate places as the wiley pigeon tries to convince his young readers to let him drive the bus (using a variety of increasingly funny ploys). Finally, a book your kids can say \\"No\\" to! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More good times with the Pigeon","review":"If I had to pick one of the Pigeon books, I'd go with the Sleep story. But if I got two of his books, this would be a very close second. My son loves the Pigeon's animated antics and creative ways he tries to get to get on board the bus. It's a fun, cute story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a typical 5 year old temper tantrum","review":"Loved the pigeon, loved the story about saying \\"no\\" to someone who does not want to be told \\"no\\" to. My 4 1/2 year old and my 2 1/2 year old loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My students and children adore it!","review":"I love love LOVE this book. Kids from ages 4-11 will too!!!! Buy it!!! You will not regret it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun reading with your kid","review":"I really love this book. Your child really can participate in the reading. This is a book you read over and over and have great fun while doing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites!","review":"This is such a great book! We had a copy of it years ago and it got ruined by our cat, so we had to buy another one so my daughter has it for years to come. She loves these books so much that we had a birthday party themed around them one year. She's 7 now, but has had and loved the books since she was 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Bus","review":"My 3 year old LOVES this book! The pictures are simply drawn and the story completely engages him. He is giggling \\"NO!\\" at every page. He asks for this book so often that he recites to me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This new book is sure to become a Caldecott Medal winner","review":"I bet this new book will be a future Caldecott Medal winner. It is sure to delight both children and adults alike. Children will love the story of that little blue pigeon and it is sure to make parents remember with a smile the willful nature of the three year old. This book is a must for your children's library. Five time Emmy Award winning writer and animator Mo Willems is sure to gain further recognition for his latest venture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son's favorite book!!","review":"Super cute book, we love the Pigeon!!

It is a nice size and the font is very easy to read. The leather is a little stiff at first, but loosens up in no time. It has gold gilded page edges and a nice bookmark ribbon. I wanted the clasp to protect the pages in my purse.

While it isn't pocket sized, it's long but narrow dimensions allow it to fit easily in a briefcase or purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"My four-year-old son and I are BIG fans of the First Discovery Book series. The transparent pages in these introductory non-fiction books add something amazingly different to our large library of story books.After buying a handful of these books for my son, I gave him the option to choose our next purchase. He chose \\"The Human Body.\\" He is at a very curious age, and this book helped me answer many of the questions he had about the workings of his body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book...but why so small??","review":"My grandson enjoyed this book I had sent to him, but his mother and I were disappointed that the book was so small. I expected it to be bigger so that small children could look at bigger pictures. Bigger overlays on bigger pages would have a much better impact on young minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid 5-drawer cart 773488","review":"Looks good, rolls well, drawers work well, nice work top. Drawers are metal on the inside and plastic on the front. The remainder is the heavy plastic material--no rust, no scratching of adjacent items, easy to clean. It's lighter than the metal ones which was a huge plus for this older wimp who will be lifting it into a truck. No tools in mine--just a rolling work station with lighter supplies inside and it'll be great for that. Seems sturdy enough for tools, tho. Woulda been nice to have drawer liners with it, but otherwise very pleased with the product. Shipped quickly, already assembled and without problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great LCD Monitor","review":"I have never used the LCD monitor for desktop before. This is the first time. It's the Screen big and good picture performance. Event when you see from the side the pictures looks like the same. The price is not expensive for this quality. Its will be better if you used the graphic card at 64 mb so it will support the 1280 x 1024 resolution with max color 32 bit. the auto adjustment help you to have the best view for your PC. You can try and will know the performance since you shot on the monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, gets to the heart of true competitive advantage.","review":"D'Aveni's view of competition in our global era is right on. Few competitive advantages are truly sustainable, and long-term strategic planning is ineffective. The only long-term sustainable competitive advantage comes from a firm's ability to create short-term advantages that span across numerous competitive arenas - from cost/quality, to know-how, to various types of stronghold positions, to financial muscle. How is that accomplished? By continually disrupting the status quo, changing the rules of the game, by taking an industry in new directions in which competitors' strengths become irrelevant. Strong recommend: lengthy book but \\"executive summary\\" is in the 35 page Introduction. Short form paperback version coming out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book was once thought to be the new rival to Michael Porter's books. Porter talked about sustainable competitive advantage and D'Aveni countered that nothing is really sustainable. I don't have any problem with the gist of the argument, but the book is largely unreadable for another reason. It is an orgy of charts and tables and confusing terminology. The author doesn't really try to build on exiting work. He wants to reinvent everything. When the book was written in the mid-90s, management consultants' fancy charts and diagram were in their zenith. So the author tries to awe the reader and runs with it as far as possible. The result is largely unreadable. I would say four stars for actual content and one for style. The book is now 15 years old, so it is not worth more than two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have.","review":"The strategy challenge is \\"to know all gurus, but to follow none\\". You need to resolve your own strategy paradoxes by creatively combining aspects from different approches. There is no one best way to make strategy. However, D'Aveni offers training manual for managers to formulate the desired strategy. Excellent. MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"First clear definition of modern competition","review":"D'Aveni manages to convey and explain the current competitive environment. Why nobody has defined it so easily before, I don't understand (everything is simple after you've had it explained to you).The great thing about D'Aveni, is that he in principle challenges the Porter's and Ansoff's of this world, and explains that competition today is intense, not very well-ordered and competitive advantages is fleeting and has to be constantly renewed. In short, this is the first book in Strategy that I've read and immediately felt at home with. You can't loose, buy it, read it and contemplate it. If you don't agree with its main theme, you're probably of a dying breed of managers, otherwise you need this book to make sense of the competitive landscape of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelente biblia de estudio","review":"me encanto haber comprado esta biblia, es la guia perfecta para estudiar y hacer analisis profundos, y tiene hasta diccionario biblico realmente me fascino la recomiendo 100%!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snail pace delivery","review":"It took forever to receive this bible and I still have orders that have not come in.

También Hitler manipulo la fe de los hombres, proclamo el antisemitismo, el odio al prójimo, a Israel y los judíos(hermanos de Jesús de Nazaret).Recomiendo que busque una biblia que contenga 100% la Palabra de Dios y no palabra de hombres.

Not to worry, though - our (usually) fearless protagonists come together to solve a complicated case and we also get a taste of less-than-satisfying, but highly pragmatic philosophy from the lawyers involved (how can they defend the obviously guilty, is this jail time actually going to solve anything for this defendant, etc.)The characters and the cases are interesting. Well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent High-School Bio of Taft","review":"This biography of Taft was written for advanced junior high or beginning high school students, but it's the best I've been able to find. It's a reasonable summary of Taft's extensive career in government, although the simple writing level does get old, and it brushes over a lot of the more advanced issues, like his controversy with Roosevelt and his philosophy and impact as a Chief Justice.The book has 214 pages and is fairly large print.As a children's book, it's probably quite good, but I evaluated it from an adult perspective.If you're interested in his chief justiceship only, the book to look at is by Alpheus Thomas Mason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"Best of\\" this Great Bluesman","review":"One of the paradoxes of the blues is that if you happen to have a voice like burlap, you get critical points of autheticity. If you are blessed with a golden vocal chords as Josh White clearly was, critics will classify you as a cabaret signer.White is anything but a musical lightweight. His music greatly influenced folk legends Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan. Contrary to its title, this amalgamation does not do justice to White. It leans heavily toward his more popular songs (which came later in his career) which are not necessarily his best from an artistic standpoint.There is a chronological set of White's work available. The first three of these to contain his best work. Any of these would rate four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same bag, cheaper price.","review":"This is the same model sold in the camera dept.

Not great...I got weary of it after the second song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this one","review":"The title of this book would seem to indicate its contents would give equal space to both points of view - it does not. It is strictly an explanation of the Jewish (and very liberal I suspect) point of view with a few casual observations (many of them wrong) of Christianity by the author thrown in for effect. The author displays an \`in your face take it or leave it' type of arrogance. I was disappointed in the fact that the author almost never backs his points directly by the Scriptures (God's Word), but rather he refers to the opinions of the \`great scholars' and Rabbis (men's words). He even referred to the laws concerning sacrifices (God's law) as \`mythological concepts in worship.' This book should have been entitled \\"Traditions of Liberal Judaism and Casual Observances of Christianity From Afar .\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Comparison","review":"This is an excellent book. I was raised as a Christian, but recently have been questing some of Christian practices and beliefs. Every chapter of this book taught me something new about the Jewish people and the Old Testament. I never realized how much Christ's teachings (or the teachings of the apostles) are in conflict with Jewish beliefs. I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to reconcile the Old Testament with the New Testament and is having a difficult time.

The crystal scratches easily. The watch is supposed to be waterproof to 99 feet and the case was never opened; but the crystal was full of moisture bubbles after he swam with it on (and he was at the surface at all times - not nearly 99 feet). Needless to say the thing stopped working shortly thereafter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best gay literary studies in the past decade","review":"After a spate of books in queer studies anachronistically identifying this or that work as \\"gay,\\" Alan Sinfield produced this thoughtful, accessible book that gives gay readings their due while simultaneously attempting to read things with a sense of historical responsibility, postulating the Oscar Wilde trial of 1896 as a marker for the formation of a queer identity that incorporates effeminacy into its battery of indicators. A smart, responsible, and well-written study."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book to end/begin the journey.","review":"Anyone who is at this site has the very exciting prospect of finding the actual TRUTH. A huge claim you may say but one that was made by Gurdjieff. Questions such as is there life after death can be answered. The question more importantly is can you accept the answers. Having read much in this line I was enthralled when I found such an excellent book in my favourite second hand bookshop. Whilst it didn't fall of the shelves it was THERE. Webb has touched the very essence of the work and he is to be congratulated on the presentation of the work. There are times when we know that we have finally got it right. Knowing is a solid element. I strongly recommend the book to searchers of the Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent earth science book!","review":"I checked four earth science books out from the library for my 7yr old. Out of all of them this is hands down the best visual book! It has 3-D and Cross-section pictures and diagrams that are great for visual learners. For instance on the volcano page it has a model of a volcano with a V-shaped cross section and it looks like the magma is flowing out of the page. It shows the main conduit with side vents from the inside and how they look on the outside. It has a great pages on geysers, waterfalls, coral reefs etc...It isn't an in depth science book but that is why I liked it. It covers interesting topics with wonderful pictures and it explains key points in terms kids are more likely to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional and informative","review":"Outstanding documentary. I was fascinated by the journey Guzman takes from being a conservative who had welcomed in Pinochet back in the day, to pursuing the case against the dictator. The documentary will disturb you, but it's essential viewing. More chilling, I think, then the footage of bodies unearthed, is the blind devotion of those who still regard Pinochet as a great man. The man himself was by all accounts a despicable sociopath, and he's more then earned his place in hell. It's interesting to see Guzman, a decent man, as he comes to terms with this dark period in his country's history and pursues justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CALIF.

She is part of a VERY SMALL group of instructors who went out of the way to make our class environment interesting and very educational.

But once I got use to the routine I didn't want to hear her explaining what to do over and over again. I just wanted to do the routine since I knew it.

I want to hear faster, louder praise music so that it keeps me going on the exercises (which I hate). I don't need the pep talks from Donna - I need something to take my mind off what I'm doing. Also, I found that she went through the dance type steps so quickly that I had difficulty following her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise God!!!","review":"Wow what a workout! Anybody can do this, no excuses. Beginners, just step in place and wave your hands to the music and praise God. Try to Follow along as much as you can. Intermediate level follow the Donna and the group dancers and you advanced folks go wild with the holy ghost. Dance, clap, just have fun!

As soon as the show debuted he wanted this. I have to say that for the most part it sits in the house with no play time. I think that is because there is nothing really to this toy. The sound quality is AWFUL. The volume is so low you can barely hear the phrases. It is supposed to turn into a wand but as another reviewer stated this has to be done manually and not by the push of a button. Also it looks like the end of the wand should light up, but NO it is just clear plastic. With all the other electronic toys out there and what they show on the TV series Bandai could have made this item have a few more features. I guess you get what you pay for and with this toy not very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant performance from a brilliant woman","review":"Even though I haven't ordered this CD, I do have a tape of this.

Sure \\"Raise Your Hand\\" and \\"As Good as You've Been to This World\\" aren't the best openers to a legendary concert (these versions aren't very good), but as soon as the drum opening of \\"To Love Somebody\\" starts, the concert gets into full gear and doesn't look back!

Lockwood sounds like Willie Johnson on the early Howlin' Wolf stuff in the first half of the record and the Johnny Shines stuff is just amazing. Shines is the closest thing to Robert Johnson we ever had and he plays some great slide as well. Lockwood's subsequent work was more spotty but Shines never failed to deliver the goods even if he often, like most bluesmen, seemed to repeat himself at times.

Truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poems and Pictures","review":"This book contains three of Elliot's Poems. Growltiger's Last Stand tells the story of the fate of an ornery cat at the hands, er, paws, of Persian and Siamese cats he disdained. It is an amusing tale, although when read today it doesn't always come across as exactly politically correct! The other two poems talk of the feud between the Pekes and the Pollicles, and describe Jellicle cats. All three poems are entertaining and are illustrated with silly pictures that well-suit the tone of the poems. I believe that the book is better suited to slightly older children than the 4 -8 year-old reading level mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goljan Rapid Review is the way to go","review":"I bought it thinking it would be a good supplement for class and the boards but the reality is that there only so much time to review things.

It seems to have been translated word by word from the original Norwegian. Nor can this book about the 'Victorian Ape Woman' be said to be in particularly good taste. I see there is a used copy advertised on Amazon for a penny - that is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think again!","review":"I'm not sure if it's just the translation but the book is quite clunky and poorly written.

The sounds that Tan Dun created with paper and produced by Haruka Fujii are amazing. A real exploration on different sounds and rhythms. The combination of Chinese and Western music is not new for Tan Dun (he composed the music for the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), but this concerto really gets into your senses using what could be considered a primitive instrument. This concerto just shows the immense variety of sounds that can be produced with paper and how it blends into an orchestra. Just sit down and listen, you will be immersed into the music. A real work of art. Highly recommended for any musician, and not only classical music ones. The sound recording is just great, and surround sound serves the purpose well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Tan Dun, what happened to you?","review":"This is not The Last Emperor.

He forged a new harmonic language, shattered boundries, combined the music with his often strange personal philosophy. But you would never know it from this record. Ra doesn't even play piano on it! He only doodles around on the synthesizer now and then, just to let you know he's there. The tunes are mostly old jazz standards, not his, and to my ear they sound like anyone could have played them. Pleasant, straight ahead jazz. But that's just boring when you're expecting the mighty Le Sony'r Ra. Check out the Evidence records first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Expensive Classes! This is the Best Way to Go.","review":"I was lent this book when I was enbarking on a new adventure in my life. I just came home with a 6 week old Black lab puppy.

It is clearly an essential guide for anyone who wants a richer relationship with the dogs in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Skete method did not work for me","review":"I was a novice dog owner and bought this book to help me train my increasingly agressive and out of control puppy. (I chose this one based on the Amazon customer reviews) I tried the training methods used by the monks even though they seemed to be overly confrontational. After a few weeks of the \\"shakedown\\" and \\"alpha rollover\\", the dog's behavior began to get even worse. The physical punishment was eroding any bond of trust that I had established with the dog. To make a long story short, I changed training methods and concentrated on positive reinforcement only. It made all the difference in the world. My dog is now almost a year old and she is truly my best friend (with first rate manners). I learned the hard way that you don't need to intimidate your dog to have her love and respect you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and old techniques","review":"This is a good book if you learned \\"traditional training techniques\\" such as dominance/subordination \\"conditioning\\" and are not interested in learning something new, positive and that works. If you have a dog that has ANY amount of dominance or aggression... DO NOT USE THIS BOOK! If you have a dog that is timid or shy DO NOT USE THIS BOOK! There are much better methods today using positive reinforcement where you will end up with a dog that actually loves you and is happy to please you rather than a dog that is doing what you ask \\"just because he is supposed to\\". If you are a woman DO NOT USE THIS BOOK! The methods may work for men who can physically dominate over their dogs, but please do not try these training techniques unless you can manhandle your dog into submission (and why would you want to do that anyway?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very outdated","review":"I shudder to think of all the inexperienced dog owners out there who are now doing alpha rolls for ordinary dog behavior. I have herad this book quoted for years so when I finally got around to reading it I was highly disappointed. There's actually a section in the book that teaches you how to hit your dog. Twenty years ago I'm sure that it was a great book but a lot of the theories have since been disproved. I would read the book for reference and then find a book with a more positive approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mixed barrel","review":"The Monks have some good ideas about dogs. But many of their ideas are scary! They advise hitting a dog til it cries. This is abuse and should never, EVER be done. If you truly want to train your dog, try a more humane approach, like Karen Pyror. The Monks do understand a lot about dogs--but i would never enrust my precious Labrador to them, and I would never use their abusive methods of \\"training.\\" The thought of so many dogs being cruely trained as a result of the Monks scares me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel and outdated methods","review":"I completely agree with some of the reviewers above, who describe the methods in this book as cruel and dangerous. Hitting, yelling, and using fear to control a dog will only produce a fearful or aggressive animal, not the friend and companion that you want. Please enroll in a local puppy, or adult dog, class that uses praise and positive reinforcement in a fun environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't use this book!","review":"This book is horribly outdated in many of it's training methods. Punishment and intimidation is not necessary for training your dog. \\"Scruff shakes\\", \\"alpha rolls\\", and similar methods have been discounted for years, but this book persists in advocating them. There are so many books available right here on Amazon[.com] that teach you how to teach your dog using scientifically proven positive methods that really work.

I would not advise anyone to buy this book or use training methods like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Informative - Easy","review":"This book made me the Alpha dog in my pack. Training techniques may change but dogs don't. They are still pack animals and respond on that level. I have used the Alpha Wolf Roll Over technique successfully on several pups. Would I try it on a snarling, full grown dog? Of course not, but when used in combination with the other tips and techniques, it can be very helpful to let a young dog who is challenging your authority understand your seriousness. My in-law's cockerspaniel was a snotty little pup always trying to nip at peoples faces. I gently, but firmly used the alpha wolf roll over, he promptly peed in submission and stopped the annoying behavior.

As a dog trainer who specializes in improving dogs behavior,I can tell you with all honesty that their roll over and scruff shake manuvers are not only very dangerous to the dog but also the owner. Countless owners have reported to me how when applying these monk techniques not only did their dog become more unruly but also violent. The monks are cool looking guys with beards and robes and live communely, and i'm sure they are nice folks...but they need to retract their alpha wolf scruffs and rolls and do it soon before more people are severly bitten!The reat of the book is really rather ordinary...many books on this subject are now being written by far more knowledgeable and experienced trainers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"Buyer beware, it's a cheap CD for a reason!

There is'nt too much dribble or drab.Much of the content is probably already well known to his readers but a collective work of the thought process over the time span covered in the work was well worth the read.Again, I disagree with Paul's politics and economics but for those wanting a good view of \\"the other side\\" and the mechanics of the minds on that side this is as good as work as any."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have written a book rather then a collection","review":"Krugman, eminent columnist and economist, has compiled many of his great essays and many lesser works into this single volume that he says chronicles the \`unraveling' of America under the Bush administration. The sad part here is not that his points are well made or that his essays are not good writing, the tragedy is he should have written a book and combined the ideas from his essays to form chapter outlines. As a collection this is a weak read where much fat is included with the meat.

The writing he has done on the evils of mixing economics and ideology is interesting and informative. He regularly uses data (rather than opinion) to support his views on policy. But I'm saddened that \\"The Great Unraveling\\" is void of any citation or backing. Krugman makes many strong points but fails dramatically in backing them up. If Tom Delay went so far as to cite the teaching of evolution as a cause of the Colombine killings I want to know where. Without proper citation Krugman's writing lack validity and meaning. The only thing Krugman demonstrates in \\"The Great Unraveling\\" is that he lacks the writings skills found in most first-year undergraduate students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blowhard Elitist","review":"Unfortunately, a newly awarded noble peace prize winner, further adding to his armor to attack without criticism, the opposing party politics. Nothing but a rambling Bush hit piece, only three years into his presidency, and a big government proponent. Problem is he has apparently has no offspring contributing to the \\"cradle to grave\\" society he espouses. A career without raising children? Maybe I could have as many publications in my spare time. Collection of op-eds from the NTY's that have no cohesion. Sounds like a town crier for the boy who cried wolf. No doubt to his economics knowledge, however, from the halls of academia to the street are two different gigs. Time to see if the next four years, possible eight, will corroborate what he hypothesizes about the gap betweent the rich and poor. Still a good read for the open minded from both sides of the political spectrum.

Krugman, with whom the truth is often a casualty, misses the target again and again in his role as leader of the Bush-bashng brigade. As biased as they come, he doesn't seem to understand that objective readers see this tirade for what it is; Bush Derangement Syndrome taken to the extreme.Serious readers will want to look elsewhere.

He is a leftist. He opposes the Bush administration because he knows what they're doing will be good for the country, not because he is a principled man; even his own mother thought very little of him according to family and friends. His columns speak to the unreality of today's America with the disdain and arrogance of a Princeton economics professor.His thesis, which appears to derive from an excess of prescription medications, is that the Bush Administration seeks to basically eliminate the 20th century--get rid of social security, medicare, unions, all of FDR's New Deal, etc., etc. If you are prepared to believe that load of crap, then you probably will like this book; it'll make you mad and your head will explode. On the other hand, if you possess even a scintilla of intelligence, then you will know that former Enron advisor, Paul Krugman, is a bloody fool and a true moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krugman's Shrill Diatribe","review":"How conveniently Krugman manages to lay virtually every problem in this country squarely on George Bush and how conveniently he also manages to totally ignore everything the Clintons and their administration did to get us where we are.

Krugman gives us facts and policy analysis. Bush and his administration simply do not. I especially love how conservatives attack anyone who questions the administrations policy in Iraq as unpatriotic.They simply must have forgotten the massive amounts of criticism thrown Clinton's way while we had our forces in Kosovo.

Sensible people like Chinese, Koreans and Japanese hold most dollars. Texans can't fight their way out of a paper bag. American morals make the world cringe. If you travel you will deny your citizenship. We can't sell bonds or buy oil.Honesty demands that we respect hegemony of the Asian axis and the late arival of Germany-Russia. That's our world now - watching from the sidelines. If Krugman were a useful economist he would not mince words about it. America has no reason to be great and nothing to be great with.

What I got instead was a collection of editorials previously published in the print media. These editorials were published over a time span of 5 years, hence many of them were outdated by the time this book was published. The feel of the book is sarcasm, and it is one long polemic against George Bush and the neo-conservatives in his administration. Unfortunately, since it is comprised of editorials, there are no figures, no charts, no graphs and very few references. Instead, we get paragraph after paragraph that mention this number or that statistic, but without proper sourcing. Also, because it is comprised of a series of reprinted editorials, the flow is not good, and many of the points are not argued well.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read The Book","review":"To all you Krugman fans and would-be fans....I urge you to read the book. Unlike the dim bulb from Chicago, an ACTUAL reading of the book by someone with an intelligent an objective mind will find that it is mostly a collection of modified press releases and fleshed-out talking point memos distributed by the Democratic National Committee.On those infrequent occasions when the former Enron advisor actually writes a column on the subject of his alleged \\"expertise,\\" it takes a veritable army of real economists to follow along behind and correct the numerous errors and misstatement of facts....sort of like the people in the circus with the brooms trailing behind the elephants."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Unraveling","review":"Clealy written by a truth twisting low life liberal.

Wasteful spending is what causes deficits Krugman! Tax cuts to both corporations and individuals can and have under both the JFK and Reagan administrations raised revenue coming into the treasury. That is because tax cuts increase the revenue needed for capital investment. It is investment in new ideas that keeps the economy going and creates more jobs. Under Bush, we have increases in spending across the board which makes Bush a fiscally moderate Republican not a Reagan Republican (Krugman thinks your a radical if you want to let people keep a little more of the money they earn) Finally, when a liberal like Krugman starts talking about free market economic policy you have to laugh because Marxism is his religion - there was no free market in the U.S.S.R."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEFT WING RESPONSE TELLS ALL","review":"The venom spitting left wing response to Krugman's book is the surest indicator that he is, in fact, nuttier than a fruit cake. Recent events continue to show that this administration has been right on just about everything, from war to tax cuts, in order to improve financial and physical security in this country.

I wish everyone in America could read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is written for a reason...","review":"Krugman loves the USA and hopes to shed some light on the troubles Bush's partners have brought upon themselves and on us.

Other reviewers have noted the accuracy of the period costumes, and this may be so, but it is nonetheless a romance of the cheesiest calibre. It smacks of hackneyed melodrama, silly dialogue (\\"I should shoot you where you stand, but that is not my way.\\"), and hokey lighting during the \\"romantic\\" bits. It was, I believe, a made-for-TV movie, though, so this is perhaps to be expected.All the same, if you are a fan of the actors who are in it -- especially Hugh Grant, and would like to see him in one of his early works, or if you are like me and are (unintentionally?) amused by cheesy romances, then you will certainly enjoy this. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film that I enjoyed watching!","review":"It isn't the quality of Pirates of the Carribean or Lord of the Rings, but it has a nice oldtime feel to it that I love.

It has some good fight scenes as well, again, not as good as nowaday fight scenes, but still captivating. The costumes/makeup are wonderful to look at, as well as the variety of scenery.

Did they really increase the film speed with shots of horsemen to make it seem like they were moving faster? Yes! I think there's a reason why no one ever mentions this movie when they talk about Hugh Grant's career (let alone Michael York) and it's the absolutely terrible script.

It's obvious that Dodge travelled to these foreign places as he infuses his descriptions with the sights, smells and sounds. This is a well written adventure, one of a series: apparently, Dodge wrote two more Colby books; one day I might track them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase, For any fan of 08th MS team","review":"I first got this after watching the 08th MS team, and i must say this is a great figure to own.

I suspect it will become one of the classic texts of the dynamics and evolution of complex systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"The main thread of the book is the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research and education center founded in 1984 in the US. The institute deals with complex adaptive systems from physical, biological, computational, and social point of view. Complexity can be found in for instance environmental, technological, biological, economic, and political systems. Hence, this research area is highly relevant.The story was interesting to read. However, being an engineer, I prefer a shorter and more concise style of writing. A deeper mathematical discussion about complexity would also have been appreciated. The book tells an exiting scientific story, but it is more of a well written novel than a technical textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I found the book disappointing. This is definitely NOT in the league of Chaos.In particular, the coverage of the material of the subject, complexity, was very thin. Waldrop would bring up a subject, address it with some metaphor, and then move on without providing any details. The vast majority of the book is a series of stories about scientists at the Santa Fe Institute who had their inner-child hurt on their journey to discovering complexity. A better title for the book would have been \\"The Road to Santa Fe: A Tail of Grief.\\"The book had two redeeming features, the breadth of the material covered and the bibliography; both provide direction for more fruitful reading. Really, getting the feel for most of the subjects covered in this book could be found by putting 'complexity' into wikipedia and reading for a day, though.Since it was not a complete waist of my time, I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"a view on today's science","review":"how the edge of the world of science looks today. an insight on where we stand and what we are looking for in the third millennium.given in a clear, insightful and informed way. you only need be interested in the topix to understand it, and it goes a long way in making a book of science good for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't believe many people are too much interested in finding out how scientists work with other people by reading several hundred pages. Maybe a chapter or two will suffice for that purpose. People who buy this kind of non-professional book on science and engineering want far more than that - they want to understand the underlying ideas and the significance of the ideas, written in accessible English.Simply, this book spent too much space on explaining how scientists worked, and not much on WHAT they found out.

But why not change it to more accurately reflect the content to something like \\"The History of the Santa Fe Institute\\"? The autobiographical journey the book takes the unsuspecting reader on is filled with too much background and not enough substance. I consider books to be some of the most valuable items in the world today. However, upon completion of this book, I looked at my wife and said \\"I've got to throw this one away. I don't know of anyone else that I would wish it on and I will never read it again.\\" And so, in the trash can it went. It probably isn't THAT bad of a book, but I could never recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This book is not about a mathematical explanation of complexity. This book will not teach you how to construct a neural network or create autonomous cellular automata.This book is about the process that some of the world's best scientists went through to realize why a theory like complexity is needed. The book will give any reader a deeper understanding for, and appreciation of how such a broad and information rich topic like complexity is becoming better understood. Insights are also given into how this new understanding of emergent behavior may soon be applied to what were once considered unsolvable problems of Economics, Artificial Life, Biology, Physics, etc.Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos is the story of a group of humans trying to understand the very nature of nature itself, a superhuman task.

Even if we could understand them, after playing once or twice you would know all the answers with the VERY small deck of playing cards. Why would you only put 36 cards in a game like this? Someone really didn't know what they were doing when they made this game. Apparently they didn't plan to sell many or they would have made it easier to understand, had a lot more than 36 cards and made the tokens where they actually stood up.

Still, I learned a great deal from this book; not only was it informative, but it wasn't nearly as dry and impenatrable as I'd been afraid it might be.

This is wonderful music to put on in the evening when you are cooking, reading, or just wanting something beautiful to listen to. I don't understand why this man isn't better known here in the US, but he is a Scot, and a lot of Americans don't seem to look beyond our own shores.

Jimmy Grimble has 2 tracks featuring Ian McCulloch of The Bunnymen with Alex James from Blur and Simon Boswell. I loved the almost-acapella feel of their rendition of sentimental favourite, \\"Blue Moon\\". \\"Do You Believe?\\", an original penned by McCulloch, James & Boswell, is a bit schmaltzy to begin with, but sets into a nice groove. Other highlights- a couple outstanding remixes updating old 80's favourites. EMF's \\"Unbelievable\\" is druggy cool, and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \\"Two Tribes\\" ...well, if FGTH did the \\"Shaft II : John Shaft in the Matrix\\" soundtrack, this is what it would sound like. I also dig Freestylers \\"Feel The Panic\\", and old standbys from Charlatans, Happy Mondays & Stone Roses. Of course, Echo & The Bunnymen w/\\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" ...well...it's the Bunnymen.

I own every single release and watch them over and over.Throughout the Poirot series (both TV and movie) there has always been a charming character who will calmly solve the murder using dry humor and intellegence. His interaction with Captain Hasting and Miss Lemon add to the plot and they are missed in the newer movie collections.In Set 5 you find a tired, bitter old man and dark settings - this was not a pleasure to watch and a one time viewing is all that this set will get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agatha Christie's Poirot: Set 5","review":"As they became available, my husband and I purchased seasons one through four of the Poirot mysteries starring David Suchet. We enjoyed these so much that we looked forward to the recently released season five which includes Third Girl, Murder on the Orient Express, and Appointment with Death. We were very disappointed. Had these three been our introduction to the Poirot mysteries, we would not have acquired any of the others. The producers of these latests stories took free rein in adding and changing characters and plots which did not in any way improve on Agatha Christie's original stories. Additionally, Poirot now appears bitter and self-righteous and without any of the charm and humor we so admired in previous collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"murder on the orient express, new David Suchet version","review":"I found this production of Murder on the Orient Express in poor taste and frankly disagreeable. It amazes me that Christie's estate allowed it to go forward. The script writer took unwarranted liberties with Christie's story, none of them for the better. This version is frightening and grim; all the wit is gone out of it. I don't recommend it at all.Nora Klein, Houston TXThen I watched Appointment with Death. The productions are more violent- violence for its own sake - and without charm. The writer has turned Poiret into a figure of religious zeal - something entirely uncalled for and in no way even hinted at in Christie's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark!","review":"I own literally every Poirot DVD starring David Suchet. I was so excited to see that 3 more DVD's were available to view with him portraying Poirot. I, sadly, watched the set once and will probably not do so again. Why? The stories were quite \\"dark\\" and with such an intensity that it made me uncomfortable. I didn't enjoy watching. I felt relief when it was over, so I could relax...the only problem was how to get the images and sounds out of my head! Also, I was saddened by the difference in the Poirot portrayal. This Poirot is not \\"jolly\\" in any sense of the word; he is barely likeable and in some place is NOT likeable; he is deeply intense. Don't expect any of the smiles you have during the other DVD's at the foibles in Poirot's character. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"I own all the Poirot DVD's to date, so was glad when this became available. It was very beautifully filmed. As a long time fan, I have to admit I do miss the other three characters I grew to love, but I realize the later ones try to be true to the book. If you're a fan, you will want this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"My wife and I have all of the Agatha Christi Poirot DVDs with Suchet thru Season 10, some sixty shows, and have truly loved the series until somewhere around Season 10 or 11. At this point the TV series took a shift to what appears to be some sort of modernization and a loss of the \`charm' of the previous shows? We have ceased to purchase any of the most recent shows due to this degradation. This Set 5 from season 11 is by far the worst set and Appointment with Death is the worst ever. It is unlikely we will ever buy any Poirot DVDs from Season 11 on. Truely disappointed as we so enjoyed the series in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP, have not recieved it yet way past deadline","review":"help, have not received it yet, do not know where to go to tell you.

They are not faithful to the books,seem to be updated to an audience who will not notice the changes or errors in plot, dialogue.Point of view is more 21 century then 1920's - '30's.

As written they are fun to read and are worth reading again and again. However the movies can be quite a trial to watch at times because you get other people trying to rewrite her ideas and I think that one has to look sideways at some of them and say to yourself, \\"They don't quite cut it as Mrs. Christie\\". BUT, what did they do to \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" in this version? Poirot is played way to sinister in this adaptation, when one looks at all the other versions played by other actors. What a mess. I did not like watching this one. Not only was the acting quite poor by the Music was over powering at times and noisy on top of it. Agatha must be rolling over in her grave.

Sadly, the team who chose to \\"modernize\\" Miss Marple got their hooks into Murder On the Orient Express.How anyone can imagine that they can \\"improve\\" on an Agatha Christy mystery is beyond me. Such arrogance!Here we have Poirot utterly out of character condoning the stoning of an adulteress. This wasn't anything Christie wrote; just some \\"improvement\\" this director or writer thought they would ad to show perspective. And this writer/director apparently has insight into Poirot's religious beliefs as well--what a surprise to Agatha Christie.Poirot is depicted as Javert-like in his belief that \\"the law\\" must always be obeyed. Such rot! Didn't they read Curtain?This adaption isn't just bad; it's a literary crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us back the old Poirot!","review":"First, I want to say that I'm a big fan of this series and have seen all of them, own the DVDS, and watch them over and over again. But the new producers of this series have ruined it. Once again missing are Miss Lemon, Hastings and the Inspector. Instead, we get an overly serious Poirot. The tone is no longer fun -- it's grim, VERY grim, in both Orient Express and Appointment With Death. I will watch neither of those shows again. Please, please bring back the old producers who did such a fine job for all those years. This new format and tone are NOT working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on the Orient Express","review":"My wife and I were so looking forward to seeing David Suchet play Poirot in \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" but this is a huge disappointment! I don't know who had him play Poirot as a dark, cold, unsympathetic and self-righteous person, but it was a mistake.My wife and I have watched every Poirot many times and the way he was played in this makes it a real drag to watch. Frankly, not worth watching again.I hope in future movies he returns to the Poirot we know and love!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"The three DVDs in the set are well-acted, produced and directed.

However, the storylines were \\"dark\\" compared to previous episodes. I was disappointed that Hastings was not featured in the Movie Collection. He made the stories more interesting and was a great addition to every episode. Perhaps, the murder's seemed more sinister and dark because Hastings was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I have loved the Suchet Poirots to date but this season was a major disappointment. These were not even in the spirit of the books. Where did all this gratuitous religion come from? Never saw it in Christie's books, other than the traditional vicar character. Poirot is dark, miserable,seemingly physically in pain, and preachy. He may have always been a bit pompous but lovably so. This version makes him almost evil in his grimness. The documentary on the Orient Express and filming of all are lovely.Zoe Wanamaker is a delight. The stories, however, are jerky and often illogical, not something that the author would have done. Christie would be rolling in her grave over these."},{"rating":"1","title":"poirot 5","review":"DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL - far inferior to the Peter Ustinov versions.

The band is tight and telepathic. Guitarist Scott Henderson is a musical alchemist, combining jazzy harmonic sophistication, screaming bluespower, and pure shred into an electric stew hot enough to melt rocks. The rhythm section of drummer Steve Smith and Victor Wooten alternately funks up the beat and subdivides it into complex rhythmic algebra. High points include \\"Sub Zero\\" and the extended jam \\"Chakmool Ti\\". Henderson's playing is a little rawer than it is on most of his Tribal Tech work, but it is no less stunning. Bassist Wooten is a formidable technician, but still leaves room for the funk. Drummer Smith's style on this CD is reminiscent of fusion titan Billy Cobham. All in all, an excellent sophmore effort from these excellent musicians. One only hopes that they take it on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"a valuable gift","review":"The service was SUPER fast and efficient.The product is very useful and appreciated by the receiver.Will do business again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and Stinky","review":"I've used just about every hair thickener, and this is not my favorite.

I have to admit that I have only tried it twice, and the reason being is that this spray is VERY MESSY and will also paint your face if your not careful. Also, I dont recommend anyone using it on a hot day, where you may be prone to sweating because if you do sweat, you better run to a bathroom to either wash it off or you will look rediculous with color all over your face.

If you're hair is thinning on top this will do some amazing things for you. Most people don't realize it's not just about \\"painting\\" their scalp - this stuff actually does something to your existing hair that gives it a huge does of texture, making it easier to style. Anytime I start running low - I always reup before running low. Some disadvantages are that it def comes off on stuff - like your pillow case and your fingernails if you scratch your head. And also, on other peoples fingernails, if they find their hands in your hair. Rain is not a problem, neither is sweat.

There was a time in my life I thought I was going crazy because of all the premonitions I was having. This book makes me feel more normal. This is one book I won't give away but will keep as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this book!","review":"I read this book based on a recommendation from a dear friend. That recommendation turned out to be one of the greatest gifts I've ever received in my life. This book held my interest the entire time. I took my time reading it because I was savoring the information, inspiration, etc., that I received and continue to receive. The words from this book will stay in my mind and heart forever. I plan to purchase many copies of this book to give away as gifts. Judith's writing style keeps you interested and excited about the next chapter. The experiences of her patients, and her own, are realistic and easy to relate. I can't say enough about this book. It has confirmed and explained so much of my life's path - it has given me the confirmation and courage I needed to embrace my life path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaches You right to the Core","review":"The book \\"Second Sight\\" is absolutely phenomenal and I have read tons of books on Intuition. Second sight made it easier to understand and let me tell you I had lots of \\"aha\\" moments. The author takes you on her own journey in life and it amazes me of the similarities in my life. Her description of the double life makes it easier for me to understand what I am going through. It is so true that we live too much by our heads and not feel by our bodies...I recommend this book to anyone currently stuck in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution - This book might shake your faith...","review":"I was amazed at the depth of this book.

However, I had to review this if just to help other buyers from wasting their money. If only I had read the Amazon review as well as other buyer's reviews more carefully. I read them again and wondered...did I have a brain fart while ordering this? The Amazon review states...\\"Aside from these strong features, the film itself is a little bit of a mess\\". A little bit of a mess is a huge understatement! And what \\"strong features\\"?First, I will tell you what this film is not; NOT....funny, interesting, historical, nostolgic, informative, well acted, well directed and produced, musically interesting, sexy, titallating, or erotic. I'm sure there is more adjectives I could come up with but I would rather not waste any more time referring to this film.I will tell you what it IS though: A waste of money at any cost as well as your viewing time.

There is a good deal of hippie nudity, and the music is pretty good, but the acting, story, dialogue, direction, and editing, are all pitiful.

It's easy to find the romantic and (mostly) fanciful tales. It's a much more daunting task to find a well-researched and \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" book on the topic. I was looking specifically for additional and less histrionic information on The Morrigan, a character much referred to in fantastic terms and not so much in terms of credible resources. The book delivered and promises many other such stories as well. It seems well balanced in terms of both presentation of various theories and in interpretation of those theories in terms of native culture, as well as religious, social and gender roles of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service and product for the money","review":"I've used this vendor twice for Waterman pens.

I suspect most cell phones won't work either.

Very relevant for those with a Christian heritage, whether they are practicing Christians or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEQUEL?","review":"Face it people, this is not T2 or The Godfather Part II, and why is there a sequel to the hitcher anyway? The first \\"The Hitcher\\" was a classic movie which was a perfect reimagining of Steven Speilberg's classic DUEL. There was no need for a sequel. The story was told, nothing more to tell. A sequel? Dragonheart fell victim for this. A sequel will just tell the story all over again. Not even C. Thomas Howell could save this movie from being a failure. All in all, not entertaining and unnecessary. Not recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel","review":"I cannot rate this movie without comparing it with The Hitcher, since the reason I bought it was because I am a fan of the original movie. The best thing about the first movie was the suspense and the excellent acting by both C. Thomas Howell and Hauser. This second movie is a bad rehash of the first with a lot of action and no suspense at all. There are even repeated scenes; this makes this movie a totally predictable one. The villain this time is not as mysterious as the first one and the easy way in which he escapes one time after the other is very hard to believe, as is the stupidity of everyone from the police to the new hero. C. Thomas Howell did an excellent job with the very limited part assigned to him, but this is simply a mediocre movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really doesn't even deserve one star....","review":"Oh GEE...I can't imagine WHY this movie went straight to DVD.

After I watched it again, I said to myself, self, this is crazy!! I loved this movie and watched the first one with Jennifer Jason Leigh. That was insane. I am a big fan of Kari Wuhrer and Jake Busey. But with all films that have a II, III, et., you loose the magic that the first one had. Why try and repeat it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hitcher 2: I've Been Waiting","review":"I do not fully understand the comments about this movie. Yeah, its not perfect but man the story is creepy and the hitcher is so damn crazy that it would make the original hitcher look goofy. I like the kills and the music and the finger scene. oh man! Yeah I know this movie isn't perfect but its 2000 times better than the horrible remake. So I recommend u get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT HITCH ON TO THIS","review":"In the first movie, a young Jim Halsey is taking a trip across the southwest to see his brother. He picks up a hitchhiker and he turned out to be evil. In some twisted way he looked at Jim as a son while he murdered person after person and framed Jim for it. The first movie, after time, picked up an audience and somewhat of a cult following. In number two, the hitcher is played by a different actor. If you believe the title\\"Ive been waiting\\" its supposed to be the same guy but C. Thomas Howell doesnt reconize him when they meet.(go fiqure) After this point its basically a re-make of the first movie with no orginal ideas at all. For some reason, Jim is killed about halfway through the movie so his wife must battle the Hitcher which im afraid to say is real unbeliveable. Kari Whurer is beautiful but, I found it hard to belive her in this role. Get the first movie if you want to be entertained, get this movie for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy sequel to the original","review":"This straight to video fim cannot compare to the 1st-which was a classic with Roger Hauer-Jake Bussey (son of Gary Bussey) is just like his father-a typical B movie actor with limited range and acting ability. He was not at all scary-he was just too predictable. The movie did not explain the connection between Busey and Hauer (from the original) - and I thought that was a major part missing-C Thomas Howell is a great B movie actor and is fit for movies like this but---he was killed off way too early in this film and from that time on the film kind of went down hill after that. Rent it-bring it back to the store and forget it.

I know Roberta Shore eventually leaves the series and that will be interesting how it is handled. Don't want go give it away as some of you haven't ever seen The Virginian.

It is the perfect size for melting chocolate, stirring batters, sifting flour into, prep work, etc. It is light enough for me to lift with one hand and gradually pour flour into my stand mixer bowl instead of having to spoon the flour in. It might not be the most hefty bowl on the block but it definitely does the job without making things difficult. If it eventually dents or warpes, I will have gotten my money's worth.It holds less than 3 quarts, to my measurement, but that will not change my opinion of how useful it will be to me.

Although this was clearly the intent, the reality falls short of the mark.First off, the book is infuriatingly poorly written. It is rife with misspellings, bizarrely worded sentences, and endless repetition.

The story jumps from action to action in a very wooden manner, without fully describing the characters or their emotions. The main character, Finn, is developed somewhat, but the other characters are almost interchangable without solid personalities of their own. The surprise twists do not come as a surprise. There are big holes in the plot. At one point, Finn trusts a character who he knows helped kidnap his friend. In another scene, he holds a powerful weapon in his hand, but doesn't use it against the enemy. The novel is riddled with poorly written sentences. It feels very quickly written, without enough editing. Which is a shame, because the ideas in it are very clever and original. It's too bad it wasn't more thoughtfully written to fully engage the reader's senses and emotions. It has all the heart and depth of a video game. Lots of flashy ideas, but no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Yourself A Favor!","review":"I love Ridley Pearson's KK series so much! I'm well over my tween years and I am a huge fan of Disney and Pearson and those two combined made for a great seven part series. The books are filled with adventure in a memorable place and bring into play some of your favorite Disney creations. The action is appropriate and the story is challenging for young mystery/thriller readers. The first book takes place in the Magic Kingdom and whenever I read it I automatically imagine myself there. Your favorite scenes may be in the castle or on Main Street or (mine) Splash Mountain! There are new villains running around and we want to stop them!The publisher did a smart thing with the new covers: they made them bold and interesting. Something people will stop and look at. So please do your kids or yourself a favor: buy a copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the bad writing","review":"Such an interesting idea, but so poorly written that neither I nor my 10yo daughter made it more than 50 pages or so.

I haven't gotten very far into the book, but I'm a little disappointed already to read that the only black character in the book is tall, has attitude, baptist, and has no parents. No, this isn't a general fact, it's a stereotype. I'm sure there are other stereotypes about the other characters, but I just couldn't get past those.In addition to that, it's poorly written, slow to start, and confusing for my clients.

It really gets you in that Disney mood too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Lover's fun for all ages","review":"I am a huge Disney World Fan so I was drawn to this book. It is written for the teen or preteen age but as an adult who finds herself reading all sorts of heavy material for her occupation it was great to have a fun read.

The story flows nicely, with some surprising twists. My only criticism is that I thought is should have been a little harder hitting, maybe with a sudden death or near-death to show how high the stakes were. I guess I wanted a little more grittiness from a \\"teen\\" book. But no complaints whatsoever on the quality of the writing.

The process of the scanning makes him and 4 others cross over to Disney World at night. They have to figure out what the Stonecutter's Quill is and avoid the Overtakers (Disney Villians) This is only the beggining of a series of books and I am looking forward to the release of the 2nd book on August 28th!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I was very excited when this book came out and could not wait to read it because of the reviewers' positive reviews. I also was excited for it because I am a Disney fan and love everything about Disney, especially Disneyland. However, this was a very, very poorly written book. Now I am almost in my 30s so I guess I could agree that I'm not Finn's age and maybe wouldn't understand as well. On the other hand, I generally only read children's books so I believe I have a good understanding of what a good piece of children's literature is and this is not it. The writing was clumsy and as was mentioned before, wooden. Very wooden. It had good ideas, but did not deliver. Instead, it seemed like a marketing gimmick. If you enjoy good children's literature, do not read."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor language, attractive setting","review":"The book is fun to read, but absolute pulp fiction for kids. Primitive action, poor language, flat characters. Nothing to provoke any thinking. The only thing that I liked about it: the real setting of the Magic Kingdom is fun to read about.

The descriptions put me back inside my favorite rides and had me wondering about all the behind the scenes areas I've never had the pleasure of visiting. It also kept my mouse ears a bit tilted as I pondered how I would interact with attractions gone astray and dark characters come to life.

In a series of stories linked by the figure of John Wayne, Dan Barden weaves an emotionally taut family saga.As much as this is a book about John Wayne, it is also a book about the Bardens, a family trying to make sense of their own lives in the shadow of the Duke. He takes the John Wayne myth and peels it back to show us how much more heroic a complex, flawed individual trying to imagine the best for himself is than the Indian fighting screen image against which his life is set.

It seriously works PERFECTLY, I can do pretty big batches of food (snacks for 5 of us, or a meal for 2 or 3) and it heats to 350 in about 15 mins (I just timed it).

That, in itself, isn't really a compelling reason to buy it, there are plenty of other good translations out there, some perhaps even better than this one.However, this one has hands down better notes than any other cheap paperback bible. Every book of the bible has a brief, very scholarly written introduction, and clarifying footnotes on many pages.What I really respect is that the introductions and footnotes and really, legitimately, scholarly. The moralizing commentary routinely found in some \\"study bibles\\" is here reduced to simple notes of clarification on either odd historical points or lines that are hard to translate.More than enough to recommend this one, even to non-Catholics. Martin Luther might not have particularly liked the extra books, but he did say people should read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Hardback","review":"As a Catholic bible, this is wonderful.

I gave this a \\"two\\" rather than a \\"one\\" only because it is not so bad as a few popular bibles which are mere paraphrases.Though the content is not inaccurate, it seems the authors were so desperately trying to be \\"super-American\\" that they translated passages into American slang, ironically not realising how that can vary according to region and era. For example, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, generations would have understood the word \\"harlot,\\" where \\"loose women\\" does not have the same accuracy.For a contemporary, accurate version of the Bible, in non-slaughtered language, try the Revised English Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lord is with You","review":"My birthday is February 8th and I wanted to read the two books of Maccabees to learn the story of Hanukkah Chanukah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen inspirations","review":"Giada's cookbook is as inspiring as she is!

It had recipes in it that are pretty common Italian family fare - nothing unusual or fancy - Not really representative of Giada's normal style and flare.

Service is fast and efficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Bad Cook to Good Cook","review":"I was possibly one of the worst cooks on the planet until I discovered Giada De Laurentiis and bought 'Giada's family dinners' book. It truly inspired me to enjoy not only the cooking but also the preparation of the food. It's georgously glossy with lots of lovely photos and the recipes are so simple to follow that I have so far failed to produce a disastrous result which in itself is a small miracle. All of the ingredients used are easily available. The suggested menus are also a great idea especially for someone who needs all the help I can get. One of my favourite recipes is the Lasagna Rolls and whoever heard of grilling lettuce? - but it works! I would also recommend Giada's \\"Everyday Italian\\" book for all the same reasons plus the fact that the Vodka Sauce is heavenly. Thank you Giada, I'm no longer scared of the kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more great recipes","review":"I am a long-time Giada fan after watching her on FoodNetwork for several years. I connect with her recipes because they are healthy and tasty, easy-to-follow instructions, and I can be successful cooking them.

The photographer did a great job on both books...I like seeing a photo of finished prepared food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better","review":"This, her second cookbook, is even better than the first. Its family style is pleasing. You feel you are sharing recipes with a good friend who is also a terrific cook. The book is a prized addition to my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"step up from her last","review":"Though I haven't cooked a lot from this yet (I own too many other cookbooks I'm trying to work through!), what I have cooked from here has been great. In her last book, there were too many cleavage shots and a couple \\"throwaway\\" recipes, this book is a step up in every way--better recipes, more actual pictures of the dishes. This cookbook has a lot more usefulness than the last as well. I want to cook a lot more from this one, and in many ways the things seem more practical.See the table of contents provided by another reviewer--I'll think you'll find an interesting and intriguing selection. As a developing home cook, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect again","review":"If you're looking for easy-to-make and relatively fast meals that taste great, you're in for a treat once again with Miss De Laurentiis' newest book. Of course, there are more refined, elaborate, and challeging Italian cookbooks out there, but if you don't want to spend all day in the kitchen yet turn out beautiful and delicious meals, try this. In my opinion, food for dinner with friends or family shouldn't be either demanding for the cook to create or intimidating for the guests to eat. Therefore, it's great for family meals as well as for entertaining. If you're looking to WOW your guests with all of the hours of work you put into a meal, try Charlie Trotter instead. If you're looking for time to spend enjoying your guests and diners who beg for your recipe, buy Giada's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"I was very impressed with this cookbook.

I am a huge italian food fan and love to have this to work off of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little gripes, overall yummy","review":"Overall, I love Giada's simple recipes. My gripe is more with the production of the book. Many of the photos are either unlabeled or not near the recipe they depict (either label them all or none or put them all next to the recipe). There are LOTS of photos of Giada (and her dog and her family). While I think we can all agree that Giada is photogenic, I'd rather get an idea of what I'm going to be making and how appetizing it should look.But those are just picky gripes from someone who loves food photography and wants more.Sure some people take offense that her recipes are to simple or Americanized, but I think they are tasty.

Scant introduction to composting, importance of worms to the soil, sprouts and container gardening. Gives brief descriptions of growing 27 plants he feels are vital to health.

The new one has a fixed antenna which will not move to help secure a better picture like the first one. The picture is clear during the morning/day and in the evening/night, the picture gets quite static. The sound is not bad, but the louder you have it, the more static you hear.

Well, the other brand is charging as I type, so I hooked this Summer one up -no charging needed.... GREAT picture ...in the dark (w/ nightlight in room)- kudos in that dept. BUT, it's the white static noise that we CANNOT deal with. If it were SOFT white noise, fine. But, nope, harsh static...no sleep static... sleep isn't happening static, sooo back to the store this puppy goes.HOWEVER, if you only want to use this during the day and/or that sound doesn't bother you, then -GREAT picture, clarity & nice big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this camers cause i had a very premature baby.I had a diffrent brand with my son and i loved it worked great but boys will be boys he broke it.picked it up and threw it so ihad to buy another one when my daughter came home from the hospital.i couldn't find the same one,So i bought this one didn't have it two weeks and the screen went out on it all i get is ablack screen and the recepition is bad its always making funky noises.But i didn't take insurance out on it so i couldn't return it.So here i am tring to find another with out wasting a hundred and some dollars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"The idea of this product is great. We get so much static that it's almost impossible for us to even use this, I've been startled numerous times in the middle of the night. It's so loud at night that we have to turn the volume down almost all the way, which totally defeats the purpose. When there's a lot of static the picture is so distorted you can't see anything. You can't leave the screen on at night because it lights up the entire room. The picture isn't very clear, so it's hard to watch for detailed movement - like breathing. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step Away from the Monitor","review":"Bottom line: You don't want this thing.Here's why...first, if you have any kind of radio interference where you live, you can forget about ever using the audio part of this. We had to buy a separate audio monitor and turn the volume all the way down on this one (sort of defeats the purpose of the all in one monitor).Second, you rarely can get a clear picture. I don't mean a little static or the black and white is not crisp, I mean any picture besides a blizzard-like snow pattern. However, on the plus side, if you stand a certain distance and certain angle from the monitor part, you'll get a clear picture. Walk away and it's gone. Now, the angle and distance aren't predictable, so you'll have to experiment each night. You can actually keep your hand on the back of the unit and that also generates a clear picture. Again, don't remove your hand. This is a little awkward at first, when you try to sleep standing up with one arm raised, but you get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far good","review":"We haven't used it a lot in the last two months (she is two months now), but so far goo signal transmission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else, even if it costs more.","review":"We bought one of these in spring of 2006 when our son was about 5 mos old, and it worked great with no problems.

One day last week, the cord finally just died, and we couldn't get the monitor to come back on at all. The next day, we bought a new one of the very same monitor, and it's AWFUL. The picture is fine, but we were up til 2:30 am the first night, trying to find a place where the monitor didn't make this horrible, repetitive, endless static noise.

Then three madmen appear out of nowhere and sodomize David. Their appearance is like the viewer's wish granted: characters so willfully uncompelling should be chastised, although the real punishment should be dished out to the director.

Perhaps the best thing is that I am from Sonoma County where most of the events take place. The descriptions of the towns, people and the ever present vineyards really struck home. The obvious joy that the author takes in her life and the wines her family makes permeates the book. She obviously lives a life different from the average person but seems to know it and appreciate all she has. Many local people are mentioned but almost always in a positive and entertaining way.

Too bad, because the story of growing and bottling wine is an interesting one, and she doesn't tell it poorly.

On the first pass, I was a little disappointed in the new remix, as it seemed that the songs seemed to be missing the \\"hard edge\\" that were so much a part of their music. However, upon further listening, I find that the changes in the songs have, in most cases, added to their impact. For example, the new, two-part vocals in \\"Heat In The Streets\\" make the story much more apparent and the lyrics are much clearer than they were originally. I do miss the soaring, high-note guitar riffs that were so much a part of the \\"Nemesis\\" album, but \\"20 Years...\\" reflect the band's artistic growth.\\"Twenty years...\\" is an excellent release from a group that has been missing in action for far too long.

Itself a great piece of flamenco with full of duende.It is a simple story of loyalty, love, agony and fate of a Rom (i.e., Gypsy) family caught in a feud of revenge with another family. Musically it is a remarkably rich anthology of living flamenco and its North African heritage. Don't expect a theatrical, stylized presentation of flamenco dances like the ones in Carlos Saura's films. The dances you'll see are spontaneous and real, and for that reason, more touching and memorable.The final two pieces of music are a masterstroke of the director/composer Gatlif. The instrumental piece, consisting of the sounds of sheet metal hammering and whipping, an engine starter, and a rickety pump engine, is a pure essence of flamenco. The beautifully sung, melancholic \\"Naci en Alamo\\" will then lead you through the dark passage of death.I only wish that a video or DVD would be released soon so that I could see it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengo","review":"the first time I viewed it I found it a bit unsettling because of the subject matter, the 2nd time I watched it I fell in love with it.

To make matters worse, there's a scene where this disabled person is introduced to a beautiful prostitute for the purpose of having an \\"assignation.\\" While they didn't actually show anything, I find this sort of thing to be utterly distasteful and I don't see how it adds to any film. In fact, I couldn't even finish watching this film, let alone my dinner because I lost my appetite.I purchased the film, \\"Latcho Drom,\\" another film by Tony Gatlif, which I loved, but I definitely wouldn't recommend \\"Vengo\\" to anyone.

This one works great, but frankly I don't understand why that can't design one that is comfortable to wear.Once you figure out how it is supposed to be worn, it isn't too bad, however I can only wear it about an hour at a time. Most of the time I keep it in my shirt pocket, and put it in my ear when my phone rings.I'm keeping it, because it works better than all the other ones.

Of course, there are no replacement ear hooks available for purchase....3. in order to charge in the cradle, ear hook must be removed, wasting a bit of time to disassemble/reassemble - and increasing chances of breakage.So if you're okay with having the ear hook break and just fitting the device in your ear, it would be fine.

Overall the fit is subjective, and may take getting used to and finding the right way to insert (does not really go inside ear canal, rather, it gets held in place covering the ear canal externally, and sits in snug). The button to turn it on and off is easy to hit while re-adjusting during calls, causing you to hang up on your call if you hit it by mistake.Bottom Line:Best headset ever made so far.

Number one it does not use the same charge cord as Samsung phones, so you have to take both with you if you're going away. Nokia uses the same cord. On top of that, the ear piece has to fit inside a charging device that connects to the cord. So the ear loop must be removed each time.

I had a problem with this repeatedly falling out of my ear. I ended up returning it because it would not stay in my ear. I have yet to find an earpiece with sound as good.

I can only hear people on the other end when I am at home where it is quiet.

This rubber grommet is placed over the ear piece and keeps the WEP200 in your ear. Unfortunately, this rubber grommet wears out rather quickly and then the WEP200 continuously falls out of your ear. I tried several times to purchase additional rubber grommets from Samsung, but they will not sell them separately and Samsung could not say where I could buy them in the aftermarket. This is the only user-replaceable wear part on the WEP200. When it fails, the unit, even if it is still functional, cannot be used because you cannot keep it in your ear. As it is, I have lost mine many times. This is the worst customer support I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for eyeglass wearers","review":"The in-ear design makes this an excellent choice for eyeglass wearers.

Friends complains of great noise when I'm rinsing plates while talking, but that's reasonable.

I'll start by saying it is the only bluetooth headset I have found wich works well with this phone. Every other (Motorola, AX bluespoon, Plantronics) headset I tried had, for me, unaceptable levels of static with the phone only 3-4 feet from the headset. With the phone in my pants pocket the WEP200 is almost static free. Volume is loud enough and I probably have some high freq hearing loss. People tell me the conversation is clear if sometimes a bit thin. Sound quality is particularly good in a quiet environment. The in ear retaining system is marginal at best.

It works great for voice dialing when I'm driving. I've been asking people if they can hear me on it, and I've gotten great responses back. Most people couldn't believe that I was even on a bluetooth headset.Fortunately for me, the ear bud fits in my ear. It came with two other cover sizes for larger ear holes. It also came with an \\"over the ear\\" clip on device, in case it still didn't fit.I don't have any criticisms of this headset. Although, I tend to be somewhat clumsy, and it is a little small, so I worry that I might break it if I'm not careful.

The little nub is somewhere between the size of a nickel and a quarter with absolutely no kind of allowance made for the natural size, shape and construction of the human ear. And the little plastic bit that is supposed to help you get it seated is just a waste of plastic.After that, the sound was good, the battery life was good and it worked exactly as advertised with no other problems.

The reason I gave it a four instead of five...I cannot keep it in my ear when I am walking. Okay while driving in the car, but just the motion of walking bounces it out of my ear. I tried the earhook, but it does not help. All I have to do is brush my hair away from my ear and it is dislodged. There is not really any clear directions on how the piece is suppose to fit in your ear...perhaps that would help.

What happened to a simple plug??), meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low, necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage, even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia.

Price - It is quite decent priced, not too high but it is not one of the cheapest though.Very loud and clearNow for bad:1. I can hear the back ground noise quite a bit when my wife uses it. (kids screaming, radio playing) I am guessing that because the microphone is so far away from the mouth that it kinda has to be non-directional.2. My wife claims that no matter which ear piece she uses, it hurts her ear after a while.I would buy it again dispite the minor short comings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for one day and broke!

I have always had trouble being heard clearly with my other earpieces and also could never get the volume loud enough. People always said I sounded muffled and I had to have my windows closed and radio off in order to hear someone and that wasnt enough. This earpiece fits perfectly in my ear, no wobbling, no adjusting,and very comfortable. Everyone says they hear me loud and clear, no muffling and I can hear so well wit this earpiece, that somtimes I have to turn the volume down. Can you believe it? I tell everyone who complains about their earpiece to get this one-its fabulous!!!!! I cant say enough. It also comes with a little carrying box that's the same size as the earpiece that you also charge in, once its plugged into the adapter it comes with. I got all this for almost half the price at Amazon as the wireless stores are charging for it!!!! I am so happy I bought this one. It cant be beat!!!!!

There is an entire section on RID which only high volume reference labs use and is no longer recommended by ASCP to be covered in med tech schools. The lack of newer illustrations and photographs, and boring layouts of tables and charts is also a negative. I have actually given our students websites to refer to instead of sections in this book to complete their objectives.Signed MDM, MT(ASCP) SI"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about as good as her teaching...","review":"This book is complex. Any normal student would be completely overwhealmed by this book geared more towards Medical School students rather than traditional college students.

There are no colorful pictures for those of us who like to be able to actually see what we are learning, there is no clear cut explaination of any of the suggested topic, and all in color green and the suggested photograph on page 199.

It was a glimpse of being with someone with AS. However, it highlighted much of the negative aspects, and spoke about the relationships as if there weren't sustainable. I don't agree with that. And thought that it was speaking to AS more like a broken diseased part of a person that a partner may never be able to handle. Or they may never be fulfilled by their AS partner. I consider AS a blessing and a curse, just like any great personality strength, and do not believe that love and relationships are beyond the realm of someone with AS grasping. That's how this book made me feel for much of it. It seemed more like a commiseration of negative thoughts and feelings, more than a 'how to thrive and get what's best in these different yet sustainable and wonderful relationships'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but with gender limitations","review":"This is an excellent overview of Asperger Syndrome and its impact on the marriage compact.

The Minotaur wars was an exciting and fantastic book of battles and lore. Couldn't put it down!!**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchdogs of Space","review":"When I first read the first 9 books of this series, I wanted to see some progress in the characters' resolution of their feelings about their issues. I stopped purchasing the series when it appeared the same problems were going to be repeated. I decided to acquire Book 10, Watchdogs of Space, after reading one of the other reviewer's information. This was a really good book. I have just finished Book 11 as well and I'm looking forward to the last book War Prince when it is shipped to me.I enjoyed the addition of Gray Jack Dundee as an important character. There are still similar trials and tribulations regarding Sogan's Acturian birthright, but all the characters' overall mental health situation is much improved and I appreciated that very much. It is what led me to get the last 2 books of the series. I highly recommend the entire series and I would really like to see the author write additional books featuring these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"P. M. Griffin's Star Commandos","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this, the tenth volume of Ms. Griffin's Star Commandos series. Once again, her gift of storytelling shines in her description of her characters, fast-paced action, and just enough background to enhance the tale. From the first paragraph, a reader feels as if he or she is there, watching the events as they occur, sharing the risks and the triumphs of the Star Commando team as they complete their mission. I could not lay the book aside until the last page had been read. I found the Watchdogs of Space to be a very pleasant and entertaining read; one that I recommend highly to any reader of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling & Entertaining","review":"This is a compelling and entertaining book which draws you into an action packed story full of interesting characters.I am looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning !!!","review":"they are not shipping the real action figure they are shipping cheap snap together model kits that you have to paint and can be bought for 5$ in a store"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her standards","review":"Although I've read all her books, this is absolutely the worst of the lot.

The premise was interesting, (symbiotic virus augmenting human physiology to be able to shape change, teleport and have telepathy). The worlds depicted had promise, when you could understand what she was talking about, but overall this book was badly written. The grammer, scene transitions and overall narrative were choppy. It is clear that the author was trying a new style, since she had written books before and they were reasonably received, but the editors did a terrible job of advising her on approach. This book is terrible and a badly failed experiment. The result is that I will not read her again unless I get a personal recomendation from someone whose judgement I trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"Wilhelmina Baird has gone from pretty good(Crashcourse) to very bad with \\"Chaos Come Again\\".

Don't bother with this book - or other Debbie Bliss books. I am currently making the Eylet Dress and had to make an appointment with my yarn store's Knitting Doctor. Even she couldn't make sense out of the instructions on the neck shaping. So with her help, I am now 'winging it'. This woman also told me that I was the 2nd person she helped just this morning with a Debbie Bliss pattern. And another employee also told me that she has trouble with DB patters as well. Trouble is there are no diagrams as to what size the pieces are supposed to come out. After spending $35 on yarn and $20 for a book of designer patterns, I don't expect to be 'winging it'. Needless to say, I will never buy a Debbie Bliss book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations, almost","review":"Well, these are not recycled designs, and the needles are larger than normal for her.

I would love to dive into a vat of cashmerino and go for a swim.The first thing that bugged me about Baby Knits is that the cover shows a baby in a scarf. Only someone with a death wish for their infant would tie a scarf around their baby's neck.The second thing that bugged me about Baby Knits is that every pattern knits up too dang big. I knitted the boatneck baby sweater with Debbie Bliss yarn (yes, I checked the gauge) and it was HUGE. I went on to knit the little cap, faithfully checking the gauge. When I was finished, the cap fit ME. When I complained to other knitters, they nodded sagely and said, \\"Bliss' patterns always run large.\\"So, beware.

It is a wonderful legacy.My sympathies to his family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book With No Story","review":"Absolutely nothing happens in this book. The premise is promising because I like serial killer novels and this one might have had a paranormal twist. In reality the adept and the spunky but useless female detective stand around and do almost nothing through the whole book. Well the \\"hero\\" (?) does manage to have an affair with the married mother of one of the murdered children, does that count as action? There are no clues to check out, no one to interview, no feeling that they are closing in on the perp. For about five pages we see the world from the perspective of the killer. During that span he strangles a girl, period. No insight, no chills, no addition to what passes for a plot. Finally out of the blue the adept gets a flash when he is near the killer and they catch him The book ends. Thank heaven for small favors."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Read","review":"I dont agree with the other reviewers in that this book was \\"boring\\" and had \\"no story\\". I thought the story was very entertaining and I thought the late Mr. Relling's writing was very good. I always enjoy stories about serial killers and psychics.

Raymond uses the club to con lonely women, but it turns out that Raymond and Martha have something in common. Together the two begin to pick victims and steal women's savings, which eventually leads to murder. Honeymoon Killers is a monstrous story that reveals the dark nature of Martha's passion for Raymond as they tour east USA leaving a trail of corpses. Yet, it is a sad story as Martha is incapable of recognizing their failing love as she desires the need to feel loved by Raymond. Honeymoon Killers is a black and white drama-documentary that leaves the audience with a good, yet mind numbing cinematic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible acting, This is BAD...","review":"I read some of the other reviews and i thought to myself that maybe i viewed the wrong movie.

I, personally thought the single title cut here 'La Luna' (47:17) shows us just how brilliant of a musician this former Can bassist / founder is. A wonderfully composed ambient-electronic journey into the world of German pioneer music is to be thoroughly soaked in here. Later on 'La Luna', I noticed that Holger's often collaborator U-She shows up adding some of her Avant Garde vocals. Don't say this about most discs, but it's quite possible that 'La Luna' is maybe almost too brilliant for most.

It is full of dry, zany British humor and lots of plot twists. I look forward to reading Bonfiglioli's other works. Summary from the cover:\\"This caper finds Charlie the recent bridegroom of a voluptuous millionairess who is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen of England; at the none-too-tender mercies of a Chinese dentist (the inscrutable Lo Fang Hi); and in terrified possession of the costliest baby powder in the world--among other mishaps.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interested in Some Dumb Fun?","review":"Kyril Bonfiglioli created a bumbling \\"hero\\" named Charlie Mortdecai and wrote several novels about his exploits. After You With the Pistol is one of the Mortdecai novels. The plot - what there is of it - concerns Mortdecai's sexy wife conning him into assassinating the Queen of England. Predictably, this leads to all sorts of complications and adventures.The real delight here is getting to know Mortdecai, a bon vivant who is sort of a cross between James Bond and Inspector Clouseau. The novel is a farce and the characters' behavior is unrealistic. As long as the reader does not expect realism, the novels are quite enjoyable. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"smell alright, not that great","review":"Well, I bought this perfume based on the reviews on here.

But I noticed after a few uses, the scent faded a little quickly, leading me to think that it might be fake. I can't return it now or ask for a refund because it's been opened and used. But next time I would just rather spend a few $$ extra at the department store so I can ensure that it's real. I am disappointed. One time my mom bought fake Dolce Gabbana off the street in Chinatown, and a few weeks later the top smelt musty, and the scent faded away after a few moments.

She did not want JC just for the charm but apparently the younger girls collect JC charms and sometime wear them. I called vendor customer service to ask about this but customer service stated that they did not sell re-packaged items. No problem with the scent. It is authentic product. I was disappointed because it was my 15 year old's first bottle of eau de parfum so she will most likely remember missing out on her charm. Anyone have an extra charm out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fragrance!","review":"Definitely a great fragrance! I love its fruity smell.

To me, it smells like something an old woman would wear. Doesn't surprise me since there are none of the typical \\"young\\" notes in here at all (especially vanilla). Or if there are, I sure as heck can't smell them! All the friends I've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman-smelling perfume.

I have been able to find it pretty inexpensively online. The scent is great : nice and light, not too strong. I always get many compliments on this scent. It is not too flowery, yet not at all spicy. In fact I normally would avoid anything that is named for its brand, but I like this scent so much that I buy it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great anti-war novel","review":"It has been over twenty years since I read Fires on the Plain.

Never got to see him play anywhere, but had (and still have) the Kweskin albums, and Geoff's Sleepy Man Blues album. I learned my first open-tuned guitar pieces from Geoff. Then there was nothing from him for years. Secret Handshake came along, and now Password.Geoff's voice has gotten sweeter, with the same passion of years ago. I love every tune on this CD. The duet with daughter Clare, the yodeling in Prairie Lullabye, the uplifting Kitchen Door Blues, the beautiful When I Put On My Robe with the McGarrigles, the hypnotic Light Rain - each song has something very special going on. Richard Greene on fiddle, John Sebastian on harp, Dave Alvin on high-strung, Fritz Richmond on bass, and Geoff on guitar - does it get any better than this?? Not hardly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD you'll never get tired of...","review":"This CD is wonderful. She really does sound like Natalie Merchant (and looks kind of like Elle Macpherson). Her style is very acoustic, and the songs have a pop-folk sound. They grow on you after the very first listen. This is one of those CD's that you'll end up putting in over and over again without getting tired of it. I didn't know what to expect, but I truly enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny If You Enjoy Classic Japanese Television","review":"I have only a few TV shows from Japan so my exposure is limited; Zatoichi TV, Shadow Warriors, Lone Wolf and Cub TV, Super Robot Red Baron, and Ultraman. But I have really enjoyed this series, \\"Fight! Dragon\\". It's a fast paced 24 minutes per episode and ends with a cliffhanger, so it's a continuing serial. After watching the first 8 episodes so far, I logged on to Amazon to see how others are enjoying this series, I was really surprised to find only 1 review, and that it had such a poor rating. I don't understand. The show was filmed on location with really good cinematography. The stunts and fights are very enjoyable. The picture and sound are good and for the low price this is a treasure for anyone looking for classic Japanese TV! Give it a chance and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get yo Laugh on!","review":"This is a clean set. Mr. Rice is funny. Good, clean family fun that the whole family can watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"After first listen...","review":"With some bands, there's an intrinsic, indefinable quality that draws me to their music. King's X is one of those bands. I have all of theirs but Silent Planet and Tape Head, and love them all like children!! :) heh heh...yes. This album has so much grunt and overall beefiness! I'll have to agree with a couple of reviewers and say that (especially being a drummer myself) Jerry's sound and playing on this one just shows a little bit more of what he can do. 10/10 on the new snare sound, too. Cuts through anything! As far as the songs go, business as usual, with a little something different. There are, of course, the great melodies and harmonies. They also seem to have embraced some of the new metal that's out there at the moment, Doug's bass being that little bit lower, and the deviations in the melodies calling to mind bands like Sevendust and Filter.Love it, and I'm sure it'll grow on me even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one really grew on me","review":"When \\"Bulbous\\" was first released, I wasn't into it at all. But as some time has passed, it's really grown on me. The mix kind of sucks, way too bass-heavy in a bad way, which does detract from the music. The bass has to be turned down to even listen to the album, really. But there are some real standout tracks on this one, incl. \\"Julia\\", \\"Charlie Sheen\\", \\"Marsh Mellow Fields\\". An album that differs a bit from what some people expect from the band, but IMO it doesn't really deviate from the King's X \\"sound\\" as much as some fans seem to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings X - Making Major Strides!","review":"The nearby radio station proclaims themselves to be \\"The Cutting Edge of Rock\\". That depends on if they play this...This CD is stellar! What can I say... It is mind-boggling that a band this good can be completely overlooked by the radio industry time and time again. This CD is a little more open creatively, with the band deviating a little from their traditional song structure. It is no less heavy then previous Kings X, but it sounds more \\"open\\". There is more space in the music and the production. This self-produced CD has incredible thick and musical guitar tones, better than average drum sounds, and bass tones unlike anything I've heard recorded before. Hope your stereo is up to it. The tunes are melodic, heavy and honest, and the music is anything but predictable. It sounds as if Ty's experience playing in Platypus may gained him some fresh inspiration. But don't misunderstand. This CD is all King's X and then some...Your \\"Cutting Edge of Rock\\" is right here."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointment","review":"king's x have never let me down before of after the release of Please Come Home. while the album does include some fine specimens (fish bowl man, when you're scared, marshmellow fields)there is still a surprising amount of dross (julia, smudge, charlie sheen). a disapointment, only worth it for hardcore fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the other 2-star reviews...","review":"I love King's X, the first 3 albums plus Tapehead and Ear Candy are indispensable, but I don't think I can ever get into this release. Not sure if I should bother with Manic Moonlight now - sorry guys..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark genius...","review":"Unlike their brighter and more uplifting albums, Bulbous is the dark horse in the King's X catalogue. That's not to say it's not a work of art, which it is. In a difficult era for hard rock and metal, King's X still focus on the ENTIRE album, not just a couple of songs thrown in with a bunch of swill. Bulbous is quite an experience, only lackluster song being \\"When You're Scared.\\"Many of these songs sound like major episodes of depression put to music, except that they're still enjoyable to hear. Songs like \\"Julia\\" and \\"She's Gone Away\\" beautifully convey a sense of isolation and melancholy. \\"Smudge\\" is a downright frightening song, yet still hypnotic.There are a few bright spots along the way, most noticeably \\"Charlie Sheen\\" and \\"Move Me\\", but by and large, this album is quite a change of pace from the usual positive-thinking that this band is so good at.I consider this to be the pinnacle of a great band. It might take you a few listens before it gets its hooks in you, but it will..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Come Home...and make a new record","review":"Like everyone else who's reviewed it, I'm a die-hard, bought Gretchen when it was new, saw them first on the FHL tour, underrated band, great players, singers, yah yah. This record falls far below their previous work. It's less a bunch of songs and more a bunch of song fragments jammed together in the hope that they'll work. They don't.The mix is close to unlistenable because of the overachieving low end (maybe from proximity to a better, but also almost unlistenable record with the same problem - Let It Go by Galactic Cowboys). Perhaps they were trying to compensate for a lack of woof on the first 3-4 records.I salute their talent and their courage, their continued shining presence in a world of musical junk, their artistic and personal searching. I'm with you, Ty, Doug and Jerry - just not on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell is this?","review":"I wasn't sure if I was alone on my thoughts on this album till I read some of the other reviews. I love King's X and have every album. Great musicians, but this album is a NO GO(sorry guys). It gets a 2nd star only because after all, it is King's X. Go out and get Kretchen or Dogman just don't even bother with this one. Seeing how most King's X fans are either musicians or real music contesueurs, I highly recommend you check out Stevie Salas Color Code(of course after you get your King's X CD's). You will not be dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, you can't go any lower","review":"I can be called a fair-weathered friend for all I care. This was the end of King's X as far as I'm concerned. This was more stripped down than \\"Ear Candy\\", and it's showing without a doubt that they've started to shed Christianity. There was only one good song on here, and that's the 2 part \\"Move Me\\". The rest is nothing but junk, and should never have seen the light of day. It breaks my heart because I use to really enjoy listening to them from the first day I purchased \\"Out Of The Silent Plant\\", and \\"Gretchen Goes To Nebraska\\" at a Strawberries store in PA. I wasn't thrilled with \\"Manic Moonlight\\", or \\"Black Like Sunday\\" either. I feel that they lost thier touch when they left the Lord. I can certainly understand that it's not an easy life to lead, but when they were in tune with the Lord some of the most pretty music flowed from thier albums. With this, and the other most recent 2 they lost thier identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work gentlemen! but the moonlight shines brighter.","review":"Great CD for many reasons, though I just bought their new one, Manic Moonlight, which is better....probably their best ever; Moonlight is better than Gretchen or FHL or Dogman. Moonlight is better because it has: super heavy riffs (Soundgarden?), strange vocal and guitar effects, beautiful vocal harmonies (Gretchen, etc.), tight drumming along with tribal grooves, seasoned vocals, and an amazing mix overall.Listen to the samples. You will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the beginning of a slump","review":"I will say that it's with this album I stopped listening to King's X. I cemented it even further when I read the review of \\"Manic Moonlight\\", and it mentions that Doug Pinnick and bandmates no longer follow Christ. I haven't been following Him too much lately either, and I do miss listening to King's X. I feel that this was a weak album still. I miss the heavy funk sound that was on \\"Tape Head\\". This was a weak pop album at best, and I was lost the minute I heard \\"Fish Bowl Man\\" I feel the best was saved for last with the 2 part \\"Move Me\\". The rest was pathetic. I may give this album another chance, but not now. As for them not following Christ I'm sure they have thier reasons, and it's not for me to judge them. I was disappointed, but I have to get over it. I heard samples of \\"Ogre Tones\\", and it sounded rather good, so I will give King's X a second chance, as for me following Christ I will come back to Him someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Book!","review":"As a beginner to piano, my college course requires this book as our textbook.

I guess i'm just a dumb college student but i did not get this movie at all. The weird camera work made the movie even more confuseing. Like the shot looking though a fish bowl. The move seems to be about and old pervert that likes to make porn and try to sleep with his girlfriends daughter. Then he becomes frustrated with women and trys to desgin the perfect doll, i got this part of the movie and it was down right discusting and i'm not a partically moral person. I hated every minute of this movie, don't waste your time or money its long borring and discusting. sorry for the misspellings and bad grammar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Break From the Norm","review":"If you're tired of the minstrel show that hip-hop has become, this is the CD for you. I was pleased to hear artist who weren't talking about the size of their rims, their platinum and ice, or how high they get. Everyone in the group is original and creative. Ming Xia is an amazing singer, and she sounds good in any language (listen to Swindley's Maracas). The production values are through the roof with a lot of really good beats. The skits are comical representations of the music industry.Karma Hotel, Swindley's Maracas, and Things I've seen are my favorite songs.This album should have sold more than it did, but the artists force the listener to think. It's not just some mindless BS like \\"Chicken Noodle Soup\\" or \\"Walk it Out\\". The Spooks have lyrical content and coherent thoughts. I guess people just weren't ready for that from a rap group. Their target audience probably stopped listening to rap because of all the lame acts that dominate the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible kindle edition","review":"This is a good book, but the Kindle edition is ruined with sloppy proofreading.

Then, it emerged in the French academics. Writings on Psychoanalys is a text, attempting to fusing the two diverse viewpoints into a wholeness. Initiating from the Freudian and Lacanian, Althusser justifies that the methodology of psychoanalysis is scientific. It's the same of Roland Barthes's The Structuralist Activity in which he takes off the verbal attack from the social Marxists, such as Satre. In the second stance, he appropriates and readapts Lacanian theory to the socail \\"symptoms\\" as a psychoanalyst to an analysand. On the one hand, he regulates and justifies for Lacan that psychoanalysis is aculturalistic and not scientific.

The focus is on a trio of 20-somethings and their daily lives at their work places. It's an interesting course with interesting exercises that are relevant to modern life.

Each suggested activity is described in about one page so you don't have to read through a lot of analyses to get to the point. I truly feel that this book is a must for anyone with children! I'm buying some for Father's day gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob at his best","review":"If you ever wondered how it all started with Bob Wills,all you need to do is get this CD. Take Me Back To Tulsa (Columbia) is another CD that is a fine companion to Stay A Little Longer.Go back in time in fine fashion and listen to how it all began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Write a letter to yourself","review":"If you're having a bad and rough day, or if you are taking a nice peaceful drive on a sunny afternoon, I would suggest this, the Delfonics Greatest Hits, or any Five Stairstpes compilation. This particular collection contains songs that are so pleasant that you'll just melt when hearing them. Even songs with melancholy lyrics like \\"Toby,\\" \\"Write a Letter to Myself,\\" and \\"Have You Seen Her\\" sound so sweet to the Philly Sound arrangements and the Chi-Lites' harmonies cannot help but make you happy. So write a letter to yourself to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic R & B","review":"I borrowed this CD from my very best friend, (our keeper of records) it was so good I never returned it. I told him I lost it. I remember the Chi-Lites from the early 70s when they were first known as the Hi-Lites. Few people know that they put the \\"C\\" for Chicago in front of their name and became the Chi-Lites. It's true! They are a great Chicago group that have entertained us for over 30 years. They remain one of the most popular smooth soul groups of all time. Their all time best are \\"Oh Girl\\" & \\"Have You Seen Her.\\" They epitomize the sweet soul of the early 70s. \\"Oh Girl,\\" my favorite, is a classic which paints the picture of a man whose ego is on the brink of collapse, all from his love for a woman. Their oooooooooo baby marvelous harmony will ring in my ears forever, but not my best friend's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enroll in the Best of Old School","review":"If you love the \`old school' groove and you don't have this cd you are missing out; Eugene Record can really sing. First of all on one cd you have eighteen songs including gems such as: Oh Girl, Have You Seen Her, (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People, The Coldest Days of My Life, I Want To Pay You Back, Stoned Out of My Mind, A letter to Myself, There Will Never be Any Peace, I Found Sunshine, Toby, Homely Girl, -- that's eleven and there are still more songs. Great Stuff - you need to get this.

You are so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this too stupid to read!","review":"I admit that I didn't read very far into this book - it seemed too stupid to read! The premise of a Chili cook-off was ridiculous, to me. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly entertaining","review":"This was the first book I've read written by Geralyn Dawson. I found this book to be refreshingly entertaining. It had everything, spice, romance, mystery, humor and more. Once I started reading it was hard to tear myself away, I had to force myself, then couldn't wait until I could pick it up again. I laughed out loud and was still laughing as I recalled events days later. I'm looking forward to reading more of Geralyn Dawsons books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrangler partly rugged jeans","review":"I found these jeans to be (at first) to be the ultimate pant for someone that works on their knees all day. I am in the flooring business and for years used-up pants really fast. I tried the upland pants and found the nylon part of the pants to hold up very well, however the denim part is the same old thin material that wears and tears so easily with the regular wrangler pants. The top corners of the back pockets started to show wear after only 6 wash cycles and after 15 cycles the crotch ripped beyond my comfort level for the rest of the day on the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevated or Elevator?","review":"The production values are good, the choice of material is unassailable, but there doesn't appear to be any intensity or freshness in these recordings. There's plenty of opportunity in Becker/Fagen's music for interpretation, improvisation and play, but I found almost every cut just too safe, disappearing into mere background music. This unfortunately leaves me wanting the originals rather than being engaged by the new interpretations. This isn't a tribute, because it lacks any passion. Even static raises an emotion. This doesn't even irritate. Listening or party music? No. At the Bar, Mall or Hotel, sure, why not. If you're not just the biggest SD fan, pass on this and get the real deal in a greatest hits compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for supermarkets, dentists, elevators","review":"For those who might not know it, The Wave radio format was commercially developed by a large corporation.

The Steely Dan tunes (especially the harmonies) really gives an opportunity to make a jazzy interpretation, rearrangement, this is just not the case with.....\\"Gardenparty\\".

It's just playing the songs like in a hotel lobby bar.It sounds like a walk in the park from these players, but without any tribute of sorts. What a waste on a great idea! Specially annoying is \\"Hey Nineteen\\".If you want to hear a great example of an inspiring cover of the Dans, listen to (one time almost member of Steely Dan) Larry Carlton play Josie from his Standing on Solid Ground album. Now there's an example of how its done (just listen to the Kirk Whalum sax on this track).Anyway, I would recommend this album to Danatics just to complement your collection.Or pop it into your ipod and hear it at the dentist's while waiting for you appointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Rather Hear Static","review":"This album was obviously put out by a bunch of jealous studio musicians who were never asked to participate on Donald and Walter's albums.

Wiederman and B.Whitley Jr. give the basic elements for a scientific research.Only a few critics words from an epidemiological perspective, I'm not agreed with the skeptical wiew about observational (non experimental) studies. The theoretical and empirical developement of epidemiology is a valid investigation way in human sexuality. Case-control,cohort studies, confounding bias control and interaction analisys are tools for a non interventional research, that avoid problems of internal validity, the serious troubles and artificiality of experimental approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!

Either way its a great cd. On a side note, I love the review by the guy who rips the cd based on one of the song titles, and gives another Exploited CD 4 stars for the same reason. Thats a real nice touch there, gotta tell ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true birth of streetpunk","review":"Sham 69, The UK Subs, and The Anti Nowhere League all came before this, but the Exploited were the first oi! band to play their music superfast and agressive. Just compare songs like \\"Dead Cities\\" or \\"Rival Leaders\\" to songs by Sham 69(great band, by the way) and you'll see what I mean. As important as the Exploited are, their studio albums were somewhat unsolid, making this best of a good buy. The only reason I fall short of giving this five stars is because it sounds dated. Later bands such as A Global Threat, The Unseen, and The Virus would make streetpunk much catchier, while still being rough. However, this is a great buy for fans of modern streetpunk, or those interested in the faster side of oi! music. Overall, the Exploited were not the best streetpunk band, but they probably were the most important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy, unfortunately","review":"You would think The Exploited, a popular and famous band, would have some really cool songs on their \\"Best of\\" album, right? Well, they do have about 3 or 4 good songs. The rest are godawful. What a shame. Their good songs are \\"Computers don't blunder\\" and \\"Dead Cities.\\" \\"Attack\\" is ok. \\"Dead Cities\\" is by far their best song. Probably the best they ever did.

I heard Milnes for the first time in around 1970 while I was a high school kid. While I had been playing classical piano for years with a good deal of success, I didn't think that opera was for \\"men.\\" Well, Milnes sounded like a man. With thrilling high notes. He made me want to sing. And I still sing. But not like Milnes, of course.Well, now, to this recording. Hampson has his moments. But during Il Balen, for instance, he sounds like a really fine second tenor who spent the prior night out drinking but had to pull it together for a 10 a.m. performance. Nothing is wrong. But the voice doesn't exhibit a sufficient amount of \\"oomph.\\" In my opinion.I have the old recording with Milnes, Price, Domingo, et al. While the sonics aren't up to modern standards, I'll stick with the oldie.FWIW, I have never been a Price fan. I put up with her recordings because of the quality of the casts recording with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Il Trovatore ever","review":"This Il Trovatore is not Verdi. Alagna maybe fit for some of it, but Ms. Gheorgffhiu is not. Her trills are non-exisistent, her high notes are not there, her sense of the drama is never in evidence, and her pitch problems are by now a part of identifying any of her sets or single cds.The d'Amor sull'al' Rosee is the litmus test here and many sopranos are not quite up to its considerable demands, as say Aprile Millo is..she is, parenthetically, brilliant in role on cd..in any case Ms. Gheorghiu skirts all trills, ducks all high notes at the close, and tags on something Verdi never wrote. Horrible.But hear her Manon, Tosca, La Traviata, La Rondine, amd what can this new Butterfly be like? Dreadful things.How does she record in the studio?

I really wish I had read the reviews first. I checked and chapter 12 is more than one page, but I'm not sure I will get there. I rarely stop reading a book before the end, but this is one of those cases. My biggest complaint is the horrible punctuation (or lack thereof), misspelled words and run-on sentences. I could live with that if the story was more interesting, but it certainly is the comedy of errors described by others. Not once have I found anything remotely funny or mysterious - nothing to lead me further into the book.I haven't checked, but I'm guessing this was written in another language and translated into English. That would explain some of the oddly constructed phrases (I can't even call them call them sentences).

These vampire would eat vamps like Lestat and Louis for appitizers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remembered from the original series","review":"I read the original books when Harry Keogh was the protagonist. I have to say that I was dissappointed in this one. It didn't have the same pull as the others. There was something about the writing that just gets annoying after awhile, can't put my finger on any one thing though. I guess it almost seems comic book like in a way. Maybe it could be that I went too long between books and forgot his style of writing.When I don't anticipate getting to read more and don't think about what will happen next during the day, that's usually a sign that the book needs to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and badly paced","review":"I did my best to finish this book, but I found it tedious and unenjoyable. The plot is thin and it develops too slowly. The action scenes are poorly paced, completely unexciting to read. Most of the verbiage focuses on long exposition about the thoughts of the book's many (way too many) main characters.The story viewpoint shifts from character to character, but not in a logical, episodic way, like in the Lord of the Rings switching from Frodo to Aragorn when each is at a stopping point. Instead it's stream of consciousness: 1) a good guy thinks about a bad guy 2) we see what the bad guy is thinking about for while, then the bad guy thinks about his henchman, 3) then we see the henchman and he thinks about his girlfriend ... etc for 800 pages.Next time: less telling and thinking, more showing and doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Typically Victorian Erotic Novel","review":"Yet it stands out from all the other similar books by the sheer heat that radiates from the writing.

Not only will you have to replace the battery on this watch just like some cheap Timex, but it's not even good at telling the time with only that blazing silver dot on the 12 o'clock position. For the price of this Movado, I can purchase a 25 Jewel Automatic Swiss Chronograph and never have to worry about replacing any kind of battery again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Follow-up","review":"There's an old saying that you have your whole life to make your first album and less than a year to do your second. This usually results in artists releasing sophomore albums that are sub-par to say the least. Certainly not the case here, as Paul Cargnello slides a little bit away from being the leader of the new left and gets more personal. Some great writing backed up by fantastic musicianship provides the album with a more polished feel, but not so polished that it would take away from everything that Paul is, a raw lyricist with musical abilities that are only matched by his social awareness. Having a little more cash certainly helped as he didn't have to play every instrument himself, relying on others to perfect his visions. Great follow-up album which leaves the question, so where does he go from here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special, but not too bad","review":"I probably went into this movie with my expectations set too high. James Ryan plays the villain and that is why I was so excited to see it. In case people don't know, he was the star of 'Kill or Be Killed' and 'Kill and Kill Again', 2 of the very best American martial arts movies ever made. He plays the villain in Kickboxer 5, and does a fine job, but he is not in nearly as good of shape as he was 15 years prior to when this movie was made. He has not aged very well. Marc Dacascos is the star of the movie and he does a good acting job, but my main problem is that the fights are nothing special. Some good kicking, but that is really all that I enjoyed. The story is not even worth going over. It is pointless. Don't waste your time with watching this movie, even if you are a Marc Dacascos fan. He has a few good moments, and that is the only reason the movie is worth watching.2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Mark Dacascos Fan","review":"Besides the first Kickboxer this one is the best. But I must say the best part of the movie is its leading man. Mark is extremely talented and did the best he or anybody else could do with this part. The action is good, and the technique as well. So if you like martial arts it is a good movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a slight improvement above Kickboxer 4","review":"Kickboxer and/or Mark Dacascos fans may want to look elsewhere. While Kickboxer 5 is a bit better than the fourth, that's about it. There are a few good fight scenes halfway through the movie but then it goes downhill from there. Kickboxer 5 starts off with David Sloan getting murdered by some crimeboss in South Africa. Mark's character declares vengence (what a surprise!) and he goes off to find the crimeboss responsible for David's death with the help of an escaped convict. The final fight scene with Mark Dacascos and the crimeboss is just as ridiculous as the final fight scene in Kickboxer 4. As most direct to video films go, this one doesn't deliver overall so if you are one who wants to see the Kickboxer series than just stick with the first three movies. Trust me on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kickboxer Fans Save Your Time!","review":"Fans of the Kickboxer series will be dissapointed by this fifth installment which has nothing to do with the previous entries except for the fact that David Sloan is killed in the opening. Sasha doesn't show up, it's just a siloutte of another actor.The characters are pretty boring and the film itself is very tame for an R-rating though Dascasos use of the word \\"buttface\\" could be a bit extreme for some.The film could have gone without attaching the Kickboxer name to it.

The main character drops \\"yo\\" in between every sentence and comes off like a complete moron.Even if it was presented better, it would still be an awful story. Gun-toting cheerleaders rampaging the monsters of Silent Hill? Are you kidding me? The overall premise isn't great either, especially as a Silent Hill story.If you're looking for the mood, style, and attitude of Silent Hill, it's not here.

It seemed really good at first, although the graphics on the cut scenes are a bit lazy in terms of details. Diving around and using precision bullets is fun for a while but it soon gets tedious. The whole gameplay becomes shooting infinite amounts of rather dull AI baddies who just appear from nowhere after you walk over a partucular point. The bad guys don't move much, they just stand and shoot and there are far too many of them. This is OK if you are watching a John Woo film but is rather boring if you have to kill armies of drones just to progress to the next stage where you encounter the same again.I tried the online part but cound not find any game rooms after trying several times over a few days so I can't say if the online gameplay is any better.3 stars are for the initial impression but general gameplay is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite drink coaster!","review":"Dumb story.

Everytime I see this game for such a cheap price in stores I want to reach for it, but turn and walk away because I remember how bad it is. What a shame a next-gen game turned out to be such a waste.

I had never heard of it before, it was pretty good. Being that my great-grandmother was half black and Irish I guess I found some familarity in the story. I could have only imagined the strife that her mother must have dealt with in the early 1900's. It is a shame that one reviewer could be so ignorant, I don't know if the one star represented his/her distaste for interaccial relations or the fact that the woman cheated on her husband? In any event it's a movie... the Irish mother only dealt w/ hardships because of everyone else's ignorance and the fact that she married that man for the wrong reason. You have to find happiness where you can. If it means going against \\"societal\\" beliefs to find it then it must be done.

I'm referring to passages like \\"I had the strongest sense of th oil being incoporated by the Sound, even embraced.\\" Descriptions such as this and others that appear on the following page(132) detract from the book. They don't appear to \\"mix\\" with the hard science text. This incongruence caused me to wonder who his intended audience was.I think the book focuses on problems without offering solutions.

All I really knew about her was the mere fact she had some moderately successful country records in the 70s and 80s.

Stella Parton creates some beautiful harmonies on such hits as \\"I Want to Hold You in My Dreams Tonight\\", \\"I'm Not Good at Goodbyes\\" and \\"Cross My Heart\\". With a voice similar to that of her famous sister, Parton indeed has her own style- making for some great country music. One note, however.

When my husband tried it on, we realized you cannot change the lenght of the shoulder lace, then the back of the carrier, which I thought would rest on his hips, was instead placed in the middle of his back, right under his shoulder blades. This was disappointing since the reason I chose this carrier was that a Chicco carrier I bought in Italy with my first child, weighed all on my shoulders causing me a terrible shoulder inflammation which required strong medication to be cured.Don't buy this item if you are someway tall.

If i was able to i would have returned it, but being out of the country i didnt have that luxury"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"This seems well made but had two problems:1. It requires a lot of clearance under the table so it can be properly clamped. It will work best with a simple table. Desks with features below the table top are a problem.2. I could not get it to adjust height. I think the unit I received was defective, but there were no decent instructions with the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Monitor Arm","review":"This is a solid, well built and sturdy monitor arm. As others have noted, don't expect to move this often. It is designed to lock in one place, maybe rotate from side to side but thats it. Right now it is holding my Acer 20\\" monitor with no problems. It took a while to setup and get it \\"just right\\" but now that it's in place, there are no problems! I use it on a drafting table and it's not especially tall, about 11\\" from tabletop to the bottom of the monitor. However, with all the adjustments, aesthetics and build quality, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great LCD Monitor Arm","review":"This product far exceeded my expectations. I look for a while trying to find the appropriated monitor stand. There were several listed that were close to $200. I thought I'd give this a try and it is excellent. It worked exactly as promised and had several mounting solutions. Even though it is light in weight it feels very sturdy and I don't feel that my monitor is \\"at risk\\". Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Desk Mount","review":"I have been using it with a 23\\" Samsung monitor for over a year, and I am very happy with it. It is extremely adjustable and sturdy. I tilt the monitor for web shopping, and for working on some large portrait type documents, and its great. I installed this mount as far as I could from the monitor, so it appears to be suspended over my desk which is nice, and it frees a lot of space compared to the original monitor base. Once you tighten the screws at the right torque, it never requires more adjustments. The only thing I don't like is the cord clip system, because it doesn't keep cables in place, but that can be easily solved with small nylon ties. This mount is great for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well","review":"I don't really need too move my screen around a whole lot, but I was wanting to clear up some of the clutter around my monitor.This arm provides me with a fairly large area beneath the screen to work and store documents and what not.

I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't go low enough to use for notebook PC","review":"Only 2 stars because will not work as a laptop stand with the Neo-flex laptop holder.I have other Neo-Flex products. They have great quality. But this one will not articulate low enough to use with a notebook PC. But it would probably be good for use with a monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"One of my biggest challenges in managing my desk is finding a way to maximize available space so that I can use my Tablet PC for sketching *and* a larger screen for coding. Unfortunately my desk it quite small so a 19\\" or 20\\" LCD was just too big for a corner style area...but I bought one anyway. I ended up having to choose between one or the other until I purchased this arm that not only holds my screen but also allows for easy manipulation to swing it out from the desk while I sketch.I plan on purchasing another one of these soon and the Ergotron Tablet adapter so I can manipulate the screen toward an angle better for drawing. Regardless, the arm is sturdy and well built - I highly recommend it over leaving screens on their stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully adjustable but one tight adjusting screw","review":"The mount holds my Samsung 2253LW 22inch widescreen (8 lbs)in portrait mode and it's great so I don't have to scroll web pages, emails, Word documents, Windows Explorer, iTunes, etc. anymore. It's fully adjustable which is really nice; however, I would keep it in either portrait or landscape mode and keep it there rather than rotating back and forth because it's stiff.I removed the middle arm because I don't need to extend it that long but one of the adjusting screw was really tight and I was able to do it but I don't think a mom or grandmother could do it (I'm a 39 year old male). There's also grease when you take it apart so be careful not to get it on the carpet like me.I got this because it has a desk clamp instead of just sitting on my desk as with the Neoflex LCD stand ($35) because I felt that a 22inch widescreen monitor in portrait mode is really tall and might accidentally fall forward or backward, especially with kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great desk mount","review":"I bought this mount at the same time as my purchase of the new BenQ G2400W monitor. And, despite what others are saying about its ability to hold monitors of certain weight, it is doing just fine with the 24\\" BenQ right now. I also took off the extension, as others have. My desk just didn't warrant it. The clamp holds tight to the desk. The mounting plate worked perfectly. And its great looking. There really isn't much bad I can say about it. Although it isn't a \\"negative\\" really, I wish there was some other method for cable management. As is, it works fine. And, no one ever sees behind my monitor really. But, I just wish there were a cleaner way to route them. But, that is a bit nit-picky. It really is a fantastic mount. And the price is just fine. All in all, a great piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for 19-pound monitor when jerry-rigged","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading the reviews and weight my monitor. I use a ViewSonic 20-inch that weights 19 pounds and is about 2 1/2 inches deep.All the \\"hinges\\" worked great and supported the weight of my monitor--except for the tilt mechanism. However, with the use of one of the bolts that came with the arm, I was able to very easily jam it into the appropriate angle (tilted very slightly upward).Setup took about 30 minutes, but I'm definitely pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Apple Cinema Displays","review":"Even though this arm is rated to support 18 lbs, it won't support even the 20\\" aluminum Cinema Display which weighs 14 lbs. Rather than using a toothed hinge for the tilt axis, it uses cheap plastic washers so even though I've tightened it so much that I've stripped the allan bolt, the monitor still droops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the price.","review":"I'm using this with the Samsung 226BW monitor (22\\") and I get the feeling this is about as big of a monitor as you can use with this mount. I had to REALLY tighten the hex-nut right behind the monitor to get it not to fall forward. Now anything more than a light touch will cause it to fall forward... so its not really \\"adjustable\\". However, I don't need to contantly adjust it, so it works for me. For the price, I'd still buy this again since most other mounting arms are substantially more expensive. Oh, I think the aesthetics are pretty nice as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Center pivot loose","review":"The arm is entirely adjustable and clears my desk area with a simple push.One defect that I noticed is the ratchet adjustable verticle swivel point is loose at the connection and there is no apparent way to tighten it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you need to raise and lower often.","review":"Be aware before you by that this arm does not keep the monitor parallel when raising and lowering in contrast to other monitor arms. This has an unfortunate side effect that the axle at the end of the arm can end up at an angle where it has to fight gravity to keep the monitor up, which it isn't strong enough to do, so it flops over unless you align it perfectly.Basically speaking, when you raise the monitor, it is difficult to find a position where it won't flop over, and requires a minute or two of fiddling every time to find a stable configuration. If all you are doing is pushing the monitor back and forth on your desk then this might work for you. However, don't expect to be able to raise it and lower it effortlessly. It's a pain. The more expensive arms have this issue solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"monitor arm","review":"I like the product. I had my monitor at work sitting on two organizer trays flipped upside-down. Now the monitor can position closer to me and greatly improved my usable desk space. Install was pretty easy, less than 10 minutes. I would buy another one for home if I had the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hardware","review":"I love these. I have two of them for my 22\\" monitors. The set up is super easy, but it is nice to have another person help mount them. The only draw back is if you pump your leg like me while listening to music, the monitors will wobble a little bit. This could be due to my super thin desk top though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine service, fine product, right price","review":"I recommend this product from this seller.

Some facts are not always accurate and sometimes they are contradictory.For example, he refers to 'Pius VI', rather than Paul VI, reaching out to the Communist bloc.John Cornwell reports that Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (philosopher) spent \\"hundreds of hours with [the Pope], sometimes with his secretary present, but often alone\\". Later, the author maintains : \\"Invariably Wojtyla's secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz, would be in attendance.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only an observer","review":"In writing this book, we are certain that Mr. Cornwell remains, as always, only an observer of the See of Peter and the Roman Pontiff. His book stems from his observations and not from any understanding of the Catholic Faith. As is, the book is comparable to the upset neighbour's report on how the next door family operates. A book of conclusions made from his accounts of listening to fragmented conversations, peeking through the windows, and looking at some gardenwork done around the house. The only way to understand the Church and John Paul II is to join the family and have a seat at the dinner table. Until then, it will remain an annoyance for the neighborhood and a scandal to the un- and missinformed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Liar in Winter","review":"John Cornwell is as much of a Vatican insider as Guido Sarducci.

Cornwell is looking for fault with everything the Pope has done. He starts from that premise. The Pope did or said this. How can I find fault?I suspect the petty sniping comes from the author's fundamental issues with papal infallibility. Cornwell seems to be under some delusion that the doctrines of the faith should be openly debated rather than derive their authority from 2000 years of collected prayer, reflection and study."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPEWING FORTH","review":"This book is a hateful diatribe.

This book has nothing in common with Catholicism for Dummies, - or any other Catholic book I've purchased from Amazon. If you like for example, what Garry Wills writes, then you'll probably like Mr. Cornwell also, - but get a library copy, then you wouldn't have wasted your money. For a more thoroughly researched biography of John Paul II, - with no spin on it, read Witness to Hope by George Weigel, or The Courage to be Catholic, also by Weigel. I'd also suggest the new book- The Miracle detective, by Randall Sullivan, writer and editor for Rolling Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"valuable demystification","review":"John Cornwell has written a temperate, judicious and very helpful biography of the present pope. There is a human tendency to mystify all authority figures, and the Roman Church is not immune from this tendency. Cornwell offsets this tendency, e.g., as exemplified by George Weigel's biography of John Paul II, which easily qualifies as hagiography.

Further, it seems disjointed with one of the authors writing the chapters with a historical perspective and the other dishing out the present and future perspective.The history is covered well enough for the book's size with the 'Sabre-killing' air to air victories of the IAF over PAF being emphasized over the equally critical ground support role (for example, the Pakistan army tank busting Hunters of Longewla and troop transportion in general).Overall, the authors could have done much better even in the given size with more in-depth analysis.

She comes off as a good egg and when we hear Fallwells unctuous appraisal (\\"Her elevator doesn&#65533;t go to the top floor\\") after engineering the fall of PTL, one of the several Christian broadcasting networks that the admittedly over-the-top Tammy and her Jessica Hahn-tempted ex-husband started, we have to wonder what floor he&#65533;s getting off at, considering that the down button was pressed and we seem to be hovering here in the basement already. The best line was from the co-host of Tammy&#65533;s short-lived show with a gay man reflecting back on his relationship with her after his lover had died from AIDS: \\"She&#65533;s a survivor.

This is definitely better than anything you'll ever see on A&E biography or on one of those VH1 Behind the Music shows.This account of Tammy Faye is perhaps biased in favor of the make-up-loving former first lady of evangelism, yet it works somehow. We see a more gentle side of Tammy Faye that has often been distorted by media portrayals of her husband's scandals. You will leave this movie feeling like a better person. If you are a Christian, then you will probably feel like a better Christian after seeing this movie (being able to see more clearly some of the hypocricy that exists out there in the church as a whole).Tammy Faye is not perfect or sinless, but she sure is likeable and charismatic in her own eccentric way.

In short, to be a \\"nice guy\\" is to lack balls when it comes to women. Of course this is book is a humorous look into the plight of a \\"nice guy.\\" But the truth isn't far from reality. Women don't want sensitive, neutered men; they want a man who takes command--a man that acts like a man.

The 'two universes colliding' storyline is shamelessly cliche in it's over-use of visual and sonic gimmicks that take us between the parallel worlds.

Her interpretation was too detailed, but again, most importantly, too consciously focused to be dismised as an unconscious creation of the mind.I'm sure she meant well by painting a picture of the afterlife for people who have lost loved ones in the past.

This book is written as 'proof' that Jesus is God, and affirms the faith of the author and anyone willing to believe her words.Most of the story on her early struggles with faith, her near death experience, visions, etc are no different than any other near death account from a devoted Christian. Her vision seems to me to be something similar to an acid-trip, as the vividness and 'knowledge' she discovered is much like that of one using psychedelics.The authors style is one of cheap religious inspiration...no wonder this was a bestseller. It preys on our desire to find deeper meaning in the world and to affirm existing faiths as truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics after life after death...?","review":"I have no way of understanding how someone could not love such a life's work as this one. An artist might have to die to get famous, but what about those who die and come back?\\"Embraced by the Light\\" has helped many of my friends. One even said that my sending it to him helped his father travel out of this life in a cloud of peace.I believe that someone who is looking for an equal amount of understanding about what awaits us when we leave this life should love this book, too.Judging by the feeling that I get when I read this book, God endorses its content. Anyone have a problem with that? Then all anyone has to do is to die, come back, and tell us where we went wrong here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do I have to have a NDE too?","review":"Embraced by the Light is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how.

I would not have bought the book if I'd known this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, uh huh.","review":"Betty Eadie's book has captured the imaginations of the world with her story of her near death experience. Perhaps it's a wise idea to remember that's exactly what it is: a STORY, which (as it has done for many a story-teller) has made her rich.Experiences such as dreams of the afterlife and near death experiences are sacred and should be treated as such. Telling everyone who will listen and setting herself up as a prophetess is a bit much. Perhaps her first thoughts after her experience would have been wiser: she had a near-death experience and it renewed her faith in God and reminded her that she needs to love others. End of story.Every \\"psychic\\" and \\"medium\\" and \\"palm reader\\" out there knows exactly what she is doing. So, let's use some common sense and put her where we should put mediums and psychics: in the money for nothing category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Not worth your time if you're non-christian","review":"This book, despite the fact that it does have some uplifting moments, is very heavily slanted through the filter of the author's christian beliefs and as such is rendered quite suspect. Due to this, I was fairly skeptical through the book, up until I came across references to warring angels doing battle with Satan, at which point I just tossed the book aside.There are other, and better, and more open and loving, books on NDEs out there; they're far more worth your time than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately New Age Garbage","review":"Makes the reader think it is a Jesus related book but it really is a New Age idea of near death experience contrary to God's word.

I guarantee you will love it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read in the field of near-death experiences","review":"I heard an interview (probably on NPR radio) with Betty Eadie, and wrote down the name of this book on a slip of paper because I found her to be quite fascinating. On page 29 she writes \\"I heard a soft buzzing sound in my head and continued to sink until I felt my body become still and lifeless.\\" I have always described my own slip into unconsciousness the same way, a buzzing sound in my head that reminded me of a humming electrical wire. Pages 58 and 59 were amazing, simple and somewhat obvious truths that escape most humans - she deals with the powers of postive thinking at length. Believe it or don't, this book makes for excellent reading. I have no criticisms - it's an excellent book, an easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"There may be a kernel of truth in this book...","review":"but it is obviously heavily embellished. I agree with another reviewer -- it reads a bit too much like a novel.The first couple of chapters (before she even gets to the death experience) really soured me on the whole book. She describes in extreme detail events that happened over 20 years before, in such a melodramatic fashion that it casts doubts on the credibility of the very powerful, beautiful account of her supposed NDE.I read this book in one night soon after experiencing a devastating loss. I would really like to believe that this is a truthful account of a NDE. But something about it just doesn't ring true....Having said that, it is a quick, enjoyable read -- great for a rainy afternoon, perhaps, but not something one should base their entire belief system upon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Unconvincing","review":"This book is interesting, but after one gets into it far enough, discrepancies and contradictions which are hard to explain away appear. For example: all religions are valid, but the author's a Christian and she meets Jesus in heaven. Other improbable ideas include: spirits learning things by returning to a lower level, the experience depending on her beliefs here on earth, her praise of self-denial, reincarnation, etc. Even as it attempts to spread Christian propaganda, it doesn't stick to mainstream Christian theology. For me to seriously consider what she is saying, I'd need a little more objective view from someone perhaps who had an NDE but didn't have any convictions about religion at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good review by Mandy","review":"I think this book was exeptionally inspirationalto anyone who reads it.

She describes her journey using a great deal of Christian imagery, but this is to be expected, since she herself is Christian. For those of us who do not come from a Christian background and may not feel comfortable with descriptions of demons and angels going to battle, the important thing to remember is that these elements indicate the way her mind interpreted the events she experienced. Perhaps someone else would have told the story very differently. Such is the nature of these experiences. It's not like reading a news article! The story is to be read with the emotions and heart, not with an objective, literal mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"One nagging question...","review":"I read this book a few years ago, when my grandmother was very ill.

I have books on eastern religions and many books on NDEs. She made conclusions that are biased with her Mormon beliefs. She mentions that she learned that every religion is neither right or wrong; however, states that one will go to hell if not saved by Jesus Christ. Please, God loves all his children and I dont believe he cares about what religious belief you practiced. Its all about your Karma and your soul. So many books on this subject make this a point. The part where she tells about the council of men and then her farewell and returning to her body was unbelievable to me and just silly. It appears that she is doing sequels to this book and writing other similar topics. It amazes me how some of these authors profit on this stuff. One reviewer was right on point.

Over the decades I have read dozens of books about Near Death Experiences from the classic modern Life After Life to the relatively ancient Death Bed Visions. All have common threads in them that this book does not have. Consider that the author's alleged NDE experience happened unwitnessed. The content of the book was clearly \\"made-up\\". \\"Embraced by the Cash\\", is a far better title for this book. If you have to read it, get it from the library, and you will agree with me, sorry to say. There are many wonderful books on the topic out there, pick one or more of them!

They allowed her to ask questions and answered alot of them by showing her the answers. I think everyone should read it, especially those who have lost a loved one.

I'm not saying that the author didn't have an experience; I am saying that I feel very strongly that her story is GREATLY embellished for entertainment value--and very entertaining it is. However, I feel that having an especially sacred experience such as this is treated as such by those who have such an honor, and not exploited. Yes, these experiences are shared and written, but carefully and guarded. Like I said, this book was very entertaining, but from someone who has studied the topic for years--it just didn't \\"scrub\\". I wouldn't recommend it, except as an easy, fictional read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book but....","review":"I read both books by Betty Eadie.

I agree that we are here for a reason we have something to learn and something to teach. Her story is very positive and it may very well be true, I just find it difficult to believe in it's entirety.

The figures on the cards are like dolls, or puppets; their surrounds are simple and whimsical. Another unique feature is a jigsaw puzzle piece on various cards to show whether the influence of the card is masculine, feminine, or both.

The first 65 minutes of this movie is just painful to watch. A much used and recycled script using different actors. The beautiful but poor girl working many jobs who can't get a date meets a rich handsome and successful surgeon and falls in love. The film starts to have a little potential when Lopez finally realized she is being played and retaliates. However, no sooner does this happen when Lopez then reveals her hand and the potential is gone. The final 20 minutes of the movie just gets slowly more painful with each passing minute.How anyone can describe this movie as 'Outrageously Funny' is beyond me.. they must have been living in France for the last 20 years. The only bright spark of the movie is Fonda's assistant, Wanda Sykes, who has some very good throw-away lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why was it necessary to let an overage hasbeen dominate more than half of a film with Jennifer Lopez?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny","review":"This movie is funny.

JANE FONDA was so funny and I was so glad to see her back in a movie. It's a movie people-some people think the world had to move to make it great. And what made it even funnier is as we were watching it was we all realized she's MY mother in law, to the tee. Rent it- buy it.

And it wasn't the outlandish proportions that made it unenjoyable. It was that the lines were unoriginal, the plot highly predictable in an annoying way, and the ending far to fast and cheesy. All the actors tried too hard to be funny, although Fonda was certainly the more experienced one, occasionally delivering humorous scenes. The cliches were the most grating thing about the movie. The excentric gay friend. The nasty and aggressive blonde who loves the leading man. The hot doctor who is over the top cheesy (NO guy could EVER describe a girl's eyes like that). The sassy african-american assistant (think Miss Congeniality 2 but not as funny). But J-Lo is beautiful and sports many cute outfits, and her leading man isn't at all hard to look at - thats one star. The second? The one scene where I actually DID laugh, when Fonda tries to put nuts in Lopez's food and gets in a fight with her assistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"chick flick...","review":"I fell asleep while watching this dvd. Jennifer Lopez meets her new future mother in law (Jane Fonda) and they don't like each other because mommy can't let go of her little boy.

Jane Fonda was a riot and Jennifer Lopez was extremely charming and a joy to watch on screen. Wyanda Sykes was so funny and this movie was just so much fun. I'm a guy (17) and I took my sister (14) to this since we had nothing else to do and it was raining and we both loved it. I was a little skeptical since it was a chick-flick but the old formula works well here and J.Fo and J.Lo play off each other perfectly! Everyone in the theater was laughing out loud we had alot of fun and I recomend this movie to anyone looking for a good time. If you liked other J.Lo films like THE WEDDING PLANNER (2001) or if you liked MEET THE PARENTS (2000) you will like MONSTER-IN-LAW (2005)."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star of course","review":"the good......the director will never make another movie.the bad.....the extremely bad is.....j-lo will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoilt by over the top performances","review":"I liked the idea surrounding this film before I saw it. However, after viewing it there are so many problems with this film that I am surprised they even bothered releasing it. It could have done with more test audiences beforehand perhaps to get it right.The first problem is the unconvincing and too fast relationship between Lopez and her boyfriend. There is nothing special enough between them to believe that they could get together that fast and move in together.The second big problem is the embarrassing overacting from Jane Fonda. Frankly, Jane should have known better, and avoided this film at all costs. No mother in law would carry on the way she has. I realise this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts, but her weird performance was uncalled for.The third big problem is that the viewer does not care for any of the characters.A huge disappointment! Why does Lopez keep getting offered roles? BIzarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the DVD Monster in Law","review":"I don't understand why we haven't received this DVD yet.

Spend your money on a different bad movie that did not have to star someone who would rather encourage the death of US troops than protest the war in Vietnam.Disclaimer: I have not conducted a fact checked of the above personal comments, if she publicly apologized to 2 people in front of the press I still do not think she is sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal!","review":"This was \\"Hanoi Jane's\\" comeback?

So, not only does she betray the country that provides her the lavish, elitist, leftist, liberal lifestyle that she enjoys, she can't make a funny movie - and never could. The term 'not funny' barely covers the scope of this stupid movie. It definitely joins the ranks of the movies that you will sit through thinking - \\"Ok. I am going to laugh any minute now. It is supposed to be a comedy. I am going to laugh any minute now.\\" Don't waste your time, and don't give any money to one of the grandest traitors who this country has had the misfortune of knowing.This movie is NOT selling well here or in stores for two reasons.

I thought the movie was going to be another roasted turkey, but I was wrong. It IS one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. Jane Fonda was AWESOME, she reminded me of Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, she was over the top. Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes made me laugh so much i don't remember when was the last time that i really, really laughed watching a movie. J-Lo was surprinsingly ok, even thou I don't take her seriously as an actress, even worse as a singer, but she did a good job. This is one of those movies you watch over and over again and never get tired of it.Go see it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern day \\"screwball\\" comedy falls flat !","review":"I readily admit that Jane Fonda gave this film her absolute best, but sadly, even her best couldn't save it from being an embarrassing dud. My goodness, how does a comedy with a big budget and a great cast fail to generate any laughs or even a couple of happy, lightheated moments. Trust me, when you finish watching this film you will ask yourself \\" did I just spend 90 minutes watching one exhausted cliche after another ?\\" I want to emphasize the word EXHAUSTED because the cliches in this film are so tedious and unfunny in this day and age, they simply will not produce laughs anymore.....just many, many groans.

While the sets and costumes were appropriate, the two principals simply have zero on screen chemistry. Abraham is seemingly too young looking for the part of the sultan. And Amber O'Shea seems absolutley terrified of baring her body. Come on this is an R rated film. The whole purpose of her being sold into sexual slavery, is to have sex. The love scene in the movie is beyond lame. I have seen more eroticism on the morning soaps. The rest of the movie moves very slowly.

Where does she get her information and how does she really know? Really? If you hear something long enough people tend to take it as reality. I thought that many of the chapters were way too long and tedious and unnecessarily graphic.Now who really thinks they long to have sex with their opposite sex parent or same sex parent as a baby?

Further, her point of view is too often limited to the imagined upper middle class audience one assumes is buying this book.

I actually took a blade and cut 3 extra grooves in each heel, to have it grip more. The shoe is also slightly heavy due to the dense foam used on the bottom.

The characters have names like Fedderly and Twyla Loo, and they swing on vines, float through a swamp on rickety homemade boats, and eat tarts and pigs' feet. The book is about the brief nature of childhood; the long, lazy days of summer; imagination; and playing (and I don't mean playing with the PS2).

Also, Boston Terriers bark only when necessary and are good guard dogs. This author needs to stop writing such false information on dog breeds.

The author has written a very poor piece of literature with casual, if any, investigation into the histories of the breeds that he doesn't like. You'd be better served asking your nosy neighbor which dog is right for you. He obviously has his favorite breeds, and slanders other breeds horribly.

Yes, this breed is capable of horrible acts, but so are dozens of others. If the author would have checked statistics compiled over the last several decades, then he would know that the AmStaff, and the American Pitbull Terrier were in the 10th percentile.....from the bottom.Bottom line: Don't waste your time and money on this, or any other of the author's books.

I have less nostalgia about the period though because, though it was a period of unrestrained hedonism it was also a period of transition and upheaval. In a very short time we went from total anonymity to visibility, and the experience was jarring for those in the gay community that took part and those looking on. This was not quite underlined in the film. While it was true that sex was lying around waiting to be picked up, this came at a price. The price was intimacy. Liberation came to mean being able to be promiscuous without shame; this had its upside. However, by and large, it didn't seem to diminish loneliness or desperation for a lot of people, and for many others it barred connection. The film portrayed the times honestly, and it was good to see the survivors as well as to remember those who didn't survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Seriously, this is lame.

Well done, a bit nostalgic, and often surpisingly honest, this is a definite worthwhile gay doc. on a period that changed the community. Sexually explicit in some scenes ( mostly porno clips), but well documented through archive photos and video. Quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five people in a room talking about sex","review":"This documentary celebrates a 12-year period between the Stonewall riots in 1969 and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in 1981, a decade of gay sexual liberation. Unfortunately, the film is very limited to the New York gay scene, and to the experiences of five or six men who giddily recount their youthful days of irresponsible and hedonistic, drug-fueled lust. After its first 10 minutes of showing these men revel in their experience of finding anonymous sexual partners, and the frequency of these encounters, the documentary quickly grew tiresome and repetitive, and purveyed a somewhat sad and empty soullessness about their experience. At least the film doesn't preach about how more medical research money needs to be dedicated to curing AIDS so that the lifestyle of bathhouse orgies and rampant drug use can be restored for a younger generation of gay men."},{"rating":"2","title":"steamy , sexually explosive and significant","review":"Hot, Hot, Hot!!!!! This is a movie that should not be missed. Gay sex in the 70s takes the viewer on a journey through the explosive period in the 1970s which was juxtaposed between hundreds of years of oppression and the AIDS epidemic which devasted the gay community.

All seemed OK until it came time to open the plunger. It sticks at the bottom every time, and is almost impossible to work loose. It is likely a deformity in the carafe at the bottom that causes this but regardless, the strainer portion of the plunger looks like it was designed in the 1950s and not updated since. About as non-tech as something mechanical can get. Otherwise, this was a nice idea. It would be worth five stars if the plunger did not bind or stick every time it was used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This was nothing that I expected.

However, 12 oz. fills the pot right to the top so you can't put the filter in without losing some water. In other words, this is a \\"one regular\\" cup pot and should be advertised as such. Other than that, it does make a very good cup of coffee which is what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor and possibly dangerous device","review":"I have had several Bodum presses in the past but worn them down or accidentally broken them in the dishes. I have always been happy though.With this one its a different story. First, it should be more clear how small this thing is, but that's not really my largest concern. The press in this miniature device, is partly made of plastic (on other models it is metal). What's worse, it is the same plastic that European studies have shown that if heated, will be cancerogenous. That's really not something I want to press press into my 100 degree celsius coffee water. Do you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the office","review":"Rather than drinking the regular Maxwell House, I bring my own blend of coffee, use the hot water from work and make my own in about 2 minutes.

During that time it performed quite well. I used to take out the metal plunger and heat water in the microwave in the glass/plastic body. The plastic seemed to hold up all right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a few weeks...","review":"The glass is too thin.

Just bought another for our travel trailer, and aside from some external design changes, it's the same great unit.I put mine in the microwave (without the plunger) to heat the water, add a tablespoon of fresh ground coffee (I grind medium to fine), stir, insert the plunger to the top of the liquid & let set for a few minutes before I plunge the rest of the way then pour. This one has a clear bottom which makes it easier to see when all of the coffee has been poured. To clean, I rinse & put the whole thing in the dishwasher.This is perfect for one person & much easier and tastier than a drip maker or espresso machine. I get my drip out for a crowd & the espresso for special occasions, otherwise they collect dust in the pantry.Love Mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's not where the plunger goes!","review":"The original price tag seemed just a little bit too steep for such a small item, but I thought it would be worth it if it lasted for years. This thing seemed cheap and flimsy from the moment I opened it, though it was supposed to have been made of borosilicate glass. It made just the right amount coffee that I enjoyed quite a bit, but I wasn't surprised when it broke after less than two weeks' use during careful hand washing. The replacement carafe costs almost as much as the entire item, so it went in the trash. I will never buy another Bodum product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is 3 cups not 3 cups..","review":"I should have read farther down in the description where it states 3 cup is only 12 oz in french press land. (?) I love the flavor of french pressed coffee & this press works fine. My irritation is that I like a BIG OL cup of coffee & was looking for 24+ oz serving - not the dainty little 12 oz that this pot provides. Why don't they just list it as a 12 oz pot instead of 3 cups? I will be buying the larger Bodum press, because it does work fine. I'm just cranky because I haven't had enough coffee today!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The size is just perfect for small cups of coffee, it says 3 cups but it is actually a single small mug. Strength of the coffee can be adjusted by how much ground beans you put into it. I like it better than a coffee drip because it works so much faster and the water soaks as long as you need to in the beans for more flavor. The craftsmanship isn't so bad but would like the top part of the handle to be more secure to the glass.Note* My first one broke in the mail but customer service sent me a new one which came 4 days later.

There were just too many family members with similare traits to keep straight. I wish that there had been more of Molly's boarding school experience; that part was interesting.

I just purchased a Panasonic Headset for it last week and again I am very happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great reception BUT not a wall phone","review":"After going on Uniden's website and reading that this phone can be wall mounted, I bought it specifically to replace a wall phone in the kitchen. After attaching the adaptor, I found that the phone hangs at a 90 degree angle from the wall (i.e., in the same position it would sit on a desk)...a very awkward arrangement to say the least. While the wall mount design didn't work for me, the phone quality was excellent. Bottom line...a very good phone, but don't buy it if you want to mount it on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Fades","review":"I was very pleased with this phone at first....however....frequently, during a conversation the sound fades so severely that I could not hear the person on the other end of the phone. I contacted Uniden and they indicated that it was because the base was close to other electronics....which it wasn't. I have never had problems with a cordless phone before and I have had to end 3 conversations today because I couldn't hear what was being said to me. I would not recommend this phone because of this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone is great... when it works","review":"I've had to return this phone several times. You can read about all the great stuff about this phone in other people's reviews. My comments will focus on the problems I've had. my first phone had issues with power loss. The handset would typically lose power and would not respond to any of the buttons. The only way to bring the handset back was to remove the battery and reset the handset. I returned this phone. My second phone had audio problems. The person on the other end could not hear my voice even though I could hear them. This would typically occur several minutes into a conversation for no reason. I took this phone back. My third phone has only a minor problem. The volume fluctuates between loud and soft. I'm willing to live with this because I don't want the hassle of returning yet another phone.If I were to buy a new phone, I would not buy this one and I would not recommend any of my friends or family to buy it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, aweful range (35')","review":"I like the features of this phone. It is the second Uniden we have used - but the range is terrible. Our old 900MHz phones went from inside the house to outdoors by about 200'. This phone goes about 35'. I can't even get across the house even with line of site. The base stations are located in the same place in both cases. I had another Uniden with the same results.Today I went to the local Staples store and the sales guy told me that he has had a lot of Uniden's returned for exactly this reason. He recommended ATT, VTECH or Panasonic. I didn't buy. I'm looking for range comparison reviews on the web now.

Funny part is I never call out using my home phone, everything is done on cel, only thing the home phone ever used for is the answering machine. Yet, it still died. Some wierd error E4 on the answering machine, with this model you can't even reset it.To make matters worse, because it's not even 4 month old, trying to do a repair. After 4 emails, and 50+ minutes of dull on-hold music, it's time to just forget it and move on.

Has many features that I am still mastering. My wife didn't like the retro styling of the phone. I like the convinience of dial pad being on the base. Another nice feature is call screening and voice mail access from hand sets as well. Nice phone, over all.One gripe I have is that the phone books are not synchronized across the base and the hand sets. Each has it's own phone book, and you have to manually do the sync up. My older phone had single phone book for all handsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden TRU9485-2 cordless phone","review":"I have tried so many cordless phones and have always had trouble with them.

When one stores the number into the phone book, the phone doesn't automatically add the necessary 1 at the beginning, as many phones do. So, for every entry, one must edit the number, press the arrow to move all the way left, then type in the 1. Frustrating!

The buzz/hum was SO bad I could barely hear the person on the other end and I had boxed it all up, ready to return it, but I gave customer service a call. It turns out that there is a 'code' that one has to manually change/turn off the T-coil inside the phones to make them more 'compatible' (i.e. get rid of the buzzing/hum)So I did that, and yes it did decrease the hum considerably, not completely gone but it did make a diff. Good I think.. that is until I made a call to test it, and the volume control went up.. as far as I could get it to go and it STILL wasn't loud enough, and the hum is still in the background. <sigh>This really looked like a cool phone, liked the features and I have to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone has great features but terrible reception!","review":"I really wanted to like this phone. It was easy to set-up. Easy to use. Answering machine is simple. BUT the reception on this phone was terrible for me. I moved the base around my house but still no good.

I'm returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy range","review":"This is my third set of wireless phones, the other sets died of natural and un-natural causes - I thought the higher gig range would make for better long range reception, but these are by far the worst of the lot.

Panasonic or Seimens were the better units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"This phone is terrible! Only had clear connection when near a base.

The phone works one day and not the next. I get \\"OUT OR RANGE\\" messages with the handheld just a few feet from the receiver. Numerous other unexplanable problems. There is a number to call for customer service, the problem is that so many calls are coming in you can't get through. It appears that Uniden is another victim of \\"MADE IN CHINA.\\" I can't return the phone to Amazon since returns must be made within ten days. The good news is that I didn't throw away the old system that it was supposed to replace. From now on I'm sticking with Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product & lousy customer service","review":"I purchased this phone and it stopped functioning less than 2 days out of the box. The spare handset wouldn't register to the main base. After contacting Uniden and waiting 3 days for a reply their suggestion failed - I tried it 4 times. They then proceed to inform me that after paying the full price for the phone, that in order for the to fix their broken product I would have to pay $10. It took more than a week to get to that point.There are lots of good reviews on this phone, but God help those who have to deal with Uniden.

Hearing the person you called. This phone consistently would \\"drop out\\" so you would miss 15 - 30 seconds of conversation. The other side could hear you just fine. I tried moving all around the house, same effect. I moved the base station, same effect. I reset the phone per Uniden's direction on their web site, same effect. Bottom line: it's possible I got bad phones, but some small % of these phones have this defect (see other reviewers), I just had bad luck. I returned these and purchased Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"The phone was recommended by a friend and we also read reviews before buying one.

The new system is great - lots of useful features, good sound quality, just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of static electricity","review":"I live in an area of the country that has very low humidity during the winter and so there is a great deal of static electricity. I have owned this phone for about a year and now that winter is here I am noticing a major engineering flaw and that is with static shocks. Even if the handset is in the base unit, any static shock will cause the handset to perform either a complete power-on reset or just interfere with the connection enough so that I cannot answer the phone and miss the call. I have tried to remove the built up static charge on myself before touching the phone but that doesn't work all of the time. No other device I own does this. Perhaps the next model will perform better in this regard?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone, but got \\"Out of Range\\" error after 1.5 months","review":"I've had this phone for 1.5 months, and have been very satisfied. It is easy to set up, easy to use, good sound quality, large, easy to read font, ..., everything I want in a phone. Don't really have any complaints until now when one of my handsets displays \\"Out of Range\\" message all the time, even though I'm sitting right next to the main unit! I would have given it 5 stars if it did not have this problem.I am writing this review mostly to inform you how to get rid of the \\"Out of Range\\" error, since some other reviewers had similar problem. I was able to get rid of the error by simutaneously pressing the Phone Off button (red) and the # button to deregister the phone, then put the phone on the base to re-register.I tried to de-register before from Menu - Deregister HS. This did not work!With this problem, I am just a little worried about the quality of this phone. Hopefully this is the last problem I'll have with this phone :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good quality as I'd expected...","review":"My husband and I have both been unhappy with our phone. First, it seems to be \\"out of range\\" at least once a week. This has even happened when we were about two feet away from the base. Quite frustrating to have the phone suddenly turn off on you. Next, the clarity is not that good. My husband hates it when I use them to talk to him at work because he can't hear me very well and says it sounds muffled. So, now we're looking for a new phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The simple review\\"","review":"pROS:1.

(2011 Update)","review":"I purchased this to replace an older \\"high end\\" 2.4 Uniden that never quite cut the mustard with my parents hi expectations of overall quality. Immediately they were pleased with the send and receive volume. After a month they learned how to use the bells and whistles and have had nothing to say but good things. They really like the intercom, answering machine and how they can hear / be heard when making a call. The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I don't know for how long it will last and perform well. I have made a note to come back and post an addition to this review in one year. Also... if you need this in a hurry don't go for the free shipping. It took 3 weeks from the time I placed the order to the time I received it.March 2011It's been almost 4yrs to the date and the bases will no longer charge the batterys. Even after the batterys were replaced with OEM, terminals cleaned on both units. So they got 4yrs out of them.

I purchased this phone after Consumer Reports rated it the best and have been very pleased. Do I use all the features on the phone? No. I pick up the phone, dial a number, hear someone on the other end. It works with no interference from the wireless network. I also have never had a multiple handset phone. Our house is quite small so I was skeptical. I have to say that I like it a lot and it has been very convenient. Watch out for some other phones with multiple handsets, though. A friend just bought another popular model and both handsets cannot be used at the same time. This phone's handsets can be used at the same time, say if two people want to talk at the same time to grandma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"One week after purchase, the product stopped working.

After contacting Uniden, they said to exchange the two handsets between the two base units, wait a couple of days and if the light still goes out for no reason, to call them back. Well, it happened 3 more times and so I called them. They said that they would replace the base unit only after me faxing them the original bill and charging me a $10 shipping fee. Also they informed me that the replacement base would not be a new unit but a refurbished one, even though what I ordered was brand new. This is an unacceptable way to handle a defective product, by penalizing the customer. I can only hope that the replacement will work correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service!","review":"We have the Uniden cordless phone, and recently had some problems with the battery lasting less than a day on a charge. Consequently, I tried to call customer service, however Uniden only offers email customer service. I finally found a Texas number for them where one has to pay to call themThis is a far cry from Panasonic or Sony which both offer free, toll-free support. Apparently, Uniden is too cheap to offer a toll-free support number, and they want you to pay for the phone call. To add insult to injury, when I did finally call their pay support number, I had to wait twenty minutes for someone to answer. Simply pathetic. I would avoid this company. Apparently Uniden does not want to put any money towards customers, so why should customers pay for their phones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality phone","review":"I've had this phone for just over a year and today when I came home I found that it had died once and for all. The base showing is an \\"E4\\" error message. I've tried several things hoping to somehow reset it, but with no success.Even before the phone died I had all kinds of problems with it. It would cut out during calls, even when close to the base. The handsets would lock up for no apparent reason and I had to take out the battery to get them to reset. The answering machine would cut people off mid message.This is by far the worst phone I have ever owned. I suppose I may just have got a particularly bad one, but I will never buy another Uniden product again. There are plenty of reliable phones available out there, and now I'm off to find one to replace my dead Uniden."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear sound, easy interface, attractive design","review":"I bought this set for my parents (who are not technologically inclined). To my delight, they found it straight forward to use. I did have to set up the answering machine and time/date, but that was all.The design and red/amber color are appealing. Buttons are well labeled and keypad on handsets are backlit well. I really like the keypad on the base. This makes handsfree/speakerphone calling very easy. The sound quality is very clear compared to some older panasonic and v-tech phones I've had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Has a lot of features. The only deficiencies are the 12 minute recording time on the answering system with the option of limiting recorded messages to either 1 minute or 4 minutes. A longer recording time and an option of 2 minutes per message would have been nice. The tone quality is a little tinny but acceptable. The message alert sound feature is nice but it would be better yet if the LCD screen lit up when messages were waiting. Overall, this is a very nice 5.8 GHz phone for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone for good price","review":"This is our second purchase of a Uniden phone. We have had for three weeks.

JUNK and TRASH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor range","review":"Maybe I got a bad set but my handsets have very limited range away from the base. Once I get about 30 feet away, with 2-3 walls between the handset and the base, the static starts...then after moving further away another 10-15 feet I lose connection totally. Otherwise the sound was clear, though there was a faint, constant hum in the background. No interference problems with wifi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone - Excellent buy!!","review":"I needed a phone for my bedroom, but found I had no phone jack. So, I looked at phones that had the \\"satellite\\" plug in and use feature. Most I viewed were very expensive. However, this particular phone is available at a great price, offers expansion via purchase of satellite phones, is extremely easy to use although setting up the phone book was an arduous task, and although it's not terribly attractive, it's compact and takes up very little space. The base and the satellite handsets are small which I particularly like.Once I read the manual, I realized that I could copy phone numbers from the base or handset to each other. That made creation of the address book easier, and you also have the capability of having different phone books in each phone. That came in handy for me because I have my own phone numbers and my roommate has her own phone numbers and in addition, you can set different rings for mine and hers. So, we know who is receiving a call.Truly a great phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAULTY PHONE","review":"oNLY ONE OF THE PHONES WORK. THE OTHER ONE KEEPS SHORTING OUT.

To me it didn't seem realistic at all, and that detracted from what could have been. How much tragedy does one family have to face? How much coincidence is believable?

Easy to find what you want when you need it. It is not a book like Kimura's The Magician but a book that normal folks can and will use on a daily basis.

A dramatic look into the origins of Soviet cardiac surgery -- Amosoff was a general surgeon who learned how to perform open heart surgery on his own using cadavers and hopeless patients.

The theorizing on cybernetics in the second half of the book was rather dull and disappointing but obviously very interesting to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated but interesting","review":"One thing for sure that either the book is extremely outdated or the author was extremely ill-informed. This book is about the 2 days in the life of heart surgeon.If you have to read about heart surgeon please read the life Chritiaan Bernard - far more interesting and informative - does not babble with medical terms.Most of the book is babbling about cybernetics and from page one you will realize that this is rudimentary cybernetics. I learned cybernetics from Norbert Weiner's book so I realized what a bluff this is. If you have to read such trivial philosophy as in this book you can get it from Deepak Chopra (I mean you do not even have to go to Krinamurthy, Russell, Pauling).There are some comments about American doctors and their work ethics which are outrageous and wrong.

Big mistake. It does start out good with an interesting storyline, but after running around the bland repetitive country side and running into the 58th random encounter and listening to the bad acting and watching the painted on armor instead of it being modeled, well, it just gets really old.

Most of it features very simple cooking very heavy on egg, sour cream, butter and/or meat. If you eat this way or would like to, you probably don't need this cookbook to tell you how to do it! Venturing away from these types of dishes, for a number of the recipes the instructions and/or ingredient amounts don't really make sense or don't include enough detail. Proceed with caution and use your common sense. (I think some things got lost in translation--through time, place and/or language.) There are a few interesting ideas and combinations, some of them more appealing than others. e.g. Beets with cloves worked for me. Potato with prunes, and kidney beans with poppy seeds not so much.

Hurt's passion for Preistley grows(only if it where someone other then a old man loving a guy, ehhh) and then people are rejected. good filmmaking with superb performances all around.

Every innuendo is so undeveloped that you pray that another one isn't dropped on your lap. The effect is that the movie drags to a slow death. The \\"big\\" scene is banal and embarrasingly thin. One must conclude that there was a lot more footage but that it was edited out in an attenpt to keep the length tolerable. It wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the author","review":"About the BookThe '70s were a turning point in our history. But a mere description of major events cannot recall those years, because the measure of change is individual lives. This poetry of pain and experience written from 1970 to 1981 is one man's account of life in the fabled era. He grew up in a broken home, attended college during the height of the Vietnam War amid protests and Woodstock, and lived through a tumultuous first marriage. From the sociopolitical to the deeply personal, this collection explores change on every level of human experience and emotion.About the AuthorRichard Earl attended Stevens Institute of Technology and Rutgers University, Newark during the Vietnam War. He then spent 20 years in North Georgia writing, driving a forklift, then owning a small business. Richard moved to Juneau, Alaska in 1994 with his second wife, Vera. He is an Enrolled Agent and owner of a small tax preparation firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ass kicking machine","review":"This CD is awesome, I've been a Testament fan for a long time, and it seems like they keep getting heavier and heavier.

It has some interesting information about cat physiology, but the information on behavioral issues, such as scratching, not using the litter box, and so on, is really sketchy. I sent it back because the author is strongly in favor of outdoor access for cats but he never once mentions the potential dangers of life outdoors. He suggests that indoor-only cats are neurotic and unhealthy. But he says nothing at all about FIV or Feline Leukemia, nothing about dogs, mean people, cars, antifreeze, or any of the other dangers that you should consider before making the decision on whether to keep your cat indoors or not. My husband and I each lost great cats to FIV because we didn't know that we were putting them at risk by letting them out. I think it's irresponsible of Roger Tabor not to acknowledge the possible dangers of outdoor life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read . . .","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, and I learned a lot from it.

Without cats around, the mice would have chewed my entire house to sawdust years ago.I realize (from past experiences) that their lives are very risky compared to fat, pampered, defenseless, confined cats, but they are in their natural environment, are not overweight, are very active, lean, mean, love to hunt and are very happy.

It can be difficult reading as the author includes much detail in explaining Madison's words and actions, but I really felt that I understood the man after reading this tome. After all isn't that the purpose of a biography.The book deals with not only the life of the man, but also the relationships he had with fellow founding fathers like Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Monroe. For great detail, I really believe this may be the best most current biography of our fourth president that is available.

Mr. Ketcham appears to have an innate ability to paint a 2-dimentional picture of James Madison, and then vomit as much personal information into a chapter as possible, almost out of obligation, instead of making it interesting.I have allowed each book to guide me to my next reading, depending on who was mentioned and the interest they pressed upon me. In this case, all I could keep thinking is let me get through this God-forsaken thing and burn it.What I shame, for someone so complex as James Madison, to become such a chore because he was portrayed by someone more intent on showcasing his own acadamia than on higlighting the individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject poorly handled","review":"This book is terrible.

Madison's was a remarkable life, and it takes lots of space to cover the major points. This book likely will increase esteem for Madison's intellectual leadership, and gives careful insight into his political behavior.

These complaints are from 9 months ago and Dish still hasn't fixed this so-called \\"software\\" bug. I work in the software business and you can't tell me that they are still working on it. What they are now doing is called \\"damage control\\" because they \\"can't\\" fix the problem. The symptoms are: the audio drops out, or goes away completely until you turn power off and on.

The DVR features are not nearly as good as my ReplayTV box, (nothing else matches RelpayTV's interface in my opinion), but they are adequate and at least as good as anything else on the market with the possible exception of the Tivo interface.

The HDMI went out 2 weeks after hooking it up. Dish said that it was a known software problem and that they were developing a fix that would be out in a couple of weeks. That was 5 months ago and still counting. Even worse is the fact that they won't replace it because they claim that it is a software problem that affects all 622's. They couldn't explain why it worked fine and then all of the sudden stopped. They will also try and tell you that you have a bad cable or that the problem is with your TV.

In the event they deign to favor you with a service call, expect to wait a month and expect to pay for it.

The humor, the irreverence at the film's battle scene conclusion, the womanizing. Surprised not to see Harry Morgan make a cameo appearance but then he was probably sitting in jail after beating up his wife and couldn't make it. Another reviewer here mentioned how terrible the music was and I just laughed. Although released in 1986, the music reminds me of the post disco era circa 1980 and really dates the film with its techno pop keyboard work and closing credit vocal. Just terrible!

No extras, not even a menu or a trailer!This movie is currently running in HD widescreen on cable, I suggest you DVR that and don't waste your money on this cheap compromised disc.If Universal produces a good Blu Ray at the original aspect ratio, or even an MOD DVD in the correct width, I would buy that, Because this movie is a favorite, but now that I have a widescreen TV I find the old pan/scan square versions (like this one) unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"#NAME?","review":"There is an inescapable air of self-indulgence throughout this film, and it stifles any potential the novel but inevitable premise held. Alda's relation to each character screams for pity and fails to make the viewer care unless by some unfortunate taste one finds him and his misadventures somehow attractive. This is a high jinx film with a history buff's gloss, a formula for contrived disaster and TV movie tripe. The rousing climax of the filmed reenactment is corny and chaotic, calling either for an unaffordable budget (from wasting good actors) or a span that could not be controlled. If the angle of book-to-film frustration is to work, the sideplots must be altogether ignored. The humor and general plot is unbearably innocent, requiring a naive audience not easily found. I found it used for $1, and flea-market bartering could probably put anyone else well within that range."},{"rating":"2","title":"history is fun","review":"I always enjoy Alan Alda and he didn't disapoint and I enjoyed the young MIchelle Pfeiffer.

Lois Chiles from Moonraker plays Caine's married love interest. What they do on a roller coaster has never been tried before! And Mrs. Burgess, Alda's paranoid mother finds laughs in saying she won't eat any food until the poison in it is subdued with tv radiation. Again, this movie focuses on some of the untouched love angles, such as moving your mate's clothes into your apartment. The culture clash between California and North Carolina is something new too.

In fact, Ledoux's book (Emotional Brain) discusses how emotions are physically generated in the brain; while Goleman's (Emotional Intelligence) is the book that brought the EQ/IQ debate to the public's attention. It must be noted that Goleman does give credit to Ledoux in Emotional Intelligence for a diagram showing the Thalamus, Amygdala, and Visual Cortex. So if you're looking at this book because you want to know more about the EQ/IQ debate, definitely look at Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A needed book of emotions and their role in the brain","review":"Having read LeDoux's other work, I was pleased with this work, much as I enjoyed his previous work. In this book LeDoux explores the role of emotions in neuroscience. He does a fairly thorough job of explaining the history of the study of emotions through both psychology and neuroscience. I found his arguments about the limbic system persuasive, and his analysis of fear and also the memory intriguing.If there's one complaint I have, it's that I wish he'd focused on other emotions besides fear. He never really explains, for instance, where the emotion of happiness might be located. There may not be studies focused on that, but while he makes some interesting arguments for multiple systems of emotions, since his focus is only on fear, it doesn't make his argument as persuasive as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"It is not customary for me to feel so moved by a book that I want to write a review. This book is so bad, so disappointing that someone really should say something.LeDoux waits until the very last chapter to admit: \\"I've passed the emotional consciousness buck. I've redefined the problem ...as how emotional information comes to be represented in working memory. This won't make you happy if you want to know exactly what a feeling is or if you want to know how something as intangible as a feeling could be part of something so tangible as a brain.\\"Duh! That's why I bought the book! After all, the subtitle is \\"The mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life.\\"What the writer does manage to do prior to his final chapter is report the history of brain research, which is useful primarily as a sleep aid.

Based on other complaints found via Google and confirmed by the repairman who came by, there appears to be a recurring problem with an inverter board on Phillips TVs. Our repair guy gave us a $500 quote to replace that component. He suggested we buy a new TV because these televisions are also highly prone to have a power supply failure within 4-6 years, which would set us back another $500 within the next year or two. His comment that stuck with me was, \\"these aren't your daddy's philips tv's.

Called the Philips hotline (they answered immediately!) and was told it was a satellite issue, not a TV problem. Funny, since my last TV didn't have any problems receiving the signal. Very, VERY frustrating.Second problem: I tried to connect my digital camera to the USB and the TV said it was an \\"unsupportable device\\". Wow! If a common Canon Elph digital camera is not supported by this TV, then few devices must be. (In fact, the manual says that only USB 1.1 are compatible).

Piatt as a Wolfhound in the Paktika province of Afghanistan. It is an expierience I will always treasure. I learned more about myself and the nobility of soldiering in that year than any other. I can say that Col. Piatt is an officer who lives his beliefs and leads by example. He was the soldier with the most \\"wheel time\\" and the longest time \\"outside the wire\\" in the Battalion. In essence that meant he spent more of our deployment in a vehicle, on the frontiers,in the face of danger than any of the soldiers in his command.This behaviour goes a long way to inspire an Infantryman who is tired, scared and homesick.

The players are led on a round about trail to find the entrance to a large underground dungeon where they face kobles with a twist and a powerful and inteligent dragon.

All the little parts may break easily, in fact, every time you transform it into the Camaro or the robot you have to be careful not to break any piece of plastic.I love this toy, I am a big Transformers fan.

The collection includes what are obviously early recordings, and the digital remastering eliminates many recording flaws. Pavarotti's voice soars and sinks in sublime cadences. The stamina and excitement of the young tenor emerge in a number of tracks. The collection goes beyond the standard repertoire of the later years, to a more formative period, when there was a greater vocal and conceptual flexibility at the tenor's disposal. I have nothing but admiration for the performances.What is disappointing is that no information is provided about the dates or occasions of the the recordings; orchestras, conductors, the soprano in the duets, or any of those details that are of interest to the avid music collector.Still, a valuable addition to the collection of any lover of Pavarotti."},{"rating":"2","title":"the incredible voice of Yolanda Rayo","review":"Listen to Yolanda Rayo by chance. And from that moment I began to find his discography. It's really amazing the quality of his voice. Almost all of his records I like a lot, is a delight to listen to their songs. His voice has a power, clarity and perfect tuning. On this album are great songs, with a set of really good musicians, and a very meticulous production and fortunately a very good recording. A very good job, definitely. Do not understand how this singer does not have all their albums on permanent distribution, I must be very old, because discovering a voice that tells you something, out of the great divas of opera and jazz, I do not spend more than year to year, but anyway, if you can, listen to this singer, I think not going to disappoint you, but can be dangerous, may be addictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book exploits children","review":"No, I'm not joking. The author uses the plight of the world's children as a basis to sell books and to spend pages on pages grandstanding about his liberal ideals based on his lousy theology. He calls himself a priest (Roman Catholic, I think) so I'd expect a better understanding of Christianity's worldview, but forget it. This book was such tripe that at one point I told myself if he says we must \\"stand in solidarity\\" with these kids one more time, I'm tossing this book out... he did and I did. In short, these poor kids' stories are being sold all around the world and nobody benefits but the publisher and the author.

Its a trade-off of protection/durability vs a mirror shine.Found it more durable than most, just as leading consumer mag said.On cooler days out of the sun, takes more than 5 minutes to dry(perhaps 15, big whooop). But I like it that way, leaves more wax behind to protect the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves way too many streaks","review":"I've used many different waxes in my life. I decided to try the black magic liquid wax because of its \\"longer lasting\\" reputation. Unfortunately, I'll never know if that's true because I used this wax on one side of an SUV before I gave up. Application is easy, but that's true with most waxes now. Removing the wax is another story though. I applied the wax in the shade and let it sit before attempting to remove, just as I do with any other wax. There were streaks and swirl marks left behind from the wax. I had to wipe over it again and again, until eventually I just went back using the Mother's wax I had been using before. I will not be applying this product to any cars again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most effort of any wax I've used","review":"I bought this because of its top rating in Consumer Reports. Having read some of the reviews here and elsewhere I applied it only to the hood as a test. What a nightmare! Basically it gives the impression that it never dries, so there's a greasy-looking, smudgy film no matter how long I wait for it to dry or how long I buff. Maybe it's deliberate -- could this be where the name \\"wet shine\\" comes from?Used this on the wife's dark blue Accord. Possibly the effect isn't as noticeable on a light-colored car.This may well be the most durable, or protective (or whatever virtue) of any wax. But I'll never find out, because it's just too much of a pain in the *** to use. Giving it two stars instead of one, only because it didn't do anything really crazy like eat through the sheet metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Long-Lasting Protection","review":"I began using this wax when a leading consumer magazine gave it a top rating. I do have to be careful to apply a super-thin amount of wax because the wax is harder to buff out than a paste wax like meguiars ultimate.

The colour ones in the center of the book are not enough to show great detail.As you would know that the German Military used different colours to represent the different units. So, in Black and White photos they would all look alike(for example a German Infantry officer, a Major shoulder board would have White on the bottom. and an Artillary officer would have Red on the bottom of the shoulder board).Even though this book explains the different types of Insignias and Badges...The Authors should concentrate more on showing the realistic samples in live photos with colour more then even drawings."},{"rating":"2","title":"lATE cAPITALIST sUBLIME","review":"This volume of poetry by Ryan Kamstra is at once tender/tough, political/personal, musical/cacophanous, real/fantastical.

Do they really think incorporating other movie's elements would make it better? Then how the world would you make something about the same? 15 years later, technology would be better and that would mean that improvements would be there when building another one. How about a rocket launcher or a laser weapon? Guess that's too smart to do. I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on.

The only examples of DBQ's in the prep section on dbqs consists of dbqs they tried to make into compare and contrast questions. Also, they should be a little more up front abotu what you have to do, and make sure there is some seperation when it comes to knowing what you have to do for each seperate essay. It also does a vary bad job of explaining the importance of grouping when it comes to the dbq. But the cover is water resistent. My friend spilled water on it and nothing bad happend."},{"rating":"2","title":"INVALUABLE PERSPECTIVE","review":"This is one of the best things I've ever read, even independent of the AP exam, because its main focus is not only on the facts of history, but their SIGNIFICANCE.

My reccomendations: Take Practice Test 14 BUT DON'T WRITE IN THE BOOK. See how you do. Then go over everything start to finish and take Test 2. You should get a 50/70 if you want a 5.

However, there is an additional setup process required to register the phones. It is not difficult - just follow the instructions in the manual. The clarity and coverage are great.

Called Uniden's support and the person told me it's not compatible probably just from reading the manual. Anyway I decided to go ahead ordering it and give it a try. The TCX905 won't fit in U160P's base for auto registering, so here is how to register TCX905 with U160P:1. unplug power cord from U160P base2. hold \\"find H/S\\" and plug in the power cord3. wait until the \\"find H/S\\" LED is flahing, release button4. press \\"#\\" on TCX905 until the LCD says \\"registering...\\"And intercom, room monitor, day/time sync all works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden TCX905 Accessory Handset","review":"I bought a few of these to be used as additional handsets for my Uniden Cordless system.

The other models of compatible Uniden handsets have separate buttons for these features. This central buton (sort of a flattened joystick) has been difficult to operate at times. I know that if this handset should stop working, it will be due to this button.Otherwise, the sound quality of this cordless phone approaches that of a corded phone. Additionally, the interface is highly intuitive and easily readable. After the battery is charged, setup only took a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for the price","review":"The 2-line uniden phone handset is a good starter phone for the home and or small office. The features I was looking for are on this phone. The issue I have is that the labels are too small it's hard to find the correct keys to use especially that this phone has softkeys. By softkeys I mean the key changes depending on what function you're accessing on the phone. One other issue I have with this phone is that there's interference that I hear from my router. There's a clicking sound that I hear whenever the wireless router sends data. This does not happen too often but when it does the sound is noticeable. The farther you are from the base there is also a change of not being able to hear the other party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone","review":"This phone got it right.
