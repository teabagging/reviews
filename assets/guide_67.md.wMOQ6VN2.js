Did a great job of dispersing the heat, the edges all bubbled at the same time/rate.I loved that the raised lid handle allowed you to touch the lid barehanded even with the water boiling full steam.Used the lid to eat off and the lips of the lid well contained the food.Keep in mind that pot is shaped wider then tall so this is a great pot for thinks like stews, hotdogs, etc (was able to fit all 8 with only 300ml of water). Would not suggest for coffee or small amounts of liquid.The handle doubling as a lid securing device was a nice touch.All in all, did what it said as expected.

Easily one of my favorite mics for recording voice and acoustic instruments. I have had absolutely no problems with it, it's solid and reliable.The sound is perhaps slightly warm for close-up vocal work, so for that you might want to roll back the lows on your eq just a tiny bit. But I find that bit of warmth very pleasant for recording acoustic guitar, dulcimer, flute, etc. If you're miking an acoustic instrument from 3 ft or further away, then the sound is crisp and has enough low end to just be pleasant.I have microphones that cost more, but for recording this one would be my favorite. Amazingly good sound for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and really not all that bad.","review":"[review updated after more time spent with the mic]Well, there's definitely some detail missing in the mids, but it has a generally pleasing \\"very fat\\" (aka muddy) tone.

It actually picked up me walking in my socks on carpeted floor. My vocalist sounds so clear and pristine. If you got a few hundred to spend on a mic then by all means do so.

Not as crisp and clear as some reviewers suggest.This microphone is an ok hobbyist tool. But it is anything but something to use for more than that.Notes:1) Emits a foul sharp odor that smells like burning plastic. Sometimes, makes me want to choke and cough.2) You have to direct your voice into the area above the label else it sounds \\"lost\\"3) Has a tinge of a deep, lower bass sound from it.4) For vocals, if you have to hit a loud note, it breaks up miserably. You have to back off the mic a good 12 inches to avoid this. And it sounds really horrible.Overall a decent microphone for the price. Well built, sturdy construction. Nice extra with the shock mount. But you get what you pay for.Update 1/2/13:Backing this down to 2 stars.The shock mount screws as they sit into the shock mount ring will no longer fit as they worse out.

The acting is fine for a church pageant, but not so much for a mass-marketed video. Veteran actor Bill Cobbs is an obvious talent, but no one else in the film can match him, or even comes close.The direction is limited as well, with most shots focusing on just one actor at a time, no creative approaches, very basic shots. The lighting is also often poor. This is a very low-budget film.For all that, the story itself is reasonable, and quite old-fashioned: I was reminded of the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland movies where the kids decided to \\"put on a show!\\" The plot and situations come out fine. And there's nothing especially wrong with the film. You just shouldn't buy it expecting a big-budget picture out of Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's Review","review":"Your first day at middle school can be a very stressful experience. It's hard to find movies that portray this age group correctly while being appropriate for the entire family. I really enjoyed No Limit Kids because it sends a positive message to new teens.

No LImit Kids would make a great gift for the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"the second half is quite good","review":"This is now out of print: cheap paperback editions from the 60's are now selling for forty or fifty bucks. Most of John Christopher's stuff (actual name: Samuel Youd) is for pre-teens, but this novel is for adults -- though it is a short one.This book manages to be both gripping and depressing, but it's not without its problems:1. It seems to take forever to get started.2. I would say that characterization in this novel is a minus. Christopher throws too many characters at you too fast. Since he doesn't bother to distinguish them much, it's a bit hard to tell them apart until the middle of the novel. But once the middle of the novel hits, even more come along.The one thing I liked about this novel was that our heroes, in an attempt to survive, resort to murdering innocent people using an \\"either us or them\\" philosophy. Since you don't see that very often in the post-Apocalyptic genre, I would recommend it in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good post-apocolyptic novel.","review":"Christopher has done a good job with this format of science fiction.

Very well done.This mature, mystical ride through the ages atop a classical musical instrument provides pleasures, both visual & for the senses, without noise or the usual intrusive,aggravating fastball pitching of the overwhelming majority of today's typical films !!An excellent film - even better if the role filled by Samuel Jackson had been cast elsewhere. I can think of a couple of British high level older actors who would have added immensely to this production ! Samuel Jackson is the only negative I have for the film ... somehow, he just doesn't come close to suiting the part this flic should have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Enjoyed it very much. Beautifully made and good story revolving on a red violin as it transforms the lives of those who owned it. Good music backgroung performed by Joshua Bell. A must for violin music lovers. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not glitchless","review":"John Corigliano is an adequate, but not great, composer. Still, the music and the prodigy's playing of his part of it are the most pleasing aspects of the film. Some scenes (such as the extreme reaction to infidelity) are a bit hokey. Especially since Italian, French, and German are spoken beautifully by the actors, it's a disappointing surprise to hear mispronunciation of the violin maker's name (Bussotti) and a key word of his inscription (\\"cuore\\") by one who supposedly is an expert in the history and construction of violins. Does everyone grasp the horrible meaning of the final line of the film? It made me, the father of three daughters, shudder."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Buy the Universal/MCA Edition DVD Instead!!!","review":"This DVD edition by Lion's Gate has a significant subtitle deficiency. While much of this movie is in German, French, Italian and Mandarin (?), the only English subtitles available are for the hearing impaired, so they appear at all times and provide sound descriptions as well, which can be quite a distraction. The Universal/MCA DVD offers a setting for English subtitles for the foreign languages only, as one should expect. Why Lion's Gate missed this is beyond me.The movie is great-but don't buy this edition unless you are hearing impaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"The Red Violin is such a good movie. The storyline is good as we as then cinematography, though it does slow down when it gets to the chinese part of the movie and to the american part (the movie is separated into different time periods..each separated by a tarot card)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This is a beautiful film with a great plot and a really intriguing twist ending. You must be able to handle subtitles unless you can speak German, Italian, and a little French. :) The movie explains the \\"fortune\\" of a fictional violin as time and history pass. The scenery is beautiful as the story moves through German monasteries, Eastern Europe, the English countryside, and finally China. Some of the effects are dated, but the films makes up for it with an amazing score played by Joshua Bell.Great movie, a bit intellectual - you have to pay attention or the entire thing is lost - but completely worth adding to your personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for Classical Music and Mystery","review":"The Red Violin is a terrific movie that revolves around the Tarot card reading of a master violin maker's wife and the history of a 300 hundred year old perfectly made violin and how the two are forever tied together as one.The red violin is set to go up for auction at a present day New York auctiion house and we learn the history of the violin and how & why the people who are bidding on it want it so badly.Movie is beautifully made, has mysteryious plot, wonderful music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitting \\"Pause\\" for bathroom breaks not required","review":"What a yawner! I can't give this movie one star only because we actually watched it through to the end, with only two short naps. Yes, it's very pretty to look at, and yes, the music is lovely, but it stops there. The violin wasn't a strong enough thread to tie the different stories together. Although we were shown why each bidder at the auction wanted the violin, there was absolutely no reason to care about the modern folks as much as their historical counterparts. Samuel L. Jackson's character is completely unlikable.By the way, Gypsies are generally far too superstitious to be grave-robbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars? Impossible!","review":"While beautifully filmed, (and that's not difficult these days) most of the vignettes are extremely weak. As in many international coproductions, there seems to be a lowest common denominator factor at work. The link with Jackson is interesting but it just doesn't play true and the hoped for suspense falls flat. The Chinese section is a joke. It feels like it was filmed on a backlot in Hollywood with 4th generation Chinese Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie, but HORRIBLE DVD!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies and I was excited to add it to my DVD collection. But they made a HUGE mistake with the subtitles. In the movie theatre, the movie had subtitles for the foreign languages, and the English scenes were left alone. On this awful DVD you have to watch it with either no subtitles, or with the \\"hearing impaired\\" subtitles...which means EVERY LINE, foreign or English, is subtitled. And the background noises are explained, too (\\"heavy breathing,\\" \\"children singing in Chinese,\\" etc.), which is incredibly irritating. I found myself watching the subtitled version during the foreign language scenes, then switching to the unsubtitled version during the English scenes. Frustrating in the extreme.This really ruined the viewing of the movie for me. I doubt I'll ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lions Gate Version - BEWARE","review":"While I love this movie, I purchased a release on DVD from Lions Gate only to discover that there are no subtitles! What were they thinking when they released this film? The majority of it is not in English and impossible to watch by the average person.

It ended up having more action and adventure than most films I've seen! After coming back from vacation I made sure to find this movie and have added it to my collection. I won't spoil it by telling any scenes of the movie so if you havn't seen it take a look.

Everything was perfect and the story was so moving. Movies like this are so rare that when they come along they are either embraced or reviled. This movie deserves to be love dfor a very long time. The movie follows the story of one very special violin. One that was made to be held by the maker's son, played by a prodigy, dissolve a love, and survive a cultural revolution and end up in one person's hands ,but who's hands will it be?

Can not suggest this movie to anyone even if you love the violin like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"From the beginning scenes with actors wandering around aimlessly viewed through cracks between boards, to abrupt changes to past and present, and repeated clips this is a poorly done movie. Bizarre, fantacy behavior that would be deemed pornographic by most best describes one segment and the violin maker was depicted as demented by his treatment of his wife's dead body---hardly believable and certainly not inspiring. The segments described, by their shock, overshadowed some decent, partially historical material that might have made a good movie had the rest been as relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Violin","review":"My nephew raved about this movie.

The plot was very well thought out and it kept your interest. Where I feel the movie went wrong is in it's inabuility to move the plot along. I thought I was going to keel over and die before the violin would ever be sold at auction. It has a great and unusual story though, so I was able to stick it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring but colorful remake of LA RONDE","review":"The basic plot of LA RONDE (used previously for such films as THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE) is rehashed here in the form of a famous violin and its many owners since its creation. It's a cursed thing so brings only tragedy to those who covet it (somewhat like Wagner's RING). This vastly overlong film is lethargically directed with no point of view or connecting thread between the stories and when we get the great revelation at the end we realize we guessed it in the first reel. The faux \\"classical\\" music score by serious composer John Corigliano was Oscared. The Art Direction, Costume Design and Cinematography are all of merit and worth mention but the thing never gets off the ground or soars - you'd think it would considering the music the instrument makes. If you're an afficianodo of the violin, this will please you. If not, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Violin DVD","review":"This movie is in apx four different languages with no translations.

Although viewers may be turned off by the fact that it is subtitled, it is still a very good film. The fact that the movie has five different languages is what makes this film special. The characters are real and you see a good side in everyone. The story of a red violin and the people who have owned it is very original. I am highly impressed with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feast for the viewer and listener","review":"Lavish presentation, as intricate and ornate as a baroque symphony. The story centers on the journey of a priceless violin (varnished with a curious red laquer) as it passes from hand to hand over many generations and thru the centuries. A little short on plot, with a somewhat tattered thread sewing the 'plots' together, The Red Violin is nonetheless a lush, sensual, and satisfying film on most levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Film","review":"The Red Violin was one of my favorite films of 1999. The music, story telling method, and camera work was spectacular. The journey of this violin through 400 years in Italy, Austria, England, China, and the US was a fantastic story of both success and loss. This was the type of film I thought about for days after seeing it. The only drawback was the selection of Samuel L. Jackson for a key part in the film. He was not the right fit for the role. Overall... if you have not seen this film, it should be at the top of your list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel with the \\"Red Violin\\"","review":"This delightful tale takes us through the 300-year \\"travels\\" of a Cremona-built violin famous for its red color (and how it got that way!). From Italy to Austria to England to China and finally to the auctioneer in Montreal, we're treated to the compelling intrigue of various owners and their stories. Meanwhile, the mystery of what will finally happen at the auction is coupled with flashbacks to a fortune-teller predicting to the violinmaker's pregnant wife the next stage of the journey.Some off-screen work by violin virtuoso Joshua Bell is masterful; composer John Corigliano's scores were written specifically for the film and earned him an Oscar for his superb efforts. While the individual stories might have had smoother segue ways, actor Samuel L. Jackson, playing a noted violin appraiser, delivers a twist at the end once his detective work as to the true identity of the violin is complete. An engrossing and entertaining two hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring movie","review":"This movie was very boring, I was trying to stay awake through the whole movie, I finally switched it off towards the end, it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your MONEY!","review":"What a borefest! The story comes together in the last few minutes after following the history of the red violin. Which is long and boring. The only part that was of any interest was why the red violin was red. Now that was cool, its SPOILER ALERT: blood of the creators wife.Wow, the rest of the story was just terrible! I wish I could get that time I watched the DVD back! Don't waste your money, get it at the library first if you really want to see this one.

Hopefully a human at Amazon will read this.Also, I know if I try to leave this without rating the product it will bounce. I love the movie: 5 stars plus.

I was amazed that anyone would show it on an airplane and after i got back to the US spent months telling my friends to go and find this movie in the vido stores and watch it, i loved it so much. This was, some 4 months before its theatrical release in the US, so it was a fruitless reccommendation, but now they can buyu it and watch on and on.

If you turn on subtitles, every word of the script, and even words for sound effects are displayed. If you turn off subtitles, then subtitles are displayed only for foriegn language portions.~~~As for the film: It is fabulous. Beautifully produced. Mysterious. Multilayered. Raw. Emotional. Gripping. Some here have complained that not enough historical violin master musicians play the red violin. Aside from Frederick Pope (who seems to be a fictional composite of Paganini and Mick Jaggar), this is not a story about the privileged and popular. It is rather the story about extraordinary things that happen to common folk who \\"follow their passion\\" (Joseph Campbell), with an enchanting red violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta watch this one!!","review":"I promise you will love this movie. It is a bit long but man is it beautiful!! I never buy movies but this one I am about to get off amazon. One of my #1 recommendation to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Masterpiece.","review":"This is an exceptional movie. This movie has a depth that is rare; seldom are movies like this made. The plot reveals itself slowly, carefully, winding to an incredible and inexorable revelation at the end.How could such a thing, made by mortal hands, have such a captivating (even enslaving) effect? Watch and see.To me this was fascinating because never has a movie so closely revealed the power and attraction of music; this violin captures the very soul of music -- an all consuming passion, evoking the best and worst in us all.This is simply one of the best movies made. After watching it one feels that 99.99% of movies are garbage.The Red Violin is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful production values","review":"The music is sumptuous, the plot is a little hard to follow at times, but the production values are fabulous. The verilisimitude of the various settings - medieval Italy/Cremona, Germany/Austria, China, wherever - is lovingly detailed. The makers did not spare the production values, praise be, you feel you ARE there in those scenes. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Violin Lovers","review":"This complex tale follows a magical violin from its tragic creation in 18th century Italy to its sale at a contemporary auction house in Montreal. Like any good movie, it requires the willing suspension of disbelief which for me was easy enough to do with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson playing the part of Charles Morritz, the violin expert. He is a wonderful actor but is totally miscast here. This is an entertaining film that weaves together several amusing vignettes accompanied by John Corigliano's enchanting film score. Buy it at a discount and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE","review":"I believe this movie was a sleeper - a real blockbuster that no one heard about. I think this is another one of my top favorites of all time. There wasn't a dull or sleepy moment throughout the entire movie. It was fascinating and interesting as the violin traveled through time and the ending made me laugh and squeal with delight. The only thing I had a problem with was knowing he was taking a multimillion dollar violin home to his kid. That almost gave me a heart attack. Besides that, it is a movie that I have watched again and again. It is always thrilling and fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I really like the plot of this movie: the long history of a specific violin as it makes it way toward an auction. It's such an interesting story with different historical periods being shown, and the landscapes and costumes of each period are also very good. I'm so surprised that it's not more well known. You won't be disappointed in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Half an hour in and I couldn't even pay attention at all anymore. I skipped through the rest and it was all the same. Really long shots of nothing with violin music in the background. Oh my God this movie was so slow moving. I wanted to see SAMUEL L. JACKSON!! What the hell, only a few shots here and there? Damn you, Red Violin!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film with great music.","review":"This is a wonderful film.

By the time the story had moved to China I felt lost and bewildered. This film is extremely hard to follow and quite boreing. I originally rented this because Samuel L. Jackson was in it. He had a small part and seemed to be the most interesting character in the whole film.I did however enjoy the music and the scenery, it was quite beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Violin - a movie w/out a lasting impression","review":"I found The Red Violin to be both boring and unmoving. The story follows the 'life' of a violin created in the 1600s and the movie consists of several individual stories woven together by the present-day scene of an auction at an Auction House as well as a tarot reading consisting of cards including Death, Justice, The Moon and the Hanged Man.The movie attempts to portray to the viewer the importance and wonder of music, particularly that played by the violin but at the same time the movie does not leave any lasting impression on the viewer and bar an interesting twist at the end of the movie, your time would be better spent catching up on some sleep.The best part of the movie is some original editing techniques that make for an interesting film study but for those looking for an entertaining, relaxing movie, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Flag","review":"I rented this movie because I read the reviews on this website. PLEASE do not make the same mistake. This movie is so stupid and boring and pointless that I can't imagine who these reviewers are. It dragged on and on and on, as the stupid violin got passed on to more and more uninteresting characters I couldn't have cared less about. I couldn't wait for it to end. Unless you like wasting your life, do not see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough details to","review":"figure out what is going on in the beginning.

I can't believe all the production value that went into this script! The acting is just as overdone as the screenplay. It is an interesting idea, to follow the life of an inanimate object and examine the lives of those who touched it, but this movie has all the subtlety of a monster truck. Its like Masterpiece Theatre mixed with the Days of our Lives. In my opinion, you should avoid it. You'll never get those hours of your life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greta Scacchi's character","review":"I agree with the Amazon.com reviewer, but the subject of my comment is something else:Interesting that so many pepole assume that Victoria is Frederick Pope's mistress.

It is a really nice, well writen book. It doesnt bog you down a lot with grammar and the drills and excercises are really helpful. This books gives you small chunks at a time, so if you take your time with it, you can really learn a lot in my opinion. There are two things wrong with it though.1) The pronounciation section, I think its lacking. There should be more examples and a few more oral excercises before the start of the real coursework2) There are some typos in it that are a small nuisance, like for example when they intended to make a statement bold and the forget to make the last word bold, or in some few instances the last letter of a word might be capitalized when its not supposed to. An example would be the word \\"doi\\" (radio -- the accents were left off), and in some instances it was typed as \\"doI\\", just a silly typo.all in all it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese Inn","review":"I think this book is excellent if you are looking for a historical representation of Japan.

If not for the name Emma Drummond, I wouldn't have. I hated the pace, story-telling, plots and sub-plots of this book. I think it's because I am very familiar with her books written under the name Emma Drummond. This book did not live up to the powerful way her stories emerge.It focused mostly on one character and his road to recovery from post traumatic disorder and some kind of murder mystery involved.

It is sad that these are not safe to use due the residue issue.We did find another alternative, though, that seems much better:100 CPP Clear Plastic Sleeve with Resealable FlapThe price is quite reasonable and they worked just as well in terms of size and shape. The plastic is a bit thinner than the Memorex Keeper sleeves, but they still seem quite durable.If you are going to use the Memorex sleeves you pretty much have to use some sort of inner liner within the plastic liner -- like taking the CD paper liner/notes and using that as a barrier around the CD inside the plastic sleeve -- in order to prevent the residue problem.We did use inner liners with the new CPP sleeves, too, just for safety, but they do not seem to have the same problem as these Memorex covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strongest possible warning, whatever you do, do not buy this item!","review":"This horrific product leaves an insidious, foglike residue on your disks that is nearly impossible to remove destroying your expensive computer games, data backups and DVD's.Leached out by the obviously inferior pigmentation that is used to color these sleeves, in many cases the thin superglue-like residue causes discolorations on the disks that can only be fully removed by automobile rubbing compound or rubbing alcohol mixed with toothpaste, both of which leave millions of fine scratches in the residue's place.In the case of baking soda, you can simply no longer see the discolaration any longer due to the many scratches that cleaning a DVD with baking soda causes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF RESOURCES & ENERGY.

HUGE mistake. Awhile back, we noticed music and movies with this 'stuff' on them. Much of our library (not massive by any means, but numbering quite a few boxed PBS, Charlie Chan, and other expensive series) has been ruined by these gawd-awful wastes of petroleum resources. Now in the process of reviewing our discs to see what can be salvaged, and what will have to be thrown away.

Unfortunately the book does not explore how \\"The Company\\" which was once an R&D powerhouse, got to be in this dysfunctional state. Also the book offers very little hope for dealing with a company in this type of state, short of the company being acquired or getting lucky and having unintended benefits during a passive/aggressive power struggle amongst management.

I read it many years ago, but thought I should review it just in case someone wanted to get a glimpse into a bygone era of American politics. The Reagan administration is seen by many as one that accomplished much, and how it accomplished what it did is an interesting story, a story that should be told from more than the normal perspective of Reagan worshipers. Regan is not a Reagan hater, but rather someone who has a more somber vision of what occurred. Yes, this did result from the fact that he was burnt by some in the administration, but he still did observe the fact that Reagan was a delegator who trusted people too much. Regan also highlights how a lack of direction created unease while he served as the Secretary of the Treasury. All in all,a great insight into the presidential politics of the 1980s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Buttler is outstanding","review":"Another great book by an extremely talented and gifted writer.

However if you read one or two together say Rudin and A Month in the Country then you see another side to this fine old author, that is he doesn't have a good sense of where he is going with the book and his caracters flounder around. What happens is that a whole bunch of people get together in a country mansion wander about the garden being deep and meaningful, fall in love and then wander about the garden being deep and meaninbgful some more. Eventually the hero has to go away and usually dies, that gets rid of them and everyone else lives happily/unhappily ever after.I am still a Turgenev fan but he does not develope his story consistantly as does say Thorogood in A Foxtrot Through India, anyway read Turgenev he is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dinosaur Story","review":"I think Jurassic Park should was a great book, thats why i gave it four stars. I like for bookis to go right into the action and Jurassic Park took about two or three pages and thats what i liked about it. i also like the fact that they used the same names like in the movie so the readers woulnt get confused. Jurassic Park is a book about a man who decides to create an island and make dinosaurs, a few experts come to the island and everything goes wrong. The dinosaurs start to attack the people and the people have to try and get away in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Jurassic Park was good though a little repetitive at times. The best thing about it was that the movie was totally different. The book is a lot better and I loved the movie.The pace of the story is good.

Make no mistake--it is exciting. What could be more scary and exhilarating than running from a T-Rex or outwitting a velociraptor? If you were ever interested in dinosaurs as a kid, you will revel in Crichton's creations.Yet underlying all the excitement is this whispered lesson: Life is inherently chaotic; you cannot control it. There are also cautions about being overly dependent on computerization, the folly of messing about with things you don't fully understand, and the dangers of letting academic knowledge replace common sense. The book is never \\"preachy\\"; it makes its points subtly and they are all the more powerful because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ride","review":"As usual Michael Crichton executes a brilliant set-up and brings in all the characters for introduction by the end of the second itieration. The bulk of the book is a rollercoaster ride and the suspense is heightened by periodically killing off his characters. Crichton doesn't end his books well, wrap up is not his forte. Interesting to see the changes they made to the movie, which would have definitely spruced up the characterisation in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT the Movie","review":"If you have seen Jrassic Park, you know the plot.

All this is ansered in Jurassic Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"It jumped around too much for me","review":"O.K. maybe I didn't like it because my ninth grade teacher made me read it.

He kept on about how everyones gonna die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely gripping, but pure drivel","review":"I read this book in only one day because it was so gripping, but was left with little to show for my time. Crichton's cartoonish portrayal of dinosaurs, overstated morality play, and psuedo-scientific mumbo jumbo is exciting, but is ultimately hollow and pointless. If you have eight or nine hours to waste go for it. At least it's better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHARACTERLESS","review":"This is one of the few books i have tried to read and failed.

THey were less than 2 dimentional. \\"Bob is a palentologist with brown hair...\\" M.C. spent no time on his characters, tthey wree flat, uninteresting, and ultimatly forced me to give up on the book.

An anchor which Crichton cuts loose halfway through in order to make room for a couple of contrived chase scenes.Maybe Crichton has never been able to write books, but only mass-market screenplays. Unfortunately, the movie was even worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Careless Thriller","review":"Crichton at his best builds his novel with careful research and attention to detail, which is why Jurassic Park is so disappointing. Dinosaurs get out when electric fences fail, even though they are supposed to be enclosed by moats as well. Rivers seem to flow up hill. Basic addition fails (the sum of three closely related normal distributions is not a three-peaked distribution). The chaos theory is profoundly misunderstood: most chaotic systems are in fact tightly bounded. The biology is also bad. Although Crichton gives lip service to warm-blooded dinosaurs, major plot devices link them to amphibians in unrealistic ways. Crichton would have been better served by either making the book a shameless fantasy or by taking the time to get the details right; but pretending to a meticulousness that is so repeatedly betrayed makes the book frustrating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick On Jurassic","review":"An evil, sleazy book, unheroic and malevolently mystical. Ian Malcolm, the mathematician, expresses the novel's theme. This character's central philosophy carries the weight of the novel's theme. Ew! Ick! These aspects never come up in the movie, which was a relief and a good entertainment. But as a novel -- ew ! ick! A arch-Catholic with a vile and anti-Man view of reality. But enjoy the movie like a cartoon carnival treat. It has nothing to do with the rotten essence that is the meat of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting. However, still a great read!","review":"Michael Chricton is one of my preferred authors. I give 75% of his works a 5 star rating. However, this particular book didn't meet his usual high standards. It seems as if it were pumped out on a long weekend, instead of well thought out. Still, you can't go wrong with Michael Chricton. He is a fantastic author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie has nothing on this.","review":"If you're a fan of the Jurassic Park films, you must read the novels they're based on. You won't regret it and you'll love them even more than you did the films. A slight downside is the inaccurate dinosaur facts, but that's to be expected in any older book focusing on them. It's also very interesting to see how much different the books were than the films.In my particular copy though, I noticed quite a few typos. Words spelled extremely wrong, or a few that started out as the word they wanted then seemed to change into a different word halfway into it. Editors should have given it a proofread in my opinion but it only takes 1 star from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehhh","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner but the print is poor.

It was just as good as the movie, and I saw the movie before I read the book, so I already had most of the characters in my head, and I luckily got to vividly see how realistic the dinosaurs were! The only downside is that the veloceraptors kill to many people, and the big tyrannosaurus rex ate NO ONE. But the scene where they had to go on the raft was very interesting and scary none the less. I liked how descriptive Michael Crichton was in writing the book, and how he described the dinosaurs, to make them appear so real to the readers. The movie was totally AWESOME, too. I am a BIG Steven Spielberg fan! Overall, this book was fast-paced and action-packed, a real page turner! Could have gone without so much technical mumbo-jumbo, though. Great work Mr. Crichton, one of your best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller coaster ride!","review":"This book is lots of fun. But Crichton probably should have stopped at this volume. Subsequent work simply did not live up to this.The tale is irresistible. Humans meet dinosaurs. Human rationality presumes that it can contain the meeting of humans and dinosaurs and keep things antiseptic and safe. Technology moves faster than reflection on its use. . . .Whedn I first read this (quite a few years back), it was like a roller coaster ride (and the same thing with the movie). Lots of excitement, lots of questions popping up.Anyhow, a fine novel, a fine read, a fine yarn. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER READ!!!","review":"SIMPLY AMAZING, EXELANT, I THINK THAT THIS IS MICHAEL CRICHTON'S BEST.

The cavalier way Spielberg changed and juked the story around to make it into not one but two movies shows these two were made for each other :) Anybody can read this novel and not strain their brain, or upgrade their reading skills beyond about 8th grade. A profound masterwork of an author who gives people what they want rather than what he wants them to have, and my hat's off to him for showing a budding author the Way :) How about a sequel giving Spielberg an excuse for re-creating the Ice Age and its woolly mammoths and fantastic ice world? :) Another re-creating pre-human man-apes :) Another re-creating ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in size of book","review":"I have only myself to blame for not reading the specifications about the book closely enough, but, I thought I was ordering a normal hardback version of this book, not a paperback version with a hard cover. That's essentially what it is. The pages are small with very small lettering like a regular size paperback book. A hard cover has been added so it is technically a hardback. I will keep it but am greatly disappointed. I do wish that in the description the seller had pointed out that this is NOT a normal size hardback best seller. That might help to keep another buyer from making the same mistake. Again, I should have read the measurements of the book and not assumed it was a normal, hardback book. Live and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really a Hardback","review":"This is not what I consider to be a Hardcover book.

At the begin this little girl in Costa Rica gets bitten by a raptor and a baby gets its face bitten off by a raptor and a construction worker gets killed by a raptor and then you hear about the hupia. These stories are all told at the very beginning of the book as there own story. It jumps around to much. The best part of the book is the end when they leave the island because Jurassic Park failed to be successful. They learned there lesson for messing with nature and for being stupid enough to pick DNA from frogs that can change their sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO BOMB!!!!","review":"Is REALY GOOD.

I especially enjoyed his, \\"..life will find a way..\\" speech. The plot is a tightly wound ball of string that as you read on begins to unravel until everything and everyone is engulfed in utter chaos. Another of Malcom's enjoyable speeches is on the nature of chaos. A very important work, that should have won a pulitzer.

It's so gripping that you cannot put it down. It's nothing compared to the movie. It's got a much more detailed mathematical, philosophical and scientific explanation to the dinosaurs.However, the parts where the dinosaurs attack could have been more detailed in order to get a better image in the head of the reader.Overall, a great book. I'd recommend it to anyone. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jurassic in the modern age","review":"Not Crichton's best, but still excellent. Crichton tells a story of a park that features genticaly engineered dinosaurs. The experts are called in for a preview, and so are the owner's grandkids.

Overall, this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy The Book - Even If You've Seen the Movie","review":"Being that the movie based on this book is so popular, you probably all already know the plot, but here's a quick description. 'Jurassic Park' is Michael Crichton's story about a rich entrepreneur that figures out how to genetically create dinosaurs from DNA recovered from insects trapped in fossilized sap. His plan is to exploit his dinosaur creations in a themepark/zoo creation. In his haste to start making money as soon as possible, important details are overlooked, and things quickly go haywire.I enjoy the technical detail that Crichton puts in each of his books, especially this one. 'Jurassic Park' is filled with science, drama, and most of all adventure. The addition of child characters and their views of the dinosaurs is an excellent touch. The movie was a good adaptation of the book, but don't skip the book just because you've seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abridged Version - read/listen to the full","review":"I listened to this book as an abridged (I couldn't find unabridged) audio book, so my review may differ from that of other readers.Having seen the Jurassic Park movies multiple times each, I was actually quite surprised how this story seemed to have parts from all of the movies in it. It makes me excited to read/listen to The Lost World next. I read on Wikipedia that Crichton helped to write the screenplay for the Jurassic Park movie, but neither of the sequels.The book is well written with good characters. Like I said, I listened to the abridged version, so I wish it would have gone into more details about some scenes and situations that would have had more detail otherwise. Overall a very good and compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - with a few exceptions!","review":"I liked this book alot - it was hard to put down and was very informative. The plot hooks you, and it's nice to read, AND the characters are likable (especially Malcom!)... however, there are a few lingering questions. 1. Why didn't the verlarsaraptors (spelled wrong, probably) excape the first time? 2. Why was visiting the verlarsaraptor's nest non-dangerous? It appeared added at the end of the book with little explanation and little danger (it would seem to be the most dangerous)!Other than that, a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's best book to date and then some more!!!!","review":"This book was much better than the movie and I would say thatit is a thrilling techno-thriller. It was more graphic than the movieand it was better than any of Crichton's other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exception to the rule","review":"9/10 books I read are better than the movie, but this is one rare case that I believe the opposite. The book is mostly slowed down by the excessive scientific discussions. It's not so much the conversations I don't like; it's when they have them. I also think that the characters make really dumb decisions; a prime example is late in the book, when Grant and the rest escape from the visitor's center and a helicopter is on it's way, they decide to 'check out' the raptor breeding grounds. Can't they wait an hour? Have they not put their lives on the line enough?? Surveying a nest of deadly predators that have been trying to kill me for the last twelve chapters would be the LAST thing I do! If you want excitement, watch Jurassic Park the movie. Or if you prefer reading, Lost World, which is the Jurassic Park sequel, is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"an overrated book. as unbelievable as it may sound, I found it even less entertaining than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

This is the story of the humans, not the dinosaurs, and it's realistic, well thought out and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly exciting book","review":"It was truly a very exciting book. It was exciting and interesting throughout the entire book. I just couldn't put it down. It never seemed to get boring at all. Even when it did it wasn't really boring, it just slowed down a bit to give more information on what was going on. It was always a needed part of the story so it wasn't really boring. It is a book that I would read again and enjoy many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of Jurassic park","review":"Do not think that because you saw the movie you don't need to read the book. The book is better. it has a lot of action and suspense. It is quite long but worth reading. The basic plot is that there is a lot of people with very different backgrounds that are trapped on an island with a bunch of geneticly engineered dinosaurs that want to hurt them. And to top it off the power is out. If you like Sci-Fi thrillers read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie for sure","review":"Ok, you saw the movie and were \\"wow-ed\\" by the animation. The book is so much better! The scenes that never made it to the silver screen are so darn good that if for no other reason they alone would justify reading this book.4 Stars, not 5 ... why? Well, I like self motivated fully developed characters. Mr. Crichton simply puts some characters in the book to fill a single role and then they're gone. Too cookie cutter for me, but then again, the action scenes are out of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This book was totally awsome!","review":"I would have givin it a four and a half star but i didn't know how. People don't want to read this book because they think they know what happens because they saw the movie. I pitty them because the book is filled with totally different conflicts, unlike the movie, it doesn't follow the same plot all the time. I realy enjoy this book so much because it's not just about dinosaurs getting loose on some tropical island, it has so much suspense because just like animals, dinosaurs can be unpredictable. Micheal Crichton really knew what he was talking about when he wrote this book because of the detail, its like your in the middle of it like a 3D movie at Universal! So i DARE you to read this book, you won't regret it, but just don't give up in tne beginning because its like a movie, it has an interview to the plot, then the action starts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I saw the movie first and loved it. I was told to read the book and thought it could not live up to the beauty of the movie. I was wrong - this book is great and one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have been a fan of the movies since they came out and have them memorized. That said, the book read a lot different than the movies, for which I am glad. I knew the book would be different but didn't see a need to read it. Am I glad I did. The typos are throughout, just a little FYI. But all in all, a great book to sit and relax with. I was asked which I liked better, the movie or the book. The movie seemed a bit campy and the book edgier. I have no preference, but am glad I took the time to finally read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Information is what held this book together for me. The information about chaos theory and how that applies. Learning about paleontologist theories being applied to a level of genius. The book kept you interested not for the intense parts or the many lines of detail, but of the amount of information that was strung across the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I have always been a huge fan of the movies and was obviously a little late getting to the book. I was not disappointed by the book at all. Crichton has a great way of building characters and suspense simultaneously without missing a beat. It felt like a completely new story to me and I'm glad to be introduced to his work through this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, So Much Better Then Movie","review":"This book takes off, it is a wonderful fact based fairy tale of sorts. It doesn't even compare to the movie in a good way and I liked the movie. There is so much more to this book, no wonder the original Jurassic Park movie was said to be five hours long. The one scene I really remember not being in the movie, was when the T-Rex chases them down the river when they are in a boat. This is just another one of those books that everyone should pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"great experience","review":"I wasn't sure about buying books online. I was afraid that the descriptions of the books online wouldn't be the same once I received the book. When the book arrive in my house I was thrilled of ordering the book.

I'm very satisfied with my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I ordered this book after my son attempted to purchase it at a local chain bookstore and it wasn't availible.

It mantained a high level of action throughout the whole book and it was very describtive and interesting. The movie was great too, except for the ending. I thought it was very different from the book, and I personally thought the book's ending was much more realistic. I highly recommend that you read Michael Crichton's JURASSIC PARK if you're looking for a page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best exciting book I've ever read!!","review":"This is a MUST read book!!!!! Once you start reading you can't stop. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book even better. This extrodinary novel is about the recovering of dinosaur DNA. These extinct animals are being rediscovered after hundreds of years, and are roaming in Jurassic Park. Something goes wrong when they start breeding themselves..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller and a credit to science fiction","review":"Michael Crichton does what so few science fiction authors have done in this day and age. By taking an age old scientific fact such as cloning, and combining it with a not too far off concept, then backing it up with plausible research, believable characters and a riveting plot, Michael Chrichton has created a masterpiece truly worthy of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"ReallyGood Book","review":"Jrassic Park is a very good book. One of Michael Crichton's best works. This book has a loy of excitment, action, and mystery. The attacks start and Jonh Hammond [the guy who made th park] is trying to cover them up but then he can't anymore because people are finding out. He needs people to come down to the park to give their personal thoughts about it. Donald Gennaro the lawyer comes down to see it. Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcome comes down to the island. I would recondmend this book to someone who likes excitement and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping.","review":"The first time you re4ad this book, you are utterly mystified at the writers, (Michale Chrichton)imagination. Chrichton spins a tale of suprise and mystery, with a dash of evasion and horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Even better than the movie!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Very technical and interesting on every page. A MUST READ for Crichton fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jurassic Park","review":"I read this book about ten years ago. Not too long after I watched the movie for the first time. This is one of those stereotypical books that are so much more enjoyable than the movie. Don't get me wrong the movie was good but this book is a bit more real in the sense that the dinosaurs are portrayed more brutally and in a book you just have time for more character development and situations.All in all this is one of my favorite books and was the first Michael Crichton book I ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action adventure","review":"Crichton seems to have spent some time researching the science of DNA when writing this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"This is a great book. It is far better than the movie. The sequels are okay, but the first one is still the best. Anyone would like this book no matter their age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! This book is GREAT","review":"This book was super - I couldn't put it down. The movie is okay but the book is WONDERFUL!!! Sure, Crichton may have made some factual errors, but who cares!! The book works anyway, and it's GREAT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific...Spellbinding...Another Great What-If Book!","review":"This is a terrific What-if work of fiction. Unfortunately some others like thedoops and MissRaptor listed in the beginning simply miss the point. This is a work of fiction, not something you sit around the table at the library discussing like a doctoral thesis. The premise about the dinosaurs is just that... since no one really knows what the dinosaurs were like or how they acted I found the premise to be very entertaining. If you want true entertainment, read this book. If you want to impress each other, look to the campus archives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I have ever read!","review":"Jurassic Park is the most wonderful book I have ever read. Scary and exciting, a winner! Very descriptive and draws the reader in. A definite page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you'd expect from Crichton!","review":"Exactly what you'd expect from Crichton. If this statement connotes good experiences, then read this book. If not, you'll probably not enjoy it all that much. Perhaps I'm not a pompous med student who wants to point out all the scientific flaws with this book, but hey -- are we really going to read \\"Jurassic Park\\" for research purposes? If you're looking for an exciting read, \\"Jurassic Park\\" is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern parable with surprising depth","review":"Anyone who enjoys books filled with suspense, and has had some past aspirations for working with large, unpredictable animals should definitely read this book. It opens up a world of twisted imagination and offers the reader vivid characters who provide witty and often meaningful dialogue. For those who desire a quick fix of fear, yet also yearn for the powerful characteristics of a masterpiece, Jurassic Park is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it, the movie did NOT do it justice...","review":"I read this book at the age of 12, about two years after it was first published and about a year before it became mainstream. Crichton's impecable tact for detail and action made this quite possibly the best book I have ever read. It is very fast paced (I read it in 1 and 1/2 days, yeah I was 12 too) and VERY hard to put down. The charecters, especially Ian Malcolm, were incredibly designed and MADE the book. Crichton has put out his best book ever, even beating Andromeda Strain. I HIGHLY recomend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most entertaining book by the most entertaining author.","review":"Many people have seen the amazing movie, along with the ever so disappointing sequal, however, I would be willing to bet that now nearly as many have read the marvelous book. First of all, if you liked the movie, the book will become an instant classic to you, and even if you didn't like the movie, you would still enojoy the book. I never enjoyed reading very much, but after reading this book, it changed my view on books. I went out and picked up the sequal (which was also much better than the movie), and several other Crichton books. Basically, Chrichton changed the way I view books. His books were the keys that opened the doors to my brain, and my imagination. This is a great book by a great author, and I advise anyone who has not yet read it to go out and pick up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the movies","review":"This is a good book, but there is a lot of language and the dino attacks are way to graphic for a PG-13 movie. Not just that the book is sometimes kind of boring while the movie is good every single second. However I gave this four stars because i like Michael Crichton and without him the amazing movie wouldn't even exist. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than the movie","review":"Reading this book has made me realize just how much of a bastardization the movie really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I read the book, saw the movie, and thought both were great!

I have read this book, like, four times, and I could never ever ever ever get tired of it! The characters are vivid, the explanations make you feel like it is real, and you feel like you are THERE! Every time you think things can not possibly get any worse than they are, MC just twists the story further! Nothing can be said to match the sheer majesty of this book!! How about a third installment in the JP series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"This is without a doubt one of his best books to date. I first read this book when I was 10 and instently fell in love with it, and have since re-read the book at least 20 times. The book definetly keeps you on your toes and you never want to put it down(belive me I know, my 9th grade german teacher constintly had to tell me to put it away) the book would have gotten a 10 from me if not for the fact that alot of the Dinosaur information is a little off, for example. Velociraptors ar NOT 6 FEET TALL more like 3 the animal that possed such a threat resembles the Utah Raptor. and as for the fact that Dilophosaurs had 'Manes' and could 'Spit' poison has never been proven. and finaly the T-rex can only see movement? I doubt it! T-rex's had excelent vision! but other than a few 'Dino-misprints' the book excells and keeps you woundering 'is he going to die?. can she jump and make it into the pool?' well you'll just ahev to find out.

Stone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Crichton's Best","review":"This book, Jurassic Park, is one of Crichton's best books, if not the best of them all. Basicaly a simple story, man creates dinosaur and then loses control of dinosaur. Runs in the same vein as Frankenstein. Anyways, a really good book, the first time I read it, I finished it in a about a day and a half, I've read it four times since then, the story never gets old and is a thriller every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton just keeps getting better.","review":"I know that Crichton can write great books and this is right up there with his best ones of all time.

Great and very suspenseful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was a great book","review":"i really loved the book. critchton has qiete an imagination.i already read it 2 times. and the 2 book once, but im going to read the second one again.the charactors were the best names and the dinosaurs are really scary . you cant even put the book down. its very dramatic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"So clever, moved so quickly. Agree that characters are indeed \\"stick figures\\" as many critics alleged, but still, dinosaurs alive now - today ... just really, really cool! The fact that it's supported by detailed, realistic science makes it very believable. A lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton is a God","review":"I'm not gonna say the plot because just about everyone has heard about Jurassic Park. All I'm going to say is that as one of the gods of Science Fiction writing, Michael Crichton's books have been remarkable in that they take seemingly improbable situations and convert them into scenarios that are very believable. He does it once again with Jurassic Park. Crichton ingeniously interweaves details of genetic engineering, computer wizardry and current scientific controversy over dinosaurs to fashion an amazing read. In most cases, the book is much better than the movie as there are many, many scenes that didn't make it to the movie. Some being: The Pteradactyl showdown, the compys, Gennaro's hunt with Muldoon, the T-Rex's baby, and much more. There are even characters that died/lived in book that died/lived in the movie! I can't say enough good things about the book so just go out, read it, and be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jurassic Park... Awesome Book","review":"This book is about a paleontologist that goes on a trip to an island that is inhabited by dinosaurs. A number one book that is hard to put down. Much better than its sequal and the movies after it. i love it most of all because it is actually believable, unlike The Lost World: Jurassic Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good hardcover edition","review":"I like the book, but the hard cover edition leaves much to be desired. It is reminiscent of what one might find in an elementary school library. It is smaller than standard hard cover editions of books and the type goes so far into the center binding that often one has to exert too much pressure on the binding to read these words. Though the price may be tempting I would not recommend this hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!!!","review":"coming from a non-reader, this book hooked me into reading. it is much better than the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book itself 5 stars... charging $10 for an 'E' version that cost nearly zero to publish? - 4 stars... means 1 star","review":"Really... $10 Amazon? Greed much? I know the publisher supposedly sets the price but I have grave difficulty believing Mr. Crichton is insisting on charging more for an E version than the actual paperback costs. Call me crazy... or call me 'Not going to spend $10 to buy a 'second' copy to my hardback version'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Crichton","review":"This was the first Michael Crichton book I ever read, and it continues to be one of my favorites. The movie, although good in its Hollywood appeal-to-the-masses way, simply can't compare. The novel is darker and more suspenseful, the characters and backstory are more developed, the moral questions are more obvious, the science is fleshed out more, and my personal favorite, Malcolm's rants on theory, are more numerous and in-depth. There are also a lot more human-dinosaur interactions, which is inevitable considering the expense and technical difficulty of CGI when the movie was made, but those interactions are, in my opinion, the lifeblood of the story. The friendly, appealing baby dinosaurs provide an emotional counterpoint to the dangerous adults, making the ending much more poignant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best.","review":"I have absolutely loved Diane's other books. She brings such a fresh approach to beauty in a nice concise manner. However, I was sadly under the impression that Boot Camp would be as good. I suppose it would be a helpful book if you were, let's say, 14 and just learning. But for those of us who would go for this type of book, all of the information is old news. The journal portion is really kitschy. It is almost as if she had nothing else to write about so she took stuff from her other books, threw it together and added the journal portion in line with the current trend.

The material is clearlywritten and very well organized.The chapters are very short, thankfully,and the best thing is that there arecomplete worked solutions to all thechapter exercises.The book ends with a nice applicationof the theory to molecular vibration.(As always, it helps to know the basicfacts about groups, and linear algebra -vector spaces, linear transformations,matrices etc.)An excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment - waste of money","review":"Could have been a good and slow introduction to the topic. Unfortunately the authors decided to create their own little world by using nonstandard notations, e.g. a function f applied to an object x becomes x.f instead of f(x) and flipping more or less every standard notation we know in mathematics. This happens every now and then in the literature but these guys are taking it to an absurd level.This seemingly harmless choice has major implications:1 - if you already know any math at all, the authors are asking you to re-learn everything to adapt to their choice2 - if you learn from this book you won't be able to read any standard text on the topic without major aggravation or confusionWaste of time and money from my standpoint.

He then relates the 11 mind sets to five pictures of the future and in all but one I think I can 'get it' you might say. I think this is an important work if you want to understand the changing landscape of the future. Well worth the read. Actually the only thing I dont like about the book is the hokey cover, the book jacket is creative but half what they normally are and a real pain to have when you read it. The actual book cover is awful under the jacket ... strange thing to not like but I didnt.

I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon and agree with most of them, so I won't bother repeating what others said well.Here's my advice:Read the table of contents - that's all you need for most of the 11 mindsets.Read the first 3 chapters of part 1.Read the last chapter (ch 5) of part 2.I'm not sure, but perhaps you can skip all that and just read part 2, chapter 5 and you'll have something to really think about.As an educator, I'm fascinated with America's general views on science and religion (especially compared to the rest of the world) and this last chapter, if a good prediction of the future, will make everyone think/rethink about what it means to be human.^^Rob"},{"rating":"2","title":"The future in focus","review":"Wonderful book for those that want to understand where the future is and to help see it coming.

Along the way, the book covers all aspects of plain-English drafting, including audience analysis, writing style, document design, substantive requirements, and testing.The authors also thoroughly discuss methods for implementing plain-English writing in the law; they present the pros and cons of legislating plain English, as well as their own views on subjective versus objective testing of texts.

He plays the neutral role as he allows Don Manuel, the overseer, to keep the slaves working and allows the father to teach them about reaching paradise if they follow their masters here on this earth. Eventually the slaves revolt after he lets 12 of them eat at his table in a recreation of the last supper. He realizes that he gave them too much.

But at your child turns ages 4-5, consider avoiding the obvious names thrust at you and advertised on day time TV, and look into titles from independent children's artists such as Justin Roberts, Joe McDermott and Ralph Covert. These guys (and Gals) are sincere musicians who open up real topics for kids supported by their own musical expertise and influences (check out the awards they have won!)

I put in the cd, and I swear, it was like a miracle, she was quiet the whole time. and she even falls asleep to it. The only drawback, the music gets stuck in your head, but at least you'll have hair.

I decided to buy a CD (to get her away from the tv) and Yummy Yummy is the one I chose (she had not seen this video yet) and she loves it. We listen to it at least three times every day. She was wanting to watch the videos all the time, so the CD helps soothe the trauma we go through for not being able to watch the video. We dance together and sing the songs.

One could probably classify this album in the same genre as Portishead and Frou Frou, with that whole \\"trippy\\" and mellow sound. However, those bands are more memorable than Kate's music here, and she often tries a little too hard to sound like Imogen Heap. I think Kate definitely has a lot of potential, and this is a solid effort, but she'll need to distinguish herself more from the pack in the future.Standout tracks are \\"Not Fair\\" and \\"Kaleidoscope,\\" songs that will stick in your head a long time after you've heard this album.

But you won't find it in this book. What you will get is a personal reconciliation of his Christianity. Not that that's bad--but it is not how the book is represented. A fundamental problem with this book is one that bedevils (so to speak) many works by authors who write on subjects outside of their field of expertise. Pearce is a theologian (apparently). He is not a physician, physiologist, biologist, or anthropologist--and this really shows when he writes about those subjects. The theology is OK. The physiology is ho-hum--the same any intro course would give--except that he strays into details that are unfounded or absurd. As for the anthropology--whew! where does he get this stuff? Ancient cities from 20,000 years ago?! Early Americans that were 7 ft tall?!!

Through a new discipline of neurocardiology, it is being shown that we have another center of consciousness in our hearts that has a dynamic relationship with our brains, creating true intelligence and wisdom. There has never been a time in our history more crucial for a conscious transcendence than now while we are in our technological adolescence.

In all fairness, the book is at least politically balanced: It brandishes the liberal idea of the noble savage and the paradisical state of the pre-patriarchal societies, but at the same time echoes the lament of conservatives through the ages: That young people today are greatly inferior, intellectually and emotionally, to their ancestors. Never mind that all of these views are contrary to any coherent scientific worldview.The book is recommended in so far as it makes a good case for spending quality time with babies and children, and there is some realistic science related to brain development in that part.

He embroidered his great defeat on his girdle and people made assumptions that it was seven men, not flies. Throughout the story, Bob used his intellect and great use of trickery to receive half of unknown land and the always beautiful princess.This is an awesome book for children to read. It could teach them that they don't have to be poor all of their lives. Yes, kids won't get the chance to trick a unicorn, a wild boar, and 3 dumb giants to get rich, but this story explains that using the ole noggin can get you places, just like Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does anyone have the track of How Great Thou Art?","review":"Does anyone know where I could obtain the sound track for the How Great Thou Art that Sandi Patti used in this recording.

This is one of them.With SABU collaborators Shin'ichi Tsutsumi and Susumu Terajima (who I already was a fan of and became even more so - this guy's a great performer!) in the cast, it's a great story with humor, action, and a pinch of insanity.

That'd be too easy (and less fun)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Shoe for Problem Feet","review":"Here we have what must be an old clique - the letter carrier with problem feet. I've had weak ankles and rather serious pronation for years. Physical therapists recommended the Brooks Beast and it works for me - very well. Great arch and ankle support. As for price, I compared and this time Amazon was the best. I buy two pair at a time so I can alternate shoes every day in the hope of extending their life in the rather stressful conditions I put them through. A good bet all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD FOR RUNNING","review":"I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes. Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself. I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation. As I first started running in them they seemed fine, but with each training run they became more uncomfortable. By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile. I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain. I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks. People who walk in these shoes seem to love them, runners seem far less taken with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Running shoe Ever.","review":"I went through every brand of running shoes . I am tall and have a large frame and I tend to go through running shoes rather quickly. When I discovered Brooks about 4 years ago it was Heaven sent.

They suppport my whole foot and I have not lost any toenails as with others. I now run for fitness and not races. These shoes last me about 6 months. So if you are in searching mode I HIGHLY recommend these shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooks Beast Running Shoe","review":"It's a quality shoe but maybe not as supportive as the previous models.

It's a challenging film which is perhaps why few people know about it. (Most people know Blatty for writing the book \\"The Exorcist\\") Being a VHS tape, one expects little bells and whistles on this product, which is the only reason this movie did not rate the 5 stars. I look forward to seeing this product released on DVD, hopefully with commentary by director and the major stars. I like this movie so much that I will not be upset for having to buy it both on VHS and DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE SEEN CLASSIC","review":"Blatty's musings on God, life , death, faith and the inhumanties of man is an absolute knockout. The premise is doozy- the US military keeps all it's high profile nutcases (Colonels, Astronauts etc who've lost it )in a secluded high security looney bin. The new warden (Stacy Keach) soon proves he's maybe crazier than all of them and might even be a notorious homicidal maniac.The acting is sensational, Keach is great as the coiled, barely keeping his demons at bay Col Kane, and Scott Wilson is Oscar calibre as the sensitive, burned out Astronaut. His verbal jousts with Keach are wonderful to behold. Also memorable is the terrifically imposing Steve Sandor, as a glowering, nightmare biker.They were no doubt fired up by Blatty's brilliant script that pulsates with huge concepts, tremendous humour and some of the best dialogue ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star movie ....0 star DVD...equals 2 1/2 star rating.","review":"I love this movie...and have been anxious to receive the DVD.....and was amazed to see it was coming out with a director commentary, deleted scenes and alternate ending!This is all too much to believe for a fan and the bad news is as follows: The commentary is great, the featurette is fine , although it was widescreen and is cropped for full frame thus chopping off copy and on and on..but the worst news of all?

It was bad within five minutes and I really tried to give it a chance, but the only thing profound about this stinker is how profoundly bad it really is. Boring, turgid, and ridiculous.

That anyone could enjoy this film is mindboggling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, beautiful, comical, and unseen gem of cinema","review":"William Peter Blatty made an incredible and unique piece of cinema with this film. This was Blatty's first picture as a director and it's much more personal and accomplished than other directors' first works. Usually first works are good and show great promise, but seeing this you'd think that Blatty must've been directing atleast twenty years before. The story is incredibly personal and thought provoking. I was jaw dropped through quite a bit of the movie, especially at the scene in the bar with Keach and the biker gang, but really all of it. Who knows were Blatty got the story, because it's so unsual and so,completely original because there really is nothing else like this picture. This should be shown more. To me this deserves a better place in cinema and probably DVD. Like Ken Russell's The Devils. See it if you haven't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy and full of suspense . . . .

I would recommend this film to anyone truly interested in a fine movie going experience. Also see 'The Exorcist 3' by Blatty, featuring Flanders and Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"As another Blatty character once said, this man is a poem.","review":"William Peter Blatty must surely be the most underappreciated artist of our time. The Ninth Configuration is a punch in the gut to the reductionist, cynical world. This is crystalized in the moment when Scott Wilson's character considers the relative madness of Hamlet - truly, if he was crazy, or if the more extreme madness of all those around him made him seem to be.In that hope, is our own. And if Killer Kane is worthy of salvation, perhaps we all are. What a beautiful, lyrical, important film.

Next was the cooking method: a water bath in the oven (baking pan inside a pan of water) is a little complicated for a box brownie. Third is how it comes out of the oven: greasy and flat, about a half inch tall, and it separates into a mealy, bready layer above and a slab of greasy goo below. It's a complete mess to get out of the pan. Plus it tasted lame - it ranks among the worse sugarless chocolate flavors out there.Finally, the very high amount of sugar alcohols means that if you have a sensitivity to the stuff, you will definitely react to this! I had one brownie and my body's reaction was violent, painful and disgusting.There was not one positive thing about this mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing Box Brownies Ever = skip the impulse 2 Buy","review":"While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets, this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment. The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter (read Unhealthy), then requires cooking in a water bath (dish within a dish of water), requires glass square dishes, and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust. The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying, being thin like the height of bread, poorly textured, and poor mouth feel product. I can't say too little about this product, except that this product makes one savor and fully appreciate the genius and deliciousness of Ghiradeli and Betty Crocker box brownies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very edible, better than any recipe off the net","review":"Took a chance and glad I did. I have tried several recipes off of the net, and they all left me wanting. These did the trick; these brownies were a hit at our house. Easy to fix, the hardest part was waiting for them to cool.

I wish I'd read the truth, the naked truth, the unvarnished and ugly truth:1 Brownie - strange tummy rumbles. Sounds like thunder. Caution, you want to be near the plumbing fixtures.2 Brownies - Thunder, plus the most unexpected gastro warnings. Think a high wind on the Sahara. You might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom. Start practicing your prayers.3 Brownies - You should just make your bed in the bathtub. You'll be there all night.More than 3 Brownies: The refrain: \\"Dear God in heaven\\" is heard echoing against the porcelain."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY wanted to love these!","review":"I agree with all the other reviewers who say these are just like \\"regular\\" brownies, with a rich chocolately flavor and great texture.

It's not just me, it happened to my entire family, my husband, and both boys, teenagers. Not pretty. I don't think it was the sugar alcohol that caused the problem, but what was it? Who knows?

I ordered this product and was very happy with the brownies. They do come out of the oven with 2 layers to them - a crunchier top layer and the gooier lower layer. After a couple of days, the layers are not as obvious. These were a big hit with our kids as well - and they aren't anything if not honest. The portion is smaller than most people would normally cut for a brownie - but after being on a low-carb diet for a while, you are happy with the portion size.

In this concert, he just sings, acts tough and sexy, and dances around the stage. I would have enjoyed it more if he was playing a synth, along with his band.Again, it was a very good quality and entertaining concert. All of his songs had a lot of energy!

It was probably due to the scene where the bed crashes down. It is one of the films of the young Depardieu in couple with Isabelle Huppert and with an excellent Maurice Pialat directing it. In reality nothing really important happens, but the love scenes are nice. Depardieu plays a young guy who is rather happy without being fixed up in regular work and Isabelle Hupper leaves her husband to stay with him. She earns their living and also decides to abort, since Depardieu only wants to work after the birth of the child. This is also the sad fact about the movie that in reality does not have an end.

If you think your getting an action flick or even a good movie; think twice. The cover completely fools you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woweee...what a nice frisbee I have","review":"Dispicable...truly NOT funny, truly VERY annoying. I hated seeing it in my apartment so bad that I had to do the next best thing....put it in a waffle maker, then the toaser, then the oven, then douse it in lighter fluid and light. That was the most exciting part of the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the all-time worst","review":"I hate anime comedy. I'm not going in to any detail with this DVD, because it sucks. Final Criticism: Story line - Sucks/ Animation- Okay/ Overall - Don't bother, don't even consider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this DVD!!","review":"My friend bought this DVD for me for Christmas and I LOVE it. I am a HUGE fan of the Trigun series. It has a wonderful storyline and very developed characters. The series has comedy, action, romance, horror, and suspense. I am a very satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice anime romp","review":"Vash the Stampede is the most infamous outlaw on the planet Gunsmoke and with a 60 billion double dollar price on his head the most sought after!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Western","review":"This is a well-animated manga series starter. You have to love the comedy action filled sequences, as Vash the Stampede/Destroyer starts his quest. Two insurance agents, Meryl and Millie, are out to prevent further destruction and insurance losses. As they go about handing out doughnuts, they keep running into this goofy guy who answer to Vash. This can't be the evil destroyer that they are trying to stop. Well worth watching and adding to any Japanese anime collection. For us parents, there are no sex scenes only mild language issues to worry about. Now I can't wait to see the rest of the series. I understand it progresses from the opening silliness to probing the depths of some fascinating philosophical questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"Many people who try this anime say they are surprised but pleased with the light tone. Most expected just action and blood. Let me tell you, the creators made it just right. The earlier episodes alternate between action and amusement and keep you guessing for awhile.However, be warned that there is far more to it than that. As the series progresses, more ideas and conflicts about morals will come up, and more people will be hurt. But just when things might get quite heavy, there is always some humor; however it is never garish and strikes just the right note.This is an excellent anime which is actually about something... definitely watch it if you ever wonder about the morality of taking a life to save others--or about war--or crime--or guns--or really anything involving people being hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMFG!","review":"This is the coolest anime in the whole world with Lain, Magic Knights Rayearth, and such.I thought this plot was so awesome! A comical westurn with a bounty upon this IDIOT'S head. ^^ I quite enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TLC is back!","review":"Hi, I think this is a really awesome CD except for one thing.. The music and the harmony of the girls' voices is great and all, but I don't think there is a good message at all from the lyrics. That is why I gave four stars instead of five. Aside from that, this is a great CD!! All three members of TLC are very talented and have made a CD worth listening to! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FanMail is an excellent album! Everyone needs to own it!","review":"FanMail is a masterpiece! It is better than their previous release 5 years ago, CrazySexyCool. The Japanese import with the bonus track \\"U In Me\\" is positively the best version of this album, the song \\"U In Me\\" is great, It reminds me of \\"Silly Ho\\", with T-Boz's deep sexy voice & bass beats. And once again, FanMail is a masterpiece right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"{T}otally {L}ousy {C}rap","review":"That describes this much-anticipated follow-up to TLC's 1994 smash, \\"Crazysexycool.\\" Unfortunately, too much hype and such high expectations might have been what killed this album. For one, the style here is soooo much different than their previous (more enjoyable) albums... I wouldn't call this album hip-hip but rather scratchy, robotic, flashy techno album that lacks substance. The usual charm of their light, sensual R&B grooves are gone. Now there's \\"hardcore\\" garbage like \\"I'm Good At Being Bad\\" or \\"Silly Ho.\\" It's pathetic how they try to drift in with the new fads. \\"No Scrubs\\" and \\"Unpretty,\\" which by coincidence are also the only singles so far, are the best songs. Track #8, the ballad \\"I Miss You Much\\" is okay, but the rest is just horrible filler. I can't for the sake of me understand what TLC was thinking and doing, but regardless of this stinker, I still love them and admire their other music. If you want their true talent, pick up \\"Crazysexycool.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No Scrubs is exactly the bases I wanna keep with you k?","review":"The album only has one good but still played out song \\" NO Scrubs\\", its sooooo played out that even TLC gets annoyed of it now. I didn't really hear the rest since they were are edited. I was trying not to explode while listen to their music because of the pitch of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I EXPECTED MORE","review":"I expected more out of this group. There are only 2 good songs on the cd. And everyone who gave this 5 stars is just jumping on the band wagon. I admit that \\"No Scrubs\\" is the bomb, but what's up with the video it has absoultly nothing to do with the song. But you got to give it them for for putting out this garbadge cd and going platinum, because they are getting paid, remember this is the group that went bankrupt. And the least they could do was put out a quality cd worth the money, since they are getting paid by there fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album disapponted me truly.","review":"TLC is well known for recording good music. In this case, I would have to disagree. Not only was it bad production, but bad vocals. The girls could have put more of an effort into their vocals. If this is for their fans, I don't think they are showing it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a piece of garbage!","review":"I hate to diss TLC like this because I do think that in all they are good. However, their new cd fanmail is definately worth your money! There are only a few good songs and after a while No Scrubs gets annoying, and it's the only really good song in the album. Listen to this review and go get yourself another cd... as for this one... LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible!","review":"I bought this CD recently for a very high price at a nearby store because I thought I would like it since it had Scrub and Unpretty on it ( I like both of these.) When I got it home and played it I realized how dirty and unpleasant this is! Now I can't find the reciept and I'm stuck with a cd I don't even like and spent half of my birthday money on. I guess you would like it if you like rap though. This has about four good songs on it and the rest are sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent!","review":"It's a shame that no sense music sales. TLC is just a case of pretty faces. They have no true talent, just a good personal trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get A Grip!","review":"After perusing a large lot of these so-called \\"reviews\\", one thing is very evident: the bulk of you could use a remedial english class.

This is all studio/ producer fluff. It's want the audenince wants to hear and not what they need to here. THe lyrics tackle complex problems in the simplistic top forty way so it can help build up the girls egos and alreayd to large pay check . The songs egotiscial lyrics and over blown pretneouis are deadly. It also helps to make the girls look more ingnorant than they already are . These girls better stop spouting neursy ryhmes like lyrics and find something else to sing about than crone about how awfull it is to think your grate have everyone love and then still compalin,"},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to buy this CD!","review":"This is the a great album. It's one of those that you can listen to it over and over and it still is good. I honestly can not think of a bad song on this album! They are all good! Of course I think they could have done without some of those curse words in \\"I'm good at being bad\\", but it's still a good song. If you liked TLC's album \\"Crazy, Sexy, Cool\\" you have to get this! I think it was well worth my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It focused mainly on older women not the average teenager","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love the whole CD, but I don't think it pretains to a teenager my age because i'm only 14. So like in the song no scrub most guys I can date don't have a car, or a job and all off them live with their parents, so that is why I said it pretains to older females. The CD is still slamming though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Them my GYRLS, all of their albums are straight !","review":"TLC, portray how some friends should be, everyone of their songs is like something they have experience. I like them because they are not rapping nasty, or negative Lyrics. They seem to be down to earth, I would not knock them if they were not my favorite, but I hope they keep up the good work, and I pray they NEVER split up, good female groups are so hard to find, We all Know it's alot out there trying to copy Yall NOT! that is M'Possible.

A few of the songs seem to have a lot of feeling in them, like \\"Unpretty\\". The rest are the type that you can tap your feet to or sing along with. This album definately has explicit lyrics, but there is an edited version of the CD if that's not quite your thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Wow! I was really impressed! I brought this cd because I liked \\"No Scrubs\\" and I LOVED \\"Unpretty.\\" What I love most about this cd is the variety of songs. From beautiful, and slow ballads like \\"Dear Lie\\" and \\"I Miss you So much\\" to edgy and sharper tunes like \\"I'm Good at Being Bad\\" and \\"Shout,\\" TLC really puts all emotion into it. As for the \\"explicit content,\\" if you're not offended by somewhat graphic sexual terms and descriptions, then you can ignore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TLC cd is the Bomb, so get up and by the cd.","review":"If you dont by the TLC cd then you dont got any good music in your house.

This is the GR8EST cd on the face of this planet. I bought it the first day it came out, and have been listening to it for EVERY single day for 1 and 1/2 years now. Every single track on this cd is great in its own individual way. Each song is just as creative and well written/sang as the next. This is definetly TLC's best cd yet, and I can't wait to hear new stuff from them! Definetly BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i like noscrubs its my favorite song and album","review":"for those of you who think no scrubs is stupid yall have problems cause my girls can sing really good"},{"rating":"2","title":"TLC is the best!!","review":"I love this album so much. I have always thought that TLC is the best female group there ever was, and this album proves it. I love every single song on this cd. I especially love the title track and I think that it is a wonderful way to open up the album. When It's been 7 years since LeftEye died and I honestly still can't believe it. She was so young and talented and she had so much left to give the world. At least she is in a better place now and her sisters T-Boz and Chilli will continue to carry on her name."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect conclusion to the 1990's","review":"alas the decade of good r&b/hip hop music had come to an end. Fanmail, Destiny's Child Writings on the Wall and Mariah Carey's Rainbow were all over the charts in 1999 and made you crave more from these artists in the future. Get this album. It may be a little more overproduced than crazysexycool, but the music is creative and innovative for its time, and no scrubs was hands down the jam of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of their best work!","review":"I love this album. All the tracks are worth listening to. This is the kind of album that you can listen to all the way through without any complaints. Sure, some of the songs might not be your favorite, but you can't deny that this album is worth listening to and you can't deny that you can listen to this badboy all the way through without making any awful remarks about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tboz,Chili and Left eye are back and taking no prisoners!","review":"I've heard the single ,'no scrubs' several times and I thinks it jams.

Well, this isn't one of 'em! This album is a soulful pleasure from the start of the title track to the groove of \\"Don't Pull Out On Me Yet.\\" My fave songs on this album are \\"I Miss You So Much,\\" \\"No Scrubs,\\" and \\"Unpretty.\\" I really like the way \\"Unpretty\\" goes out to the ladies who are insecure of themselves and their beauty. This CD is definitely a must have for your rack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-round all-fun!","review":"TLC does a great job on this CD. The beat really picks me up and is awesome to dance to!

I loved the album! The songs were taking a more futuristic step into music. The only problem I had with the album was constant some-what annoying interludes (Especially compared to the interludes of there sophomore album \\"CrazySexyCool\\", in which interludes were prominent and even really good stand-out tracks, and fun to listen to)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am SO disappointed with this....","review":"........................................................this...insult to TLC!

Here, TLC masters dance hall anthems such as \\"No Scrubs,\\" \\"Silly Ho,\\" & \\"I'm Good At Being Bad\\" and satisfying personal ballads like \\"Unpretty\\" & \\"I Miss You So Much.\\" Aided with Dallas Austin's strong songwriting, TLC once again makes hot music for the 1990s."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD if you like TLC and pop/hip hop style","review":"I think everyone should get this CD. The song \\"No Scrubs\\" is OFF THA HOOK!!!!!!!!! There are a lot of other good songs like \\"Fan Mail\\" and \\"Silly Ho.\\" The only problem is the cussing. TLC does not need to curse to make the CD good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GLAD TLC'S BACK!!!!","review":"i thought this cd was good!my fave song are \\"silly hoe\\" and \\"no scrubs\\"You'll really enjoy this cd!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"This is one of the most sorry cd's I have bought this year.

Their voices are just as beautiful as ever! The highlights of this cd are No Scrubs, Unpretty, Lovesick, Silly Ho, Shout, My Life, and If They Knew"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO'S A SCRUB NOW? Fanmail - A Major Disappointment","review":"After two hot albums from T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli and over ten million album sales, the third album from TLC was destined to be a classic. Right? Sorry scrubs, try again. This album has FIVE really good songs out of about 14. Silly Ho, No Scrubs, Miss You So Much, Unpretty, and Track#6. So why did I only give the album two stars? Because the rest of the album is at best mediocre. The songs are either lackluster or very repetitive. The production on much of the album is weak like Canibus' first joint. The album tries gain appeal by hving a futuristic theme, but it simply doesn't work. The 'futuristic' sound may be popular 10 or 20 years from now, but today it's simply not good enough. I just hope this disappointing album doesn't spell the end of the line for such a talented trio. But reality is, these women need to rush back to the studio before it's too late to save their once high-flying careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off Da Hook","review":"This album expresses TLC's growth from kiddie wanna be rappers to real experienced performers and artists. I love the way they used FAT beats to convey the dope lyrics. It's about time a female group combines real R&B soul laced w/ hip hop flava."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit!!","review":"This CD is amazing. It offers up a mix of TLC's best sounds, and I'm sure everyone has heard their most recent single \\"No Scrubs.\\" A must buy, whether you're a fan or a first time listener!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my precious time.","review":"I strongly dislike the song, \\"No Scrubs\\" by TLC. It makes the people from generation x seem like they are shallow and materialistic. Also the song is too repetative and they could have put a little more time into writing it. A 13 year- old could've written a better song than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"TLC is AWFUL!!!","review":"every time i hear tlc, they get worse and worse and this album is no exception. i suggest thatr they go away again and make this their final album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"You've really got to be kidding.

I wouldn't recommend it - if you want to hear TLC at their best, buy Crazy Sexy Cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a class CD","review":"I thought this album rocked it had all different types of music including rap,soul and pop, I would advise getting this album if thats the sort of music u listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!!!","review":"i love this cd.my favorite songs are No Scurbs and Unpretty.If you liked TLCs other cds youll love this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY KNEW WHAT THEY HAD TO DO!!","review":"TLC went into this project with high expectations giving their fans glorification for their great success.

Anyway, my boyz the sporty thieves are representin' for the fellas with there new joint \\"NO PIEGONS\\"! I love this song. I know some women who would fit right into that catagory.

I don't know why this is the case (and, no, it is not that I purchased the edited version by mistake ... the rap is not included on the regular, unedited CD.) For those of us who hate the sound of the chorus running on and on and on when we should be hearing the rap segments (and Left Eye's Flavor Flav back-up to the rest of the song), heavily marketing the rap version and then sticking the lite version onto a CD I shell out good money for is a god**** joke. I personally will not buy another TLC album ... this is absolutely a ploy to get people to fork over more money for the single.

Great Opening.Silly Ho- Very humorous with T Boz on leads. Especially the line, I never been a silly bitch.No Scrubs- coolest song but Left Eye's Rap is way better than the album mix.I'm Good At Being Bad- Starts out as a love song until with a rap leads. Left eye's contribution is very aggressive.If They Knew- least favoriteMiss You- Soulful track with the girls harmonizing.Unpretty- Very empoweringIt's My Life and Shout- great songsOverall the album Rocks.RIP Left Eye"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I'm sorry to say this, but TLC really let themselves down with this one. There is hardly any Left Eye, and most of the songs are just some standard R&B garbage (not to say I don't like some standard R&B garbage, but I'm expecting something a little different from TLC). It's nice that Chilli had some more lead singing, but most of the songs it seemed like hardly anyone from the group was there except the lead one singing. Basically, this CD is boring. That's the basic thing. Yes, No Scrubs and Unpretty are good, but really that's about all. Some, like Come On Down, are sort of pretty to listen to for a while, but they are not enough to hold the whole thing up. TLC's first two albums were awesome, and I can't help but agree with Left Eye's disagreements with the group. They started out great, so wwhy did they want to regress to mediocre? They don't even sound like a group anymore on this CD. I hope they get it together better next time. Well, that's it for this diatribe.

I bought the damn thing hoping it was worth my hard earned money, I'm sad to say it was'nt worth one red cent of my money. The women of TLC go around dissing everyone's project when they should diss their own. I can only stand to listen to two tracks... \\"No Scrubs\\" and \\"Unpretty\\" and this is only because a friend played them for me over and over until they grew on me.

Keep up the good work TLC!!! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"the girls are back and just as hot as ever","review":"as you probably now T-boz, Left Eye, and Chilli are back!!!! there super mega hit \\"no scrubs\\" has ruled the charts and is the first offical song off the album. Chilli lifts her voice on such tracks as \\"no scrubs\\", \\"i miss you so much\\" \\"come on down\\" and her phat duet with T-boz \\"don't back out on me yet\\". T-Boz makes huge hits out of her solos \\"silly ho\\", \\"dear lie\\", and her hit featuring chilli \\"unpretty\\". Left eye shines bright as a superb female rapper on tracks such as \\"i'm good at being bad\\", \\"if they knew\\", \\"my life\\", \\"shout\\" and the \\"no scrubs\\" (REMIX). the no scrubs with an extra rap verse by Left eye is the remix and DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE ALBUM!!!!! also about the explicit lyrics is so phoney in dear lie T-Boz says \\"instead i'm f**ked\\" and that is pretty much the only song with explicit lyrics besided \\"i'm good at being bad\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It is DA BOMB!!!!","review":"I just got this CD yesterday and it has already impressed me. I especially like \\"Silly Ho.\\" Fanmail has a little bit for everyone. A little rap, singing, r&b, and a great beat put together this smash alblum. In my opinion, TLC has done it again! My praises to the girlz. Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hot album","review":"I didn't buy this CD yet, but I am going to Tomorrow.

Its awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT CD!","review":"I bought this CD mainly for \\"No Scrubs\\" but that is not the only fantastic song on here. Though some songs are better than others, I never skip over any of the tracks, because there are no bad ones; at worst they're easy listening. This has remained one of my favorite CD's, as I never get tired of listening to it! My favorite tracks are \\"Silly Ho\\", \\"No Scrubs\\", \\"I'm Good at Being Bad\\", and \\"Unpretty\\" but they're all exceptional. TLC is exceptional. So I say if you buy this CD, you won't regret it and TLC, rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I just think that No Scrubs and Unpretty are good on this CD. I'm not saying this is a bad CD but those are the only two I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth the hologram in the cover","review":"I was just taking a look at some of the reviews people have been giving this album and I thought it would be important to let you know that there's some serious opposition out there. I was a die-hard TLC fan since their first album and I stuck with them even through their condom fashion stage. I was extremely impressed with the production, lyrics, and thought that was put into the second album, Crazy, Sexy, Cool, but I'm sorry to say that Fan Mail is seriously disappointing. The lyrics suck, the interludes are utterly cheesball and were put there just so the album appears to have more tracks, and the only good songs, Silly Hoe and No Scrubs play so much on that radio and in clubs that you're sick of hearing them by the time you pop in the cd. Sorry TLC, but if I could take back your new album for a refund I would. Borrow this one from someone if you're a hardcore TLC fan, then think about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry,but this cd is a huge disappointment........","review":"I've heard all of the songs on Ooooohh...On the TLC Tip, their first album, which was excellent. Then came CrazySexyCool, a great follow-up. And now,this.... Is it the swearing? No,it's not the swearing... Some people are shocked and appalled to hear such a \\"fine music group\\" swear. I ,personally, don't care about the swearing as much as i care about the bad music... Yes,this is bad music,very bad music indeed. What happened to songs like \\"Baby,Baby,Baby\\",\\"Creep\\", \\"Case of the Fake People\\", \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"Shock Dat Monkey?\\" No one really knows. Well,I do. They've been replaced by trashy tracks such as \\"No Scrubs\\" and \\"Silly Ho\\" This CD is a huge waste of money. The only worthwhile tune here on \\"Fanmail\\" is the meaningful \\"Unpretty\\", possibly the only reason why I gave this horrible CD two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay......","review":"\\"Fanmail\\"..I still listen to to somewhat......But the cd is \\"stale\\"....I like how group member Rozanda Thaomas is more \\"stunning\\" amd gets some more of the spotlight, but poor tracks like \\"Dear Lie\\", \\"No Scrubs\\" and \\"My Life\\" who would have stop they where a gropu thats been arounf FOREVER....also where is Ms Lopes...shes nowheere throughout............."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACTUALLY - A ZERO STAR RATING","review":"\\"Silly Ho\\" Wow, now that's a deep subject! Does this MTV featured trio have any brains? They're definitely wealthy. It amazes me how the rap industry and MTV (Viacom) has brainwashed America into thinking that rap or a good video is music. TLC is definitely not music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-played throwaway $#&*^#@*@#!!(junk)","review":"This album has no worth. TLC's second album was pretty appealing to me, yet the first was just a bunch of clutter and junk moving around over vocals. So this was TLC's chance to prove what they're really made of. Okay, I'll admit \\"No Scrubs\\" was a good track, but after seeing the video a bazillion times and remembering all the video posterings it was played so much, it lost flavor. I can't stand hearing this commercialized synthesizer-dominated I liked \\"No Scrubs\\" before the video came out. Back then no one even knew what the hell a scrub was. Compared to their last album, this is terrible(it is compared to anything, really), but I can't believe after CrazySexyCool that they would put out this junk. Sorry TLC(and fans), but the only reason this is popular is because of the \\"scrub hype\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is TLC's best work yet.","review":"I have always been a TLC fan, but after buying Fan Mail, I really saw their talent. It is a fresh, new album with well-written lyrics and a good beat.

I couln't have spent my money on anything better! I give it 2 thumbs up also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanmail is TLC's way back to stardom.","review":"Fanmail is TLC's way back to stardom. Their new hit single, \\"No Scrubs\\" is a good example of why. It's fresh, cool, and they even have a new dance for it. I also know their next coming single, \\"Pretty\\" is also good, but the one thing that I think is not good about TLC is their attitude in some of the songs. They sound conceeded and full of themselves. Other than that, Fanmail is awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS C.D IS THE BOMB!!","review":"I think that their album Fanmail was much better than Crazy Sexy Cool. It has a lot of good lyrics and my favorite song from the cd is No Scrubs.

I would suggest that ought to be a little less \\"feminist\\" and talk about their personal emotions a little more. But their drive and enthuastism are the saving graces for this album which are rather impressive by all means in fact. The sarcasm is rather interesting but slightly off-putting especially in \\"No Scrubs\\" which has a fabulous beat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"TLC doesn't need any TLC after this CD","review":"TLC definitely hit a bulls-eye with this album. With great hooks and lyrics, I love listening to it. The best, stand-out tracks are \\"Unpretty,\\" \\"Dear Lie,\\" and \\"No Scrubs.\\" At least, they are in my personal opinion (of course, in the video for \\"Unpretty,\\" I could've gone without the footage of the silicon implant being removed from the girl's...anatomy). Anyway, this CD has been out for a while and I guess I'm reviewing it a little bit late, so I guess you can decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Late Descovery","review":"I have never really been a fan of TLC, but when their songs would come on the radio I would sing along. I have had DEar Lie stuck in my head for ages and couldnt get rid of it so I decided to buy the album and i only wish that i had bought it earlier. The album contains the hits Dear Lie, No Scrubs and Unpretty. The album also contains great tracks like Silly Ho and Come On Down. I know finally know what all of the fuss was about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody needs a little TLC","review":"This album has definately surpassed CrazySexyCool. What can i say TLC rock. I just wish they would tour the UK so i could actually get to see them live. Mariah Carey needs to stop wailing and let the real divas through, at least they've got a powerful message. Equality for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This album is boring and the worst album tlc have ever released. I expect better work on an album especially the thrid one. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd one is also successful.","review":"I think TLC's 3rd album's successful like debuts&second.The reason of success are their fame&effective advertisment.Maybe only one thing that it's new one after a long time, can make this popular.And altough this CD has a few songs can be hit singles, \\"no scrubs\\"&\\"silly hoe\\" maked this successful. Shortly the whole impression is good but there is no speciall song except \\"no scrubs\\" And their ballad songs are bored even it's new trial(MY PERSONAL OPINION) 'Cause \\"CrazySexyCool\\" was great, i little disapointed. But this one also good totaly And i find one thing . Lefteye's rapping is very good!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I like TLC, but the albums was not all that I Just like two songs on there. They could done better then this.

THis is one of the greatest peices of their work yet. \\"No scrubs\\" is the best song. So ya'll that are wondering whether to get it: Don't wonder go for it. Its DEFINETLY NOT a watse of dough! $$Its worth. I love it!! YAAAAHH *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGET WHAT YOU HEARD!!!","review":"If anyone tells you that this cd is not the bomb, forget them!!! TLC has come back harder than ever. Every cut on the CD is worth playing but the best by far is \\"I'M GOOD AT BEING BAD\\", it's the women's anthem for '99. It'll probably never be a single so you have to buy the CD to hear it.Much love to T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli... Next year's grammys belong to them!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS DA BOMB!","review":"To those that said that this album ain't good....i guess you guys aren't really R&B listeners.

I have always loved TLC, I wish them the best with their next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning - hoorah for the domestic sublime","review":"Susan Stinson has written yet another lyrical piece of literature that deals with the sublime in everyday life. Her protagonist, Carline, responds to an an act of mundane and profoundly disturbing bigotry by hopping on a south bound bus. The domestic, courageous, deliciously flawed, Carline is a trip in herself. And she leads us to a cast of equally interesting characters in a story stiched with elegant care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Kitty Unbrella","review":"This is a very pretty umbrella, so girlie! It does not fold up or collapse into a smaller size like a Totes umbrella. It folds down nicely enough but is still long and old-fashioned like. It opens up fairly big - just right for a 5 year old girl to carry and keep dry under in a rainstorm. We haven't yet gotten to try it out in the rain, but the quality of the fabric is pretty good, and I doubt the colors will bleed when wet. If it does I will certainly update this review. I think it's worth what we paid for it and my 5 year old was really very happy Santa had left it for her under the tree. It was the first thing she went for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet tour-de-force","review":"This movie simply perfect as an indie-style odyssey that first seems to have only a surface meaning but then delves into more complex human emotions. Each stage in the couple's journey is slightly like a different lesson, but they really knit together to form one woven view of life--American life, perhaps, but of the life and joys and issues and sadness people face every day in their lives and families. From the zany to the touching and the heartfelt, Away We Go is more about a couple searching around for a place/support system to have their baby. It's an unflinching, completely honest, exploration and examination of the roads in life, and the roads that lead us home.I didn't want to give away any specifics, really, but this movie is absolutely excellent. It's in the same realm as Garden State. I think it's a perfectly made, quiet, unassuming and yet/therefore powerful odyssey that really, in the end, tells us something about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but tedious","review":"The story of two people on a journey to find their home is poignant and familiar to most of us - we've all looked for a home at one time. The lead characters give viewers an interesting take on this search, but the remaining ones are exaggerated and uninteresting stereotypes (far-out college professor, loud-mouth redneck, etc.) who contribute nothing original to the story. Overall the movie is just tedious and I found myself hoping that it would end sooner rather than later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Condition","review":"This DVD was in very good condition. I absolutely love this movie. It was hilarious and had a great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it just in time","review":"I received this movie just in time for Christmas to take to another state with me. The movie is in good condition and I have not heard from the gift recipient about any issues. I have seen this movie before and I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful take on a couple trying to figure out the next step in their lives and the crazy people they meet along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a charmer.","review":"Away We Go is a fantastic movie for adults. I felt like I could relate to all of the characters and the storyline is totally believable. I found the entire movie to be very charming. It was refreshing to find a movie that I was able to enjoy relaxing to as I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very good, but...","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but the language is rough, especially towards the end. I would still recommend it though, Maya Rudolph is wonderful as is the guy from the Office (how do you spell his last name? lol). I am a fan of independent movies, if you are as well, you will enjoy this drama about this young couple trying to find their home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated movie.","review":"Rented this flick recently. I think the critics liked it, but I just didn't get it. Bored in the first 30 minutes, never recovered. Maybe I'm just too shallow to get it. Lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious down-grade...","review":"Not even two percent of what American Beauty was. Just goes to show you how important the script is. And someone on hereactually said this movie was believable? Almost none of the minor characters were believable at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, real and funny!","review":"Loved it! The acting was awesome... especially Alisson Janney, who practically stole the show, in my opinion! So cleverly written, brilliantly acted and with a musical score that was perfect for the film. Great flick for people who have the stillness and emotional maturity to tolerate a film that's mostly dialogue with no explosions or car chases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away...you've been warned","review":"We rented this based on the positive reviews...i wish i had more energy to give this a thorough review. there are some decent parts in the movie, but there are so many cliches and John is basically playing his Office character with a disguise on....its gets very boring and tiresome. Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt at \\"indie-quirky\\" comedy","review":"I know a lot of people like this film so this review may get disregarded right away. I go on the record stating that I loved \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\", \\"The Tao of Steve,\\" \\"Rushmore\\" and many other indie-type films. This movie seemed to be trying too hard to be likeable and quirky and the result, IMHO, did not pay off. We've seen directionless characters like this before (anyone spend any time with '70s cinema?) and more likeable as well. I just did not care. As someone who was about to become a father when watching this I thought it would matter more but ultimately it did not. Nothing interesting here, just monotonous characters whining their way throught the film. Oh how unjust life is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Away We Go is just depressing! I expected to like it, I wanted to like it but this flawed, lonely couple and the obnoxious families and friends they meet along their journey left me in a major funk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Away We G ... PLEASE GO AWAY!","review":"A preposterous film that isn't funny at all. A very strange set of characters chasing, well, who knows what. It tries to hard to be quirky and to emulate the \\"Juno\\" soundtrack with its acoustic indie rock background score.It didn't score with me.I think I'd rather have my teeth drilled without Novocaine than to have to watch this boring flop of a movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude parody against marriage with few laughs...Disappointing","review":"This could have been a fun story about a couple looking for the support of family and finally finding it. Instead it indulged in loads of sexually crude language and unnecessarily explicit imagery (with the opening shot of the male lead's head stuck between the female lead's legs). Any married family or friends they went to visit were either vile, totally negative, weird, or sexual deviants. The only amusing scene to me was at the home of a childhood friend who had fanatically turned to natural childrearing techniques.Mendes contributes again to an attack on marriage. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Rating","review":"I still have not recieved this DVD. It's now been over a month and my patience with this seller is slim to none. I've sent an e-mail last week and still have not recieved any response. Please take care of this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Away I went","review":"After 10 minutes I gave up on the film. Why? One reason, the lead actress is extremely unattractive. Why would Sam Mendes do this? Was it because Kate Winslet told him he is not allowed to work with attractive women anymore after the young girl in \\"american beauty\\"? Is this why they have now broken up?I love Jim from the office, John Kranski, but lost respect for his character in the opening scene, cmon man, you can do better.One star as amazon won't allow no star.I heard it was funny.I like Sam Mendes.The girl was very unattractive and I like looking at gorgeous girls when I watch a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Punk from the band from Vancouver (Not the UK)","review":"Peopel who expect this album to be from Dick and the UK based Subhumans will be disappointed. It is classic anarchist punk from the Canadian Subhumans.Lyrics are simple and highly politisized. It is angry, some times funny, and very good.The band included Gerry Hannah, famous as one of the Squamish Five (eco-terrorists who blew up part of a cruise missle factory and part of an unenvironmental hydroelectric plant). Memebers also went on to form DOA.For anyone who thought there was only one classic band named the Subhumans, this album lets you peer into early Canadian punk at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"They must have been on sedatives.","review":"This reminds me of how the DeadMilkmen became some mellowed out post-punk band. When I first heard this album, I thought that some new band had formed under this great bands name, it sounds nothing like what they have sounded like. If you like the album \\"From the Cradle to the Grave\\" or \\"Worlds Apart\\", then save your money and don't buy this. Wait till your friend buys this album and then listen to it. I sold my album back to the music store, that's how usless it was. Of course if you are looking to spend your money on trash, or if need a new ashtray, then I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not from England, but from Vancouver","review":"This is an album from the Vancouver group Sub Humans and NOT the great Subhumans from England."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see!","review":"Well I have read article after article and stroy after story about Richard Ramirez and this video seems to answer all the questions. An insightful video that is a must see for those interested in crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but...","review":"This is Adams' least loved album, and only sold 3 million copies.However; it's still a great record, but a pop record - not a rock album with a few nice rock-ballads, like Adams' \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\" or \\"Into The Fire\\". There is only one familiar Adams sounding rock song, \\"Before The Night Is Over\\", and the rest of the album is soft pop-rockers and alot of beautiful pop songs. So my advice is; buy it if you like great melodic simpel pop music, but not if you're expecting the old Adams sound! \\"18 Til I DIe\\" highlighted Adams' other rock/music styles, but this one is just way too soft - kindda boring, but nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan rocks again!!","review":"A must for any Adams' fan, this CD once again proves that Bryan is one of the most talented rockers out there. No one can sit still for \\"Before the Night Is Over\\", and he can still give us those ballads he's known for with \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\". Thank you, Bryan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bryan Adams CD ever made!!!","review":"I've been a Bryan Adams fan since... forever!!! I have all his albums and they are always playing in my cd player. \\"On a Day Like Today\\" is a beautiful album and all the songs are nicely written.

I love the songs \\"On a day like today\\", \\"Where angels fear to tread\\", \\"How do you feel tonight\\", and of course the duet with Mel C. from the Spice Girls \\"When you're gone\\". Five stars all the way with this wicked album by Bryan Adams!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam's Day ! Like no Other","review":"Bryan Adam's \\"Day Like Today\\" is his best studio recording to date!In essence it takes me back to \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\",different and refreshing.The ever growing Adams is so close to his own \\"Hey Jude\\",this recording is the start to both critical and commercial success.The entire album shows how much is still to come from this renowned artist(esp. by his peers)I sense the best is yet to come.Lyrically,instrumentaly and artistically Adams is at his best.This album will entice you to ask yourself,What is so different? This record lacks little and makes me want to sing and dance.I will enjoy what is here for now but I can't wait for more.\\"On a Day Like Today\\" is the intro to \\"You Ain't Heard His Best By Far\\" yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this CD!!","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. When I first heard this CD I was not too impressed. BUT after listening to it again it is by far one of our favorites! I was not a Brian Adams fan in the 80's but now own nearly all of his CD's! The kids love \\"On A Day Like Today\\" and \\"18 till I Die\\". In my opinion there is not a bad track on either of these albums!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Adams at his best !!","review":"I'm a fan for 14 years and I tell you: this is definately his best album since 1987's \\"Into the fire\\". Bryan Adams sounds like a new Bryan but, at the same time, reminds us of the great things he did in the past. Songs like \\"I'm a liar\\", \\"Getaway\\" and \\"Before the night is over\\" are perfect ! It's amazing how the guitar riffs in this last one reminds us of \\"One night love affair\\", from the 1985 album \\"Reckless\\". I can't stop listening to this CD ! Even the ballads are great, totally different from that \\"Have you ever realy loved a woman\\" stuff. Bob Rock's produciton did great for this album. If you're a Bryan fan, what are you waiting for ? Go get this album !!! And if you're not, give it a shot and buy it. I'm sure you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adams In True Form","review":"The CD might not be available yet, but the first single is. Entitled On A Day Like Today, the single gives great promise for the upcoming album. A nice mid-tempo rocker, with a very catchy tune, this single leaves this reviewer anticipating the upcoming album, which, among other things, will feature Cecile Thomsen (actress and Adams' girlfriend), as well as Mel C from Spice Girls performing alongside Adams."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BORING B.A. ALBUM!!!","review":"This is the first BA album that I don't like at all. Only half the songs are rockin' songs, and even them dosen't rock like his songs use to do. I miss the straight ahead- guitar rock with a couple of nice 'Rock ballads'.

There are 2 \\"cons\\": even though my adirondacks have very high backs, the cushions are much higher than the chair backs, which you can see if you look closely at the picture; and the cushions do not have any ties to attach them to the chairs, just a way too loose plastic strap at the top of the back that maybe will keep the top from falling down.

The actors who did the voices lacked the passion of the original actors.

There have been times when I have been so angry with Jamie I wanted to beat my own husband.I understand where the two star lady is coming from, but I think she missed the point. Jamie is doing what he thinks is right according to his times. Claire is extremely upset and indignant over the whipping but she knows she is living in a different world and can't fault him too much for his ignorance.

I found myself skim-reading much of it as it just did not hold my interest. I have made it to the half-way point, desperately hoping that it will get better but have now decided to abandon it in favour of something that I really want to read.

The effects in the movie were pretty good for it's extremely low budget, but the obsurd acting makes it all unenjoyable. I don't even know what to say, I'm speechless at how bad this movie was.

It is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, which makes it appear cinematic. The only extra features are all 22 of the episode previews and some ads for other ADV releases. Episode previews are something that I enjoy and want when TV series are released, so I am thankful that they at least added those. It would have been nice to have more extra features, but the show is being released more quickly than some other ADV series. (Mutant X, Farscape, & Andromeda for example.)

She has a very strong and beautiful voice. She uses a great range of strength and tenderness in her voice to convey her lyrics. Oh, speaking of lyrics, her use of words are just amazing and creative. I like chilling out to her music, closing my eyes, and letting my imagination and memories run through my head.My friend, who listened to a couple of her songs, compared her to Norah Jones. But if you listen to all of her music, she has such a wide range of music, it's very difficult to categorize her along with other artists.She is truly unique, and I definitely recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kept Secret??","review":"I first heard \\"Worn Me Down\\" on the radio over a year ago now(I think its been that long!), and became an instant fan of Rachael Yamagata just on the strength of that song. I was really happy with the EP and I went out and bought Happenstance the day it was released.I must admit I was a little disappointed when I realized the album version of Worn Me Down is different then the EP version, but pretty soon I was hooked on the new version too!The CD is perfect for a relaxing evening, full of torchy, romantic songs(with just a touch of angst). Other highlights include Letter Read, I'll Find a Way & Even So (both absolutely gorgeous songs),I Want You and Under My Skin. With the exception of The Reason Why, the album is perfect.Since I first heard of her, I've definitely been turning all my friends on to her and have made big fans several so far.

I was expecting another guitar-and-voice Ani wannabe (which I would not have minded). Instead, I found a powerhouse of contention, beauty, anger and melancholy. Yamagata's sultry voice reminds us of a Fiona Apple that instead of letting the anger out at once allows it to ripe in the corners of her heart. The first track, Be be your love is full of sweet melancholy, while \\"Letter read\\" introduces us to the world of her melancholic rage. I also love the hidden track, a soft ballad of misery. Buy this. If you are on the Fiona vibe, buy this today. If not, buy it anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Impossibly Beautiful \\"","review":"would you please stop comparing Rachael to Fiona Apple? Not to underrate Fiona's music but they're way too far appart, fiona is philosophical, she wines about the unknown while in Rachael's music there's relationships, drama, reality in the middle of dreams...what Rachael is all about in this album is emotions...This album has the tendancies to be my all time favourite album! I don't expect anyone to like it, in fact, if youre not romantic or have the least amount of emotions i think ull hate this album (hence some lame reviews)...Everything is perfect, all the tracks are terribly delicious, if you like classical music youll fall for this...rachael's beautiful voice, touching music and heartfelt playing is exposed all through the moods of this album.Im honestly not gonna go on and on reviewing this album in details all i can say is...Every emotional person out there deserves to hear this albumI Love itA"},{"rating":"2","title":"would love to hear her at a cocktail lounge","review":"Some really nice tracks with quality sound, both vocal & instrumental.

I had no idea who she was nor did I have any idea about her music. I remember standing in front of her for about 45 minutes enjoying her music.I recently thought back to that day at ACL and looked online for her CDs. I purchased Happenstance and have fallen in love with her music and her voice. I enjoy sitting in my car and listening to this CD. Her voice is so amazing...it's strong and yet it doesn't overpower the music. Her songs cover all the different moods...sad, happy, nonchalant, angry....it's such real music.I recommend this CD to anyone who's sick of mass-produced music and wants something to remind them of how music is supposed to make you feel.I truly enjoyed this CD and am sure that if you're anything like me, you would too.

I had no idea who she was nor did I know what the song was. Luckily The O.C tells the names of the artists they feature in their episodes otherwise I would still have no idea. I loved this song right away and knew I NEEDED to have it. I was really drawn to her voice. It's kind of a cross between Fiona Apple with a Tori Amos type approach in her music. So, I saw it one day in the store and had to buy it. Such a great purchase it was. Very talented singer/songwriter!Standout tracks include: \\"Reason Why\\" (my favorite), \\"Be Be Your Love\\", \\"Paper Doll\\" and \\"Worn Me Down\\".All the songs have a great melodic feel to them with her genuine and at times very deep lyrics.So happy I caught that episode of The O.C!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money....and then some","review":"I saw Rachael Yamagata in concert with Liz Phair and then was lucky enough to catch her on her own tour.

She was an intensly powerful and emotional singer; just her and her piano, she had no need for anything else. She reminded me of a cross between Tori Amos and Fiona Apple and I was looking forward to hearing more of her.When I got this disc, I wasted no time in putting it into the player, and when it was over I wasted no time in taking it out. The songs are great, but the production was terrible; overblown, over tracked, and too cluttered. Next time, leave her and her songs alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is a wonderful CD, at times quirky, and at others lovely and melodic.

I was wary at first because I saw tons of advertisements for the cd at various stores and when they do that, they're usually pushing for more than the artist has talent for. But I was happily surprised to hear she has an awesome, unique voice. She also plays some of her own instruments, which is impressive these days. Some songs are mellow, others are upbeat, so there's a nice variety. There's also a beautiful instrumental song, Moments with Oliver. Basically, I highly recommend this.Personal favorites:- Be Be Your Love- 1963- Reason Why- Quiet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing around the living room","review":"I can't review this album in reference to musical roots & influences, etc. like the other reviewers. But I can tell you that I heard it in a funky & fashionable store, and I actually stopped and asked what it was. Then when I got it, it made me put on the headphones, crank it up, and bop around the living room, especially on tracks 2 & 3. So if you want some funky chick-folk-rock, get your groove on with this CD... it rocks, it tells you your life, and it makes you think. This CD will be my friend for a long time. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd I have heard in a while","review":"This cd is absolutely amazing. I saw that a lot of people found it to depressing.

For me, these are such songs. Melodically, they each have their own strong theme, don't all sound the same, and are beautifully arranged. Rachael's voice is hers only. Yes, one can make comparisons with others, and I do hear occasional similarities to others, though I don't hear any similarities to Norah Jones. But this is a very subjective thing. Suffice it to say that she sings beautifully, with great range, both tonal and octave-wise. I am looking forward to her next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD!","review":"I never really heard of Rachael Yamagata until i heard her on a Continental Airline flight.

A worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments with Rachael.","review":"This was an album I picked up unheard because I was gonna see her open for Ryan Adams and wanted to know the songs. And what a great bunch of songs! I did recognize \\"Worn Me Down\\" when I heard it, and it is possibly the best of the album, but the whole thing is very good. I totally see the Fiona Apple comparison, but she also reminds me a bit of Cat Power. \\"Be Be Your Love\\", \\"1963\\", \\"Meet Me By The Water\\", and \\"Reason Why\\" are all incredible. There's a few upbeat songs here, and numerous beautiful piano pieces as well. She excells at both.

I won't rehash the plot because so many others have done so; I'm actually writing this in hopes of finding out if anyone else thinks there is a scene missing from this edition (Remastered, Sony, 2008). I thought that in addition to seeing the snobbery at the reception hosted by Deeds, we got to see him throwing the bums out; instead we just hear about it after the fact.

The rich and sycophants who surround him try to prevent him from being a more ordinary guy and eventually give the money away to common people just like him.

Wonderful, light, terrific movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"just to naive to be true","review":"This kind of social comedy, with its naive eulogy of the simple man, the inocent farmers and the small american town, just gives me the creeps.

With Zero, it appears the band tried going in a new direction-- less \\"spooky metal\\" and more a minimalistic, drums/bass/voice sound. Furthermore, the songwriting quality is lost (few hooks and nothing radio worthy), and this effort sadly lacks the heavy guitar sound of their previous two CDs. In fact, it makes me wonder if perhaps this lackluster effort cost them their record deal and helped lead to their break-up. Just a theory. Anyway, don't fall prey!

I immediately opened the box, tore off the plastic wraps, and was more than pleased with the good look and the feel of the clubs and the bag. The very next day, however, my excitement turned into disappointment. After a couple of swings at the driving range, the head of the driver broke! Taking a closer look at the broken head, all I could tell is it appeared to be made of some cheap stuff, plastic and aluminum, maybe?

The characters are well developed and believable insofar as the Roman world in which they live is only slightly representative of historical realities (as as we presently know them).This book is recommended, and considering that I am doing this without first finishing the book says something about the general enjoyment in the reading.It would be hard to see this book fall flat at the end considering the overall strength thus far. Read it and see for yourself. I never thought a toga saga would be as enjoyable as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"Apparently, the Roman Legions were populated by middle class British public school graduates. Scarrow makes no attempt whatsoever to represent the mindset and customs of actual Legionaires; the vernacular utilized is that of 20th century Great Britain.

It might make a screenplay for an average animated movie aimed at juveniles if the sex and violence were tamed a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I bought this book to read while on a business trip and from the start, couldn't put it down. It ranks right up there with Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" and Michael Ford's \\"the Ten Thousnd\\".

For the first time I feel like I am starting to understand what it might have been like to serve in the Roman legions. Following Cato, a buck recruit, the reader is introduced to all the weapons and gritty lifestyle of the Roman grunts. We march alongside him all they way and the book is so well written it is almost liek you are there when the fighting begins. Better still, there's a plot involving a sneaky bunch of traitors out to topple the Emperor. What more could you ask for. Can't wait to read the sequel.Oh, one final point. Who is the nitwit who wrote the Publishing World review?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few hours I'll never get back","review":"I regret the time I wasted on this clunker.For a so-called \\"military adventure\\" there's an awful lot of chatty, head-in-the-clouds characters. Most of the book consists of cardboard cut-out characters sitting around thinking out loud. What little action is there is poorly described. It's a ridiculous story with completely unbelievable events. If this waste of paper is enjoying any success what-so-ever I would guess this is because it rides upon the coat-tails of other better books that truly deserve the title of \\"military adventures\\" such as Pressfield's books or those by Jack Whyte.Look into those authors !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventure?

Full of pretentions while trying to appeal to the youth of his class using phrases like 'groovy'. Well he ain't groovy and having read his first book it seems only mediocre offerings with high concepts will be accepted these days.Try to avoid these mundane offerings and invest in great books from the likes of Fante, Celine and Hamsum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Bizarre and Unexplained Reviews","review":"Simon Scarrow is really on to something here with his story of a pair of Legionaries engaged in the second Roman invasion of Britain. Technically, this is a work of historical fiction, but there really is more fiction contained than history. However there is enough history to lend the story great credibility.For the most part, this book has a quick pace. There is not that much fat in this book. Each scene neatly segues to the next, the end result being an engaging book with great characters.This book sets the stage for some intrigue in the Roman Court, but there is more action and battle sequences to to balance the intrigue. Also Scarrow's Romans seem to act more British than the Britons they are fighting. I think it's good that he did this, it does a great job in bringing the characters to life. I will eagerly look forward to reading the next book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I understand literary license but man, seriously?","review":"I understand this is historical fiction and not history, but seriously, do some homework. I was cruising along enjoying this in a very history-lite fashion until I hit a major stumbling block: the award of the grass crown to Cato for saving one centurion's life. Probably just me but this sort of thing really angers me. It's lazy. You can practically count on one hand how many generals and legates were awarded the grass crown in nearly a thousand years of Roman history. According to Scarrow they just handed those things out like after dinner mints. Not even Marius or Caesar were awarded a grass crown. To earn a grass crown you had to save a legion or the entire army-not one centurion, not one cohort. Crack a book guy.Do yourself a favor and read Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble Effort","review":"It's as if this book were written for teenagers. The story and all the characters were flat and cliched. The plot is weak. The dialog is laughable and all too contemporary. Even in a modern novel, I expect Romans to sound like Romans, not like 21st century teens. I like Scarrow's four-part series on Napoleon and Wellington but this book pales in comparison. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the basic stuff","review":"When I had to take the TOEFL test I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to prepare seriously.... but although I never studied English formaly, this book helped me to get a 290 in less than two weeks. On the negative side: It is true that the reading section is weak and some of the sample exercises are questionable, but I think that there is very little you can do about paragraph analysis anyways. It is also true that the sample tests in the CD are flawed (I guess they try to simulate an adaptative test) so you can't get more than 250/260 even with a perfect test. But on the positive side this book concentrates in what is important for the test. In my case they were a lot of grammatical constructs (including some custom uses and phrases) I never used before and they appeared in my actual test. If you have some previous background or need to refresh your grammar for the TOEFL this book may be a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly written book","review":"I used this book to prepare for Toefl and found it to be very much lacking in most of the areas, especially the reading comprehension. The tests on the CD are total waste of time. I took two tests and my scores were around 190, without the writing part. I took the real Toefl and my score range was 240-293. The CD does not have the solutions to the test and therefore you don't know what was wrong with your answer choices. I cannot recommend another book but if you are really deficient in English, this book is not a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be worse!","review":"I bought this book to go through one of the computer based tests before I take the test itself. I ended up doing both, because my scores turned out to be pretty low. I think the Reading section is dreadful. I took the TOEFL CBT almost two years ago - and I have been in the US since then doing my Masters - and my score was 280 in 1998. I got a 240 and 250 from KAPLAN's tests (including an assumed score of 6 from the TWE). I don't believe I have lost my proficiency in English studying in the US. I can strongly argue that some of the answers I picked up for the reading comprehension are as true as the answers that were indicated as \\"correct\\".

As a result of this unexpected life altering experience, Irene takes the reader on a personal journey of healing as she reveals and shares her many lives throughout the centuries with Saul, her ever present and constant soul and life mate.

It took her about another month to work a small hole on the side... and before I knew it there was little red peices of rubber all over the house.

I got the 8-inch one and its a perfect size for him. (80lb.)The ball is of high quality design and is quite durable. He's been trying to gnaw on it for a couple weeks now and there's not a single puncture hold in the ball. (He's not a big chewer however so YMMV).The rope is a good quality, good length and seems to not detangle like some other ropes I have purchased. However the knots were a little loose when we received it. They kept coming unknotted until I really tightened them up.It's quite interactive, the rope/ball combo keeps him interested and playing with it much longer than most other toys he's had.The polyethylene plastic its made out of hasn't given off any odor which is a huge plus.Jolly Pet makes great, high quality products. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a durable fun toy for their pup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog toy!","review":"Purchased this for our 100 lb. olde English bulldogge who was destroyed innumerable chew toys.

Both times the dog shredded the rope right away, so I'd suggest watching your dog carefully the first times playing with this so they don't swallow pieces of thread. It is soft enough for a large dog to chomp down on and fairly sturdy. One of my dogs just chomped on his all the time and never ripped a hole in it. Another dog started picking at the raised letters that say \\"Jolly Ball\\" and there's a hole there now.

It's nothing like what I got used to them from outrospective. I was used to the girls subtle voice over some catchy beats. But this album was filled with that dude trying to rap. As for their references to US Politics I wasn't too impressed. It's always a bad idea for a band to inject politics into their music. They can alienate half their fan base with one song. Usually it's just stupid stuff like \\"War is wrong blah blah blah\\", that sort of nonsense. It wouldnt be so bad if the music was catchy like the previous stuff, but the devolved into some sort of trip-hop act and they dont pull it off.

Effervescent, light, joyous, romantic -- everything you dream Rio de Janeiro could be. It's more of a precursor to the Antonio Carlos Jobim Bossa Nova explosion a few years later. But Bud Shank and Laurindo Almeida picked up on the potential for fusing jazz and the samba early on. I'm not a musician, but I know this album is pure genius. The soft sax and vibrant guitar will dazzle you. The interwoven rhythms of sax, guitar and drums go on and on. My favorite track is \\"Stairway to the Stars.\\" Still gets me dreaming.

Imagine small dancer image against spinning magenta or neon green spirals and trying to learn moves from that. It is just plain hard on the eyes. In fact, I watched this DVD once then gave it away b/c it literally hurt my eyes to watch.

I adore Suzanne so much and I guess I have just been lazy. After reading the first 20 reviews, I have made up my mind that today is the day I start. I wish Suzanne would come out with more recipes or meal plans, or maybe even frozen, easy to fix entrees!! I also have her video that goes with her book and she has great points on it and the exercise is great. Thank you Suzanne. Keep up the great work and helping so many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!The greatest diet i ever tried!!!","review":"A friend of mine went on this diet, and he gave it to me to try. I have been heavy all my life. I just turned 54. I started the diet on July 9, 1998 and weighed 281 pounds. As of December 31,1998, I now weigh 215 pounds. I have taked 10 inches off my waist and two inches off my neck size. I went from a size 52 jacket to a size 46. At first I thought the diet would be difficult. I have stuck to this diet, without cheating. I did so well on the diet that i have about 15 friends that are now using the diet. my goal is to get down to 200 pounds. I also feel that this book illistrates an easy way and with recipes, that really work. I would just like to thank you very much for putting together this book.

Every time I would eat I would look 3 months pregnant! I am a 3rd degree black belt and a certified weight trainer so it's not like I wasn't getting any exercise. I've been on the diet for 2 weeks and I have already lost 10 pounds! I fit into a skirt that I haven't fit into for 2 years. I feel great! I only had a headache the first day and I haven't craved sweets. In fact, I sell Mary Kay and had my Holiday open house last Saturday and had two trays of cookies and candy kisses everywhere and didn't eat any. I now rollerskate every morning outside(I'm in Florida) to help firm up. I hate to cook but the recipes are easy and great tasting. I no longer bloat after eating. In fact my stomach is almost flat! I would encourage anyone to give this diet a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somersizing is not for everyone.","review":"While the program may work for some, it is simply unrealistic for many others. For example, on level one you must eliminate all sugar and white flour. I tried to do this, but do you know how hard it is to go to the supermarket and find foods that do not have any sugar or white flour? Most foods have these things. On the program you basically have to prepare all your meals using meat, vegetables, oil and fruit while you are on level 1. Who wants to eat a hamburger without the bun anyway? And you must give up potatoes altogether. Who wants to do that? There are also a good number of other foods that you must give up altogether (at least while on level 1). Also its unrealistic for those who work long hours or students because you must prepare all your meals- you can't eat any canned or prepared foods. The complete elimination of sugar on level 1 left me lethargic and weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"You don't have to say anything more! It works. My family and friends are thanking me for introducing them to Suzanne's program. I have bought at least 10 books to share with others and have gotten another 10 to get their own -- do I get a kickback?

I've followed the recipes for one month and have lost 15 lbs and several inches, I plan to keep up with this for the rest of my life. If anyone out there is on the fence with this book, give it a try, I use to eat non-fat, low-fat and still never lost any weight. Through Suzanne teaching me how to seperate Carbs and Protiens and cut out sugar, I am satisfied after a meal and don't look to cheat! Bravo Suzanne, let's get another book out with even more recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally enjoy cooking!","review":"I loved Suzanne's book. I've been eating a low fat diet for over 15 years and am 20 lbs heavier! Finally a lifetime eating plan that addresses the sugar problem. Like lots of people I know,I had fallen into the \\"if it's no fat it must be safe to eat lots\\" trap and it turns out these snacks are full of sugar & calories. I've only followed Somersizing for a week now but I actually look forward to preparing meals for my husband & I. I had been eating low fat for so long that I lost my appetite years ago. Now,I seem to require less sleep, have lots of energy and feel slimmer. Loved the family stories & photos in the book. Suzanne comes across as a real woman & a mom and not just another celeb with a book idea. My only hurdle has been leaving fat out of the carbohyrdrate meals (for instance: eating bread without butter, peanut butter or mayo)I look forward to reading Get Skinny on Good Food. Should be lots more great recipes. Thanx Suzanne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program, and it really works!","review":"I had written a review of this program about 16 months ago, saying that I had great success, and had already lost 20-some pounds.

I feel wonderful, but it's really doing a number on my digestive system, if you know what I mean. I can't understand why I'm not losing. I've found it very easy to follow. Some of the recipes are really great. Most though, have too many fancy ingredients. I've found that most can be eliminated, or substituted, and the food still turns out great. I think I could live this way for the rest of my life, with rare, occasional cheating, but I WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, too. Anyone have any suggestions? So far, I have followed this to the letter. Would love to hear from someone who has lost a lot of weight on this and get some tips. So far this looks like a great way to maintain, not lose.....what a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best diet ever","review":"I have never had a weight problem until I turned 40. I tried going on low fat diets and was starving but lost no weight. My mother was on Suzanne's diet and suggested I read the book. I loved it. It was the easiest diet I had ever done. My husband and I eat out frequently and I never have a problem with picking something off the menu. I just substitute the potato for a salad. To date I have lost 20 pounds. I now weigh 110 lbs.

So I am doing the best I can to spread the word. I have been able to eat lots of food, and never feel hungry as I usually did on diet plans. The recipes that my wife and I have tried have been wonderful. It was hard at first to give up some of my carbs, mostly the pasta and meat sauce, or sandwiches stuffed with mayo and meat.

It works for some people. I've lost weight on this program but really, you are just cutting WAY WAY back on calories, so, that's the bottom line. If we all stopped snacking on GARBAGE and excerised, we'd lose weight! Why I really hated this book is because it is ALL ABOUT SUZANNE! There are pictures of her in her gorgeous home with her gorgeous friends and her gorgeous skinniness...gag me.

According to her book, one can lower cholersterol by eating the fats one likes: cheese, sausages, etc. It even offers an illustration of an individual whose cholersterol was INCREASED by following what would amount to Dr. Ornish's plan featured in Newsweek a year or two ago. After having a borderline ECG treadmill test (lowered ST depressions at max) in September of 1998 with a HDL cholesterol at 30 and LDL at 159, I followed Dr. Ornish's advice and in 6 months the HDL was 33 (better but still not great) but the LDL was 113 (a drastic reduction of the bad cholesterol). I dropped 10 lbs. too. Somebody is right and somebody is wrong. Who is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Weight Loss Book I've EVER read!","review":"I bought this book after a neighbor recommended it. What a little gem (the book and the neighbor)! This has to be the best kept weight loss secret ever. I lost 30 pounds over a 4 month period eating lots of yummy stuff and people at work would not believe me it was easy. I had tried EVERYTHING ... all kinds of fad diets, internet and tv pills (that cost a mint and did nothing but bust my bank balance), heavy exercise (my Chiropractor loved me) and nothing worked like this diet when I stuck to it. That's the secret ... stick to the plan and you do lose heaps of weight and keep it off. But binge on those funky foods and it creeps back. Just goes to show, one should eat healthy to stay healthy.

Yes, I lost weight. Yes, I have since gained it back, and lost it again through other means.Pros:By eliminating refined sugars, carbs and other processed foods, she has the right idea of how to eat. This got me eating more veggies and fruits, while limiting processed foods considerably.Cons:Now that I'm older and wiser and have done research on how weight loss really works, I can tell you food combining and \\"hormonal imbalances\\" have nothing to do with it. It's calories in, calories out. From what I recall, she also puts little emphasis on the importance of exercise. It's nearly impossible to lose weight and keep it off without regular exercise.There are better ways to do this. I recommend The Eat Clean Diet, by Tosca Reno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound advice","review":"Enjoyed the writings, found the advice useful and the recipes were good.

My clothes feel looser, but I don't own a scale, so I don't know for certain that I've lost any weight. If this works, this is truly a way of eating I could keep up for a lifetime. Removing the dietary fat bugaboo has given me the freedom to make some amazing meals, including my fave, eggplant parmesan! I'll write again in a few weeks to let you know how the actual weight loss is going. I think basic health requires us to drink lots of water, eat plenty of fresh veggies and avoid excess animal fats, no matter what -- I think it's important NOT to use this diet to get around those basic tenets. I'm eating mostly chicken and lean meats, reduced-fat cheeses, and am having wonderful, satisfying food. It can be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T WORK FOR ME !","review":"Followed the diet exactly, ate more food than I ever have before for 4 weeks, looked better, but weight remained the same...think the low carb diet does dehydrate you, which makes you appear slimmer.

You can feel the results in just a couple of days if you are in tune with your body. What I noticed first was that I had virtually no bloating after eating.

I highly recommend this system to people who want a lifestyle plan not a diet. When you eat this way, you leave the table feeling full and satisfied -- never starving and hungry. I believe that this is why people have such such success with it as they are satiated from the food.

As a side benefit, I never realized that the way I ate affected my blood sugar and caused me to want to eat even more.

If used alone, the impact is subtle. If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath. I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies. After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top. The icing will hold them in place. The two layers create a beautiful, richer look. Think of a precious stone. Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle. But, with facets and light, it comes to life. That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing. I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.This is not a product that you can taste. It's not sweet. Its purpose is to complement your baked goods, unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles/jimmies.Wilton consistently provides excellent quality supplies and I've been using their products for about 34 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice color but not so sparkly","review":"Purchased this lavender sugar to put on lavender sugar cookies.

But if you are hoping for a lasting addition to add to your collection, do not purchase this product. This is nothing more than a Signet paperback, with the same tiny print and cheap newspaper-like stock as any other dimestore edition. The only difference is that carboard covers have been attached, making it technically meet the definition of hardcover. I can't think of many reasons to opt for this format over the paperback, since this is not a book to keep on your bookshelves for posterity. However, if it is intended as a working copy to pass around to your friends and family for a couple of years, this one will do for that limited purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I just finished this book and in my head I know this is going to take me a while to process. What I really liked about this book was how blunt Malcolm X was and how he didn't sugarcoat anything. His knowledge of history and his perspectives of why the US race problem is the way it is very eye-opening. He touches on a lot of topics in this book including women, drugs, hustling, religion, history, social welfare... basically stuff that can pertain to anyone. Malcolm X's faith led him to overcome many obstacles in his life and this I believe will inspire many readers in their own lives to hold on to faith when the going gets rough.I got a little annoyed when Malcolm X kept defending himself and getting repetitive near the end, but overall I know the book will challenge readers to think and act."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahh !","review":"wonderful , beautiful human being ! .

This is not new or controversial information within Bible scholarship. This is simply a subversive leak of information from one of them to all of us.And, the nature of some of what you learn, such as the repeat sentences, is such that it does not require advanced knowledge of Hebrew or a reliance on some convoluted explanation to see it for yourself.

It was written in a simple language that can be understand by those who are not scholars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along with Burton Mack \\"Who wrote the NT\\"","review":"I use this excellent and manageable text along with Burton Mack's treatment of the NT as handy sources to review prior to discussions on Biblical topics. This book in particular was recommended to me by a colleague after my \\"Book of J\\" disappeared during a class. (It took a while before I got another copy). My colleague recommended this as a better book and in many respects I agree with her. I still like the poetry in \\"The Book of J\\" but the analysis by Friedman is excellent and easily led me on to his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pentateuch Unmasked","review":"Following the long line of previous investigators, Professor Richard Elliot Friedman gives us a very excellent treatment of the field of Biblical Criticism, in particular, the Documentary Hypothesis of the Pentateuch. Over the past several years a group of scholars known as \\"Bible Minimalists\\" seemed to have attracted most of the attention in this field. Their view that the sources behind the Bible arrived quite late in history and their views which discounted or offered reinterpretations of the archeological record earned them the monikers \\"Biblical Minimalists\\" and \\"Revisionists.\\" But, they held a great deal of influence in academia.Friedman takes on this school of thought in a gracious and informative manner. He helps his readers to understand the controversy as well as the history of Biblical Criticism. He then offers compelling and convincing evidence supporting the view that the Bible's underlying source material is in fact much older than Second Temple Judaism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This book is total junk. The JEPD theory has no textual evidence, and yet he passes it off as fact. This is just another liberal book out there to try and refute Biblical authorship. If he bothered to go out there and examine the actual, ORIGINAL text (in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) he would know that there are no proofs for JEPD. It is all theory.Heck, I could say that Santa Claus wrote the Bible, and have as much proof as this guy. Save your $."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who has either read or plans to read the Bible or the Torah. This book gives you a good base too start from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I found Friedman's hypothosis to be far more compelling, rational, and just plain interesting than the teaching on the origin of scripture that I grew up with. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in taking their knowledge of scripture beyond the Sunday School stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friedman Delivers","review":"This fascinating book unfolds like a mystery novel, and like a really good \\"whodunit,\\" it is very hard to put down. Friedman sorts through everything that is known about the historicity of the Torah, adds some of his own deductions based on style and subject matter, and comes to a solid, well-supported conclusion.This book lacks for nothing; any question that can be answered, is. Friedman knows his archeology, his Hebrew, his history, his commentary. The reader will be able to go back to the Torah with fresh understanding after reading this book, but more, the reader learns quite a lot about Jewish history.I hesitate to say more, because I don't want to give anything away, so please just trust me; even is you have just a passing interest in the Bible, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR USE ON EDIBLES!","review":"I really think this should have been included in the product description.

Concentrate","review":"Ordered from UnbeatableSale, Inc, the very expensive (almost $300 for 2.5 Gal) Deer Off is constantly plugging up the sprayer. I had to discard 2 sprayers because I could not clear them even with a reverse flow from a compressor. I noticed the hardware store has a ready-to-use spray with a \\"new formula\\".

Literally a day after application both of my sets of roses were eaten by the deer. I think the deer are going to eat my roses no matter what, but I won't spend money on this stuff anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I spent several hours reading reviews for deer repellents before settling on the Havahart Deer Off product. I gulped at the price, but reasoned that it was a concentrate and I would get my money's worth. First, let's start with the fact that the product is filled with little mushy granules that immediately clogged my garden sprayer. I had read the directions. I had shaken the product vigorously as recommended. It still clogged not only my standard gallon garden sprayer, but every other sprayer I tried to use to dispense the product. I wound up \\"painting\\" it on the plants I wanted to protect. And now comes the second part..... it did absolutely nothing to protect my plants. The deer ate three quarters of everything to which I had applied the product within a week of application. Flowers, vegetables, shrubs. It was as if I had used nothing.My opinion? This product is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"New formula no longer works","review":"My wife used to purchase Deer Off at a local landscaping store, and there was no question that it worked. We have a lot of deer in our area, and if she kept our plants sprayed right after a heavy rain washed things off, the deer didn't bother the plants. If she forgot, it only took a day or two before the deer ate the plants.The local store stopped carrying Deer Off this year, so I decided to purchase it on Amazon. When I got it, my wife noticed that the color of the concentrate was different than before. It seems that they have a new formula, and it DOESN'T work! (Their website confirms that they have \\"improved\\" their formula.) I contacted the Havahart company directly to see if they would trade me for the old formula, but they didn't even answer my email. I strongly suggest that you stay away from this product unless they return to their original, proven, formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD from underrated MC/producer","review":"I've been following Chops since his days with the Mountain Brothers, and was surprised to see a solo CD from him. I took a listen, and I was impressed. His rapping style is full of complex wordplay, with heavy use of punchlines and metaphors, so if you're into guys like Ras Kass, Pharoahe Monch and Chino XL, you might like his flow. His production talent really shines on tracks like \\"From Unda\\" and \\"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.\\" The hidden track is also pretty cool, where he breaks down his career up to that point and why the Mountain Brothers broke up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking through the body!","review":"This is a very good book.

I guess the title is justified by a mild twist on words(ie. \\"Appeteaser\\") becuase I find no other reason for it.

Although they are written for a young adult audience -- and two of the stories center on young adults -- these stories are well-written enough to appeal to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted story. Although actual dates and places aren't given, all three stories seem to take place in the 17th - 19th centuries, two in New England and one in Italy, and a statue figures in each; hence the title of the collection.Recommended as a nice, short intermission between other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie.

This dvd is a copy. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON! Please find a better quality dvd elsewhere! The picture was pixelized for most of the movie and the sound cut out during parts in the beginning.

It was very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"great film -- amazon copy not so great","review":"Hindi High School Musical with terrorists -- in fact terrifically charming, though many will want to fast-forward through the gratuitous, sometimes cartoonish, belabored violence towards the end. This film belongs in every bollywood home library -- it includes director/choreographer Farah Khan's characteristic wit throughout (and that's especially clever during dance sequences), some fun and memorable songs, a very strong cast, and what is admittedly a rather silly, strained meta-plot that still manages to generate a sweet and sometimes even moving film.What I wish I had known before purchasing? that the Amazon copy sold to me was a pirated dvd with painfully obvious bootleg qualities -- occasional bad pixilation, etc. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad copy","review":"Even though others have pointed this out, Amazon is still selling a terrible copy of this movie which contains commercials. And not just commercials, but commercials that play across the top of the movie while the dance numbers are going on. The copy I got was sent by Dancing Dolphin(Lola's Dream), and I will never buy from them again. You can tell if you've gotten a bad copy by the following: If the upper right-hand corner has \\"Movies on Demand\\" written on it, and the back has the words \\"Akai\\" and \\"Air-Tel\\" written in red, then just send it back without opening it. Also, the dvd case is cheap cardboard rather than plastic. There is such a problem with some copies of Bollywood movies, that I hope people will describe what the outside cases look like when posting reviews so that others won't be stuck with cheap copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Buy pirated copy","review":"This Dvd has commercials/advertisements through out the movie as if it was copied from a t.v.

I recommend this simply because Shahrukh Khan is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly waste of time and Sharukh Khan","review":"First, you can't get to the menu using Menu or Next Track functions on your remote. Then you get to the menu and press Movie to play, or so you think. Then you get more advertisements for other movies. Then comes the cheesy music in the opening credits. The action in the opening scene is hilarious. It reminds me of a lousy Hong Kong movie. Oh, and did you know that when somebody is shot with a pistol bullet they fly back through a glass door? Imagine what would happen to the shooter if this were reality? You know that pesky physics stuff: For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. Finally, the EROS label sticks in the upper left corner 90% of the time, like a music video or TV show. We couldn't watch more than about 20 minutes, after fast forwarding through the first dance number, which was terribly choreographed and the music was irritating. The lyrics were worse. Pathetic waste of time. Too bad. We really like Shahrukh Khan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to her?","review":"If i'm not mistaking she was a Jersey native.

Russian church music is what I admire the most. There's Rachmaninov's \\"Vespers\\", Tchaikovsky's \\"Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom\\", and now this: Grechaninov's \\"Seven Days of Passion\\", a.k.a. \\"Passion Week.\\" This is truly a spiritual experience; it's so passionate and lyrical. The Pheonix Bach Choir & Kansas City Chorale really help, too. Their sound is pure and their diction perfect. Charles Bruffy brings it all together to bring a 74-minute choral piece to life. This is one CD that I'll fully cherish for years to come. A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite c.d.","review":"This is the rare c.d. that I listen to over & over again - it never gets old.

There is no better instrument than the human voice. God created man and woman to praise Him. This Russian church music is amazing, but you must give it your full attention. It DEMANDS your attention. My first listen was when I was working on my computer and I had to stop and just listen. It is impossible to listen to this music with just one ear.This music will allow your spirit to soar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Series","review":"This is probably the best of the Blackford Oakes books and, as another reviewer noted, it's a fitting and excellent finale to a worthy series of spy thrillers involving a credible and well-crafted protagonist. This book revolves around a plot to kill Mikhail Gorbachev when he was the leader of the Soviet Union. Buckley gives us a realistic view of life in Moscow under glasnost. Usually the Oakes books tend to be tempered in their pacing -- as you would expect from Buckley -- but this one has the burner turned up a little higher. Good suspense, good characters, good plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had high hopes for this book, only because it won a few awards, but it didn't take long to be discouraged. I didn't like the short divisions between chapters; it made it all too confusing. The plot could have been made into a good one, but it seems as though the author threw in a lot of nonsense that had nothing to do with the ending. It seems as though the book actually started midway through the novel. Perhaps I just needed more of an Irish backround to fully enjoy the story/memoires that this book talks about."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written if not a little difficult to follow","review":"seamus deane is undeniably a gifted writer, and this book is beautifully written in a haunting sort of way. the plot, while ultimately quite interesting and dark, is complex and very, very difficult to follow. it provides an interesting insight into the irish dilemma and its effect on the personal relationships of those involved with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written read if you give it time.","review":"I just finished \\"Reading in the Dark.\\" I'm a great fan of Irish authors and Seamus Deane did not disappoint me. The story is very well written and the further along into the book you go, the more engaging it becomes. As a warning, do not begin this book thinking that it will be reminiscent of Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" Should you do so, you will be disappointed and lose appreciation for a distictly different book. Stick with it; it is worth it, if for nothing else but for the imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has no substance.","review":"Reading this book it is clear the author is originally and more naturally a poet. His lyrical style did not translate well to prose and as a result this book is boring and slow. I always finish a book I start, but it was pure torture to finish this one. After the story line finally develops it turns out to be so trivial it is not even worth mentioning. Poetry doesn't have to have a story line prose must have one and this book doesn't.

His rendering of Northern Ireland's violent history leaves the reader breathless with complex plot, emotional upheaval, and chilling notions of a past which doesn't stay dead, haunting the living. Writing out of personal experience, his representation of life growing up a Catholic in Derry is as true to the local reality as it is profound and relevant to the human condition as a whole. Superb narrative, and deft adaptation of Gothic elements, especially his use of nested storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Secrets","review":"This book is about growing up Catholic in Northern Ireland, a very complicated place! About a child caught up in a violent history and a mysterious feud, haunted by superstition and family secrets, terrorized by the police, browbeaten by priests. It is also a mystery story--what secret is his mother hiding? What really happened to Uncle Eddie? And it has barbed humor worthy of Frank McCourt.The writing is elegant, but this is not an easy read. The subplots are complicated. Some chapters have little to do with the main plot. The reader picks up clues as they occur to the unnamed protagonist. The pieces come together slowly, like a jigsaw puzzle. In the end the reader is left with a vivid, warts and all, picture of life in Northern Ireland, past and present, on the Catholic side. It seems too real to be a novel, but at least the names are fictional. Worth reading, if you are willing to give it the time and attention it requires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better live","review":"I think STS9 is a talented group, at least the rhythm section -- the bassist, percussionist, and drummer are absolutely outstanding. Having seen them live, they didn't quite do it for (too spacey at times), but they definitely can put on a good show. That said, this CD is quite bad. There are no real songs to speak of, just themes more than anything else, and there's not a lot of exploration within any of them, even the lengthiest tracks. I found even after listening to this album a couple times that I found myself getting tired of each track after about 1:30 of each. There is no development, no jamming to speak of, and certainly no direction anywhere on this album. See them live for a glimpse of the future of music, but buy this album at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Concert in Atlanta Georgia at the Roxy Theater - after waiting in line forever - this band blew us away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Pamphlet, not a Book.","review":"If you want to learn about U-Boats pass this one up.

If Superchunk could actually incorporate all the sounds of Portastatic and take the whole sound beyond 1995, you might start to get at the sound of this disc.Eddie's guitars circle over and under (sideways and down) Anne's phenomenal and anchoring cello (the cello serves the purpose as both bass guitar and stringed, melodic counterpoint), and Mickey's serpentine/dervish-like drumming create an affect that reminds me of the afformentioned Mac fronting King Crimson. And Eddie's longing-filled, alcohol-soaked vocals will make all the girls and (sensitive boy-types) cry in their PBRs.Tales of longing, hopeful for resolutions.

Even before that I had to remove the black ink cartridge every time I started the printer and then put it back in because the printer said it wasn't there. I bought this to replace a 7 year old Epson. Now, I am using the Epson again until I replace the junk Canon. I have owned several brands of printers. This is the most expensive to use, quickest dying printer I have ever had. Also, colors that print fine on other printers had an off-hue cast on the Canon. This was a mistake.

Also, is says I have TWO of the same color cartridges installed. I don't. So now it won't print anything. It's a like-new printer with full ink cartridges that are totally useless to me. This will FOR SURE be my last Canon printer, and maybe my last Canon product. Their website offers no help, and no firmware updates. The customer should have some recourse against Canon for this kind of issue. Many people have the same problem with the printer. It should be recalled and replaced.

I then wanted to try Canon as I have always been a Canon camera user and found someone selling an unopened i6600D. After owning now for about 6 months the looks and quality of the prints compared to the C86 is much better. Build quality is much better. The printer is also very quite.

LCD viewer in middle will also serve as a cardreader for your pictures and send them to your PC.Yes, ink will cost you some when you run out, but it's an inkjet. Which printer doesn't run out of ink? At least it's 6 tanks which separately don't cost that much.As for paper, canon typically does cost more, but the Ilford brand found at SamsClub prints great especially on canon printers which is all i've used in the past 12 years after giving up on HP inkjets.

Replacement cartridges can run into big bucks, especially if the printer only takes 2 tanks and you have to replace the entire color one even if only one of the colors run out. This printer uses multiple tanks, which is good, BUT I could find no generic/compatible cartridges available for it yet. Try looking on the web for the CLI-8 cartridges and see how much they cost.

Canon Help Center happily offered to send me a refurbished printer, in place of my \\"new\\" one, or suggested that I personally take is to a service center.

First sheet fine...Second sheet inspired wailing , moaning and gnashing of teeth. All hell broke loose as gears began to grind and screech. I also recieved the mysterious ERROR 5110. I still haven't summoned the energy to deal with it as I am taking my lumps for buying a sony DVD writer and don't feel like fighting two tech support battles at once.

Also, got an Error 5100 which could not be cleared even though I did everything recommended by the service manual to fix the problem. Printer is now dead. Check out a cheap color laser instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print Quality Is Mediocre","review":"I received this iP 6600D printer about a week ago to replace my malfunctioning Canon i9900, and I am very disapointed. The print quality on the i9900 was excellent, but the print quality of the 6600D is mediocre at best. Specifically, the colors are really washed out, particularly the reds, but all are to some extent. The colors are also not as true to life as they should be. For example, the mountains in a photo I used for comparison purposes looked too blue rather than as green as they should have been. The quality is also inferior to some prints I obtained from a drugstore photo printer. Before you buy this photo printer (or any photoprinter, really) you should have some digital photo examples printed on photo paper and compare them to the same photos printed on the printer you are considering. It really sucks working to take good photos and then knowing the quality of the resulting photos in your photo album will be less than they should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious red tone problem","review":"I'm a Canon fan. I bought this printer as a replacement for an old Canon i850. Brand-new, out-of-the-box, the 6600d produced photos with an annoying red cast. Photos would require a lot of guess-work in post processing to reduce the red so the prints would come out correct. Most of the time, this 'correction' caused photos to have a green tint, so you'd have to go back and try again. Totally unacceptable. An internet search turned up a number of owners who experienced the same red cast problem.I returned the 6600d and bought an Epson R320 which produces much better prints with no additional work. For the record, my monitor is color calibrated, and the red cast happened regardless of what photo editing software I used to print my work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red color problem","review":"The photo output of this printer is really quite good except for one GLARING problem - the overwhelming redness of flesh tones. A lot of pictures of the baby are coming out like he's scalded or badly sunburned. This leads to a tremendous waste of paper and ink, not to mention effort in trying to adjust for this problem. Even a call to Canon TS didn't solve anything. Apparently, I'm not the only one with this problem. I would love to return this printer if I could... Too bad I stocked up on a bunch of Canon paper already. Any suggestions for a fix (besides the usual calibration, red tone slider, etc.)? I would love to try the MP series, but this experience has really soured me on Canon printers (I love their digital cameras though - bought 3 within the last year).My Epson 300 and even the 3810 perform much better with good picture output all-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ALL TIME GREAT PRINTER","review":"The title says it all!

After dozens of hit releases, Jordan's brand of swing was simply out of pace with the coming musical phenomenon: R&B; influenced rock & roll. When Bill Haley & the Comets arrrived at Louis' old label around the time Jordan left, his old producer, Milt Gabler, showed Haley all of the Tympany Five's tricks, which is how \\"Shake Rattle & Roll\\" and \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" came into existence.While with the small independent label, ALADDIN, Jordan waxed these 21 sides in two separate 1954 sessions. Nine singles were issued on an almost monthly basis, as well as an LP. None sold very well-- this is no reflection on the music's quality; Jordan's time had simply passed. It happens to the best of them.For any fan of swing, ONE GUY NAMED LOUIS is a must have. Sound quality is superb, performances too.

Unfortunately he was unable to raise the believability and entertainment level in this movie, although he does portray a sexy yet chilling serial killer. With such talented actors as Vosloo and Gary Busey, I was expecting a decent movie, but as soon as I saw Michael Madsen was in it, I should have realized it wasn't even a B movie. It was worth watching only because of the screen time Arnold is in it . If you are not a Vosloo fan, take my advice and skip it!! There are better ways to spend a couple of hours - chiefly, seeing \\"The Mummy\\" yet again in a comfortable air conditioned movie theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Actors Gone to Waste","review":"With Gary Busey and Arnold Vosloo starring and a great story idea, how could this movie go so wrong? Simple. With a script that can't live up to its full potential and weak directing that leaves these talented and charismatic actors with egg on their faces.Throughout this movie, lines are forced and emotional outbursts come flying out of nowhere. At times the actors are left to grope for a connection, or worse, they are made to violate their instincts, turning powerful moments into awkward ones.Like harpies from the sky, these senseless moments make the viewer want to run screaming for shelter. What seemed like a promising thriller of intrigue and insanity turned out to be a disappointing groaner of missed marks and flat presentation.It's always a shame when such awesome actors have been wasted, but they say that any experience is a good one if you learn a valuable lesson. I sincerely hope so, but I want to know \\"Is it too early to do a re-make?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Man's Psychological Thriller ...","review":"Sad to see such wasted talent as Arnold Vosloo (who is horribly miscast as a far too attractive and far from menacing serial killer) in this unfortunate excuse for a psychological thriller. If, like me, you have recently become a fan of this sexy and darkly intense actor since this summer's mega-hit \\"The Mummy\\", you will be pleased at the amount of screen time and dialogue he has but sorely disappointed if you are a fan of the psychological thriller genre. Gary Busey seems to sleepwalk through the movie when any other journalist would likely be traumatized at being stalked by a serial killer. More interviews with the killer would have provided more insight into this character. Lots of potential for an interesting study of the mind of a killer, but somebody missed the boat on that one. In short, if you're a Vosloo fan, give it a look but if you're a psychological thriller movie fan, give it a definite pass!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIARY-EA","review":"Gary Busey and Arnold Vosloo star in this lukewarm thriller, diminished by a pedestrian script and its failure to really be a \\"diary\\". We don't really find out why Vosloo does what he does. While Vosloo's performance is effectively chilling, Busey is horribly miscast. His journalist role is weakly performed, and little conviction is evidenced in his relationship with Vosloo or his live in girl friend (the lovely Julia Campbell). Add Michael Masden (B movie's Bruce Willis) as a cop whose daughter was killed by a serial killer and Reno Wilson as his obligatory African American partner, and the soup thickens. Masden sleepwalks and Wilson tries to be Ice T. Wilson's actions at the end of the movie are highly unprofessional and hard to swallow.This could have been a better movie with a tighter script and someone else in Busey's role."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Vosloo fan only","review":"I rented this just to see Arnold Vosloo. He looks great, but the movie is dumb. I'm not a horror fan, so I can't compare this film to others in the genre, but the story is pretty weak. And Gury Busey is fat and sluggish in his role (literally and figuratively). I couldn't believe how weak his character is... especially in the scene where he stands there and evespdrops during a murder. I kept shouting \\"do something!\\".

I was really hoping she would come to her senses and see the good man that she had.

(How are old these characters supposed to be anyway?)Furthermore, she's supposed to be the devout Christian and church girl out of the three girlfriends, but she seems more confused about religion and her celibacy than not.

Using both stories and psychological analysis it is able to not only help you understand where the feelings of addiction come from, but it also helps you realize that you can overcome these crippling emotional ties. I found myself interested in the progress and stories of the individuals in the book which made the book a very easy read. While many self-help books can be weighty and difficult to finish, I found myself wanting to pick this book up again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good neo-Freudian approach but not my cup-of-tea.","review":"The psychological approach taken by this book is very sound, if a little old-fashioned. To boil down its content into a few key themes one might say that it deals with the classic Freudian concepts of oral fixation and the Oedipus complex. I have never been a fan of Freudian psychology but for some such an approach can and does work. The book's great strength is in the real world examples taken from the clinical experiences of its author, Dr Halpern. There are many down-to-earth situations examined in the book and concrete, and possibly useful, management techniques described. The book is by and large easy to read. However, those of a non-American background will wince at many of the prefixes and derivational suffixes used by Dr Halpern. I remember reading words such as \\"demandingness\\" and \\"untriumph\\", just to name a couple! This book could be of practical use to some but for me it was of little assistance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insights -","review":"The insights represented in the book have been key to helping me take purposeful steps to begin to realize God's best for me.Addiction will almost always lead to destructive behaviour. The insight here helped me understand how, through my addiction I had placed a relationship before God - and with the end of the relationship a couple of years ago, I took a path that would surely have led to my destruction.It was an incredibly painful eye opener - I chose to sin after a break-up, yet my break-up was not with God - so why did I betray God? Howard Halpern's book will encourage you to find that source of insecurity and need for validation and help you on a road to realizing the gem that lies inside every one of us.I would recommend picking this book up, going through the table of contents and selecting three key topics that are most relevant to you right now and dig in. You will be blessed for taking the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to break your addiction to a person - not recommended","review":"I lost interest half way through this book, as I do not agree with the concepts within it.

I guess I should have looked up the name of Stan Kenton ahead of time, but the title of the CD is misleading. To be sure, there are some songs that do show Cuban influence in them; this stems from the early part of the 20th century (from the 30s to the very early 50s) when Cuban music had a great influence in American music, which was itself going through evolutionary changes. Incidentally, expect big band music from that time, but it's not all that good. A few of the songs belong to the school of music which insists of blowing as hard as you can into brass instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song book with Piano Accompaniment","review":"Songs from Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific, The King And I, The Sound Of Music, State Fair, Allegro, Me And Juliet, Pipe Dream, Cinderella, Flower Drum Song, with commentary on each Musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIEW QUOTES","review":"\\"Political content and experimental technique mix powerfully in Jaffe's fourth book of fiction.

The content is very meaningful though. It made me think that 1984 seems so long ago and we definitly passed it and we ARE as bad as 1984 once warned us we would be, and WORSE. The thing that got me was that no matter how bad things are and no matter how bad things are proven to be, we just sort of go along on our merry way.

Orwellian use of language is demonstrated with chilling effect.This film ties together the corporate, political and media machines in a particularly brilliant way with a combination of interviews, news footage and factually-based commentary.Admittedly, this film is a bit depressing in the same way the Orwell's novel 1984 is depressing, but very, very powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"level vials failed","review":"I have owned the LM30 about three years.

This is one of those the books that I read at least once or twice a year. I highly recommend this book for beginning JL fans and novice romance readers. You will not be disappointed. True veterans like myself probably already own two or three copies and are nodding their heads in agreement. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval Adventure","review":"Ranulf is a soldier for hire. He is hired to kidnap Reina and return her to her betrothed husband. All too soon he discovers that he has been tricked. Reina's real betrothed husband died and her father also has died before arranging another marriage for her. Realizing that she and her people and lands are vulnerable, she offers to marry Ranulf. He has money, but no lands. She has lands, but little money. At first, Ranulf is hesitant. He doesn't have much use for a Lady, but realizes that it is an opportunity he can't turn down. Besides, he likes a woman that will stand up to him. As you can expect, these two fall in love despite their initial annoyance with each other. A charming and amusing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

Ranulf and Reina are such a joy to follow through their troubles and strifes to finally find the love that each of them knew, but didn't want to admit was there all along.

She is, by far, one of my favorite Kallmaker characters. I was definitely hoping she and Rayann would be successful in their romance. Kallmaker handled Rayann's \\"hurt and pain\\" throughout the book realistically. While the romantic in me wanted more from Teresa and Rayann by the book's end, I still recommend the book.

So many of us dwell in guilt and agony. Few of us have the guts and heart it takes to believe that there is hope for the future. This book was a testament to living through agony, suffering from guilt, and knowing that the future holds the promise of happiness.

Hope, love, and happiness....imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking, Disappointing","review":"After being enthralled by Touchwood, I was hoping that there would be a sequel in which the Louisa's and Rayann's life together would be further explored. What did they laugh about, cry about, fight about? How did they dance the dance of their existence together? So many avenues to explore.Without knowing what happens in Watermark, I bought it and was deeply disappointed. I was asked to believe in the depth of Louisa's and Rayann's love for one another through the mechanism of grief preventing Rayann from exploring love with a more suitable, \\"younger\\" partner.

He merely seems to report on what he has read and 'synthesized' from many great thinkers, but I fail to see his original contribution.

I never cared for \\"Head First\\" since the melody deteriorates badly on the chorus, but the rest of the album has a rich appealing '80s style rock sound similar to Journey, Nelson, or Styx, with acoustic guitars mixed with electric guitars, harmony electric guitar lines, high vocals with harmonies, and strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aah...Nostalgia","review":"It's about time someone re-released the entire Babys collection.

What a stupid choice on my part. I expected to be at least a little entertained, but by the end of the movie I was confused. The movie was a jumble of nonsense and an undeveloped plot. While sitting through the credits, I pondered about the actual purpose of the movie. By the time it was over, I was still asking myself if it ever really began. And that kid, Patrick, was so terrified and traumatized through out the movie, and then at the end he was suddenly okay with everything. It didn't make any sense! Well, my point is that it wasn't a very good movie. It was a waste of time.

Aside from the special effects, there is nothing here. Fake, stereotypical characters made even more intolerable by some of the most horrendous acting I've seen outside of Seventh Heaven stumble through a plot that would insult the intelligence of a retarded howler monkey. It's a shame, too, because real life Komodo Dragons trully are some of the scariest predators around. The fact that there's not a single effectively tense scene in the entire film, then, is even more proof that whatever team collaborated to shove out this piece of garbage should never do so again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie!","review":"I enjoyed Komodo, but these sort of movies appeal to me.

There are a lot of things that are just plain bad about this film: the acting, the direction, the characterization, the unoriginal storyline etcetera, etcetera. However, the few good things (some cool special effects; the overall corniness) actually make the film watchable. It's kinda fun to laugh at the stupid choices that the characters make, then laugh even harder when they get gnawed on by the impressive lizards. All in all, if you're in the mood for a light comedy, errr, I mean, thriller, then this movie is okay.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot?","review":"Why were komodo dragon eggs dumped on this island in the first place?

May be interesting to some, but I skimmed through the book as best I could (not set up with a working ebook index at all). The best I could tell there really was no story at all, just this long speach about defining literature. Is a newspaper article literature? How about advertising brochures?

Sissy plays a telephone operator in a small Texas town during World War II, raising her two boys and keeping to herself. While fending off the frightening attentions of a couple of the local yokels, she causes a great deal of consternation by taking up with a sailor passing through.

Looking at my life's path has given me new insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Message","review":"My brother-in-law suggested this book and so I gave it a try. I liked the message in it and it was an easy read. I am guessing this is a book that network marketers are all told to read.

While Kenny Werner, Johannes Weidenmueller, and Ari Hoenig get into some seriously brainy and complex metric superimposition, the tunes never lose their elegant beauty. Selections from this record show how compelling music can be when its intellectual complexity is matched by its aesthetic substance. Kenny Werner's trio should serve as an excellent standard for all modern and progressive jazz musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toto - Circa 1980's","review":"I picked this CD up years ago because it was a good mix of Toto material to have in the context of a single CD.

I was not disappointed; indeed, the information on Property Editors literally rescued my project.The book is massive, with extra chapters on CD ROM. However, it is written in such a way that each chapter is self contained and you don't have to read it all to benefit from it.This book should is likely to become the C++ Builder Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best with databases","review":"This book is not for beginners, if you want to learn purchase the Teach Yourself C++ Builder 3 in 21 days. The material in this book is for intermediate to advanced level developers. The flat file database, relational database and InterBase chapters are great. The DCOM, OLE and DirectX are very hard, you must know the API and technology to understand them i guess, I skipped them. What I didn't like was that some chapters of the book are in PDF format at the CD ROM.

And with a melting block of ice sitting on an angled piece of plastic with nothing holding it there look out for the luge to slide off and shatter. Better off getting a one time use and calling it a day (much better success with the single use ones). Every time I have used one it has SERIOUS problems, of which I don't experience at all with the single use molds. Try searching for the mold from \\"Lugez\\" works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but poor craftsmanship","review":"I bought this item in anticipation of a wild evening with friends. Logistically, this item is difficult to prepare, especially if you have a small freezer. The width of my freezer could not accommodate the tray, so I had to use my neighbor's freezer, which was a pull out drawer. You cannot fill the entire tray with water, or you will get it everywhere. Instead, you fill it half way, then add the rest by hand via glasses of water. The mold came out looking ok, but cracked as soon as I tried to remove the ice. They should have constructed it with a stronger plastic. Additionally, the pegs should be longer. The angle is far too shallow to get an experience of reasonable length. I ended up having to place books under the pegs to elevate the luge so people weren't standing there for 10 minutes waiting for the liquor to come down the shoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Got this for my little cousin and she loved it. Haven't asked her how it was... but the WOW factor was there. Fun neat gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept - poor execution","review":"I just can't get behind this. It's a great idea but just too hard to use. No thought in the construction \\"yeah, we'll make a plastic box to fill with water\\". Lips on the edges to at least HELP prevent spills would be nice.Imagine yourself filling this thing with water (12-14lbs) up to the very EDGE, and then having to lift it up, over, and into your freezer. I would like to hear from anyone who hasn't layered the bottom of their freezer with ice after using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Party Item","review":"I recently bought one for my 21st birthday bash. The first time my husband filled it he didnt read the directions so it didnt come out right(his fault not the product). I was afraid it was going to break like previous reviews had stated but I dethawed the ice and no breaks or chips occurred. We froze another one for the party and left it in our chest freezer for about 2 days. It set up great and the mold withstood the weight of the ice with no problem. It was a huge hit at my party, we put glow sticks and a flashlight underneath the ice to light it it up outside in the dark. So many shots were done with this and the ice held up through it all. After all this the mold is still great and I plan on using it many more times. My recommendation is to follow instructions, let the ice dethaw a bit from the mold and put in warm water for 10-20 minutes before attempting to get it out. We didn't bend and twist the mold to try and get it out so the mold wouldnt break, it came out perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheep Plastic","review":"This product is fun but it only worked once before it broke.

This thing couldn't be easier to use, simply fill to the line and let freeze (about 24hrs). The trick to remove the ice is let it sit on the counter for about a half hour, then flip it over. Do not run water over it or try to force the block out, the ice will crack and so will the mold. I have made about a dozen without a single problem.I made a rack where I can stack three at a time, like water falls where it will flow from to the other, talk about a brain freeze! I can fit 5 of these in a cooler so the lugeing never stops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Not worth the $20.. Find a local place that does Block Ice and make your own luge. The plastic container is cheap and doesnt carve out trails well and the mouths are too close. In the NY/CT area, try the Icehouse of danbury, thats the only place I know who does block ice around here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea poor design","review":"I have to say once the first shot goes down and the edge is wet and melting all the shots are going to dribble down the edge and not into the glass. I would also make it so that you could make each side by itself it takes up less freezer space and you could run one luge at twice the length. When filling make sure it is as flat as possible because if it freezes with any lump/bump it will almost never sit \\"safe\\" enough in the tray.Overall I was not happy with this.Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, But It's a One Time Use Product","review":"I read the review by someone else that warned it was a one-time use product, so I was really careful when I dumped the ice block out of the mold. I ran hot water over the top to loosen it up a bit. It came out reasonably easy and it was fun at the party. However, I just went to fill it up again and there is a hole in the mold now so it's basically useless.If you don't mind spending the ~$20 for a one time use thing, it's pretty good. But if you want to use it more than that, you will be very lucky to be able to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds more fun than it really is","review":"The mold broke the first luge I made. Then when removing the ice luge, it broke in half. Made another one after a temporary repair on the mold. Difficult to get the luge to stay on the holder, ice melts fast (it was only 46 degrees outside) towards the bottom and makes it difficult to get shot into glass at bottom. Shot glasses started at the top as full and by the time it went through the luge and into the shot glass (after spilling) shot glass was only half full. Sounded like a great party idea but I was disappointed and would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but only if you skip the shot glasses","review":"I bought one of these at Urban Outfitters, and thought how fun it would be to have an ice luge at a party! It's very important that it freezes on a level surface, but there's no way anything you pour down the chutes will end up in a glass like the picture suggests.If you're throwing a party with really close friends that don't mind sucking off the same block of ice, this is the ice luge for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"luge is a loser","review":"We froze this three times. Once it cracked upon loosening it. It got bubbles in it that prevented the booze from flowing down the path. We used a small torch to attempt to improve it, which ice carvers do, and we still couldn't make it work as the pathways are too shallow, and there is no lip or funnel design at the end of the run to place your glass under. So the liquid just runs all over the place. It's a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Product is junk. Broke not one but two of them on the first use.

If so then the product is just junk in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great gift idea, but flimsy product","review":"I got this luge as a birthday gift...So excited to ry it out at the next party - definitely takes a few days to freeze and takes up a lot of space in the freezer so be prepared. The base cracke the first time it was used, and had a hard time getting the ice to mount in the first place. Got about 4 shots out of it total before it was a wet, melting mess.

I found this movie funny not only because I enjoy sarcastic humor, but because many of the stereotypes, I have found, are almost too close to reality, even if stretched a little. One thing I did notice is that even if you are LDS, but have never spent time in the Utah LDS culture, then many of the jokes wouldn't make sense or seem remotely humorous. This movie wasn't meant to be intellectually stimulating, just a light entertainment. I have been disappointed with movies that have come out since \\"The RM\\" like \\"Down and Derby\\" and \\"Home Teachers\\" which are awful, but I find myself returning again and again to \\"The RM\\" for some good laughs.

(I know they are made by the manufacturer because a dentist gave my wife two packages, because he was discontinuing carrying the product. That should tell you something!)My wife bought this toothbrush from her orthodontist. She likes it, but I'm ready to throw it out the window! It is fast becoming an expensive doorstop.

Unlike the \\"razor blade model\\" that gives away the razor for free to lock you into purchasing expensive blades, this is a double whammy: 1. Unlike the razor, Rotadent is outrageously priced because it is only comparable to the cheapest models from Oral B or Sonicare that cost one fifth (20%) the price of a Rotadent. 2.

It compiles many hard to find works in one volume, and therefore is worth having if you like Chesterton and want to sample a variety of his writings. The reason my review lacks five stars is because for one, the introductory essay has some biographical facts wrong, and secondly, there is no bibliography, source notes, or index. Chesterton himself always rates five stars, of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts great, can't beat the price","review":"If you're on a budget, these are terrific. They're not Freud, obviously, and they don't cut quite like Freud, but they're darn close enough for basic work. Just take care of them, and you'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good supplement, but not a primary disc","review":"For Bob Wills fans, this budget CD might be worth adding to the collection--as I did--for some of the tracks that are hard to find elsewhere. Chief among these is \\"Dusty Skies\\", which is one of the most beautiful western songs ever written. At the time, I couldn't find it anywhere else, but it is now available on a 28-track CD called \\"King of Lonestar Swing\\" that has become my favorite Bob Wills CD, along with \\"The Essential Bob Wills.\\" Cotton-eyed Joe is also not generally found on Bob Wills CDs, but be warned that you might never get it out of your brain and will be humming it forever. So, a good supplement for the avid collector--worth the price for \\"Dusty Skies\\" alone--but not the desert island disc by this great musician. Too many of the classics are missing from this disc to make it the primary choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The critical matter of the book consumes almost half its pages, but the letters themselves are charming.The other review -- though very helpful -- seems to be literally retyped from Millicent Bell's excellent introduction to the book. The phrases are exactly the same. Hello? A Reader? Is your name Millicent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Originals","review":"This book offers the non-James Scholar the opportunity to read, in the original, letters, until recently not widely available, from James to Andersen. Letters that are often cited in the argument that James was a closeted homosexual. These letters with their gushing enthusiasm and 'laying on of hands' tend to support that viewpoint.The letters also provide a view into James' art and how he viewed his own acts of creation. Not for every James reader, but well worth the money if you want to go 'backstage', behind the traditional biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mix","review":"I completely disagree with the main editorial review of this CD.

It's everything you'd expect from Diggers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as seamless","review":"this is a good cd to groove to, but it is a bit on the choppy side, as a digger fan i bought it and am not dissapointed in the music or beats just not smoooooooooooothe as is expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mix of 2002","review":"Full disclaimer: I'm not a trance fanatic, and up until now; I've never been a fan of John Digweed.I listened to most of the first track, and scanned through the rest of this mix at a record store listening booth. It didn't jump out at me, but it was on sale and I was in the mood for something different, so I bought it.I've listened to this cd about eleven times in the last four days and the stand out track, for me, is \\"Dust\\" by Pole Folder and CP, with it's subtle and moody vocals, and haunting and melodic production. It really sets the tone for the entire mix, which builds to a sublime and emotional climax by the time it gets to the remix of Shakespeare's Sister's \\"Black Sky\\".I was amazed to read the bad reviews by the, apparently, hardcore Digweed fans. If you want a beautiful, moody, and chill mix to listen to while driving around at night: ignore the bad comments and pick this baby up. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive House Dreamstate!!!!","review":"This is NOT the type of CD where you can bounce between tracks. This is a mix that is very cinematic in it's scope, it should be enjoyed from beginning to end. The tempo varies from break beat to swirling, climaxing prog house.Standout tracks include Te Quiero, Black Sky and I Have Put Out the Light, which are sequenced and mixed flawlessly with powerful emotional effect. This is the perfect soundtrack to vibing and mingling with friends, or crusing downtown at night. Grab this one and let it grow on you, true believers will be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix but expected a lot more.....","review":"I guess when you are the #1 Dj in the world people do expect a lot from you and here is an example....this is a great cd, and I think it is one of the best cd's of 2002, but coming from Digweed, I expected a little better......Also I feel that if you are buying this cd becasue you want to know what digweed is all about....don't.....buy Communication or Global unerground LA.....This cd is for major digweed fans that love his mixing and his dark selestions.........A great cd but expected more from Digweed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper010101 is dead on with his review.","review":"I couldn't agree with keeper anymore than I do.

But Digweed and Sasha sets are the only ones I can listen to again and again and again.The thing I like about Digweed is that no two of his disks are the same. You never know what to expect - except the unexpected and a high quality set. Some people have called MMII \\"boring.\\" What would have been boring is if he'd churned out a clone of his stunning but brutal Global Underground LA set.Digweed isn't that dull. Beautiful, strange, and ultimately uplifting, this disk may well be his best effort yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK...not as good as Los Angeles","review":"see title of review, if you want some good digweed, go for los angeles, though this one is alright.

The first few tracks, however, didn't grab me much. Nothing against breakbeat, but they were just too polite and, well, bland. But the mix gets much more interesting as it progresses. In some ways, the later 4/4-based songs are both a step forward and a step back; often sounding both progressive and retro (the frequent use of loping breakbeat loops layered over a 4/4 kick, for example, has a late ninties-meets-now feel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Is what I would like to know. Not up to par for Digweed. And I have seen him spin and listen to his radio show all the time, and he is the man. This cd is bland, lifeless and just average, which is really not necessary for someone with his skill and selection set. Oh well, disappointment for a long awaited cd after his great LA set. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digweed shows his chill out side","review":"Warning: if you are looking for another Digweed progressive house style look somewhere else. This one is more of a chill out album than his Global Underground releases.Im not saying it is a bad album. It's just that Im not into the chill out style of dance music out there. It does have some nice ambient trance like feel to it but that is about it. This one is really for the true Digweed fans out there. So if your looking for something to bob your head or dance your bottom off then you'll be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"If you listen to this CD you will not believe that John Digweed came out with something like this.

If you're an immature teenager or a frustrated adult go ahead and buy this. The characters are not likeable and very two-dimensional. The only \\"selling points\\" and I use the term loosely, would be the extreme blood and sex that can be seen throughout the film (scratch that, the sex and violence ARE the film). I had to sit through this video to review it. Whoever made this video is what could be termed as a deviant sociopath with repressed misogynistic tendencies (insane and hates women with a passion but doesn't show it outwardly). You've been warned, buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Anime Hell!!!!!","review":"I could not sit by and watch this monumental pile of garbage get five star reviews. I've been watching Anime for eight years, and this is one of the worst I have seen. The flimsy plot is completely drowned by triple X rated pornoraphic rape scenes. If you have the intelligence of a small woodland creature, or are a pubescent sadist with a jar of vaseline and a box of tissues, then this movie is for you. Sex and violence are great , but if I wanted to watch a porno, it would not be animated porn!!.

We purchased the CD specifically for this song as my daughter wanted to sing it for her school's Talent Show. It did not include any bonus track and this song was not included on the CD. As the CD showed up just a few days prior to her audition, there was not enough time to return the item or purchase the track from anywhere else.

Avoid this atlas!","review":"I bought this at a quickie mart in Florida after we moved here and have since found it VERY difficult to use. The exit numbers are the wrong, old numbers (as another reviewer points out). In addition, the maps are sparse on detail and confusingly laid out. There are map numbers and page numbers and the adjoining edges are marked with map numbers, not page numbers, so you have to find the maps yourself. Everything in the book is done this way.Although I had hoped for a Thomas Bros. map (Look them up for California -- They're the best!), the company doesn't do Florida.

It seems to be the only one that ISN'T published by American Map (A division of Langenscheidt, I'm surprised to learn).-- D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead Story Fantastic, Other Merely Very Good","review":"Milhauser is best in evoking strange environments, cast with oddball characters engaged in offbeat, sometimes magical plots. It is speculative fiction at it best. The lead story, August E., is by far the best of the lot, and the longest, a novella about a strange boy and his ability to construct amzaingly advanced clockwork automatons which were the rage in the 19th Century. The plot takes surprising, interesting twists. The book would be worth the price on the strength of this wonderful story itself, and the others, all solid, quirky tales.

Maybe someday Hollywood and a real horseman will get together to make a movie that shows the real nature of horses and horsemanship.12/21/11 Update: Buck's no real horseman at all and he proved it in the movie \\"Buck\\". Buck's mishandling of a stallion in the film resulted in a man getting bit in the face and the stallion given the death sentence. A real horseman keeps people safe and saves horses lives. Buck is just a show-off that knows a few tricks to exploit horses and people that don't know much about horses to make a buck.

I think this is a must read for anyone who is involved with horses. That said - I'm not sure how interesting it would be to non-horse people. I guess I'll give it to some of my non-horse-obsessed friends and see what they think.

Seven of the tracks originally appeared on Selena's 1986 album Alpha. The remaining tracks appeared on early albums released in 1987 and 1988. Four tracks appear on the recent Anthology collection and one appears on Siempre Selena. The remaining five tracks are not otherwise available on CD. These tracks are Pensando En Ti, Con Esta Copa, Pero Como Te Ha Ido, Dame Un Beso and Dulce Amor. All ten tracks are in Spanish and the lyrics are included.This is a Tejano album of cumbias and rancheras. It may not appeal to fans of Selena's mature style who prefer her popular and English recordings, but Selena's rich voice dominates throughout. It's hard to believe that she was in her early teens when these tracks were recorded. This collection showcases the early years of one of the greatest voices in popular music.

A fair price point would be around $25 not $45.The helmet is thin plastic with packing grade foam inserts...a red sticker declares \\"not protective head gear\\"...no kidding. The poly-blend uniform could not be cheaper in feel and appearance. Again, you don't expect top of the line gear for a kid's set, but I wouldn't shell out $45 for a Halloween costume for an 8yr. old. And if I did, it would have to be a lot more impressive than this product.I want to add that when the seller became aware of my disappointment they were very responsive and offered a refund and to pay for return shipping. They also located and sent a chin strap that was missing for the set.

The tv works extremely well, when attached via coax.

Although the native resolution for the LCD is 1280 x 768 it can support way beyond that unlike most LCD TV that also support VGA input for a PC. The only downside was that I was hoping to be able to use a DVI connection for better quality but unlike it says in the specification it does not have a DVI input.I would recommend this to anyone who is either looking for a PC monitor that can be used as a TV or a TV that could be used as a PC. I currently am using it for both and it has been working out great.

Dr. Aronowitz works with eating disorder patients, and it's easy to see why her sound, reasonable advice works. Every weight-obsessed woman should read this book. It's very helpful and practical, breaking healthy eating down to a system that's easy to understand, with explanations of why sugar is better for your weight than sweeteners, and how to deal with uncontrolled cravings. I'm currently working with a nutritionist, and Dr. Abby's views are consistent with what I'm learning, and give a very helpful look at the issues from a different angle.

If you like her latest album \\"Fever\\", then chances are that you're going to like this one just as much. The sounds are very eclectic on the cd, From disco sounds to futuristic waves. Kylies voice is also better than ever!!! Some songs from this cd that really stand out are:-Spinning around (which some may have heard the mixed version of before but not have known it was Miss Kylie)-on a night like this-Butterfly (Is on the album Fever but taken from this one. A great song)-Love boat (fun, catchy song)-so now goodbye- Light Years (probably the best song on this album. So strong, and out there it will give u chills :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie's Light Years ahead","review":"This album takes Kylie back to her roots - pure pop - and infuses it with a strong blend of higly dancable, infectious backbeat. Sure it's high camp, but that makes for a pleasant change from the plain pop that her competition have been putting out there lately. This takes Kylie out of the darker, more personal albums like Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess, and returns her to centre stage where she belongs. With a handfull of number-one singles, it's surprisingly not springled with a few good songs and a lot of filler like her earlier albums - everything on this one is good. Kylie has brought with her a host of top-name collaborators on this album to turn out what is probably the best pop album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un chez d'oeuvre de plus","review":"Ah que ces bon d'entendre Kylie chanter, surtout quand ces aussi bon. Avec les incontournables comme Spinning Around et On a Night like This ( ambiance discothèque assurée ) et aussi de Please Stay ( d'inspiration espagnol ), pas de doute ces 3 titres sont des chez d'uvre .Les autres sont très bons et je remercie Kylie de son passage en francais dans You Disco Needs You et dans Loveboat (quelques mots). A savoir que ma seule déception viendrais de Kids (en duo avec Robbies Williams) ambiance guitare électrique trop forte à mon got, sinon a part ce titre le reste c'est du tout bon.

I've got the australian tour edition of this album which also includes a 11 track disc w/remixes & Kylie's cheeky version of \\"Physical\\". My fave tracks on this album are Spinning Around, Kookachoo, Loveboat & Please Stay. My least fave track would have to be Your Disco Needs You, it reminds me too much of a marching band and you can't really dance to it! All in all this is a really great album!! Get her earlier stuff too, it's all awesome & her forthcoming album \\"Fever\\" will be out in October and it's got her new hit \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\"!! Hopefully she'll get recognized here in the states soon cuz we're missing out on a royal treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Past","review":"After quite a lot of hype about this c.d. (well - there was in the UK) I was pretty dissappointed when I finally got around to buying and listening to it. The two dance(ish) songs - 'Spinning Around' and 'On a Night Like This' are fairly good, although pretty average as far as a dance tune goes. The duet with Robbie - 'Kids' is also good (but if you want to have this single buy the Robbie album instead - 'Sing when your Winning'). However, the rest of the album is utterly awful - all the songs seem to be stuck in the 80's. Its a shame to say that Kylie hasn't moved on!! Its also worth noting that the three fairly good songs on the album (mentoined above) are the only ones not written with Kylie's input. The rest of the songs are written partly by Kylie and they certainly do reflect her influence as they are all bad 80's style songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover says it all...","review":"After attempting to listen to the awful musical train-wreck called \\"Fever\\", I thought that I would see if her earlier work was any good. After all, some performers' earlier work is better that their new stuff. But I'm afraid this CD is just as terrible as \\"Fever\\", her only talent seems to be displaying her booty on the cover (although it is a very nice booty). I'm spoiled I guess, listening to good house/club music like Ben Watt, Sasha&Digweed, Faithless and others. Why do people like bad club garbage like this? It always mystifies me. Support good music, watch her videos if you must (I recommend turning the sound down while watching her bounce around the screen) don't buy this lame CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album by Kylie So-Far","review":"This is by far the best album by Kylie. Starting with SAW pops, she tried to become an indie-queen; and now Kylie seems to have found her \\"real-self\\" - Disco! Apart from the record-breaking Spinning Around, second-hit On A Night Like This; other excellent songs include Kids (with Robbie Williams), Disco Down, So Now GoodBye, Your Disco Needs You, and Under the Influence of Love - all potential number one charters. Overall, my opinion is that every song is a potential chart-hitters; something I cannot say about any of her previous albums. This is probably due to the fact that she has really discovered herself, she knows what's the best for her, and she wrote nearly half the songs herself. Kylie fan or not, everyone will be impressed by this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie's disco inferno","review":"After flirting with a slightly darker and more mature sound on \\"Impossible Princess\\", Kylie Minogue returned to her pop roots with \\"Light Years\\". What makes this CD so charming and interesting is that instead of copying current pop music trends, Kylie borrows more from classic disco and showtunes, with a hint of modern techno thrown in. The result is a jubilant, tongue-in-cheek party album. And who can resist that?My favorite tracks are: \\"Disco Down\\" (a disco anthem, as if you couldn't tell by the title), \\"Koocachoo\\" (pure bubblegum pop), \\"Love Boat\\" (sounds like a kitschy showtune) and \\"Kids\\" (a duet with the equally sexy and campy Robbie Williams)."},{"rating":"2","title":"the guiltiest of pleasures","review":"While Fever is the album that has finally broken Kylie in North America, this previous set is in fact a far more infectious, highly camp and totally satisfying FUN album. Light Years combines all of the best elements of 70s disco-pop wrapped up in state of the art production, lyrics that are disposable (without being insulting), irresistible beats and a completely winning sense of humour. Imagine the perfect soundtrack to a cocktail/disco/pool party and you have it. I still return to this album when getting ready for a night on the town - there's none better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The begining of Fever!","review":"I really recommend this cd to the fans that bought Fever.

It is a huge step back from her last studio album \\"Impossible Princess\\", which was ace. That was the real Kylie but in order to be popular she is compelled to record music like this. Sad that people prefer this dreadful, commercialised music to her earlier, credible work.DETESTABLE! HORRID! CHEAP!pop-dance track \\"Butterfly\\" is tolerable, and though \\"On A Night Like This\\" is pretty good, I find it hard to take an artist seriously who gets more babyish and immature as she grows up.\\"Please Stay\\" is so gaudy and much too \\"gay\\". Just check out the horrid video to the track - how the hell did this reach the top 10?!! (By the way I'm NOT homophobic!)I don't even like her duet \\"Kids\\", with Robbie Williams. It sucks. And \\"Under The Influence Of Love\\" makes her voice sound so shrill and annoying.The title track \\"Light Years\\" sounds unoriginal and dull.Avoid this album like the plague.

Also, you can place sequential dowels with similarly excellent precision.The tool is easy to use and the accompanying documentation and video is excellent. The jig is well made and sturdy.My only gripe with the product itself is that it would be somewhat easier to use if it were slightly larger. The jig is only about four inches long.Having said that, it is an excellent tool and a nice complement to biscuit and pocket hole joinery. It adds a lot of flexibility to woodworking.

It started great but I was quickly disappointed when in the middle of the first song the music died because it was interrupted by interviews of the band members. Why would anyone think it's cool to be listening to a great song and all of a sudden stop the music to hear someone talking?

It doesn't matter if you are watching them on a television set with one speaker or a full blown, dedicated, high end home theater system. However be sure of what you are buying. Read the reviews. The single worst thing a producer can do to an otherwise quality performance like \\"The Last Supper\\" is to interrupt the show with interviews and such. Extras are wonderful but the appropriate place for them is in the \\"extras\\" area of the disk NOT in between songs or worst yet in the middle of a song.

The humor between the band when talking of past experiences is first class. I recommend this DVD to any Black Sabbath fan. If there is one draw back its the interruptions of the songs when the band members talk of how the song came about. This small hiccup is eventually over looked when you seat back crank up the volume and drift off with with the Masters of Reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Band- Bad DVD","review":"Don't expect to enjoy a Black Sabbath concert. Almost every song is interrupted (in most cases at a critical point in the song) by interviews with band members. Why not put the interviews at the end or on a bonus DVD? When you're actually listening to the concert, the band is raging but the interviews (although somewhat interesting and funny) totally ruin the mood. On the positive, Ozzy sounds great, remembers the words, and is into the performances. Unfortunately he reminds me of an elderly person shuffling around looking like he's going to fall on his face at any moment. Borrow it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Concert DVD!!!","review":"When my husband and i saw this in stores, we were excited. We love Sabbath. Got it home, and the songs were interuppted by interviews. The other reviews were right. It's bad, don't expect a concert. We have other music dvd's. They all have a feature where you can watch the concert with or without the interviews. not this one. poor job, guys, poor job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was buying a concert film","review":"Everytime I was getting into a song I was really starting to enjoy, a stupid interview with the band would intrude and ruin the song for me. This happens many, many times and just ruined what would of been a killer concert. When I buy a concert DVD, I want to watch a concert. Put the interviews in the special features!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I put off buying this DVD for the longest time because of some of the bad reviews on here. Let me just say I wish I would have ignored all of them, because I really love this DVD. Yes, they interrupt the concert footage to do interviews. So what? I found the interviews very interesting, everybody was very relaxed and spoke from the heart. Yeah, they could have put the interviews at the end of the songs, so as not to interrupt the songs. But, overall, I really enjoyed it and think any true Sabbath fan will as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"As with most of the other reviews I was really disappointed in the interruptions of the songs by interviews. This is already destined for the next garage sale. I am disappointed since I really am a fan (still have their vinyl albums) and was hoping for great undiluted music. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music","review":"Why do they interrupt the music with interviews? Thats what the special feature function on DVD's are for!John"},{"rating":"2","title":"back from hell","review":"Come on now!. We have all heard these songs before! I admitt it is exciting to hear the original Sabbath playing these tunes again but its just as equally exciting to hear them \\"finally\\" talking about how these tunes came about! Just revel in both!. Buy the cd if you just want to hear the music for gods sake people!. The interviews are \\"not\\" an intrusion but a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible production. A disappointment.","review":"While the music and concert footage is great, two things ruin this DVD. In the middle of songs, the video will cut away to interviews while the audio from the song is heard in the background. It completely ruins the experience of being at the concert. The video is also badly edited. When a song is playing you will see shots with, for example, the drummer without a shirt on. The camera will cut away to the guitarist and you can see the drummer in the background *with* a shirt on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of a Black Sabbath concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews... How can the members of Black Sabbath allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? My only hope is that they will release these performances someday in their entirety, but they probably won't... Such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. Black Sabbath is one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks","review":"Thank you all people, i was going to buy this DVD but not anymore... if the songs are cut because of the interview, it's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst concert DVD's ever","review":"Don't waste your money on this mess, as it's chopped up with dialog in the middle of songs.

Ozzy, how can you do this to us? We love you and look at what you did to us. You killed my buzz and I had to put on some Megadeth instead. Shame on you SHARON for sticking your nose where it don't belong! You need to be fired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I have purchased every darn thing Black Sabbath possible. When I saw a Black Sabbath DVD I got real excited. I expected what ever they put out to ignore any post 1979 Sabbath as that seems to be the deal they struck to get the toasted Ozzman back. The interviews cutting up the songs add to the irritation. Teach the producers of this DVD lesson and don't buy it! I know you've got to see it, so rent it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited.","review":"One might find it annoying to watch this due to its poor editing, songs were interrupted by interviews, this lousy kind of editing have been previously done in the Black Sabbath Story Vol 2, at least that one was a documentary while this one, The Last Supper, was a concert/live show and the playing should not be interrupted by interviews in the middle of the songs. Anyway I kept this DVD just for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Needs Re-Released!","review":"The performance is great, but they should NOT interrupt the concert with the interviews! They could have easily put them as a separate option to watch apart from the concert itself! That and they blended footage from 6 concerts together, which you begin to wonder how Ozzy can throw 3 buckets of water on the crowd, wearing 3 different outfits, in the span of 30 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"I went to see this tour when they were in town, and was thrilled to be able to purchase this DVD. When it came I could not wait to watch it, and upon doing so, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment, followed by anger. How can they even sell this thing - nearly every song is interrupted right in the middle to hear the band talk. Put the talking after the music - I imagine others who went to the show were as astounded as I that they would do this to such an amazing concert. If you went, and loved the music, I would not recommend this DVD, unless they re-release it without the continuous interruptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE! Re-release this product using another producer","review":"He Mr. producer: learn something from the real fans: NEVER interrupt songs in a video again. I can't enjoy it now. Without this it would be a 4 or 5 star DVD. Too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do over, PLEASE!","review":"I've had this DVD since it came out and haven't watched it in years. I just pulled it back out and remembered why. I am reading through all these other reviews and everyone says the same thing. The interview interruptions are unforgivable. Don't get me wrong, I love a good documentary and I will watch one about a band I don't even like, like Nirvana, just to learn the history and hear the characters tell their stories. This could have been a magnificent DVD if they had allowed all the songs to play though uninterrupted and save all the interviews for in between or a separate disc. It's great to hear Bill tell the story of the opium-induced title for NIB, BUT NOT DURING THE SONG. If anyone who has anything to do with Sabbath (SHARON!!!) is reading this, please go back to the drawing board and do this video right. Also, why 1999? Isn't there footage from the TRUE 1997 Reunion shows???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching these guys play is a treat.","review":"The performances are excellent. Watching these guys play is a treat. I'm glad they're getting the respect they've always deserved.The mix is a bit muddy on the low end, so I took off a star for that. Nothing a good remixing and remastering couldn't fix.The mix is excellent for guitar and voice, though. Ozzy's singing is great, and more importantly Tony's guitar tone is absolutely fabulous, as good as on the records.People are complaining about how the performances are interrupted by interviews. This is NOT a problem. Get over it. This is a documentary and a concert film in one. I completely enjoy the intermingling interviews. If you want to hear your Sabbath uninterrupted, go buy the accompanying live CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were great concerts...BUT","review":"The concerts were really great. Black Sabbath was in top form. Ozzy's vocals fantastic. The interviews were interesting and funny. But whom ever put the DVD together really screwed it up bad. You see and hear the beginning of a song then it changes to an interview, goes back for the ending of the song then does the same in EVERY SINGLE SONG!!! It would have been great if they had the concert by its self and the interviews either before or after it. Or seperate as a special feature. Then I would have given it 5 stars. As it is my advice is don't bother it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concert or interview?","review":"I was happy when this DVD has been published and happier when I bought it. Arriving home, my first moves have been: switch on Tv, Amplifier, DVD player and Subwoofer. I sit on the sofa, at the center of a 5+1 speakers crossfire and the concert starts with War Pigs....I raise the volume and enjoy the Sabbath classic sound, at last! The magic ends when, in the middle of the song, a (brief, but breaking) interview starts. I think that such an important reunion has an interesting background, so I listen to the interview. The next song starts, interrupted by another spoken insert. So, I adjust the volume and explore the DVD: every song is mutilated by interviews! Why inserting them in the live songs? DVD carry a huge information amount: there is room for hours and hours of footage....I would have surely watched a full interview, after watching the concert. This DVD is, in my opinion, really disappointing! Sergio"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you sensibly think it's what people want","review":"I have just bought this DVD and was immediatly disappointed by the constant interruption of music by interviews.

The down side is that in the middle of a song, the volume will drop to background music so they can show an interview.

This video is nothing more than a reissue of the old Battle Line series. The series was ok, good footage but a bit dated after 50 years. There are a number of other companies that have done a similar reissue and make it available for a fraction of the price. If you like old WW II documentaries this is ok but you can buy it a lot cheaper from other companies.I am very interested in military history and have bought quite a lot of videos from Amazon over the years. I generally find the Madacy product to be overpriced reissues of old material in a fancy box. Packaging looks great, contents are ok to mediocre. Regardles of your interest in the material it is always available elsewhere significantly cheaper. But if all you want is a fancy box, then by all means this is the product for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie with a Heart","review":"This film was one which worked purely on emotional levels. Matt Dillon and Joan Chen give fine performances as individuals whose cultures' although widely different bring them together in a poignant but tragic way. Although the film tries to cover a large segment of time and simplifies the conflicts exhibited by the 50's and 70's from the cold war to the peace generation it does not lose track with its focus upon how events impact human relationships. Conscience, guilt, love, ambition, and redemption of the human spirit are sensitively embodied in this film. Sounds \\"corny\\", but it works. The entire cast does a fine job and the music score by Elliot Goldenthal is beautiful to hear. Bring a hankerchief. This is a film with a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works okay, but comes apart","review":"I just bought this with my new Cingular phone. I was pretty pleased with it...until I had to charge it. The second or third time I disconnected the charging cord, it pulled off the entire top of the unit and exposed the underlying electronics. I stuck the piece back on, but it now comes off EVERY time I disconnect the charger. I'll be taking this back for a refund or replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jawbone","review":"If I read correctly, I think the previous reviewer is confused about how the Jawbone works. The Jawbone does not reduce your background noise level. What you hear in the background remains the same regardless of environment. However, the Jawbone does reduce what the person on the other end of the line hears that's in your background. Using the previous reviewer's nightclub environment as an example... whoever he talks to (a) will not hear the nightclub music as loudly and (b) will be able to hear his voice more clearly (as noted by the previous reviewer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware- Sorry!","review":"In all honesty, I have been very dissatisfied with my Aliph jawbone. I work in a nightclub and invested in the Jawbone in hopes of the claims of noise reduction being true. I tested it in my car, with moderate stereo volume in the background. There was no reduction in the background noise level with the Jawbone noise reduction on or off. The only difference I noted was a slight improvement in the clarity of my voice. I thought I had a defective one. The same night, I talked to one of our doormen who also had one, but keeps it in his pocket, due to his dissatisfaction with it. Buyers beware, you may be victims of one the best orchestrated scams I have ever seen. [...]. Until then, all I can say is the product DOES NOT reduce background noise, unless maybe you are using very sensitive measuring equipment than can measure DB fractions. Sorry Aliph, thus far it looks like you took this risk and now your busted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Splendid","review":"Again, a wonderful work of James Martin, SJ.

After I saw this IOGear it looks more attractive so I bought it.The more I use it, the more I dislike it. The ear hook is too flimsy that it is not holding it in place. Whenever I move my head, the whole earpiece moves away from my face. It did not fall down completely from my ear, just hanging there with the piece pointing 45 degrees from my face!More importantly, it frequently connects/disconnects while in standby mode, sometimes several times a minute. This is very annoying because your ear is filled with the ding-dong's (it chimes when it connects or disconnects) all the time. Sometimes when you want to take a phone call you'd find out that your headset is not connected!I've returned it once and got a replacement, but the replacement has the same problem. I hope I can get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I got this version from I O Gear as the version that I lost was so terrific. The headset for this model is useless, if you have ears. The earpiece is unusable - whoever designed it and approved its use should be required to wear it an entire day, they would find that it is not possible. Beyond its practical use because of the poor over-the-ear comfort, the headset, when held up to my ear seemed to have decent sound quality - the fact that no one could hear me was more than a little disappointing. Apparently the microphone on my particular headset doesn't work. Since I just received this and discovered that I could not wear the ear piece or could anyone hear me, I am planning to return it. Save yourself the hassle. It is a shame that I O Gear chose to change the design, the previous model was so comfortable, that I did not even know I was wearing the earpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTH THE PRICE","review":"The headset seems to have a lot of static sounds in the backround issues.Don't conform to ear or around ear very easily or securely.

Each lesson revolves around a theme to which all of the listed words relate to. This helps the reader remember the words easier.At first, I was skeptical.

It is the physicality of the book that first engages. The visual art department of my school (8-12 grade) uses this book in both middle and upper school. In upper school each student has a copy of their own and their sketchbook assignments are generated from the words. Between each class meeting a student chooses a word to work from and then links it to another in the book. The lovely cross-referencing of vocabulary allows each student to meander through the book on different paths. The middle school benefits from the words as prompts for design problems and sketchbook exercises.

Here we feel beautiful, flowing, meditative melodies, enabling us space to lie back and discover the delicate balance of going within for a deeper understanding of self and meeting the challenge of contention in the hectic marketplace all too often considered as \\"reality\\".

Otherwise, I wish I would have passed on this one.This makes me very scared to try another Checkfield CD.If anyone has them all, can you please let me know which one(s) if any are similar to Water, Wind and Stone?Thanks and happy music to you all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Printer review","review":"This printer did everything I hoped it would, other than being slightly larger than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!","review":"I purchased this printer in March of 2006 to replace an Epson that I had gotten with the purchase of my Mac.

I am now a loyal Canon user and have had great luck with this printer. It's much faster and the color is much more accurate.

After dealing with print head problems that caused the Epson to drink ink even more than it normally did, I gave in and purchased the Canon all-in-one to replace it(I enjoyed watching the trash man haul the Epson away).The Canon Pixma MP500 works great. The print quality and speed is amazing. I have had no issues at all. The printer software is easy to use and the results have been excellent with scanning, copying, printing text, and printing photos. I definitely recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER","review":"I have had this printer for about two years and it is the worst printer I have ever had. I have had nothing but problems with this printer and the support for Canon is a joke. They will not support their products, plain and simple. Also, the thing uses ink at a record pace and the ink is VERY expensive.The quality of the pictures is good when it works, but that is few and far between. I would strongly recommend against this printer. And yes before I bought it I did all the research but take it from a real consumer this is NOT the printer for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great device - mediocre software","review":"I bought this as an upgrade to my [...] Canon S300 (which was okay, but replacing the ink all the time became very expensive). Love the print quality, great scanning capabilities, great price for such a nice all-in-one.Only one complaint: the software is really designed for the 'generic' user, and isn't as flexible as I'd like. The buyer who had problems printing panoramic photos has my sympathies.Bottom line: if you need an office scanner/printer and want to print some great photos as well, this is the item to buy. If printing photos is your primary reason for buying a printer, try out this software and ensure that it will meet your needs first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, reliable printer.","review":"This is a great printer. I've had it for over 8 months and it's still great. I had three Epsons before this one, and I only had problems. It seemed if you didn't use the printer every day, the ink would constantly dry up and I would spend most of my printing time reprinting things until I got it right. Not an issue with this Canon printer. I just changed the ink for the first time, and the last print from the old magenta tank and the first print from the new one are exactly the same! No time cleaning the ink nozzles, no extra prints.My only issue was in the beginning with getting it to print photos well. After a few tweaks in the software and in my color settings in Photoshop and it's perfect!The scanner works very well and the LCD screen is very helpful. This is must buy for those with an in-home office."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would by Canon MP780 instead","review":"This all-in-one unit using CLI ink cartridge inside. CLI ink cartridge has \\"new technology\\" to prevent users from refilling. The chip inside will not reset even you refill the ink. You have to throw it away and buy new ink cartridge all the time.MP780 is also an all-in-one unit sold on Amazon. It has printer, scanner and fax. MP780 also uses ink tank instead. Refilling ink tank is easy and cheap. Good for the environment, and good for the consumer. Please see my other posting on Amazon for how to refill the Canon ink tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!","review":"I'm very pleased with this printer. I purchased it last year and it has run like a champ. Photos I have printed with it are of decent quality. I did have trouble installing the ink cartridges because the illustration/directions were not very clear, and I kept putting them in bass-ackwards. A friend helped me with this, and other than this very minor issue, installation was smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not a great photo printer","review":"My first pictures out of this printer were disappointing. I could see grain in the darker areas of faces, which actually turned out to be ink pooling. (The problem was not my camera.) I posted a question about it in an online forum for advice and was told to use only Canon paper. No Kodak, HP or anything else that I had been using. I noticed only minimal improvement with Canon paper. Photos are still not to my satisfaction. I tried changing every possible printer setting imaginable. No improvement. Cleaned the printer and no improvement. I'm pretty disgusted with it. Based on everyone's reviews, I expected it to produce pictures similar in quality to any photo processing center. Not the case. I haven't used this printer for anything else, so I cannot comment on it's other capabilities. But for those of you thinking about using it primarily for photos, I would definitely recommend against it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer","review":"Just finished installing Canon PIXMA MP500 and printed some photos off a memory card to test it out. Incredible print quality! I couldn't believe how sharp the images and accurate the color was. My wife commented that they look better than the prints we get from Costco. Took about 1 minute to print each photo and the operation is whisper quiet.Relative to other multifunction printers I suppose this is smaller, but it is still a larger printer. I was hoping the sleek design would translate into a smaller footprint, but it's occupying about 1/6th of my desk space so I'll probably get a separate stand for it and put it underneath.One complaint: no USB cable included to connect the printer to the computer. How moronic is that? I knew to order one after reading other reviews, but that's got to be one of the dumbest things you could do as a manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!","review":"this is a wonderfull all in one, i got it last week from amazon and i got in 3 days with standard shipping, i already printed 26 pictures and scanned many documents, the quality of the pictures is great, i love the paper feed switching bcz in that way u can just put the paper in the bottom and close the other end so dust does not go in there, the bottom feeding has also protection from dust, the scaner is nice too. the only bad thing was that it did not bring the usb cable with it, im glad i could find one at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and a rip off","review":"The printer and scanner work just fine.However, the color ink tanks either dry up quickly or you have to use them up quickly. This would not be a problem except the color tanks must be in operation to print black and white!!!So if you want to print black and white documents, you must spend $50 every 3 months for the color ink cartridges too. You also cannot simply fill the cartridges because the ink tanks have a special chip on them to make sure you use the \\"right\\" ink tanks...Cannon. Basically, you spend 2-4x as much on Cannon ink tanks as you did for the printer. And that's just annually. So don't buy it unless you're printing mostly color photographs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PIXMA MP500 Review","review":"I have owned this unit for only one month but it has met my expectations, even though my printing needs are minimal. As an 80 year old computer nerd, I have been very pleased with the technical help received from Canon.

I expect my future use of this All-in-One and any needed technical assistance to be of the same pleasing caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unreasonable ink consumption, regular messages of ink needs which prevent use until changes are made, and 3 minutes of settings required to make a copy of an 8 1/2 x 11 original onto plain paper make this an unacceptable product in my opinion. It produces an excellent photo, interestingly better from computer hard drive than directly from chip using extra cost XD to CF adapter. Will not function if one of the 2 black cartridges are low. I use another printer for routine printing from computer, and regret getting rid of my old printer which had copying capability when I purchased the MP500. Cannot recommend for anything except photos. Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ON MY 3rd REPLACEMENT","review":"What a disappointment after reading the glowing reviews. After 3 months this printer started streaking and leaving ink on leading edge.

A few months later the problems began again. Replacement #2. And after a few months a third replacement, this one brand new. I am still unable to scan to email or print photos plus more smudging and left paper edge is a bit shredded. I am about to call again for another replacement. One more thing.....it guzzles ink...which, as you know, is costly. I would not recommend this printer and I am searching for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"Enticed by a rebate, the looks, and the ostensible functions of this printer I bought it.

My biggest problem with it is that there seems to be no way to adjust its automatic scan-crop feature. I bought it to use as a scanner on a regular basis, but I cannot predict how much of any given document it will decide to chop off. There is no apparent way to tell it what you want, either. I wish I'd gotten a less expensive machine with a better user interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Printer Ever!!","review":"I absolutely detest this printer. The idea is nice, but the machine is horrible. The first one broke after 2 weeks and we got a warranty replacement.

I will NEVER buy another Canon product. They used to be a good company, but no longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice all in one BUT","review":"This is a very nice all in one scan/print/copy no fax machine. However be prepared to shell out some bucks for the biggest of the 5 cartridges, the PGI-5. I am going thru about 1 every 3 weeks at a cost of about 15 bucks. There is no compatible as of yet. I went thru Office Depot where I paid $15 per but got free shipping on orders of $50 or more. I might have to bring back my Epson for my black ink print jobs. The other four cartridges are wearing very well. If it wasn't for the PGI-5 I would have given this machine 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer for a great price","review":"I love this printer, and find it to be easy to use. One great feature is that it has 2 paper feeds, so you can keep photo paper in one and regular paper in the other. Quality is excellent.

I tried all the cleaning options offered by Canon on their website - none worked. I even emailed Canon's customer support and was told I could either take it in for repair (at my own expense since it was out of warranty) or they offered me 10% off a new printer - from their website.

Pictures produced from this printer were good, but not stellar. Then, after fewer than two years, my Canon Pixma died.

When coping it inexplicably often reset itself to an odd paper size and type, and you must struggle through the menu to set it to the 8.5 by 11 plain paper size most of us usually use. It has two paper feeds and if you don't need to keep two types of paper stored in the machine, this is just another setting to get wrong when printing. I would look for a simpler user interface if I was buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ink eater","review":"I got rid of my old Epson printer because I learned it used all the colors even if you are printing in black. I specifically asked the salesperson if this Canon did the same thing and they said no. I bought the printer and after only using grayscale for the last few months, the colors have miraculously run out. I am not sure if this printer is also using colors to print in black or the ink has dried up, but for a few months??? Another think is that it takes 2 black cartridges, and if one is out, you need to replace it before printing in black, which I don't understand. Other than that, I think it prints wonderfully, and has never given me a problem in terms of printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer","review":"I am very happy with this printer.

My old epson took around 15 to 20 minutes to print something that this printer will print in under 2 minutes. Haven't used the copy function yet but the printer quality is much more than I expected.

Neither the wonderful sound nor technical mastery found on the CD was evident in the live performance given by Ms. Wilcox. Day and night!It is very frustrating these days that \\"performers\\" can simulate high artistic levels with the aid of master editors.

It introduces mechanics with an excellent chapter, which is extremely useful, on matrices, vectors, coordinate systems. The book is excellent for self study as it follows a line of reasoning and the chapters are arranged in a logical order. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is well discussed. Finally there are a lot of exercises for practice"},{"rating":"1","title":"No continuity of thought","review":"This is by far the worst book on mechanics I have seen. There is no attempt to form any conceptual basis about the actual physics of what's going on. The first few chapters on basic Newtonian physics were interesting (mainly because I knew it all), but later chapters were impossible to learn from. Landau&Lifshiz offers a much clearer description of Lagrange-Hamilton mechanics and makes the variational calculus needed for L&H simpler. I wish someone would have told me that while I was taking the course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at Lagrangian & Hamiltonian Dynamics,","review":"I am unsure on why the ratings of this textbook are so low, it is a very solid textbook on undergraduate mechanics. Its treatment of the caclulus of varations and Lagrangian & Hamiltonian dynamics is very elegant and clear. It is the best treatment out there at the undergraduate level.In other topics it is strong as well, but not as strong as the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian treatment. The physical ideas conveyed are very good. The math is not really that formal, it just requires what is needed to do Analytical mechanics: the normal calculus sequence, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra. The problems are not easy, but you can not expect them to be at this level of physics.The only stumbling block of the textbook is at times the mathematical notation (outside of Lagrangian/Hamiltonian Dynamics) is cumbersome and just plain bad. It is just notation however, and it just needs getting used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A not-so-bad book on mechanics","review":"I don't understand why the reviews are so negative on the book. It's certainly not at the top level of undergrad physics books, like Griffiths E&M for example. however, it present the basics in a fairly easy to read and easy to follow way. The price is ridiculous, but most physics textbooks aren't far off from the amount. If you want to see a truly bad undergrad physics textbook that should have been buried long ago, go look at Reif's Stat. Phys. book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professors: Please do NOT adopt this text.","review":"If the physics community is wondering why we are producing physicists at the lowest rate in 40 years, they might consider the quality of their pedagogy. Thornton provides an unnecessary character-building experience while failing to explain the problems that every physics graduate must know. While we are all impressed that his wife was an astronaut, he succeeds only in spoiling the work of the late, great Marion. It was only because of an outstanding professor at Cal State Chico that I learned what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY IS THIS TEXT SO WIDELY USED?","review":"I had to use this poorly written, overpriced book for my course at Cal State L.A. There are insufficient examples, some of which are confusing, and the binding seems to have been deliberately designed to fall apart after a few months (to limit the used market?). The problems sets are sorely lacking in imagination and, as others have noted, poorly worded. I would recommend the Schaum's outline in theoretical mechanics by Murray Spiegel. It is inexpensive and contains a wealth of good examples. When you finally get to sell back Marion at the end of the course , you will still have a good reference on intermediate mechanics and won't feel as bad about the money you lost on M&T."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mathematically formal piece of crap.","review":"The table of contents sure looks promising. Buta pretentious and unnecessary mathematical formalism obscures everything. Simple concepts are made obscure by lousy explanations. Apparently the authors assume that the student is born knowing these concepts.

Lousy overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book","review":"I had the displeasure of using this book over the course of two semesters. \\"Classical Dynamics\\" is poorly constructed, gives weak examples, and the explanations are less than clear.

I like using the book as a reference, but I think that each chapter does a poor job of explaining how to solve the problems that appear in the end of each chapter. There are also very few simple problems in the book that allow one to become used to using new methods (like hamiltonian mechanics, and the use of lagrangians) before using them to solve difficult problems. I would reccommend another mechanics book such as \\"Mechanics\\" by Landau and Lifschitz or \\"Mechanics\\" by Symon.

The only changes Thornton made were bad ones. The examples are incomplete, Symbols are introduced without definition. The problems are challenging if one could ever discern what the question is! To top it all off the author almost blindly takes word for word sections straight out of Goldstein's classic text. Now this is not particularly bad, he is given reference, but Goldstein is thorough. This text is lost in laziness. The key steps which I feel a student needs specific direction, are left out! So a word to instructors who teach undergraduate mechanics...just use Goldstein, and design problems of your own. Marion and Thornton's text is in need for replacement"},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful text","review":"I had the misfortune of taking a class that used this book. This book contains piles of mathematical expressions barely any of which are adequatelly explained. This text is intended to be used in courses that introduce mathematical methods in physics, what it actually does, is present some qualitative ideas and some equations that don't really seem to connect to the text unless you already know the material. This book would make a nice rewiew material for someone who learned the subject already, however, in no way it provides any real insight into the priciples of physics that it attempts to explain.This book really is one of those unfortunate examples that are targeted at beginnig students, but are only readable to professors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Mechanics text","review":"I fail to understand why is this book become a standard required text for undergrad mechanics in all the major American universities. The book describes at length esoteric problems and concepts (such as the falling chain tension using energy conservation in chater 9) while completely ignores basic things such as Principle of Virtual work,statics & stability in systems of Particles. In all it is an average text with lot of useless space age stuff which the author seems to brag about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous, unexpressive, rushed recording","review":"I did not like this version at all. I think the narrator is rushed, monotonous, unexpressive and boring. I could not absorb the material, it was read so quickly that I didn't have time to think about anything. If you want a really good recording, one that is well-paced, and thoughtfully and expressively done, look at the Scourby or Waggoner editions. I think Scourby is the best without a doubt, but Waggoner is a close second, for a very enjoyable learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty and gripping script . . .","review":"This is a very good, well-made play. A social commentary in one sense, and Sondheim's stab at the seven deadly sins. It is very funny to read all of the bitchy quips being tossed back and forth by each of the patients. A dark atmosphere, keeping you on the edge of your seat, and you are always kept guessing. Finding out who the killer is at the end of the first act is a very daring device, and you are left to wonder what would possibly happen in the second act. It is hard for me to say anything more that the other reviewers haven't said, so I just suggest that all intellectuals out there buy this book and prepare to enjoy yourself.

The Casablanca is impressive- it's silent- even on really fast speeds, and doesn't wobble or tilt at all. Installation with the casablanca was a breeze. This hunter was a headache for him to install (something to consider if you pay your handyman by the hour!) and the quality just isn't the same. It tilts- although just slightly, and shakes a little. It's enough that I'm slightly concerned with it's position above my bed. Most annoyingly, I can't turn the fan off or on without some real effort. The cord is 'dispensed' through a hole that's slightly off-center so I can't pull straight down. I have to pull at an angle and in order to do that, I have to stand on my bed. Even then it's not easy. I had thought hunter was the name to get- maybe others are better??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter let me down","review":"The fan is attractive but very hard to install and operate. I had it professionally installed by a contractor who is used to hard work. When it proved to be too much for one person, another had to be called in. If I want to change the speed, I have to get a step stool and manfully (womanfully?) pull on the chain. It tips the fan almost sideways before it will engage. On the highest speed, the fan sways until I'm afraid it will work itself loose from the ceiling so I use either the lowest speed or the mid speed. I've had Hunter fans before that were great but I wouldn't buy another one of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great fan.

It was written in 1901 in French and then translated into English by Alfred Sutro and published in English in 1910. It is a classic bee book written in a lively style. It's reasonably accurate, for a book so old, and has a nice readable style.

It just wasn't up to the \\"Steel\\" standards in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable","review":"After reading \\"The Kiss\\", I've given up on Danielle Steel. This book is very predictable. Also, the book is longer than it needs to be, as the last several chapters could have been condensed in to one. The same thing is said over and over and it's just a waste of time. I find with Danielle Steel's later novels is that she recycles the same plot, and only changes the character names, and sometimes the setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second star given grudgingly","review":"You have to have a little respect for someone who can find a way to say the same thing a hundred different times. Oh my goodness, Steel can create great plots but it boggles my mind that her editors let this repetition go unchecked. Of course, I keep buying this stuff because of its pure fluff value.

This audiobook has had me throwing things at my ipod speakers, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kiss: An Intensely Laborious Waste of Paper","review":"I have never read a Danielle Steele novel before, but the promised story line and the Gustav Klimt cover drew me in. It sounded like a good, romantic read and I knew Ms. Steele was a very famous and popular author, she must be good, right? Was I ever in for a surprise! This book spews forth the most redundant character analyses I have ever heard in my life! Over and over we hear about how Isabelle has to care for her invalid son Teddy, how her husband is extremely selfish and neglectful, how Bill, her true love, has a very selfish wife. The descriptions are flushed around and around, over and over, like something foul that just can't be gotten rid of. Please, do yourself a tremendous favor, Ms. Steele, and take some time off before attempting to write anything as completely empty and intolerable as this total waste of paper! Highly do not recommend this book! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"That's It","review":"Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books.

BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, \\"so and so was a devoted mother\\" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance close to reality","review":"I enjoyed the romance that went on between Isabelle and Bill. I could understand why they found solace in one another. However, it wasn't one of her better books. I really liked The Promise, which was an earlier book. Maybe that is why this story doesn't have the same simplicity and reality combined. Although it was a good read to pass the time, a better read is Cherrie Kimbrough's Rosewood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, tired, tired story.","review":"I used to be a great fan of Danielle Steel, but in the last few years her stories have become repetitive and boring. I finished reading a recent one the other night, and threw it across the room in disgust - it had no real ending! \\"The Kiss\\" is far-fetched and a great disappointment, as are all of Ms. Steel's novels over the past few years. What happened to the creative writer who wrote \\"Star\\", \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"Summer's End\\",\\"Lightening\\" - those were passionate and interesting - good reads! I am disappointed by \\"The Kiss\\", as I have been with other recent novels of this author. I used to enjoy her work so much, I purchased each new story.

That wasn't too surprising since all her recent books were bad. The Kiss repeated itself over and over so much. Isabelle's character got annoying since she was so weak and kept on defending her husband. I wanted to slap her after awhile.

She told the same things over and over. I found myself skimming those parts of the book I thought I had already read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Done, Danielle","review":"Have you ever read an author's book that you disliked so much, you couldn't get it out of your mind? This is another one. This story is so unrealistic, I don't know where to start. One thing for sure no one lacks for money in Ms. Steel's stories, jetting everywhere, staying in 4 Star hotels, calling for cars to take them everywhere. It's a world I can't comprehend. Most people would have been bankrupt after a 2 month hospital stay and 9 months in a top notch rehab. Also a small detail but how does Bill hop into the shower from his wheelchair? None of the hotels I've stayed in have a shower you can roll into and I'm sure Isabella did not reserve a room for physically challenged.I was VERY disappointed in the end when Gordon did not get his come uppance. Better luck with your next effort Ms. Steel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"It amazes me that Ms. Steel has as many readers as she does..\\"The Kiss\\" was a book that failed to hold my attention..I couldnt finish it. I felt like the whole time I was reading..instead of being \\"Shown\\" what was going on I was being told all of the time..This leads to flat characters and a story I just didnt care about at all. Also..whats with all of the repetition?? Surely I got the point that Isabelle is concerned with Teddy's health after the first 55 times she mentioned it!!! I swear she repeats herself just to fill up space..All in all I thought this was a poorly written book that just isnt worth the time it takes to read..I wouldnt recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another spectacular book!","review":"I don't usually like to read romance novels because they make like things always come out wonderful and of course this one ended up that way too,but I still loved the book! It was so sad towards the end that it actually made me cry! When Isabelle went to see Bill after her husband threw her out and Bill acted like he didn't want to see her any longer. Isabelle's husband was a real SOB and treated her horribly but she stayed for the sake of her child, but when he died that was very sad as well, but for the husband to be so heartless especially at that time, that saddened me too. But the part that was the saddest is to not be able to be with the one you really love! And it was obvious that Isabelle and Bill were so much in love. I'm glad they FINALLy got together though. A wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought this video with the expectation that i'd be seeing a lot of really good goals, and while there are many good goals, there are also a lot of fairly average goals that don't bear revisiting. The producers were culling goals from the mere eight years the league had existed and they missed a surprising number of really spectacular goals. I also agree with the prior reviewer that some goals are replayed too often (this is a DVD, I can replay it myself if I want to), and the \\"special effects\\" are gratuitous and distracting.I've been a fan of MLS since they opened shop and there are a lot of highlights missing from this DVD. You're left with the distinct impression that the people who put this DVD together didn't have access to everything they should have to create what purports to be the definitive collection of MLS goals.By the way, I am a D.C. United fan and I may be a little partial, but to show only 3 (maybe 4) goals from the three-time champions of the league is an insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisterhood","review":"I loved this book. Having no siblings myself it gave me a true look at sisterhood. Briscoe looks at 3 sisters who all have their share of problems but pettiness and pride keeps them from reaching out to one another for love and support. This book really makes you think about how we treat our family and weather we truly value what we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"College student's review","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

Will not order from this merchant again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to talk about","review":"Unfortunately I've not read many Connie Briscoe books, however, the two I've read so far (this one and 'A Long Way from Home,')would encourage me to read more. I'm looking forward to receiving my copy of P.G. County. Nonetheless, after reading Sisters and Lovers I did come away with some laughter and a few reality checks. I thought the three main characters (the sisters) were very believable, funny, and ultimately supportive of each other. I only wish the one sister, Charmain, had been a little more independent and not determined to hold on to a 'man,' even a bad man. The book is definitely worth reading (great for reading on subways or buses or any long ride) and as a member of a book club here in Washington, DC it does give you something to talk about. And also coming from a large family of eight girls I can relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GO CONNIE BRISCOE!","review":"I WAS TRULY HAPPY WITH THE WHOLE BOOK IT GAVE THE SINCE OF REAL FAMILY AND WHAT SISTERS SOME TIMES GO THRU!

But I like \\"Sisters and Lovers\\" better. Even though Beverly was my favorite character in the book because I could relate more to her, she kind of got on my nerves of how she was being so picky with the men she was involved with. Other than that, it was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Absolutely nothing happens in this story. There's minimal character development and growth and it's totally predictable--except you're left wondering how and why it took them so long, and the one, semi-interesting twist was ruined with the first lingering stare. We follow three boring and rather irritating sisters through their dramas, horrid mistakes, and general obnoxiousness. As for the men as a whole being weak, pathetic, crazy, and/or ball-less, there actually are men like that, but they are by no means the majority. Overall, it was a pretty disgusting portrayal of men, and the women were pretty despicable, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRUE WASTE OF GOOD PAPER!!!","review":"I was very excited by the title, but after reading about four chapters, I had already knew this book would drag on!!! This book had nothing to do with sisterhood or lovers, instead it was about a constant relationship of 3 bickering sisters who could never get it right. A good book usually takes 1 to 2 days to read, this one was soo slow and boring, it took a whole month! I do not recommend sisters and lovers to anyone under the age of 55! (meaning=boooring!!) A bit of advice for connie, Don't quit your day job!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this version","review":"I would give the movie five stars - it is one of my favorite silent films - but the low rating is for the Alpha DVD. It is of a bad print, very dark and scratchy. But the worst is the dreary, monotonous organ score - absolutely horrible! As a longtime fan of silent films, I believe firmly that a quality musical score is essential to our enjoyment, particularly of a lengthy drama such as this one. Choose either the Kino or the Image DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy DVD Print","review":"Impossible to enjoy this DVD due to terrible, washed-out, fussy print.Film needs major restoration!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this case to use when I work out. The controls are hard to access through the screen and it is difficult to get the zen micro into the case. It is also extremely difficult to get the case on to the arm-band attachment. Once you've accomplished that task, and eventually manage to fasten it around your arm, you will discover that it is extremely unstable and the micro bounces up and down alarmingly, looking like its about to fall off. It is secured on your arm only by velcro. The case is not particularly sturdy, and does not appear to be effective in protecting the zen micro from damage if you drop it. All in all, an extremely disappointing buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Controls","review":"Attractive design other than I could not get the controls to work thru the clear plastic. The plastic needs to be thinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to pick up, hard to put down!","review":"Accused By Facet-Eyes is the memorable science-fiction novel of humanity called to account for their depredations upon planet earth by the insect like Magi Queendom. A fantastic, mind-numbing journey through a world of alien perceptions and multifaceted vision, Accused By Facet-Eyes creates an amazing, captivating world that is unlike our own and yet all too close. C. B.

Rarely has such a book inspired compassion, or lofty, noble ideals. In the very rare persuasive rebuttals of this sort, artistry and a level of authenticity have been present... Unfortunately, this book is not rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"A novel relating a day in the life of a Siberian labor camp inmate. It lacks the gripping quality of books such as Journey Into the Whirlwind, but portrays well the details of an average prisoner's life and thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE classic gulag tale","review":"No author can better master the tale of the Gulag than Solzhenitsyn. The fact that he personally spent time in one may be considered by many to be the reason for this, but in truth there were many people who could both write and were thrown into one of these concentration camps. Solzhenitsyn's account is the best because his skill as a writer is superb. I highly reccomend this read for anyone of any age, it is a quick, enthralling, and informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a normal day","review":"Solzhenitsyn draws from his ten years of experience in a Stalinist prison camp to create a very revealing portrait of a single day in a camp. The protagonist hero is an average prisoner who narrates an average day in the camp. The book is written in true narrative form with no chapters or page breaks to cause the story to slow. The advantage to the book covering only one day is it helps the reader better understand how the narrator can think only one day at a time. With no clocks and little contact with the outside, it quickly becomes apparent why the narrator focuses only on getting through each day. This day in particular included a trip to the doctor, elaborate maneuvering to obtain more food, and a piece of saw is hoarded for future use. While these may seem like small things to us, we cannot begin to understand their importance to the narrator. Hopefully, by understanding we can learn from this terrible period of time and that hope can prevail over all things."},{"rating":"2","title":"his book as a perspective warper","review":"Obvious is the significance and brilliance of this novel, which has been discussed over and over and over again. It's important to look at this novel as how it changes your comtemporary perspective of human suffering, and create a strong feeling of sympathy vested in the fact that 'you know, I really don't have it too bad after all.' I read this novel shortly after watching 6 seasons of HBOs Oz, and it makes that Oswald State Penitentiary look like Club Med. If you ever feel like you're down in the dumps and life is hopeless, pick up this book and read it in an evening. I assure you that by attempting to understand how Ivan Denisovich and his prisonmates survived and lived each day at a time will truly change your perspective on how you live each day of your OWN life."},{"rating":"2","title":"All classics","review":"I have read most of Solzhenitsyn's books both in English and German, each time forgetting time and space when I was reading. Then I traveled Russia and stayed in the hotel in Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East where he stayed upon his return to Russia, and I cruised the Amur River along which the Gulags he so vividly described existed. Alone near the front of the boat in the early morning hours, I pictured his prisoners in the bitter cold, totally isolated in a huge area that is cut off from the world except for the winters because of the marshes, but also escape-proof in winter because no one can survive those temperatures.What literature, what landscape, what a country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"vivid and brutal","review":"A.S. in a short masterpiece clearly describes a world of which I knew little, and now I know some. Most of my Russian reading has been confined to the pre-revolutionary era, and it is interesting to contrast work to my favorites of Tolstoy and Chekhov. In short, A.S. is much to the point, informal, and writes with accuracy and a minimum of characterization. It's a fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective novel","review":"Solzhenitsyn's novel on one day in the life of a labor camp prisoner is a good read for anyone who wants to see what a typical day was like in one of Stalin's prison camps. Ivan Denisovich is not in a hard labor camp though, because he is a political prisoner, but the novel still covers many important topics such as food, illness, work, sleep, and society. I found that the ending was particularly powerful as it perfectly parallels the main theme of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"enter a new world...for a day","review":"what makes this book worth four stars is as much what is says as what it does not. going into painstaking detail about one day in the life of a prisoner in the gulag - one of like 10,000 days of his prisoner life - this book conjures up a whole world.at points it was a little tedious and hard to follow, but the main thrust of the roughness of his life just made the journey from cover to cover one worth following.main plus of the book and thing making it worth reading: snapped me out of my little world for a few hours and made me grateful about how my life is...about my freedom. that guy was a modern slave. and i'm not. like bob marley says: emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds. well, this book helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of the twentieth century.","review":"This was Solzhenitsyn's first published novel and it caused a sensation. I first read the book when I was in high school in 1964 and recall being stunned by the story (even at that early date, high school students were reading the book and, as can be seen from the comments of the other reviewers, high school students are still reading it). It relates one day in the life of a prisoner, a carpenter who had been imprisoned on baseless charges, in a labor camp in Siberia in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Solzhenitzen drew on his own experiences in labor camps to write this short book. A few years later, he was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivan Denisovich is a symbol of bravery.","review":"I love this book. Ivan Denisovich is a symbol of bravery of the human spirit in despair. This story is necessary for all of us who used to the living in a society that supports freedom. The images of the Siberian camps in the Stalinist era are disturbing but impressive. There are many powerful outlines that express what a prisoner has to do in order to survive. Solzhenitsyn captures the society's dehumanization masterly. I was arrested in this story, making me feel as if I am Ivan Denisovich's cellmate. This is a masterwork on the psychology of continued existence. Reading about Ivan's life changed how I live each day. My uncle met Solzhenitsyn in CT. Great man. I wish I met him. He is one of my idols."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prison and harmony ?...!","review":"I found the author's description of the prison life very vivid and rather disturbing, till I came across the following quotes that the author made during his Nobel lectures on literature:\\"The artist is only given to sense more keenly than others the harmony of the world and all the beauty and savagery of man's contribution to it -- and communicate this poignantly to people. And even in the midst of failure and down at the lowest depths of existance -- in poverty, prison, illness -- the sensation of a stable harmony will never him.\\"Sages and philosphers are sometimes made in the prison: but I am sure the author was gifted at birth with the ability to communicate poignanty to people his experiences, and illuminate them from darkness, and kindle a sensation of harmony in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovich","review":"when I was about 13/14 years of age I read this book, and found it interesting what can I say I read it again now, after knowing so much more as I did then about 'Gulags' life and my empathy for the underprivileged and having friends now from Russia I understand much more, Judy"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich","review":"A detailed book involving creativity and lots of describing words about Ivan Denisovich in a Russian prison camp. Ivan Denisovich was put in jail for treason and sentenced to ten years in prison. Through the book it talks about Ivan and what his life is like in cold northern Russia. It is a slow book, that is not very exciting, but has lots of details of how the setting is and has a creative plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Prison Camp","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It provides a real and true account of life in the Russian prison camps. The prison camp is shown in the eyes of a very smart man that has to be deceptive and honest at the same time just to stay alive. The mystery of not knowing what is going to happen next and where the next meal is going to come from keeps you on the edge. It gives you a complete view of a day in the life of a Russian prison camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important books of the Cold War","review":"Solzhenitsyn is one of the heroes of the Cold War for his public stand against communism and the abuses of the Soviet Union. Through this book, he exposed the Soviet Gulag in Siberia and helped bring world attention to the mass imprisonment of political prisoners. This book gives a play by play of the events of one day in the life of Shukhov, a prisoner in a Siberian Gulag. It is a simple book with a powerful message that was important when it was written and important today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Novel","review":"This was as awesome novel which I read for a World History class in college. I strongly recommend this book to those interested in Russia, World War 2, Stalin etc.I love history, and this book was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel!","review":"If you've never read this story, you are missing out. It's about a Russian soldier in WWII who is captured by the Germans, but quickly escapes. The Russians did not believe anyone could escape from the Germans, so anyone who did was sent to the Gulag. In Ivan's case, he was sentenced to 10,000 days hard labor...this novel by acclaimed Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, chronicles one day in Ivan's life while imprisoned by his own people. If you enjoy a good read, this story will make you experience hunger, thirst, happiness, sadness, fear, triumph, failure, pride, shame, and most other human emotions you can think of. That's fairly amazing considering it's only about 200 pages long.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!Oh, by the way, 10,000 days is roughly 27.4 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gulags R us","review":"Ivan or Shuhkov as he's called through out the book is imprisioned in a Russian prison camp. His days starts with hanging out in bed because he feels ill. The book could really be considered a long story. There are no chapter breaks. And even though the idea of tracing one through a day seems dull its interesting. I especially like the three types of narration which is so subtle you may miss that it changes. It's good literature. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boorrring!-David","review":"First of all I am an 13 yr old who was told to read this book for my Ad English class, I found this book to be very boring.

The concept sounds boring, but it makes you realize that there are situations where the small things in life really do matter, and everyplace has its rules. The character is street wise and very likeable. I read this during the Northeast heatwave in the 90 degree range with no air conditioning and fantasized about the sub-zero cold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the most truthful book I have read.","review":"Ivan Denisovich was a book that told a story about a guy that is in prison for treason. The story is based on one day in prison. It shows all strenghts and weaknesses that come along with being in prison. Even a hard-core prison like this one. Usually books like this don't have a very good ending, but this did. Ivan learned from the others, but knew he couldn't think about getting out or he would go crazy. This book is well written and I would suggest it to anyone who wants to learn about the real situation in prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful balance between hope and despair","review":"I first picked up this book out of curiosity, and wound up completely engrossed. This description of life in a Soviet post-WW2 gulag is incredibly powerful, largely in part because Solzhenitsyn recounts the tale as a simple description of daily life. One might expect the author of such a tale to go out of his way to spout hateful words and particular atrocities, but Solzhenitsyn doesn't seem to need to do that. His account is very matter-of-fact in tone, which makes it all the more chilling. These prisoners are basically without any long-term hope (except for one or two notable comrades, such as Ivan's Baptist \\"neighbor\\") They must take a sense of accomplishment in such tasks as building a wall quickly or successfully hiding a tiny chunk of bread. Solzhenitsyn powerfully presents this horrible life in such a way as to ask for simple awareness, instead of the pity it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows how creul life can be, and how people bear it.","review":"This novel shows how anyone who uttered Stalin's name in wrong ways was sent to the labour camps to endure humiliation, freezing cold and hard work. The millions of \\"zeks\\" sent to these camps were just like Shukhov. They searched for every bit of dignity and privicy, or maybe just a smoke. This is how life can be but Shukhov seemed to make the most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost this book at the airport!","review":"Yes, this wonderful book of which I had only read two chapters was accidentally left behind at the MSP airport. Never have I been so disappointed at not being able to continue with what appeared to be a marvelously written book based on the truth and suffering experienced in the life of the author. Soon, I will either buy another copy or check it out at the library. The hook is in this fish's mouth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day Living Under the Oppression of the Evil Empire","review":"Alexander Solzhenitsyn has given the world a glimpse of the evil that is communist oppression and tyranny. While Western Intellectuals (disguised as enlightened progressive liberals) where idolizing the Soviet Union and its collectivist economy, Solzhenitsyn brought the reality of the system to the fore. More than anyone else, he made envy of the Evil Empire less fashionable. This novel is based on Solzhenitsyn own experience with the Soviet work camps that recognize no human rights and starved or worked prisoners to death in the cold arctic Gulags of the Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn gives the reader intricate details of what a day in the life of a Gulag would be like and is asked to imagine not only thousands of such days - but of not knowing the duration of one's imprisonment. This book, along with Solzhenitsyn's \\"Gulag Archipelago,\\" is a monument to the evils of hands-on collectivist ideology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Treat","review":"This political/social/interpersonal treatsie is so very thought provoking, especially for the western mind who has no concept of the modern prison camp culture.

It has wonderful photographs, and I was pleased to be able to identify a mysterious succlent plant of mine within the first 10 minutes of owning the book.The only thing that I did not like, which is why I am not giving this book a 10 is that the entries run up and down instead of left to right. I could not understand why the authors and publishers did not set up the book like the cacti book was set up. In my opinion this made things a little more difficult to read.

And once the characters entered the caverns, there was no turning back.Most of all, I love the way Sean Russell doesn't fall into the old cliche of the noble heroes fighting an evil dark wizard.

Russell is a master of characterization and the art of weaving intriguing plots together, and this makes even a prequel entertaining. In fact, I found it more interesting than Book Two of Moontide & Magic Rise, and more concise."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a land Farr Farr Away","review":"Being a fan of all of Russel's earlier works I was eagerly awaiting Beneath the Vaulted Hills. Needless to say I was not dissappointed.Beneath the Vaulted Hills answers so many of the questions left unanswered in Moontide and Magic Rise. Of course there are a great many new questions revealed in this novel also.Taking place decades before Moontide and Magic Rise, we get the chance to meet many charcters from the MT&MR book in their prime, or characters that were long dead before MT&MR.I think one of the strengths with this book (as well as MT&MR) is that there are mysteries in the world and we see how people interact among them. Of course this is also one of the most frustrating things as we can't know. Its like going to Greece and looking at the ruins and having to draw our own conclusions.Needless to say I enjoyed this book and it certainly left itself open for a follow-up novel. But also if the story ended then and there, that is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Find!","review":"This is one of the best finds in my reading for 2002. A great introduction to Sean Russell's great stories and deep plots it has everything a great story needs. After reading this I couldn't help myself but get his other books and I am not dissapointed!

Great work Sean Russell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore","review":"I purchased this book based on all the good reviews, however, I was very disappointed in this book and could barely finish it.

It is a distracting and unappetizing comparison with which Native people may be all too familiar.Throughout the book, the author seems to go on and on about the relative popularity of dogs to cats. She includes far too much about dogs and their behavior characterstics in relation to people. If this were a book about cats and dogs that might have been appropriate. However, in this book, it was simply another distraction.There are a few interesting things, but overall doesn't cover any new ground that Desmond Morris hasn't already covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Whisperer","review":"I have been looking for a book to help understand normal cat behavior for a while and this is the first one that comes close to being useful. The writing style is very good and it makes for an enjoyable read. The author obviously loves cats and I felt she was approaching her subject with great kindness.Even though I am a cat lover, the details given in the book about what makes cats \\"tick\\" seemed just about right for a layperson and really did help me see my cat in a new, better way.For anyone just curious about what their cat is up to, this would make a nice resource for them I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good only if you never watched your cat, or you never had a cat before","review":"I bought this because of the title--I've learned a ton from the Dog Whisperer tho' I've had dogs half my life.. I've had cats my entire life, and I found this book to be more of a \\"how to care for you cat book\\", so I feel it was not well named. It really did not provide any real insight into cats or feline psychology. I know more about cats' minds and motivation than this author--very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Whisperer: The Secret of How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"Aside from the catchy title, I found little of use in this book that supposedly deals with cat communication.

She is away at colledge and the lock key broke when she came home to get them fixed. I ordered this product and it was a good price but it was too big to even try. I had her come back home to try again after getting this product and was again not able to get the locks off. My neighbor pounded a socket onto the lock and took off all four locks so I could do the break job. It looks like it would be much easier if it were the right size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I ordered this product to remove a locking lug nut for which the key had become stripped. When I received the product, I discovered that it was for an impact wrench, something that was not pointed out in the advertising copy. I don't have an impact wrench, so I borrowed one from a friend. Instead of removing the lug nut, it broke the lug off.

I wanted to read about Princeton Seminary to find out where it went wrong, where it departed from Biblical orthodoxy. This is a book about the early years of the seminary, when there were godly solid men faithfully serving the Lord at Princeton. It gives a good, human depiction of these men.

Of those electronic new age \\"space music\\" artists who came to pseudo-prominence in the '80s - Steve Roach, Kevin Braheny, Patrick O'Hearn, Jonn Serrie, Vangelis, et al. - Burmer had the most developed sense of traditional musicality without sounding cryptic nor \\"poppish\\". One can count on an album that will transport the listener to other times, places, and dimensions while treating the ears to beautiful melodies and compellingly exotic arrangements with both romance and drama; this is more than just background music!Bhakti Point and On the Third Extreme are the two Burmer albums I own and revisit quite often.

One of the \\"songs\\" that introduced me to this interesting electronic 'stuff' was Richard Burmer's Bhakti Point. I found it an amazing piece of music and bought the album on tape (and later a CD.) I find it almost hypnotic and it can conjure up a variety of images--a nighttime sled ride across frozen hills in the arctic; the dawn of creation, when creatures first crawled out of primordial mud--or Burmer's own interpretation: Bhakti Point is a special place that one's mind escapes to. Whatever it brings to a listener's imagination, I think it is a marvelous piece of music and I have never tired of hearing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Version","review":"As one other reviewer pointed out, the quality is poor.

There's no index. I saw some information on mildew but spent over an hour trying to locate it again.

I've been to Paris twice (and will go again despite the recent political problems) and it was wonderful to read the history of all the places I've seen. For example, I had no idea that the Les Halles area had been reserved as a market place since 1183. It's still a shopping area, too. It will make my visit next time more meaningful.I recommend reading this before a trip to Paris. It's also good to read while you're there or when you get back.I'm reading it now and marking passages to check out on my next vacation in that beautiful place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History of Paris","review":"Overall, this book accompished its purpose - it painted a portrait of the unique qualities that make up the Parisian character. Horne goes into great depth explaining the traditional love of art and class war that makes Paris such a faccinating and beautiful city. It's a great read for someone who has a good understanding of French culture and wants to learn more.As an introduction to French culture, though, it fails. Horne peppers his books with untranslated quotes and phrases. For the younger generation, which usually forgoes French education for Spanish or Mandarin, this can be exceedingly confusing. Horne also assumes a certain familiarity with Paris, and does not provide a thorough map. While a map is not necessary to understanding the book, it would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive History of a Vastely Interesting City","review":"Alistair Horne has taken on a large task in telling the tale of the city of Paris from the Middle Ages until the fall of de Gaulle. The job is divded into the Seven Ages of Paris to create more bite-size morsels for the reader but it is the character of the city and the characters within the city which make spanning the centuries so much fun. The author includes most of the bloody bits of the history (and with Paris, there was much of that) but also pauses to brings in elements of the arts and culture, particularly in the wonderful sections detailing the past hundred and fifty years. The architecture of the city is told in great detail and may be of interest to some readers, primarily those who have seen Paris. This book was a joy. The author touched on all the important periods and, though a favourite personality may be missing here or there, makes it an interesting read for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know much about (medieval) history","review":"Let me start by saying that I gave up on this book midway through the third chapter. I just could no longer stand the factual errors! It's clear that Horne loves Paris, but he apparently doesn't feel quite so deeply about the study of history. Why write about a period without at least finding out the basic facts? Is it such an obscure fact that Jerusalem was in CHRISTIAN hands during the Second Crusade (giving the French king no reason to besiege it, as Horne claims he did), or that the defeat at Courtrai was at the hands of Flemings, NOT Edward I of England? The average reader might not know his or her history, but an historian certainly should.Another reviewer pointed out that the facts are more reliable with regards to the modern period, so there may be some use for this book. But with regard to its (possibly too ambitious) scope, I can't forgive the errors on the medieval period.Let's hope that facts will be checked and maps added for future printings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled and disappointing","review":"The trouble with Alistair Horne's \\"Seven Ages of Paris\\" is the set of expectations it raises and then fails to deliver upon. Naturally, when picking up a history of a given city, I expect to get a narrative that concentrates on the subject. But too much of this book is taken up by generalized history of the French nation, with only incidental discussion of the impact of wider events on the capital. Admittedly, France has become such a centralized nation in recent centuries that it is tempting to take country and city as intimately intertwined. Yet I'm not sure this was always true.The book is also oddly stingy with illustrations and maps. The growth of Paris would seem to present all sorts of opportunities for vivid illustration (check out the Musee Carnavalet in the Marais for several hundred candidates for inclusion), but all we get here is a few sparse city maps and a few pages of glossy pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This vacuum certainly cleans your carpets however I was disappointed that it doesn't clean right to the edges and the on board tools are always falling out.

In the end I took one of the brushes out but then of course I never used it again.I can't reccommend this vacuum because after less than two years of use the connections are broken and the brushes no longer rotate. I can only use it for the wooden floors now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Vacuum breaks under normal use.","review":"The thin plastic that connects the wand to the vacumm head breaks very easy. The company is no help. Fantom said the wand for this model is on back order and they don't know when they will have it. Now I have a useless vacuum that is only a couple of months old. Stick with an upright if you still want a fantom."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum will break before one year is up.","review":"The wand ends are made from plastic that will break. If they had made them from metal, there would be no problem.We have tried to get a replacement wand to no avail.Alas, our one year warranty already ended. The brush head unit doesn't clean very close to the edge.The tool storage isn't very good either. It's like a puzzle trying to get them to fit back in correctly.It does have good suction though. We like the HEPA filtration too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on carpets only","review":"My house is 50% carpets and 50% bare floors. On one side, this vaccum perfoms wonderfully on carpets, giving them a \\"fresh\\" and new look. On the other side, I was very disappointed by its performance on hard wood floors, tilles, and kitchen liners. Terrible! This thing doesn't even pick up a cherrios or a grain of rice!Too much money for a non-versatile vaccum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great! Falls apart quick...","review":"I have owned this vacuum for three years, so my review is realistic. The first month, the cord reel broke. The wheels which are just pressed on fall off constantly. I just push them back on. The cord is very short which requires you to change outlets constantly. The hose is very flimsy and kinks frequently. You lose suction when the container is about half full. The vacuum has these tiny wheels in the front which cause the unit to tip over when you try and pull it along. Sometimes I got so irratated I just leave it flipped over and keep working. Today it quit running which is good news for me. I can go out and get something reliable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected for the money.","review":"I was impressed with the pick up power of this vacuum. I've had mine for three years and had to take it in to be repaired in the first year because an overheat fuse. That was repaired under the warrantee. Shortly after the warrantee ran out the neck on the power head broke we superglued it together and have had to do so several times. Cleaning it out is not that convient I have to empty the canister more than once whenever I vacuum our 1600sf home with wall to wall carpeting, and the canister doesn't clean completely without washing. The hepa filter is expensive to replace. I'll replace the vacuum before putting any more money into this, and I be sure to check the reviews before buying another vacuum. There has got to be something better than this out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum I've ever owned.","review":"I have 3 homes, and I have a Fantom Lightning Canister Vacuum Cleaner in each one, so I own 3 of these. I owned Fantom uprights before these, and they were great, but these top those.Much easier to use, much lighter weight, and in two of my homes I have carpeted steps, so I purchased the separate attachment for stairs. I love the way the vacuum sets on the steps, no chance of it falling, very secure. I really enjoy being able to see the dust and dog hair that this picks up, and I have a very hairy large Cocker Spaniel. 2 of my homes are totally carpeted, and the 3rd has carpet and tile, works great on any surface. Also it is very easy to vacuum mop boards and under beds. If I were to need another, I would definitely buy a Fantom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"My Fantom is a little over 2 years old and no longer functional. The company does not fulfill it's warranty obligations. The cordwinder is too powerful for the vacuum. Ours broke 3 times. The first time Fantom paid for the repair, but we had to wait 3-4 weeks to get it fixed. The second time it broke, Fantom would not fix it even though it was still under warranty. We paid for the repair ourselves. The third time it broke we did not fix it. The entire thing is made out of plastic and will fall apart in several places. The suction is good, but the filters are very expensive to replace. I DO NOT recommend this vacuum. There are much better quality vacuums out there for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but..","review":"It works fine but it keeps breaking. I have had it for 1 year now and set it to the shop 3 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to get replacement parts","review":"I've had this vacuum for just over a year and it's already stopped working. First the wand broke and there's no way to get another one. I've tried all over. Fantom said they were no longer being made because of a defect! That's why I need a new one. Now it's just stopped working. I would never put this much money into a vacuum the company won't stand behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky","review":"The Fantom Lightening is a junky vacuum cleaner that does not hold up. In the past three years since I bought mine, most of the plastic parts have broken as has the cord retractor. The suction is average. I have rated this appliance with one star because I do like the bagless feature. If they would just make it out of metal which would hold up instead of plastic, it would probably be a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product I've owned","review":"I have never had a worse vacuum. It is supposed to keep odors out, instead it redistributes the odors each time you vacuum-(thats after replacing the...hepa filter after only a year).The hose that connects to the canister continually comes off as you move with the vacuum. The on/off button has sprung off. If that is not enough, there is too much work that needs to be done each time you vacuum, such as:emptying out the canister.cleaning the filter out every vacuum.The bagless vacuum (at least this one) is not, in any way, convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Like others who have reviewed this item, I am VERY disappointed with it. Fantom appears to have gone out of business, so don't expect any replacement parts/repairs to be available on this item. The collar that connects the metal wand to the metal powerhead is made of: plastic...which breaks quite easily. Now I'm driving out of state to buy the LAST one available at that repair shop.It does clean OK..but the reliability is so bad, it doesn't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good & Bad","review":"I did like my fantom sweeper very much but it did break the 1st year I had it and I think when they fixed it they made it worse than it was. Now the swivel broke and it can't even be glued. I did find out that Fantom is in Chapter 11. You can find parts for it at [website]."},{"rating":"1","title":"10,000 Rabbit Trails","review":"This is a very fine translation of one of the most important books from the ancient world. Be forewarned, this is not easy reading for the ordinary or casual reader of history. The university level teacher or classical scholar will savor every page. Herodotus does not give you a simple narrative. He starts you out and then runs you down ten thousand rabbit trails so you may forget where you started and where you were trying to go. He introduces names and places in a staggering volume in just a few pages. He will introduce a person and then tell you all about his great grandfather,grandfather,father,mother,siblings, every person he killed and every woman he ever slept with. He goes to great length to tell you how the Greeks chose their commanding general at the Battle of Marathon but he gives you sparse detail about how they actually won that famous conflict. The breadth of people and events Herodotus covers is huge but the pathway is not linear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Really Bad","review":"The only reason I actually finished this boring, convoluted, uninteresting book was because I was stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read. I should have just gone to sleep. The plot (if there really is one) centers around the attempt to recover gold stolen by Japanese military leaders and buried in the Philippines during World War II. There is virtually no action or drama in the book--just long, drawn-out explanations of historical activity by the main characters. I completely lost track of why some of the characters were in the book. Most of the activity (not action) is implausible and generally disconnected with the main theme. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the new geek!!","review":"I just picked up Leo's new book.

I found this particular CD to not only be my favorite of all Bob Malone's works, but to quite possibly be my favorite CD of all time! I was fortunate enough to see Bob perform this album live at the Ogden Museum in New Orleans shortly after the hurricane, an honor normally granted only to local New Orleans musicians. He brought the audience to tears with \\"Home to Me\\" and \\"Angel\\", and elicited laughter and cheers with songs like \\"Chicks\\" and \\"The Brush\\". Bob's lyrics, as usual, are phenomenal, and his brilliant piano playing is incomparable. This CD has such wide appeal that even my friend's five year old twins have memorized all the words. This is a CD that no music lover should be without. And if you're a Bob Malone fan, well, you already have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"Malone's last album \\"Darkest Part of The Night\\" was so good I guess I was expecting something more than this one delivers. I found the songs on this CD to be tedious and boring for the most part. Bob sounded like he got stuck in the same old groove and couldn't get out. Certainly not up to a standard he set with even some of his earlier work, like the \\"Bob Malone\\" tracks. If you're a big Malone fan give it a shot, maybe you will hear something I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOn't waste your time","review":"When I ordered, the book had a different cover. Was looking for a forestry review book, but when I got into it, so much stuff was outdated and virtually worthless. Book had a copyright date of 1922. Don't know how much I paid, maybe nothing (Kindle), but even nothing is too much, due to the time wasted trying to go through it. I'd rate it as a minus 5 stars. For me, I think Amazon ought to be ashamed of itself for offering such a book. At least the new offering gives more of a clue as to how out-of-date the book is. I'd say more, but I've got to figure out how to delete this...............book from my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very old school soft porn - not what I exepcted","review":"Very old school soft porn - not what I exepcted from the description.

Interesting are the thirty-eight dishonest tricks which are commonly used in argument and the methods of overcoming them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this out of print?","review":"Reading this book opened my eyes to exactly how badly crooked thinking runs our society today: how little emphasis we place on actual evidence and argument, what kind of dishonest argumentation our politicians and news providers use, etc. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that I had to go to a used bookshop in Perth, Australia to find it!

Music itself is not in question here of course but the noise makes it impossible to enjoy. Even if you remove the noise somehow, the sound itself is pretty bad too - uneven frequencies balance, resonating bases on some tracks, no highs at all on the others.

I saw them at Snocore tour with Smile Empty Soul and Trapt. Let me tell you...they were beyond amazing =) Best of all, I got to meet Hrag and he was so cool. BUY THIS ALBUM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE...

Well then Strata appeared. Not only was the singer gorgeous (noticed that first, hehe), but their shear talent really caught my attention. I went and bought the album not too long after that and was extremely happy I had found out about them through that show. They had great stage presence and sound great live. The CD is really good too, for a band of their experience. I am mostly a listener of Otep, Kittie, etc., but if something softer comes along that is actually original then good, and Strata does just that. Tracks 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12 are my favorites- the music really stands out and the lyrics are well versed. I can't wait to see how awesome Strata gets with a little more experience and albums under their belt.

I bought the album the day it came out and I'm still listening to it over and over. When you listen to his album you can tell the difference between him and all the other cats in the game.

The Girl Next Door features two talented and pleasant stars in Dan Dailey and June Haver and the color looks great, but the songs, the dance routines and the cartoon sequences are surprisingly uninspired. Add Dennis Day to the mix, and the film suffers even more. I never understood his appeal. When I think of Dan Dailey, Mother Wore Tights and When My Baby Smiles At Me comes to mind. June Haver shines in The Dolly Sisters, I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now and Look For The Silver Lining (at Warners).

I'm sure this collection is amazing, but after purchasing this collection on instant view, I'm saddened to realize that what I actually bought was ONE 38 minute long video, and NOT the collection. Definitely not worth the $10. I could have bought the DVD for less. True, this was the first time I'd ever purchased an instant view title, and I see now that it says \\"Journey of Man\\" (the movie that you ACTUALLY get), but I'm a long-time amazon user and like every other order I've ever placed (with no problems), I expected to get the item that I'm looking at, not something else.In short, just be aware that if you buy this collection for instant view, you're just getting a 38 minute video, NOT the 12 disc collection that the listing is for. LAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This movie was well worth the NYC $10 I paid to see it in the IMAX theater. However, that was because it was in 3D!!! It was beautifully amazing with 3D glasses and for $10 I didn't mind that it was only 40 minutes long. But this is definitely not worth the money you pay on here, unless they give you 3D glasses with it and you can see it how it should be seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This blu-ray disc does not play on my LG 3D blu-ray player.

It would either eject and say disc error or load forever, or occasionally make it to the menu, but the movie would only play for a few seconds then lock up. Even though I've never had a bad dvd or bluray before I thought that particular disc must of been bad. I sent it back to amazon and they sent me another brand new one. Guess what? Same exact problem.Sony also makes the swimsuit sports illustrated 3d bluray and it plays fine along with all my other 3D and 2D blurays and dvds.The few seconds I saw of the film between it locking up did show great 3D and was really pretty to look at, I wish I could watch the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - not the actual circus show","review":"I bought this right after getting my first 3D television, thinking it was a full circus show, as seen on some PBS stations.No.It is an all too short, choppy 'story' about someone growing up, and to be honest, only part of it is even 'circusy' in nature.Overall, a pretty big disappoitnment for those expecting the real Cirque du Soleil experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not the best","review":"I have been fortunate to see live performances of C du S's La Nouba and Quidam which were both exqusite and breathtaking. The originality that C du S brings to their performances brings out the child in me and every time I see them I am moved. This is what circus should be about. I have seen journey of man several times at the IMAX cinema at the Ontario sicence centre and it is only this large screen format which does this film justice all the acts in J of M are wonderful if a little short, but as a 29 year old man it always brings me to tears. I think I would recomend buying other C du S movies before buying this one, unless you are a die hard fan. However, I would also recomend not buying any and saving your money to go and see a live performance!

I have been to a number in person (Allegria, Dralion, O, and Zumanity, Seen several more on TV. The TV versions always left me cold. The 3D Blu-Ray version of Journey of Man takes you into a place where movies cannot go. I wont reveal the experience, but as with all CdS shows, there is a mix of water, acrobatics, and the ubiquitous characters who communicate with non-verbal gestures. Some parts of the story are hard to connect, and it seems short compared to the live shows (or the movies). Since there are so few 3D Blu-Ray offerings, this is a great one to have if you love CdS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good on movie screen but not a home screen","review":"I was NOT impressed with the 3D in most areas largely because they had the camera zoomed out so far that even on a good size home TV (55in) the images are small and unimpressive. While many good 3D movies might have long shots in 3D, normally they will mix it up and often zoom in to close up shots. I can see why this might be a good movie for effects on IMAX screens, but it is one of the least impressive I have bought for a home TV.

Dean Winters did and incredible job as Harrison, who turned out to be Jenny's Father. His face showed so much emotion, so much love. Yasmine Bleeth did a great job too as the girlfriend who fell for Jenny too. I loved the end when the Mother did the most wonderful act of love any Mother could do for a child.

This CD will probably be lost in the shuffle of everybody who ever owned an instrument releasing a CD in the 90's. IF YOU LIKE MODERN JAZZ WITH A FOCUS ON INTERPLAY AND ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS BUY THIS! I doubt it will be in print for very long. This is easily Chris Potter's best feature for all his talents as a sideman and his song FEAR OF FLYING should be a jazz standard for the 21st century. This is also one of the few CDs featuring Garry Dial's composing that is still in print. Kelly and Joel are two of the best and most sincere musicians out there so don't miss out.

Barzun's ideas on prose are certainly not consistent with modern linguistic research, and it is obvious that he could never have written anything that wasn't intended for an academic audience. Furthermore, Barzun is a condescending, pompous ass. For example, he refers to Somerset Maugham as \\"the storyteller Somerset Maugham\\", as if it would have killed him to refer to him as \\"the writer Somerset Maugham\\".

She is tough and sexy and believable. Singerman lets us see inside her head so she becomes a real 3-dimensional person. I also loved the parts about the little town of Velvet, Florida, where all the residents are psychic. I'd like to move there! The plot really was well done, especially the ending.

But \\"person in the woods\\" tales are not natural history, they are stories that begin from Thoreau's \\"Most people live lives of quiet desperation\\" and procede to show how the author escapes from this. The trees, birds and frogs -indeed the whole landscape of Flat Rock - is a kind of prop for this, however lovingly described. Carey is aware enough of this at his best, as in the chapter where he tries to get frogs to sing Handel. His life isn't meant as a model for everyone's, except insofar as he definitely escapes quiet desperation, and wants the rest of us to do so too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does a book stink in the woods?","review":"Anyone seeking a copy of this book can have mine.

Although he laughs at his mistakes, if he wasn't so clueless he wouldn't make them in the first place.

Corelli's writing is fairly simple, but she keeps the story interesting by creating emotional, believable characters. She does a very good job developing the girl's progression from naivete through downfall, though I found the downfall to be a bit sudden and overdone. A favorite theme of the author's is how men like to control women, and how men disapprove of women expressing their intellect and artistic ability. I'm guessing that Corelli was a victim of that treatment, and wrote about it in the hope of getting men to realize the idiocy of it.I just finished a book similar to this one, with two female leads and a completely different ending- Infelice by Augusta Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pendant is nice; Chain is a rip-off","review":"I am really disgusted with the Cat Pendant that arrived today.

Definately give it a try :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good sequel to first book!","review":"I found this book to be both exciting and funny.I liked the plot and the conclusions, but I was surprised and disappointed that one thing I thought would happen,didn't.I liked how they tell you which characters survived the end event from \\"Mrs.Frisby and the rats of NIMH\\". You Definitely have to read the first book before reading this one,it lifts all the suspense off.This is a good novel for kids from grades 4-8 who enjoy animals and adventure. This is not one of my favourite books(as I prefer dogs and horses)but I still enjoyed reading it and it was a new experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIHM Continued","review":"This sequel to \\"Mrs Frisby and the rats of NIHM\\" does not have the brilliance of the original novel, however it is enjoyable and quite touching. The novel's primary character is Mrs Frisby's son, Timothy, and focusses on the Rats in their new home and new society. A good sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shadow of the original","review":"This entire book was weak, from the characters to the battle against the construction company. I've read better fanfiction than this collection of character archtypes, Racso the Mary Sue, and the stultification of the solid characters that made Mrs. Frisby so rich. The damn builders could have been replaced with any number of \\"bad companies out to maim and destroy\\" including NIMH."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this sequel.","review":"Even though I enjoyed this book, I found that it lacked continuity with Robert O'Brien's original book, \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.\\" The book was an easier read, but it doesn't have the detail that the first book had. I read both aloud to my students. My students all said they liked the original book better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"I am a 5th grader, and recently I was given an assignment to read this book. Earlier in the school year, we read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, which was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much since I had read it many times in kindergarten and first grade. The book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like Jane Leslie Conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. The book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. The plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, I didn't like it. It was also too long for such a dull book. Usually I would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. However, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better. I enjoy books by J.K Rowling, Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racso and the Rats of NIMH","review":"I read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH in school. I thought it was the best book I ever read(and I read a lot!). I got Racso andthe Rats of NIMH at my local library, and after some thinking, I think Racso and the Rats of NIMH is better than the original. Ithas a thicker plot, faster paced chapters, and more dangers. It reveals a lot of secrets that the original creates. But it has one weakness. I'm 11 and in fifth grade, and some of the lines are more for younger kids. But it still deserves 5 stars. I'd reccomend it to anyone who has read the original. If you haven'tread the original, start reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable story and characters","review":"I found Rasco to be a very enjoyable character. He didn't start off on the right foot, and had a problem with pride and wanting to do things his own way, but he had a good heart and really wanted to fit in. His character developed from his experience at the rats' school and his participation in handling the crisis they all faced. It was a very good sequel to Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a regular play in my iPod!!!!","review":"I've had this CD for over a month now, and I still play it almost every day start-to-finish, and each play I enjoy it more and more.

The author was recommended by NYT book review but the insights into the Islamic Fundamentalist culture and the violent whirlpool that a young man can be sucked into were a surprising revelation.

This fan barely creates any air movement whatsoever. When its on high I am unable to feel a breeze when only 2.5-3' away from the fan. In contrast, with my other fan that I was replacing, I could feel the breeze from that fan 10' away or better. I have no idea why someone could possibly want a fan that barely moves air, but I guess the reviewer that says he \\"uses it on his desk\\" may have found the only viable usage (1' away from one's face).

Some things really had me laughing. The appliances turning to their old college buddy Wittgenstein, an early computer in a museum; a Christmas tree angel arguing with Viking 1 on Mars; discussion of the unified field theory (?!) and planned obsolescence (in a kids' movie?); and lines like: \\"The miracle part of Woodstock is that peace could happen at all.\\" \\"It's some sort of trajectory, expressed in binary numbers.\\" and \\"There's an election every day.

With this seat, I have successfully completed several long trips with no issues. My back still hurts, but not while sitting on this seat in my car.

They must work for this company. This is a piece of plastic covered in thin foam and black fabric. It's actually horrible. Very uncomfortable.

He had tried other seats with limited success and he loves this one. I knew about the Obus because I've used one for over 15 years in my Subarus (not known for their comfortable seating) and it is still in acceptable shape. I bought it originally because I'm a small person who rattles around in most vehicles and had a lower back problem, and it has made long distance driving without pain possible. It also goes well with the lower back rest, but can be used very effectively without it. It has an inner form that is far and away better than other seats I have tried. Don't even bother looking at other brands. This is the best seat on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for big people","review":"This cushion is not made to be used by men over medium size. It has an interior plastic frame. The sides of the frame swoop upward. The padding is soft, not dense, and the edges of the frame dig into thighs and upper legs. No way I could get used to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin for a day at the office","review":"I bought this along with the Ultra back rest from the same manufacturer. I love the back rest, but the seat was too thin for a day at the office. I'm a fit 30-something with lumbar and cervical facet issues, hence the interest in these products. The seat is not angled, so it doesn't do anything for pelvic tilt while working at a desk. Also, the foam cushion flattens out after less than an hour, and by two hours sitting becomes painful as all I can feel is the hard plastic frame below, which is not removable. I just took the seat off my char and find the chair cushion more comfortable. I'm sorely disappointed by this product and could not recommend this to anyone. Others have complained that the edges of the plastic frame dig into their thighs; if I were a bit larger (I'm 5'9\\" and 165) I can see how that would be a serious issue as well. Poor design overall and not at all ergonomic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as comfortable as I would have liked","review":"After sitting in my recliner too much and triggering a bout of back pain (that later turned into a severely herniated disc) I purchased the Obus Ultra Forme backrest for added support. I was so happy with the backrest that I decided that adding the seat was called for. It unfortunately turned out to be fairly uncomfortable. The support was pretty good, and the problem might have been that it was too small for my recliner, but I ended up returning it. I'm 6'4\\", 200lbs, so maybe I don't have enough built in padding, but regardless, I was disappointed in the seat after being so happy with the backrest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"I wanted to wait a while before writing this review to see how the product would hold up over time. The black fabric has no pilling, it's easy to clean and helps to correct your posture while seated. I got this for my husband's work vehicle. If you've ever had a company car or work truck you know you're at your boss's mercy when it comes to repairs. The driver's seat should be replaced but since the boss doesn't see it as a priority I bought the Obus Forme. I have no complaints about it but if you don't have common sense you may not have the foresight to notice from the product image that every time you exit the vehicle it will shift a bit because it is not attached to the driver's seat. This means you will have to shift it back into place. A small price to pay for a comfortable seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lots of fun for a little guy...","review":"There are so many way to enjoy this toy.

In Moth Crazy, he manages an impressive feat by showing himself capable of interweaving history and romance, suspense and wit. Featuring a young man's coming of age through trials of graduate school, archaeological digs, encounters with colorful characters and attempts to make sense of a wild adventure, Potter's first novel is clearly not for the staid and unimaginative. This book is waiting to be picked up by unsuspecting readers and trust me, won't be set down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unconventional Gem","review":"Moth Crazy is a great tale of adventure mixed with the internal quest for identity and acceptance. The methaphors and unconventional (yet entirely readable) story-telling capture the reader, unfolding at a sometimes frantic, sometimes measured pace. Elements of mystery, love, personal struggle, and an unforgettable cast of characters make this book a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures in the human condition","review":"Moth Crazy is written in a unique style taking advantage of different perspectives on the same situations by different characters.

This is a buggy program that I could not get to install and work properly. It caused immediate blue screens, and had to be removed in safe mode. Apparently this is a common experience. Based on my experiences I can not recommend this program, which is unfortunate given how good their software has been in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verdict: guilty as charged.","review":"After having seen the glowing review in PC Magazine and the mixed reviews of Amazon customers, I decided to reserve judgment till I'd tested the program myself. Well, the verdict is in. Every time I downloaded ZoneAlarm into a computer, that computer would lose the ability to connect to my on-line service. Guilty as charged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, bad installer","review":"I purchased this product to upgrade from the 2005 version. The written instructions tell you that the installer will give you the choice of a clean install or upgrade, but it never got that far when I ran it. Instead I got a message that this product could not be used to upgrade. After reading through their (very helpful) online FAQs, I determined that I would first need to uninstall the previous version, then do a clean install. That worked fine, except that every so often when I start up the computer I get a message that my subscription has expired (even though it clearly hasn't.) I emailed support, and they quickly sent a reply with the procedure for correcting the problem... which involves uninstalling, reinstalling, deleting a registry key, blah blah blah. Other than this, I think the product is fine. The only negative thing I can think of with the actual software is that the email protection is very slow, though that may have to do with the size of my inbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service Rating is 1 star or less.","review":"The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned.

Takes a few sessions to allow ZA to learn what programs you use routinely (by user selectively choosing to always allow). I supplemented my ZoneAlarm Suite with Spy Sweeper, to really protect against spyware, as suggested by a review I read. I would recommend both these products. The only complaint I have with ZA is that you cannot create an online user account if you do not buy directly from Zone labs. This means you would have to type your license key in each time you request support--hence, 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all-in-one security system","review":"This suite is easy to set up and use with many levels of security that can all be set individually. The firewall and virus protection are first-rate, and the option to block personal information from being sent to unintended web sites is a godsend. The banner ad blocker does restrict some valid content at the highest setting, but it is simple to scale this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of support","review":"Up until version 6 of Zonealarm, I would have given a hearty two thumbs up for this product. With version 6, and Check Point's take over of zonelabs, they have stumbled hard. Contrary to their assertions, Windows 2000 Pro and XP Pro are NOT fully supported. If you are a running a windows based network with multiple users, active directory, roaming profiles, this product will cause no end of grief for the client machines. New users will not be able to log on. Users will not be able to log onto different computers, unless you uninstall Zonealarm. Zonelabs tech support's response is that they do not support these integral features to Windows. Instead they try to shift you to their 'corporate' Integrity product, which is waaaaaayy too much product for most ZA users and waaaay to expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"no email protection","review":"I am surprised how everyone says how wonderful this suite is but never really mentions email protection. Protection is quite good and the main interface is good and easy. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT ZA ONLY SCANS EMAIL/ATTATCHMENTS IF THEY ARE USING OUTLOOK EXPRESS AS A MAIL CLIENT. I emailed ZA and they did confirm that email scanning is not available to other email clients. So all in all a major part of my computer is not protected. This partnership with Microsoft is annoying. I was considering Kaspersky Security Suite but it has the same problem. I guess I will have to look for something else or depend on AOL for mail protection.By the way ZA runs very nicely with AOL. Protection is offered for IM but not email. Kaspersky causes havoc when I run AOL.Oh wellIvan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about upgrading from an earlier version.

I had been using Norton for several years but decided to change because of what I had been reading about the new Norton 2006 edition. Perhaps this was a big mistake? Zone Alarm loaded easily enough and I was able to set all settings without any problem. However, after loading and starting up, all, and I mean all of my other applications ran extremely slowly from this point on. I have decided to keep Zone alarm in hopes a future update will correct this problem but I doubt that it can or will.

Her voice has a hint of maturity, but still needs to loose that kind of rich girl from mexico accent. Once she experiences some more of life and hopefully learns from more international producers she may even make it to the top of the charts world wide. I normally don't like the female pop stars like thalia or Paulina cause their talents are more about shakin it and lookin cute, and not so much about their voice ( which is sad if that is what the standards are in Mexico) Thankfully we have Christina Aguilera, who I know isn't what many may consider full Latina but she tries and does it better than anyone so far. Hopefully Belinda keeps working at her voice really hard and with time and luck we may have a real talent in Mexican Pop for once!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitching","review":"There are times when you listen to an album for the first time and it feels perfect for the moment. Think of Coldplay's Parachutes or Feeder's Echo Park. The Picture show contains utterly beautiful, bitter-sweet, spirit lifting tunes, the sort of music that you hear snatches of during scenes of high emotion in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Roswell.

In the songs with morals in them, you can tell that they don't really mean what they're saying. In Do Your Own Thing, they sing in these flat voices that are just SCREAMING \\"None of these words are worth your life.\\" In Amigas Cheetahs, they finally notice that and try to make their songs very emotional (and I'm pretty sure the songs were meant to be sung with heart), but they exaggerate it so much that it sounds like they are having a seizure.A better band for kids would be The Naked Brothers Band (there's one girl in it, but it started out as all-boys).

DeVoto wrote the book in 1943 and takes shots at Indians, Mexicans, Mormons, Eastern Intellectuals, and Texans in general and Fremont, Polk, Stockton, Zachary Taylor, and others in particular. I had the strong feeling that DeVoto was telling it as he saw it and many of his observations were humorous, acerbic, and accurate about the myths and mythmakers of circa 1846. I enjoyed this book, but occasionally was lost in DeVoto's stream of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick as a brick","review":"I had read a book called, \\"Ordeal by Hunger\\" for my book club and loved it. The writer was able to place the reader at that time and place very well. It was written in 1936. This book, however was not just about the Donner Party but about the year 1846 of which the Donner Party was but a small event. Nevertheless, I couldn't wade through it. I was bogged down in every paragraph. The writing was so dense, as to be incomprehenible, most of the time. It felt like the author was showing off, how can I make this sound smarter, more than it is? Perhaps, it was just out of my league. I did glean some interesting facts from his account of the Donner Party, but not enough to override my utter lack of wanting to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year of Decision 1846","review":"A great read.

The episodes (which I'm guessing are from the early 90's, so keep in mind that it's not HD, and beware of the ugly sweaters) are just about their dives and the current status of the shipwrecks, not history of the ships themselves.

With Titanica, you can see the ill-fated ship in her final resting place. One of the most incredible cinematic shots I have ever seen is your first view of the bow itself; on the large IMAX screen, you suddenly feel your equilibrium go out as your brain tells you that you're truly flying; I can guarantee Claire Danes knew her feet were still on the deck. While an Imax movie inevitably loses something by getting scaled down to the small screen, Titanica is a voyage you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the others, save your money","review":"Seeing as I normally ignore reviews and form my own opnion, I got burned bad here buying this DVD. Its watchable, but nothing special. The vaunted IMAX pictures really look nothing different than what we've seen before, and in fact spends more time above the surface or just in the debris field than actually pictures of the ship. If there was any footage of inside the ship, I must have blinked and missed it.About the only new thing I observed from this was how much a ghoul Ralph White is, and his comments as he wants to pillage the ship I'm amazed they didnt edit out.Its almost worth buying this DVD to hear his Russian divemate chide him for wanting to open lugguage on the ocean floor \\"But zat does not belong to you!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Story, Not Enough Screen","review":"'Titanica' documents the efforts to film and salvage some of the remains from the Titanic wreckage. How the scientists are able to take themselves to the ship in and of itself is an interesting story, but too much time is spent on that aspect. Tension develops as scientists argue among themselves over what artifacts should and shouldn't be brought back to the surface. Unfortunately, that scene is about as exciting as it gets.The history of the ship and its fateful voyage is adequately covered, but I would have enjoyed hearing more information from the two survivors who were interviewed. Like all the IMAX DVDs, 'Titanica' ultimately suffers from being forced onto a small screen. The information presented is somewhat useful and moderately interesting, but the small format of a television screen (no matter how large your home entertainment center stretches) just can't inspire the awe that viewers experience in an IMAX theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This IMAX DVD is very disappointing. Much of it consists of old newsreel footage and still images of the Titanic rather than the stunning IMAX photography I was expecting. There is even quite a bit of time devoted to images of the submersible crews looking out their window and operating the subs. If you are looking for a short, semi-documentary on the Titanic, this might appeal to you, but if you are looking for IMAX images of the ship then this DVD is a total flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"I have seen many Imax films, and this has to be one of the worst.

Unless you have legs like tree trunks these are simply too big, especially around the legs. The cinch straps wont tighten enough on these meaning they are free to rotate around and leave your legs dangerously exposed.

I wouldn't recommend these to anybody apart from Nellie the Elephant or Dumbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit for average sized guy","review":"At 5'11 and 200lbs, I guess I am fairly average sized. These chaps are enormous for 'one size fits all'. They should advertise that they protect your stomach and chest since you have to cinch the belt up near your nipples to keep from tripping over the bottoms. One remark I heard was that I appeared to be a 90 year old man with my Sansabelt slacks pulled up sky high. I wore boots & jeans and they were still very baggy.I didnt test the function of the chaps, but they seemed to be fairly easy to work in. They were hot though...I had to take them off every half hour to cool off.All in all, if they do what they are supposed to, I'll be happy to put up with the poor fit and odd looks to keep my legs attached to the rest of my body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gap in protection","review":"Because of the way these chaps are cut and the one-size-fits-all fitting (my waist is 34\\"), the leggings tend to rotate so that my inner calfs and thighs are very exposed. It seems that the inner legs are as likely to get hit as the outer legs, so I think this is a pretty major design flaw. I plan on returning mine and trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really one size fits all","review":"The quality of these chaps seems pretty good, but the claim of one size fits all is misrepresentation.Unless you are 6 foot plus, 200lbs and have a hefty build, especially thighs and legs, these will not fit you.I'm 5 feet 9, 168 lbs. and they were a good 6 inches too long and with the straps tightened all the way were still very loose on my legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"These chaps are more dangerous than wearing nothing at all.","review":"These chaps fit too loose,and the straps are a tripping hazard.

I wish I had spent my money on a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety on a Budget!","review":"These chaps adjust to fit just about any size and they are long enough to cover to your shoes. I am 6' and 225 lbs and I think I am about halfway in the middle in terms of the range that these will adjust. The nylon padding appears that it will jam a chainsaw on contact.

Despite the brevity of the text, a blocky font makes it difficult to read. The 'duotone' reproduction is achieved by imposing blue plate on the black plate--making vintage photographs resemble a poorly adjusted television screen.

The second half of the film is not related to the plot of the first half. This also happened in BOOBY DUPES, the following short.FLAT FOOT STOOGES (1938) is not great, but not terrible either. There's just nothing special about it. Too weird of a plot.Not a good tape, one great short, two weak ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Kienzle - Phhhhtttt","review":"I put Jimmy LaFave in the same category as Emmy Lou Harris. It is not always for the casual listener, but they both certainly have songs that would fit this category. You have to actively listen to both these performers to really appreciate them. Mr. Kienzie must have been listening going down the highway at 90 mph talking on his cell phone. That is the only way I can figure out he would trash the CD the way he did.It is definitely a CD that grows on you the more you listen to it.My favorite cuts were \\"Woody Guthrie\\", \\"Never Is a Moment\\", \\"Tears\\", and \\"Love Can Find Its Own Way\\".Besides covering other artists excellently, Jimmy LaFave is the King of Red Dirt Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody's got one....","review":"I would hate for someone to believe the nonsense contained in Amazon's Editorial Review of Texoma. It certainly deserves a place on the shelf of any fan of American folk and rock songwriting. In addition, Jimmie LaFave is actually one of the finest interpretive singers I've ever heard, particularly when it comes to Woody Guthrie and Dylan. And if Lafave is only spouting cliches, somebody better tell Nora, Woody's daughter, and Mary Jo, Woody's sister, because they think he's great. As do I, and I suspect, as you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A class act!","review":"This is the only CD of his I own, but I surely intend to buy more.

I LOVED the shoes so much that I purchased 2 additional pair for me and 2 pair for my daughter. If I could afford to have them in every color I would buy them all. The sneakers do not have a lot of support, but they are not meant for jogging or exercising. They are by far the most comfortable everyday casual sneakers I have ever owned. I walked an entire day at Disney World and I could still feel my feet at the end of a long day. I think they are more comfortable with socks, so I always wear them with very thin cotton socks. As far as the size, for me, they run true to size. Mine have held up very well and I wash them regularly in the machine.

But zillion small parts take an adult about 30 minutes to assemble, and don't snap securely-- thus it falls apart almost right away with regular play.

While looking for that poem, my used bookseller found an Everyman edition of \\"Never Such Innocence\\" on the off chance I might be interested. It is absolutely wonderful. It is a collection of heartbreakingly beautiful poetry by British poets during World War I. My seller was lucky enough to get a used copy in pristine condition for very little money and I am now buying another copy from \\"Julie's Bookshop\\" in the U.K.I recommend this anthology for anyone who loves meaningful poetry and since it is out of print, get a copy where you can, while you can. It is a collection I cannot put down and keep it at the ready always so I can re-read many of the poems that remind us all of the tragedy of war....lest we forget.

I managed to find my way around the mistakes and eventually get the desired setup (I think), but it wasn't an easy task. I was pulling my hair out on more than one occasion and I've been doing this for seven years.Overall, I would not recommend this book to a beginner if you plan to learn from the tutorials.

It is probably the poorest instructional material I have encountered in all of my years in college. Humor was incorporated into this text in an effort to help students better understand the material, however, that effort is a big failure when it comes to this student, and probably also for many others.Instead of helping, the humor detracts from the instructional value of the material and distracts the student rather than helping him or her to comprehend. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 deal with rhetoric and fallacies, however, I have found those three chapters to be the most incomprehensible and unhelpful chapters in the entire book.

The first time I used it the motor burned up. I took it to the local factory repair center where it stayed for 4 months! It took that long to get a replacement motor from the factory. It has never worked right since. The factory refuses to replace it because it is now out of warranty. I have a housecleaner who has brought her own vacuum because this one works so poorly. I think I got a lemon and the factory refuses to stand behind their product. It has been used a total of 5 times in the past 2 years and now does not pick up a thing. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Short Stories!","review":"I got this book as a going-away gift. I started to read it and found the stories very inspiring. They were good and short to the point. I liked the way the stories were tied to a biblical passage and a moral teaching. I have continued to use this book over and over again.

The story within the story (the struggle between the Wolf, Rainbow and the heroic farmer boy Jimmy) effortlessly keeps the children involved.

Guest Artists like; Dave matthews, G and B, Rob Thomas and others get together to make this a superb music dvd. Once again the sound quality is one of the best I've had to pleasure to listen to. The song \\"Maria\\", performed by Santana and the Rappers G & B was truly great. The guys from G and B being youngsters compared to us, \\"Baby Boomers\\", seemed to enjoy the experience of performing with Santana a true pleasure.

What an enjoyable experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Video Production","review":"This DVD is a must for your concert video collection. The video production on this disk is outstanding. From the guitar cam effects to close up shots of the crowd, you feel immersed in the auditorium. You won't see any cameramen crawling around the stage dressed in black clothes. It's a mystery where they shoot some of these angles from. The sound is a top quality mix but not quite up to what I consider to be the ultimate standard on the Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. Still an awsome audio experience though."},{"rating":"2","title":"best music DVD I've ever owned","review":"This DVD is taped from the Supernatural concert. The quality is very good.

It worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations lead to disappointment.","review":"First let me say that I'm a Carlos Santana fan. No one plays Carlos' signature riffs better than Carlos himself. But ask him to play something outside of his comfort zone and Carlos is a fair to middling guitarist at best, especially when you consider he's been playing guitar for over 50 years. His attempts to add something with acoustic guitar to songs like Sarah McLachlan's ANGEL failed miserably. He looked lost during song intervals that \\"begged\\" for guitar riffs and when he did play, the riffs were amaterish and distracted from the song. And the fact that his solos are limited to about a dozen signature riffs wouldn't be so bad if he didn't insist on making the solos so long accompanied by facial expressions designed to convince us of the \\"supernatural\\" effort behind them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana","review":"This is a very good Santana concert DVD.

No se puede comparar con el de los Eagles ya que este último es un concierto acústico, aún así a mi me gusta mucho más, y desde luego, muy superior al de Sheryl Crow. Es una suerte que Santana haya tenido este éxito con Supernatural que nos haya permitido disfrutar de la grabación de este concierto con imagen y sonido digital, cosa que no podemos hacer con otros grandes grupos de los 70 y 80. El único pero que puede ponerse a este concierto, es que nos hubiese gustado que en el hubiese habido algún tema clásico de Santana más, por lo demás es una compra totalmente recomendable.

I don't like the songs performed here though. I don't like what Santana is doing lately either. Why is so impossible to get a DVD like \\"BEST OF MUSIKLADEN 1971\\" and this DVD is everywhere? Chester Thompson plays so great Hammond Organ solos, but GREGG ROLIE will always be the greatest keyboardist that Santana ever had. And after him, Tom Coster.I would like to know if Santana is interested in his old fans to release a DVD one day of a concert from 1970, 1971 or the Lotus era. Let's have a balance here. It's being released a video for every pop song lately but nothing from the stuff that makes him what he is and what he will be remembered.

Just one big zero. But I can't give this album a zero, because Amazon doesn't have that option.I'm willing to try another earlier album, when they presumably had more spunk and were willing to take chances, but there is NOTHING new or interesting in this album for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"41/2, but it's still a must own for trioheads.","review":"Alkaline Trio is back again. After 2003's successful \\"Good Mourning\\", the band has finally shifted into a new direction. And that new direction? More rhythum, not so much punk rock. The dark lyrics, allthough present on this album, are not nearly as dark as the Alk 3 we are all use too. This album is also 99% curse free, minus one s word. Strange for the Alkaline Trio.Time To Waste is by far the best song on the album, and the first single. But other great songs include \\"Burn\\", \\"I Was A Prayer\\", \\"Mercy Me\\", \\"Deathbed\\", and \\"Sadie\\". But this whole album sparks a much different turn for the Alkaline Trio.Someone told me awhile ago that this album is what thier last sounded like, and they went back into the studio and changed it at the last minute. Intersting. Well \\"Crimson\\" is a great album, and is very much an Alkaline Trio album, I can't help but say that \\"Good Mourning\\" was a better album, as well as all the other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ak3 get an Unsatisfactory in the Effort department","review":"I have always been a fan of the Alkaline Trio, but with this album they just seem to be going through the motions. Crimson, like Ak3's recent Good Mourning, lacks the raw energy and lyrical wit of their previous releases. Of the newer Ak3 releases, From Here to Infirmary is the most coherent, since it combines solid songwriting and energy of prior releases with slick production. These songs just seem uninspired. I want the Ak3 that made me feel the hangovers, envision a baby crack from work related stress, and taste sour home Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but really, really good.","review":"Deathbed is my favorite track on here (I just realized that it was 6:40.

Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimson is the Trio's best so far","review":"I have read a lot of the reviews for \\"Crimson\\" and I saw the same thing happen to my favorite band a couple of years ago. Die hard fans blasted AFI for moving past its hard core roots. But AFI grew as musicians and songwriters and produced in my opinion the best rock album of all time with \\"Sing the Sorrow\\". Alkaline Trio seems to be taking the same route and it pays off. I read a lot of criticism about the guys moving more toward a pop rock style and getting farther away from the \\"One Man Army\\" punk style. \\"Crimson\\" starts off with the first 5 of seven tracks that are good enough for extensive radio and video airplay. Time to Waste, Poison , Burn (my personal favorite), Mercy Me, Sadie..... The list just goes on. This album is head and shoulders better than \\"Good Mourning\\" which was a good album. \\"Crimson\\" is just plain great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alkaline Trio's Done It Again!!!","review":"If your not that big of a fan then this isnt for yeh!! well all the songs do not sound the same even if they did i would still buy the album but hell its alkaline trio come on people!!! Crimson Is probably well (not their greatest) a very good peice of work written by the Trio. The Opening Track's piano arrangement is amazing how it builds up to the complex guitar riffs and drumming abilities of the band. Some of the tracks do sound a bit like each other but if your a hard core alkaline trio fan then yer sure as hell might buy the cd!!

If every single album Alkaline Trio released sounded like Goddammit, Maybe I'll Catch Fire, or From Here to Infirmary, you'd be reading reviews about how every album sounded the same and were just boring. Yeah, Crimson sounds a bit on the over-produced side, but so what? I like the fact that they incorporated strings on this album, just listen to Sadie. I don't think that song would sound the same with the added depth of strings. I mean really, take the organ out of Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water and it's just an average song. Bands are allowed to evolve and everytime I've listened to Crimson, it just becomes that much more catchy. Maybe you wouldn't file Crimson under the term classics with the aforementioned AK3 albums, but I wouldn't sell it short either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but not perfection","review":"good album. the best tracks are time to waste, burn, mercy me, dethbed, and sadie. although dans songs are good ill always take matts songs over his, but i do like how they change pace with the songs. My only problem is that the album ends on a dull note with smoke. get maybe i'll catch fire, goddamnit, and from here to infirmary first"},{"rating":"1","title":"sadness","review":"The one thing I can say this album is it reminded me of why I used to like old, defunct bands that have broken up already. To hear the alkaline trio record something like this is like watching your pet dog you've had for 7 years get hit by a car, both of which are slightly less painful than seeing them on MTV made up like the killers. The only song i do like on this album is \\"If we never go outside...\\", and it still pales in comparison to the band I fell in love with and got tattooed on me 5+ years ago. If you have any sense, buy one of their first 3 releases (Goddamnit, S-T, Maybe I'll Catch Fire.) If you're a big fan such as I, you have to buy this, but dont say I didn't warn you. I'm going into my room now to put on Goddamnit for the 40,000th time, and pretending this album doesn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring overall","review":"I've gotten to the point now where i just download singles and make mixtapes. \\"crimson\\", as with most rock records these days, carries more fillers than killers. Mercy me and Time to waste are exceptional, but the rest fall short. One after another song just fails to meet the expectations set by Time and Mercy, and at the end, you're left wondering how \\"crimson\\" even made it past pre-production. If you're a typical top 40 buyer, you've probably grown used to the trend of 5 or more fillers per record, but if you're more into those solid 10 track indie epics, you've come to the wrong place."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Trio Cd","review":"If you're not a huge Alkaline Trio fan then you will love this cd. The music is incredible, the vocals and harmonies are awesome, and the the production is great. The only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because the lyrics aren't what they use to be on their older cds. It use to be that every song would give me the chills, and i would be amazed by their lyrics. That only happens for a few songs for me on this cd. They seem to be all about the fire the last couple of cds, and i don't really think that's all that cool. I like the songs such as aurora a lot more. These are the songs that seem to be coming from the heart, rather than just trying to be cool. Anyway with that said i still love this cd, and can't wait to listen to it. I've still yet to find a trio song that i dislike."},{"rating":"2","title":"confessions","review":"I must confess that I only bought this album so that I could be somewhat acquainted with Alkaline Trio before attending a My Chemical Romance concert where they would be playing. I fell in love with this band the instant I popped the cd in. The lyrics are very deep and the music is fantastic. I listened to the cd non stop until I had learned every word. It set a tone and a standard for a lot of my own writing. I haven't heard anything else that Alkaline has put out, but this album made me a fan. It's a must for anyone looking for some good gothic, melodic, easy rock music. Highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline","review":"By far the trio's worst album, they started at the top of a hill and have fallen significantly with every album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Sacrilage","review":"After I heard \\"Good Mourning\\", I lost all faith in my used to be favorite band, Alkaline Trio. And \\"Crimson\\" is even worse. It hurts me so much to do this. Alkaline Trio used to be original. They had such a unique sound. And I'd like to add that I'm not one of those people who complains when underground bands go mainstream, I LIKED \\"From Here To Infirmary\\" just fine, but I am one of those people who complains when good bands go to sh*t, and such is the case with Alkaline Trio. If you want to hear Alkaline Trio in their prime, I'd suggest \\"Maybe I'll Catch Fire\\", or their self titled. If you're looking for something dark, and something that won't be a waste of your money, I'd suggest purchasing MCR'S \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\".

Skip it if you live in Northern Michigan. Very little of the timing will apply to you. One other thing I didn't like was how many chemicals (of various sorts) they tell you to dump on your lawn. Every month it seems like they're telling you it's time to put one or two more on your lawn or in your beds.

It is ex players in the band who call themselves Saxon. It would be like Vinnie Vincent starting a new band called KISS. The band doesn't sound bad...but the audio and video don't always match. And the cut aways are bad. It's like watching someone who thinks they are funny tell a joke and that person is the only one laughing. I would probably pay the four dollars I paid to download this to see this band live...if I didn't have anything else to do...Some shots have a small crowd right up against a stage...then switch angles no one is around and the band has no energy but they still try to pretend they are pointing to someone..then magically a crowd reappears.So a lot of times its like watching a rehearsal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't play","review":"Can't comment on the concert amazon has it listed as NTSC but it turned out to be PAL formatted.

In regards to the latter, this is arguably the book that placed experimental methods on \\"map\\". In terms of its media findings, it does an outstounding job of documenting agenda-setting and priming effects; also, there is a lot of sub-analysis that nicely details which people are most prone to and what type of coverage enhances such effects. That said, the findings will likely strike many people today as fairly obvious, but this was not the case at the time (a testament to the research agenda I&K established). While the agenda-setting, priming, and now framing research has progressed in the last two decades, this is still an excellent introduction to the topic.

The recipes themselves are pretentious, and require ingredients or combinations of ingredients that are not in most pantries, unless you work for Dean & Delucca. Saffron, thick-cut Seville marmalade, ripe peaches, steel-cut oats, sea salt and Stilton cheese. These ingredients are obtaintable in cities of 85,000 and over, or online, but it is necessary to plan ahead. No spontaneity in the morning allowed here!

The muffins were just awful and have ended up in the trash, tasteless!! The sour cream cake, well, just as bad. The banana bread is still in the oven and I am afraid to try it at this point!!

I was given incredible run arounds on returning it for a replacemnt. They wanted me to have it serviced, I insisted on a replacement. Bottom line, they were impossible to deal with. Even the top managers just didn't care. They begrudgingly sent me another one, but first I had to ship the old one at MY OWN expense.

My only complaint is, when I pay full price for a book, I expect it to be free of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors...and this was not. I believe the fault lies in the conversion to the Kindle format because, for example, the name OLLIE is consistently written as 011IE - the letters O and L being read as the numbers 0 and 1 instead. There are also MANY misplaced periods, which interupt the flow when reading. The word \\"detective\\" was missing several letters as well.However, these types of errors are HUGE pet peeves of mine and may not be as bothersome to others.The photo quality in the Kindle version is also HORRIBLE.

To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it.

The music is a good creepy mood setter, the character design is unique (I like the Mataichi Gang's caricaturized look and how non-main characters are nearly blankfaced or kind of resemble goblins or elves), and the stories are pretty cool.In the tradition of many anime I've seen, the story does start a bit abruptly, forcing the audience to simply accept the characters as they are and ride along with the story, which begins with small isolated vignettes connected only by the characters observing, gradually building to a larger plot climax. Regardless, the self-contained stories are entertaining. It's similar to series like Vampire Princess Miyu, and is reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt in its blood-and-gore themed morality tale.Not for the faint of heart, of course, but definitely entertaining if you're in the mood for some macabre tales to creep you out a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"requeim from the darkness - turmoil lf the flesh (vol.1) + series box","review":"this is one of those scams they tell you about. this is one disck. and a box that holds 4 discks. you can buy the only dick in this set for much cheaper and not alot of extra cardboard.so to review, scam scam scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless as a cookbook","review":"I found this book useless as a cookbook. The techniques are way too complicated and the ingredients nearly impossible to attain unless you are a Korean farmer living in the countryside 60 years ago. Most Koreans don't live and cook like this book describes; it was a way of life for the privileged quite some time ago, and was not common even then.It's more of a food-related memoir, with many descriptions of life as a rich family in a small town in Korea in the early 20th century.

She quickly threw together her Korean cucumber salad in about 10 minutes! Tasting them side by side, it really hit home that the version I made was definitely Americanized.So if you're looking for unnecessarily labor-intensive, Korean-fusion cookbook, then this is the one for you. If you're looking for a good, solid, everyday Korean food cooking, then this is NOT it.And what's up with the walnuts added to everything? My theory is that the author's family must have had a large walnut tree. ; )And yes, I am Korean for those of you wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to try some of these recipes","review":"Being half Korean, I was hoping to learn at least some of what my mother has cooked for me since I was small. Upon reading the book, I did. There is a lot of history recorded in there about many traditions. There is even a recipe for soy sauce made from scratch. I recognized some recipes,but, am eager to try the many more tantalizing dishes that I've never heard of until now. Although it is difficult to obtain a lot of ingredients where I live, I am willing to try to experiment with what I can. It is an excellent source for learning the cuisine, although, there should have been more photographs of the food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality or ?","review":"Another fast moving thriller from Alex Abella where he again displays his unique ability to mingle reality with the supernatural.

My favorite routine in the movie is easily Astaire's and Garland's \\"a couple of Swells\\". I always look forward to that number no matter how many times I watch this musical. However, I often wonder how the dancing and singing sequences would have changed had Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly not met with accidents prior to filming.

What is it about her? More than 'talent' or 'competence,' surely. 'midnight choo choo in alabam' - part of a thrilling montage of Astaire & Garland duets - all aimed, as ever, at getting them to 'The Palace' - is one of the most astonishingly 'right' set-pieces I've ever seen in film. Utterly alive & intense - and Garland's voice, vibrato, have such warmth and laser-sharp accuracy it takes your breath away. Nice special features on this video, too. Astaire's daughter Ava and Garland's biographer John Fricke's commentary does not seem superfluous (as George Sydney's does in \\"harvey girls\\"): they're fun, smart & illuminating.Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy and Fred!","review":"This movie is one of the best movies MGM ever made!

This never happened because the ENTIRE film is a JOY from start to finish. The story proceeds with marvelous comedy and holds you from start to finish.

By the time they reached the stage, the screen started to roll-up and the Stage Show would start. Very campy yes, but it looked beautiful.Speaking of beauty, i've always felt that this was one of Judy's best next to \\"Meet me in St. Louis\\". She was a stunning beauty in both.

If ever there was a Cybernetic Anthem, this is it! \\"Perspective II\\" is getting back to the original idea of Electronic Music. Short but pure Electronic Music. The next two tracks seem to stray a little I think, but interesting all the same.

This book was so off the mark in reference to taking the dashboard apart to access the blower motor switch (it did not tell you that you had to loosen the under panel under the steering wheel in addition to the instrument bezel cluster) and so off the mark in reference to the blower motor (there were five screws instead of three screws and the manual did not tell you that the stud that the coolant resevoir mounted to gets in the way of removing the blower motor. You literally have to remove the stud to get the blower motor out of the truck)A pathetic excuse for a manual.

This video provided very little verbal instruction. It would be helpful if the massage specific terminology used was defined or described. The verbal instruction ofetn did not relate to the masssge technique being shown. Often the camera angle was blocked by the person performing the massage so you could not see how to do the massage. They did provide overhead camera angles which would have been ideal for the entire video, but rarely used it.

It's actually thoroughly enjoyable, and I can think of a small handfull of movies that have a premise as ridiculous (or even perhaps more ridiculous) than this movie. The cast did a great job, and I for one think it's nice that the movie is filled with real action rather than CGI effects (look at Star Wars: Lucas has bragged that some shots are 97% digital...and lo and behold, the movie is soulless). Forget what the \\"critics: say, go ahead and check out this movie. Costner, Hopper, Tripplehorn and crew each give nuanced performances that are suprisingly well-developed for an action movie. They were far more developed in the uncut version (which is yet to be released on DVD, but here's hoping we'll get an HD version).

It is worth a lot of money because it is the most prized possession in the world.

With a budget of 200 million dollars you'd think he would have made something wonderful. Unfortunately, he lost his shirt on this one. I don't think the movie even made one-quarter of what it cost. The story was all wet and so was the acting. Kostner shouldn't write anything. He should stick to what he knows which is acting. The whole movie is set on water which was quite tiresome at a movie running time of 136 minutes. Enough is enough already. I couldn't possibly suggest that you waste your money on this trash but you might want to get it just for laughs. I think Kevin's ego was getting the best of him back then. Remember those other extrememly long epics he put out(Wyatt Earp for instance. Booooringggg.)? I'll spare you the details.Buy the Untouchables instead. Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch paint dry!","review":"The year was 1995. I was only nine years old and even as a nine year old, I knew how stupid and senseless this movie's plot was. The idea that the continents could be drowned by the oceans is incorrect and wildly exagerated. Even if all the ice on earth melted like it did in the movie, it would only raise sea level by a few feet or so. To suggest that even the highest mountains, several miles higher than the oceans, could be submerged by melting polar ice is just absurd! Thats like saying that the ice cubes in your freezer are going to flood your entire house if you turn the heat up too high! I can't reccommend Waterworld to anybody. Global warming is nothing more than a whacko doomsday theory, and a story about it does not make a movie entertaining--it just causes stupifying boredom!

This movie was hyped up to be a blockbuster smash with, at its time, the largest movie budget ever. It got bad reviews and didn't do well at the box office. It has since turned into a cult classic and is now on HD DVD. HD is dead pretty much by now but people are still buying what is left out there.This movie has a cool theme based around the polar ice caps melting and covering the world in water. People are trying to survive and one has even evolved. Enter the main character, the Mariner. You follow him through his adventure of trying to save his own skin but ends up helping in the quest for dry land.The picture quality is very clean and clear.

In the meantime he will clash against a diabolic gang led by Dennis Hopper that maintains intact the collective illusion of homeless and desperate men who truly believe and have trusted him to lead to the promised land.Visually stunning, the complex stage is a crude image of the apocalyptic landscape. Tin garrisons built in the middle of the sea, and elemental weapons conform an adventure worthy to watch in despite of a negative fame due unexplainable motives.Perhaps the close resemblance with the futuristic nightmare of Mad Max and some fissures in the script tended to weak it, the movie preserves the tension with some humoristic touches here and there and predictable situations along the drama folds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable flick","review":"This movie might seem dated to some now 15 years after its release - really an inevitable fate for ALL movies sooner or later - but it's still a very fun movie with a serious message even if the plot/backstory of how the world became flooded is a bit exaggerated. It's interesting to see how people try to survive in this 'Waterworld', especially since there are now no longer any freshwater lakes and rivers and the world is covered by saltwater. It was cool to see the atolls, and people placing such value on items we take for granted, like dirt, or a simple bath. It does require a bit of suspension of belief - it's hard for me to believe that modern-day cigarettes might still be smokeable 1000 years from now - but who knows, with all the chemicals they put in cigs, it just might be possible :P I do wish there had been a bit more exploration of a backstory.

I teach third grade and bought this book for my classroom library when we got our first hamster. When we got another species, I couldn't find the book! It's always in someone's desk so they can read it next!!There are a lot of pictures and it's laid out in a simple manner. It's not confusing to read and laid out in a manner that I learned a lot and my third graders are learning a lot. It is great for children because it doesn't go too in depth on mating issues...it explains basics without graphic detail like I've seen in other books.The best section is on the hamster life cycle! I got two Dwarfs who happened to be male and female (unknown to me!) They've already had too litters and the kids are learning now about the hamster life cycle. This book has been invaluable for that. The kids are able to view pictures of the newborn babies without having to disturb mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV Guide Presents First Show From a Series","review":"This is a fun two disc set for TV Nostalia Fans released by TV Guide.Disc 1 includes:1.

I thought the book was very up to date with the advancing technology of computers and the internet. Some features that I liked about this book was the vocabulary terms located on the side of each page and a summary of vocabulary terms at the end of each chapter. I thought the layout of the material in each chapter was terrific and I thought the examples used in critical areas were helpful. I liked this book very much and would recommend it to any student wanting to acquire more knowledge in marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review-Tonya Penrod","review":"This book, Marketing: Connecting With Customers, is the required text for my Marketing class. I have found it to be very helpful and easy to understand. The reading is not very confusing and they explain things very well. I also like the way the publisher uses present day examples that helps one apply what he/she is learning. The figures and illustrations are easy to understand and give an excellent summary of the information that is being taught. One of the best features in this book, in my opinion, is the \\"Connected: Surfing the Net\\" sections. This is a very good idea since more and more of our lives are spent on the internet. Overall, I would have to say that this book is easy to understand and makes learning more enjoyable by relating to today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing Applies to Everyone","review":"I am in a Principles of Marketing class as requirement for a degree in accounting. The book made the concepts associated with the various marketing strategies very applicable and easy to understand. I found that the many figures and charts were key to understanding the material. The book used mainstream illustrations to help the concepts \\"hit close to home.\\" For example, the book uses pop-icons like Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan,and Oprah Winfrey as illustrations for various concepts. I found that the chapter reviews were very helpful in preparing for tests. The book covered the four p's of marketing thoroughly. It clearly emphasized the proper ethics of the profession. This turned out to be one of my favorite courses this semester. It would be profitable for someone of any major. It taught me how to try to sell myself to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing--a good text book","review":"\\"Marketing: Connection with Customers\\" is a good text book. It basically easily to understand. It has comprehendable deffinitions and text. The only problem I have with this book is that the index is not complete. It is very difficult to find something using this index since many of the items are not listed, but on the whole I would encourage use of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"By far, this is one of the worst \\"academic\\" books I have read in my four years as a college student.

The reading is not very confusing and they explain things very well. The definitions in the margins are also very helpful when studying. The figures and illustrations are easier to use and understand than some of my other books. The Career Tips and Summaries at the end of the chapter are also very helpful. This has been a great book and I liked it so much I decided to take the class over."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an Excellent Book!","review":"I have found this book to be very helpful for any individual trying to have a better understanding of the principles applied in the process of marketing. This book, according to my understanding, has been designed to meet the needs of the average student searching for basic information as well as those individuals seeking deep comprehension of what marketing is all about. Through the use of a series of figures, pictures, real life experiences and applications, the authors make the book come alive and the concepts easy to grasp. I also consider it to be very important that this book covers, explains, and exemplifies five of the basic and fundamental elements in connecting successfully with customers (relationships, ethics, globalization, technology, and diversity). In conclusion I will qualify this book as an excellent tool to learn about marketing and all of the elements involved in this interesting subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing: Connecting With Customers Review","review":"I purchased the textbook Marketing: Connecting With Customers because it is the chosen textbook for my college marketing course. I found the textbook to be very good. I really like that the definitions were placed in the margins as well as in context in the reading. Being able to refer to the definitions in two different ways was a good way to reinforce them in your mind when preparing for a test. Most of the figures in the text were useful; however, some of them had such little information that they appeared to only be there to take up space. I enjoyed the real life stories and examples that were incorporated into the text and placed at the beginning of each chapter. The internet sites located in the margin were also a very good feature. I really liked the summaries at the end of each chapter. Overall, I think this is a very good textbook and I would recommend it to others who are interested in marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studying the Principles of Marketing","review":"Hello, I am a student at Hannibal LaGrange College and your text, Marketing : Connecting with customers was our required text for our Principles of Marketing course. I felt the text was over all very informative and I feel the authors knew a great deal about the marketing subject. The graphs and charts were very useful, though a few were at times difficult to see what point was trying to be made. As for, will I keep this text after my course, no, why? My major is in the Accounting and Finance field and though I feel I acquired a great deal of knowledge from this text, I don't feel I will need it as a reference in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing: Connecting with Customers","review":"The graphs and charts that the authors used in the book were of fairly good quality, but the charts were postioned poorly. I do not wish to keep this book a the end of the semester I will trade it back for part of my money back. The changes that I would make on this book is that the authors need to put the figures in where the figure is introduced in the text, some are on totally different pages at times. For example on page 350 the book says, \\"in figure 12-4 indicates...\\" the figure is actually located on page 352. The authors introduce so much information in one chapter and then in the next have very little. The author also have a dendecy to repeat the same stuff over and over again to make ready very boring. Over all I really did not like the book, and reinforced my decision not to go into Marketing as a career. One useful feature the book had is that it came with a cdrom that was not to bad, just that we did not use it in class."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most famed pianists in the world !","review":"Cyprien Katsaris is an astonishing pianist. His countless contributions respect minor works of well known composers such Brahms for instance, made of him to defy that epic challenge that means to play these Nine Symphonies transcribed by Franz Liszt for the keyboard.You may realize that, with the only exception of Leslie Howard, there has not been any other pianist who has decided to face with the countless difficulties demanded for the score.But Katsaris confers éclat, elegance and expressiveness, without losing that Beethovenian drive force,that makes - at least to my mind - an insurmountable and excel effort worthy to admire and acknowledge.Don't miss these extraordinary recordings of this notable pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"A well flowing book that embraces the reader into the story with a fast-paced grace. This is one book where the descriptions of the locations render an eclectic, visual landscape of some amazing places in colorado and elsewhere, paving the way for an emotionally colorful, adrenaline packed roller-coaster ride that ends only when the story does!For those who read the earlier book (Fractal Murders), this expands on Mr. Diet Coke's self-questioning attitude, with the enhanced (sometimes dark) humor at places striking a good (sometimes thin) balance between good and evil! The witty conversations (and succint remarks) are refreshingly captivating and are worthy of mention!For the rest, just read the book! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"I had read the first in this series, \\"The Fractal Murders,\\" which I enjoyed, but this was even better. His style reminds me of the very best of Robert Parker--sense of place, great characters and dialogue-without the things which have begun to bother me. I very much enjoy the relationship Keane has with his friends, family, and even with the witness. There's no pretentiousness, or annoying girlfriend, but there is humor although people keep telling Keane he's not as funny as he thinks he is, good action and suspense. It was an exciting, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS?","review":"I assumed this was a DVD and was shocked that there are still VHS tapes floating around out there or VHS players for that matter.

Its maxims can, with an open mind, be applied to almost any walk of life, though especially to the business world. It emphasises loyalty, determination, and most importantly foresight and analysis as keys to success in life.I give it a 4. Its not necessary to get through life. A lot of what it says is obvious.

I can't believe it ended up getting some award nominations; there are some holes you can drive a truck through. Plus I didn't see how the Egyptian timeline meshed at all with the Salem one.

By the way, you pay for shipping both ways, and it's not light.After it sat by the door for a few days I double checked just to see if maybe it had been a brown out. Some appliances won't turn on if there's not enough power to them. Lo and behold it turned on. So back out of the box it came. I used it that evening. Then tried again the next day. Nope.The electronics just aren't up to snuff. This is a fickle machine and certainly not worth $99. Oh, and JR doesn't like returns. Apparently through Amazon they'll give you 30 days, but if you buy from the store it's just 14!!!Don't buy this. If you do, your only option is to burn incense, sacrifice animals, and beg on your knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another one that died within the first month","review":"Mechanically, the unit looks good, but the electronics started acting up within the first few days and blew out the first time we had a power interruption.Bionaire cutomer service says to contact the dealer first, but I'm not sure how one does that at Amazon.In any event, at 21 lbs, this isn't going to be cheap to ship back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be disposable","review":"My daughter has had some severe respiratory issues, so my husband and I decided to purchase the 1175. Within a month of running it 27/7 on low, the display on the unit, disappeared and a couple of the fans stopped working. Thinking that there was an issue with just my unit and foolishly not looking on here, we asked for a replacement. When we received it, the same thing happened, the display faded and this time, we woke up one morning to nothing - the motor had quit. Needless to say, we didn't even bother to ask for a replacement, just a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeatedly defective","review":"The Bionaire BAP1175 air filter worked for a few days and then two out of the four fans speeds stopped working. The unit was replaced, only to find that the replacement lasted a matter of hours before the fan stopped completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great air cleaner!","review":"I bought one of these for my Mom. It works so well, I bought another one for myself! Using it for about six months and very happy with the purchase. I live in a very dusty building. When I turn the unit on the highest speed it clears the air in a matter of minutes. I often use the low setting for sleep time. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"If you want to invite frustration into your life, order this air purifier. It is nothing but a waste of time, money and energy. This company should be sued for the volume of defective units it sells. I tried out a total of three brand new identical units and all stopped working after a month. The display screen got all funky and the fan just stops randomly, then it never goes back on again. Competely frustrating. I purchased a second unit thinking there was something wrong with the first. After the second broke down I called Bionaire and they sent me a new third unit to try, but only after I paid $25 to send my disfunctional unit back. This unit direct from the factory had the same exact problems. After all is said and done, it was such a waste of time and money. Please don't buy this unit. Bionaire needs to take responsibility for the poor quality product they are peddling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild surprise...","review":"If you've read the other reviews I won't retread ground but I was surprised by the emotions that this film evoked. I was expecting a straight up cheesy action flick and the fact that Paul Walker was the star didn't boost my expectations at all. Nonetheless it was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend it and my only complaint is that I feel that the end was a cop-out happy ending to satisfy a main stream audience. Kramer would have gotten much respect if he left off the last scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I have watched this movie several times and love it. it does have some scary parts to it but it is very believable. It does have some violence and I would not recommend it to teens under 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?...","review":"...Think again. RUNNING SCARED is filled with surprise twists and unexpected plot changes. Although a bit goofy and even corny in some spots, it never disappoints. Profanity and violence gratuitous, but it's just that kind of movie - at the top of it's game in that category. If you're looking to be entertained and taken on a wild ride - WATCH THIS MOVIE!! If you're looking for intellectual stimulation -don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Paul Walkers better action flick.","review":"There ares so many different dub-plots in this movie you might be afraid of losing track. You won't in this one. Both sentimental AND tough story lines converge into an ending that could go either way. It is exciting with enough of American violence to keep the most jaded interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far over, the top cannot be seen!","review":"I read the reviews for this and heard that it was really fast-paced, and let me tell you it does not let down in fast-pacedness (Is that a word). I thought that it would be way too complicated to be good, but it delivers just fine.I won't give a plot outline because their already are quite a few on this page, so I will just review the movie.Paul Walker delviers his role as a very angry, angry man, greatly. Though I wouldn't expect an award from a more esteemed company than MTV.I would say that their is a nice little sex not too far in, not for prudes. Some of the scenes, or all, can get a little graphic, so I will repeat again, not for the faint of heart.The camera is perfect and the snapshots are greatly delivered. The movie is full of twists and turns up to the last minute, but not bad enough to get confused.The DVD itself is not that great, but as I said, I am reviewing the MOVIE.Not the Greatest, but still awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walker makes Pauley Shore look like Deniro","review":"GARBARGE. Won't waste my time writing review for this movie swill, but check out Scott Chitwood's review online. Chitwood makes it look better then it is.

Good actors and good directing. The story takes you along at a nice pace. The kicker is a scene concerning our hero's wife. Defintely a movie to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Grand Theft Auto: The Movie\\" is more like it!","review":"This movie was soooo ridiculous it was truly a friggin shame. It kind of plays out like a \\"Sin City\\" rip-off, but without a linear storyline. This movie was put together like a bunch of college kids who origianly came up with a good idea for movie but didnt know how to put it together. The story is choppy and it goes every which way, and in the end you are not even sure if the plot even makes sense or if it even exist! The guys who wrote this movie wrote it like a comicbook mini-series, in the sense the story is told in blocks and chunks. That style of writing is great for a comic book, but when you want to make a movie you have to pull every thing together. The visuals were pretty good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to its title","review":"40 Years ago, \\"Running Scared\\" was a hit song full of pathos. 20 Years ago, \\"Running Scared\\" was a great buddy movie starring a dancer and a comic each of whom was also a superb actor.This movie doesn't live up to either, or break new ground of its own.If you want to contribute money to the studio or your local theatre, find a more direct way than spending it on this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"My schools film department could have made a better film...","review":"So apparently the films catch was let the actors wing their lines. All I heard was F$#@% F$#@% F$#@% F$#@% the entire film, I felt like I was listening to a broken record. I'm all about action and drama and this film has plenty of it but I feel like all the characters are portraying a bunch of junior high kids trying to sound tough. This is a text book example of writers who cannot write dialogue to save their lives, or careers. Stay far away from this film. Films like these are the reason the film industry is going down the tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The movie was recomended to me by a friend. Its a terrible story that just keeps getting worse. Not only is it unbelievable but its one of those movies where you can't put yourself in the shoes of any of the characters. There's no way to identify with any of them. In the end, nothing that you have watched has any significance. There's no wrap-up that makes sense of it all. Like I said, its just a bad story that keeps getting worse. I know one person that liked it. Maybe you will too. I thought it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry ps3 owners","review":"i give 2 stars because i luv this movie, but this bluray disk will not play on my ps3 so it was a waste of $32"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Great action movie... a lot of suspense. This is one I had to buy... it's along the Smoke'n Aces, Death Sentence, line of action. Not suitable for a younger teen audience in my opinion, but a great watch... At the price on Amazon it's totally worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Used) Wrong Case, Great Movie","review":"If you like this movie, it's worth the $3 (including shipping). The CD was in great condition for being used and the case artwork is in phenominal shape. The only problem is that it's in a blockbuster case that is a nucense to snap shut and that no pamphlet came with it on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"a realization of how unxpectedly life can turn bad in one moment","review":"I love the rush of this movie, the intensity, everything is going so wrong, I also would be running scared out of my mind.

I would defenitly recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie for videogame numbards!","review":"Any simpleminded bigot who has delusions of the way Russian Americans and Italian Americans behave in New York will find this two-hour music video hugely entertaining. But mostly, it's a giant bore, from the laughably intense scene examining John Wayne films to the tired finale. The whole thing reeks. Mobman Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker) hurries to retrieve a gun he hid in his basement before it falls into the wrong hands. Too bad that he's so despicable that nobody cares, including the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"violence for violence sake","review":"This movie doesnt even make sense. Your watching it and saying to yourself \\"what? why? how?\\" The point of the movie seems to be to TRY ( and fail ) to connect an endless stream of scenes of violence and trying to kill children. The scene of the couple making child porn and murdering the children was especially sick. The writer / director of this movie has some issues. This movie is for the fans of extreme close ups of graphic bloody violence and no one else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cameron Bright","review":"Zero StarsNot a resume builder.No child should have been permitted to appear in this film let alone view it - EVER.Possibly the most violent movie I have ever seen and I missed the beginning: totally gratuitous buckets of blood and more obscene language than could possibly have any point. There should be a foul word count to see if a record has been broken: this is almost a farce about bleeding, cussing, chasing and shooting. A relentless campaign of sadistic wanton violence.I feel badly for Cameron Bright and I mean that - really I do: and shame, shame, shame on all of the adults who must be embarrassed that they cannot find real work.A reminder that 1st time director is code for \`can be bought cheaply'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"This movie was too long and there were too many characters in it. It would've been interesting if the Muppets were thrown in there, you know, for some humor. Thanks to the dumb rappers, I got to hear a white guy call another white guy the n-word. Other than that, this movie is too dark and no children should've starred in it. Adult midgets should've been used instead. There was too much second-hand smoke going around too. Anyway, if dude would've gotten rid of the gun in the first place, he wouldn't have had no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Action Packed Thrills and Drama","review":"Watched this On-Demand on HBO, with no real expectations, while I was working on other things. I was surprised at how well laid out the story was, and how I was drawn in. It is a dark story of a rather unfortunate scumbag Joey played by Paul Walker who is supposed to get rid of a murder weapon. Things go terribly wrong when the neighbor kid (Nick Naylor's kid from Thank You For Smoking) uses the gun to shoot his abusive step-father.From there it is a frantic chase to get to the kid and the gun. Along the way the Joey's gang, the Russians, a Mexican Poker game, dirty cops, a totally effed up pedophile family, a pimp and much much more,The colors, imagery, and blurred slow to fast shots really make this movie something different than your average action flick. I would consider watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of twists - so good","review":"let me tell you if you like movies with twists... go get RUNNING SCARED!!!!like right now!!it's one of my latest favorites!!!it's full of twists, i you can guess, but you won't know the end!!!it's so clever!!!! :Phighly recommended!!! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!!!.....Why I never saw this movie in the theatres?","review":"This movie made Paul Walker stood out....in a good way. He was actually convincing and I believed him to be the Joey Gazelle he played. I am all for action movies and this one was beyond awesome. They way it was directed, the camera angles they used, it was all great. I'm ashamed to say my first time watching this movie was a week ago because it is seriously one of my top favorites of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"very one dimensional","review":"When I looked up this movie on Amazon it had an overall rating of 4 stars, so I thought it would have solid acting.

It's a shame because it is a great movie and this is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hunting this movie down to give it two stars","review":"The reasons why this gets a two.1: There is not one normal person in this movie. Everyone carries a gun, knife, everyone deals drugs, everyone is a perv. Each character that comes in the movie is messed up. Completely stupid.2: the word f**k is used so much, I was almost laughing at one scene that was suppose to be serious. imdb.com records 328 it is said, the movie itself is only 122 minutes. Do the math and figure how many times you'll hear it a minute. Thats abusing it,taking away the effect of the word.but its also pretty sick and gory, which is cool. so expect a haedcore action movie that is completely unbelieveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is simply nuts!","review":"Wear a diaper when you watch this.

While Gregorian Chant has become popular, especially with the recordings of Santo Domingo de Silos, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that Gregorian Chant is sung prayer.

I was pleased then to have her book in hand, and finally get to see some of this magic that I've been hearing about from so many others....What struck me right off the bat about this book was the fact that Chellie offers her wisdom about money and financial attitudes in such a positively LOVING way! She makes no bones about wanting to have lots of money, but she also wants to SHARE what she knows about making money with everyone she can. What better way than by personal examples, gentle warmth and humor, daily affirmations, savvy insights, and good old-fashioned common sense.If you feel impoverished in ANY way, read this book! It's not only about the richness that comes from money - it is also about the love and healing that come from a healthy spiritual life."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I have been reading this book for at least five years now. The daily readings inspire and encourage me through all types of events in my life, not just money related. I love being a dolphin, I hate sharks, and I don't like tuna, except on a plate. The author motivates with positive affirmations that strike a chord with me every day. Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I purchased this for all my clients","review":"Wow, if you are an entrepreneur or small business owner who wants to stay motivated and on track, this book is for you. I purchased it when it was first published and have purchased dozens of copies since for my clients. Chellie Campbell provides just the right mix of business advice, motherly nagging and beautifully woven metaphor-stories that can motivate me even on my most stubborn days. From this book I have learned how to give up the \\"I am so tired blues\\" and how to find and play with dolphin (the best) type of clients. A story I return to over and over is the story of Bijan - the knight in shining armor tow truck driver who reminds us that even in what seems to be bad circumstances, we really are very lucky.

My Mac Tiger picked it up without a hitch.Smooth, responsive operation.Three button ease.Nice grip on sides.The con:Its size. More like a river rat than a mouse. It's huge and tall. Shaped like a hill, it forces my wrist to flex upward and made my carpal tunnel tendencies flare up within 2 minutes of using it. If I move my hand farther up to straighten my wrist a bit, my fingertips extend past the end of the buttons. I have small hands and the size that worked best for me to date was the Macally Opti Junior. However, my Macally developed a poor cord connection within 2 years of buying it. Ergo, knowing that Kensington is a trusted brand, I researched and bought this one.I'm stuck with it and now will have to figure out a way to rest my arm on a raised surface to prevent the strain-producing flexion of the wrist.Otherwise, it's a fine mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits into the palm of your hand!","review":"I've been using a mouse with a ball track for far too long, so I finally broke down and started researching mice. I saw good reviews for some of the higher end Logitec. My main concern awaiting my new purchase was to find a mouse that felt comfortable and had a reletivly high dpi. An employee recommended this mouse to me and stated he's been using it for years. What drew me in initially was the comfort, first and foremost, secondly and most importantly was the price.

She clearly knows her subject. I recommend this for anyone planning a visit to Morocco..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear and difficult to follow","review":"This dvd was very hard to follow. Sometimes the dancers feet weren't even visible. There were no instructions on leads, and just the bare minimum on footwork, and most of the time there wasn't any instruction at all.

Joseph Mazzello plays Roarke, the son of Gail(Meryl Streep) who is a white water river rafting guide. They take a ride down a river with Roarke's father, Tom, played by David Strathairn. They have a fun time at the start of the trip, but when two fellows (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) ask for help riding down the river, things start to become odd.This is an excellent movie with great acting by Joseph Mazzello, Meryl Streep, and Kevin Bacon. I highly recommend it. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you just beg that the family will make it out okay. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adventure/suspense movie","review":"I saw this movie a long time ago at the theater.

The suspense and action is a must-see, and the scenery is absolutely beautiful. The way their ride through the rapids was filmed is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Bacon's best performance","review":"One of the least talked about films of the 1990's is also one of the best. This is an often overlooked gem featuring perhaps the best performance to date from Kevin Bacon. The movie itself is a nice change of pace for an action movie. It keeps you hooked from the beginning to the very end and it seems you learn something new about the characters in every scene. Bacon plays the evil villian to perfection and for the first time in along time, he seems motivated. If you are a fan of Kevin Bacon, this is a MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"One of my favorite movies--excellent cast, all of them, good script and fantastic location shots, and most of all one of the best film scores ever, based on the beautiful folk song 'The water is wide.' Having it on blu-ray is the crowning touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enjoyable thriller","review":"This 1994 film starring Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep was decent from start to end. The film is an enjoyable thriller set on a river to which Streep's character's family end up journeying and meet a trio of guys on the way. With some spectacular photography showing some breathtaking views, this film has something for everyone. Law and Order star Benjamin Bratt also pops up in the film.Well worth a watch, and a rewatch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild River","review":"My grandson is a Meryl Streep fan and I decided to give him some of her earlier work that I had enjoyed as we are working to completed his colletion."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"SINCE IT WAS FILMED IN THE NORTWEST(MONTANA) MAKES IT EVEN BETTER!

This is a good movie to just sit back and enjoy the ride even though as the plot develops you may feel bit uncomfortable.Meryl Streep is outstanding as usual, however I feel Kevin Bacon is even better as the deceptive, yet charming 'bad guy'. There is also some excellent acting by David Straithairn (who portrays Meryl Streep's husband) even though his character is annoyingly pathetic.The nature cinematography is spectacular and the high intensity musical score only adds excitement to the journey.I highly recommend watching this one on a home theater system with wide screen and DTS sound decoding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray?","review":"I am not an expert on Blu Ray transfer, but have watched enough of them by now to judge one from another. I am very disappointed in this new release. The movie itself is one of my favorites. I was excited to hear it was coming out on Blu Ray. The quality, in my opinion is mediocre at best. Usually I am in awe of any Blu Ray release because the picture is usually so perfect and unbelievable. No cigar on this one. It looks like someone took the regular DVD, slapped it into a Blu Ray recorder and sent it to me! Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streep's dumbest movie.","review":"This lamebrain stinker is pathetic, illogical, and ridiculous. Streep should be ashamed of this one but she probably needed a payday. Among the many laughable moments is near the climax when the husband miraculously manages to get miles and miles downstream on foot along a rough, cliff enclosed, wild river far ahead of a raft running the rapids. He must have flown, taking his dog with him. Absurd. Then he sets an unlikely trap with barrels on the cliff that Streep rows the raft over to from mid river, then she fishes a gun out of the river with the little boy, a true Hercules, pulling a cable to bring the raft through the rapid water over to the gun. Whoever dreamed up this joke of a film must have been smoking a lot of dope, and made a dopey movie for dopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word that describes this movie does not exist","review":"This movie was dull, predictable and dull. I guessed before the movie was half over that Kevin Bacon was the bad guy who held up the Livestock Auction. I also guessed that the Husband who was \\"dead\\" would make like Lazarus and come back to life and along with the runaway Dog would save everyone from certain death. Meryl Streep acted as though she was half awake and bored during the entire movie, she hardly woke up when the raft went down the rapids.

The pilates is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved Old Turtle....","review":"Like Wood's book, Old Turtle, this story is more for adults than for the children they'll read it to - the illustrations (a different illustrator) are beautiful, using soft autumn watercolor tones to illustrate grandfather as he speaks with his grandchild about nature, spirit and the connection all people have to one another.Essentially this is a book about loss, dying and eternal life. It can be a beginning point for a discussion with older children (ages 8 - 16 or so) who have experienced a loss of any beloved friend or family member.If I had grandchildren, I'd want to have the hardcover book available for them to read. The book is written to offer room for people of nearly any faith (even agnostics) to begin a discussion the meaning of life and dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandad's Prayers for the Earth","review":"Heartfelt and warm, without going overboard on the emotions. I especially liked the way this book showed the love of the Grandfather for his grandson and vice versa. It's portrays a lasting and wonderful relationship. Perfect for my teenage boys. One of the best picture books I have read. I am sure this will become an instant classic that will stand the test of time. Douglas Wood's writing is concise with perfect timing, he carries the reader immediately into a quiet walk where you can practically smell meadow flowers and hear the trees growing. P.J. Lynch's illustrations are more than beautiful, they carry the tone perfectly and add individual touches of poignant reality to the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silence of Prayer","review":"The Buddha teaches that the more that one says about enlightenment (or about god), the less accurate it is. No, this book is not specific, dictating what prayer is, who prayer should be directed at, or what major words should be repeated until they have no meaning. This book is about prayer. It is about silence. It is about seeing god in all creation. It is about aesthetics. Hesitant with dogma, but abundant in beauty, this book was a marvelous tool to discuss what prayer means with my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching Children to Pray","review":"I picked this book up at a garage sale for $.25 because the artwork and title called to me. I would have gladly paid more. After reading it I would classify this book as priceless.I have been searching for a way to teach my own children how to pray that is removed from the make a list and ask God for everything like a vending machine. This book subtly roars against that notion. It is a beautiful tribute to a man's memory of his grandfather's own prayer life and the friendship they shared. Every family should have these deeply rooted heros to look up to.The illustrations are just as deep and heartfelt as the story. I can't recommend this book more highly and will be using it in my own life and helping other adults come to a better understanding of prayer. Thank you Douglas Wood for sharing your wonderful grandfather with us all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Fragrance","review":"I have worn this for years. It is one on my favorite perfumes.

There are great endorsements by writers of prominence in the African American community and I'm wondering if they read the book or the excerpt. The latter is excellent and I thought the storyline was great but the writing is disappointing. The transitions and dialogue between the characters don't jibe and I'm finding them to be unbelievable.

I love this story line and the way Ms. McFadden had you from the first sentence to the last. I hated for the story to end. I still feel the need to know more about all of the Taylor's and Mercy.

I could not put it down and even after finishing it, I still wanted more. I read this book at every moment I could.

Sugar was one of those books. Both Sugar and Pearl will be with me for a long time, and I really, really hope Ms. McFadden's next book will be a sequel. I HIGHLY recommend this one...even suggested it to a book club I belong to. I really want to discuss Sugar in a group! Wonderful job, Ms. McFadden, and PLEASE do a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"This book kept you in suspense as to what will happen next.

That Sugar stirred up some stuff! Once you read this one you must read the sequel This Bitter Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Fast Read","review":"This is a must read. It was symbolic in a sense. I understood forgiveness, regret, and remorse. This book captures your attention from the first page. I started reading the book about 12:00p.m. I was finished at 11:00p.m. I could not put it down. It may be graphic for some, but it gave just enough detail for the reader to understand. I did not like the ending because I wanted more. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unspeakably beautiful writing","review":"Sugar was the first book I read from author Bernice McFadden - which made her my favorite author. The underlying plot is brutal, but her writing is sensational. She carries you through mists of thoughts and feelings with her absolutely wonderful turn of phrase. Her writing is poetic. The novel is so rich in characterization and tone that it forces you find any other book written by her to make sure your recollection of being carried away by her prose was true. And, guess what, it IS true. Not to ignore the plot, because it made sense, and she covered all bases throughout. She is magnificent! I now have all of her books and will continue to read her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't Nothing Sweeter than Sugar","review":"This has to be one of my all time favorties. I feel so attached to the character Sugar in this book. She is definitely one you would love to hate and hate to love. Sugar turned every town she entered up and round and round.I really felt sorry for Sugar with all that she had been through. All she wanted was to feel loved and according to the way she was raised it just wasn't modeled before her in an ethical way and I believe that is what led to the way she lived her adult life.I am reading the sequel, This Bitter Earth now and it is all coming together. YOU MUST READ THE SEQUEL!! There is more to Sugar and her past than you'll ever know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and different","review":"The cover and the title suggest something totally different from what we actually get. Expect sweetness from \\"Sugar,\\" but get the raw reality of growing up displaced, wandering from town to town searching to find one's identity, and never really belonging or finding love. Sugar uses the sale of her body as a means to survive, and when she finally finds a place to call home, her past catches up with her. You can't imagine the ending. You have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar take you back to a time..","review":"when life was simpler and uncomplicated. And that's what happens to the town of Bigelow, Arkansas when Sugur Lacey sashay's her hips into town. The women are immediately whispering and the men are intrigued. Sugar begrudingly befriends Ms. Pearl and the two become friends - mostly due to the fact that Sugar bears an uncanny resemblance to Pearl's murdered daughter Jude.Sit back and enjoy this tale as the women of Bigelow try their best to oust Sugar from their sleepy town, while Sugar awakens something that's been dormant in Ms. Pearl for many years and Sugar learns something about herself.I'll admit I've had this book for at least 8 years and initially I couldn't get into it. Eight years later I'm glad I gave this book a second chance. If you enjoy the Color Purple or the earlier books of J. California Cooper than you will love this book.It's not an easy book to read - there's alot of imagery used throughout, but in the end you'll be glad you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just outstanding","review":"I've read Sugar, this bitter earth and camilla's roses...ALL GREAT books. Bernice does a wonderful job telling a compelling story, you're not going to be able to put the book down.Sometimes her stories are a bit depressing but they are still great!, I do feel that her endings seem a bit rushed, that's my only issue, other than that, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I read this book maybe 2 or 3 years ago. While I cannot specifically remember everything, I do remember enjoying this story, and finishing it in less than 3 days! Ms. McFadden does an excellent job with this one. Great read, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Novel","review":"This was definitely a great read. Pearl's character was so real and she was displayed as a strong woman with keen values and a big heart. Despite Sugar's image and what everyone in the small town of Bigelow think of her she and Pearl become unseparable. Both deal with past hurts and disappointments and somehow still manage to keep it together. Their lives are interwined and held together by much more than conversation and shared southern traditions. The secrets that unfold will have you flipping non stop til you read the last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start But Worth The Wait","review":"This book was difficult for me to get into at first but I was determined to hang in there and glad that I did. I found the writing and character development great. The story however was very sad, particularly what ultimately happens to Sugar and her revelation that she is who she is and 2 weeks won't change it. However, I loved the way that she stood up for herself in church just before she left. Neither the characters or story line were superficial and seemed to be the product of careful thought and deliberation. The only regret is that I wished the lineage between Sugar and Shirley would have been revealed, if for no other reason than to put Shirley in her place...does this mean a sequel? I think there are so many lessons one can take from this book starting with personal redemption, judgement, acceptance of people who are different and on to unconditional love. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Read","review":"Ms. McFadden's writing style is rich, lyrical, and powerful, keeping you turning pages filled with characters that continue to haunt long after the last riveting page has been turned. She has skillfully woven a tale where the reader will be compelled to care for the characters. These are characters you feel you know and love. Ms. McFadden has done an excellant job in invoking compassion from her readers. I look forward to her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The story of Sugar is beautiful, tragic, happy, hopeful and sad all at the same time.

It started off really slow (for me at least), but quickened in pace and thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar","review":"This book I started reading and read some of it, but I am a Christian and didn't like the words and the sex that was in the book so I put it aside. It is not for anyone that doen not like their book to contain sex and violence , you might want to think twice about this one. It does go into Sugar's experiences as a prostitute and her feelings about it. It also describes violent and disturbing crime done both to Pearl's daughter and done to Sugar herself.The book was supplied to me free of charge and did not ask that I do a positive review"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Imagery and Story Telling Is Genius","review":"Only one other time in my life did I crack open a book and literally shout \\"You Go Girl!\\" as I read the words on the page! Bernice McFadden takes you straight into the heart of this town. I love the intertwining story lines and connections and not for a minute was I lost. I appreciate this artist, and compared to her, I find alot of other writings just dull. McFadden could write a math book and I would be excited to read it. She stands and holds her own alongside such brilliant writers as Toni Morrison and Dolen Perkins-Valdez. Sugar is definitely a must read, and a beautifully painted masterpiece whose shine will never dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar","review":"Very well written and emotionally filled novel.

I wasn't thrilled with the ending and what the future appeared to be waiting for Sugar, or the Taylor family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigelow will never be the same...","review":"Bernice McFadden does a great job of making you care about the characters in this book, especially Sugar. Set in small town Bigelow, it's a heart wrenching and gritty tale that keeps you engaged until the very end. This book was hard to put down and ended with a surprising twist that made all the pieces fall into place. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth while","review":"Bernice McFadden is an excellent author. She captured my attention with Gathering Waters, I then read Sugar and could not stop there... This story will take you on a journey far beyond the average read. With each page you anticipate the next and hang on her every word... Beautifully written. I laughed, cried, and envisioned every scene as if I was there.

I was stunned at material and very, very moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCEPTIONALLY COMPELLING","review":"Ms. McFadden is an excellent story teller with an exceptional use of characterization. I read \\"Sugar\\" in 2000 and found it to be exceptionally compelling and impossible to put down until I had read it in its entirety in a single day. And I have been a fan every since.

I will refer back to this book often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you think you know about prisons, read this!","review":"I had already done prison work many years ago but I learned a LOT from reding this book. I had thought the book was small for the money, but it was worth every dime. Very short and easy read but crammed with valuable information about how the prison system works and how potential ministers should expect to behave. Nielsen does not go into depth about any aspect of prison ministry but provides excellent guidance about what to expect and how to avoid making mistakes that could be more harmful than helpful to both the minister and the ministy. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUGAR MELTS","review":"Saga has a special friend, Sugar, a weather fairy visible only to her, who at times makes you drown in her sickly saccharine sweetness. She actually would be a little cute if she just kept her mouth shut! With her annoying voice it makes you want to step on her. These two episodes are a flashback of sorts from the perspective of an older Saga as she remembers when her class put on a school play. As Saga's class prepares, Sugar and her fairy friends also begin to produce their own play, with more humorous results.The problem with this show is that it lives by cuteness, but Sugar is more grating than sweet. The only comedy relief you get is from the class prima donna, Greta, who is a walking cliche, and the other fairies. But it's not enough to make this special interesting or engaging. I can't imagine anyone sitting through the 24 episodes of the regular TV series after seeing this sample.I would recommend the anime Figure 17 for a good example of mixing cuteness and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for late night reading.","review":"My kind of night time reading book here, full of short ghost stories. Most stories in this book are good, but one or three sounded like their authors were finally getting some use out of their Creative Writing 101 college course. The only negative thing I can say about this book was that it was over much too quickly for me (even though the book was 215 pages long). My only hope is that USA Weekend (the publisher of the book) comes out with a second version some day. The stories in this book I kind of equate to having the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" series on DVD, always fun to come back in a few months after reading them and giving them another read (maybe during the Fall months?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIY dead guys","review":"Most ghost-story compilations center around the same old stories -- the Bell Witch, Lizzie Borden house, Winchester Mansion, yada yada yada. This one is different. The stories are unique, told in the everyday language of the folks who experienced it, and all of the stories are a welcome surprise -- some funny, some poignant, and some (YES!) downright creepy. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that scary","review":"Some of the stories made me glance over my shoulder, but some were also pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, this one is a really good book and I highly recommend it if you're into ghosts. The fact that so many people came forward to tell their story makes me feel like maybe there's more to this paranormal stuff than just spooky stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish they'd issue volume 2!!","review":"These are great stories about paranormal experiences from normal, everyday people.

Very easy to read. The stories are scary because they really happened to ordinary people. IMO these stories are much spookier than anything you'll find by Stephen King, etc. When you're reading King, you kind of know it would never happen in real life, but the incidents in this book could happen to //you// ... or me or anyone walking down the street.I don't buy that many books, but this is well worth the money.

I diligently researched - and after reading an article (...), I felt fairly confident that the Bionaire BAP1300-U would be a good solid performer at a reasonable cost. We've since gone through two units and are now throwing in the towel. These units seem plagued with problems - and while Bionaire Customer Service folks are friendly, they a) don't have any suggestions to repair the units and b) really aren't familiar with them at all. Our first unit showed a remaining filter level of 98% one day - and literally overnight - dropped to 37%. No one could explain why - and the reset option didn't solve the problem.

THis is truly the worst product on the market - and the VERY WORST customer service i've ever encountered on ANYTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAP 1300 - Strike 1 - 2 days of use","review":"Also after seeing plenty of reviews and doing some 'bang for the buck' analysis... I decided to settle down and order this unit from Bionaire (BAP1300). It had the best CFM for the price. You just take a risk with all the consistent negative feedback on the durability of the unit.I've used this unit for a little under 2 days. The unit stopped responding to the controls and was stuck in the low setting. After unplugging the unit, it completely stopped responding. I will return this unit for a new one, and see if it gets better mileage... perhaps this faulty unit was just a fluke. I'm willing to give them another chance before just doing a complete return on the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality Control","review":"The air cleaner that was shipped to me worked for less than one day before just stopping. I called Bionaire and after being transferred many times I finally got someone who agreed to ship out a new one. It arrived promptly, worked for one day but then would not turn off. After unplugging it and plugging it back in, it did not work at all! I called again. The third one has been working for two weeks now but I had also bought a smaller version, the 1175 for another room in my house and it too is dead after less than a week - the display panel went blank even though it was still running. Now I have to deal with sending it back. There must be some major problem in the electronics - I would never ever buy one of their products again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great (when it actually works)","review":"Bought this cleaner and was happily using it. Till one day (2 months later) it was stuck on low. I could not change it, could not turn it off. Called the company and sent the computer to warehouse. Once I got the new cleaner, it was broken. All four welding spots that hold the fan in the center were broken and the fan was floating free. I thought that welding spots were done very cheap. But I will blame UPS for rough shipping and handling. Returned and got the third cleaner. Two weeks, it stops working. I was moving my apartment, thus I decided to toss it in trash. and swore to never buy Holms products again. Back then I was a second year medicals student. I lost money. I lost more time in these exchanges than sleeplessness due to my roommates smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product","review":"I ordered the product in May.

The unit worked VERY well and I was delighted with many of the design features. I especially liked that the unit could be placed against a wall and still have good air flow. My allergy attacks were reduced significantly. After 2 weeks of use, the unit stopped working. The fan would not turn on at any speed.

Then today (Jan 26), Amazon sent me an email asking me to confirm a new delivery of \\"Feb 28 - Mar 18\\". This was to be a Christmas present in 2004 not 2005! Amazon has a lot of nerve waiting until the last five days before notifying me of another delay of up to a month and a half! Is Amazon that far out in left field with respect to their suppliers?

I find that I'm sleeping a lot better now. If your bedroom size is around 11x14 or less I would suggest getting the BAP1175 and not the BAP1300 otherwise you'll freeze!The only downside is that the HEPA filters are not cheap although they last anywhere from 12-18 months.

My first unit I tried the digital filter usage display stopped displaying some of the digits and I could therefore not make out the true reading. So I ordered a replacement, this 2nd unit didn't work upon arrival. The LCD power came on... but the fan motor inside did not work.

Electrical failures! but if you ever write the company, they will never write back or acknowledge getting your letter. Goes right in the shredder.

The next thing to break (just recently) was \\"high\\". Now it only works on low or medium. If I try to set it to high, it makes a clunking noise and shuts itself off.

It's one of my favorites sopranos, (Herbet von Karajan thinks like me). The incredible voice and charm, the way not only sings, but spills the feelings of grief and joy. I personally like to watch opera, but I bought this CD just to hear Mirellas's voice. It has selections from I Puritani, Othello (one of her best interpretations), Faust, Manon de Lescault and La Boheme. 9 tracks singing alone, or dueted by Luciano Pavarotti, Stefania Malagú or Gianni Raimondi. Peter Maag, Riccardo Muti and Karajan himself conducting. Recorded from stage, 1963-1970 period, the sound quality suffers in some tracks (compare to full digital), but all have the full sound live perfomance that transports your feelings to the stage.While you buy this, I'll go and fetch the first volumen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure it's beautiful but it also can burn your fingers off.","review":"I have been looking around for a Crock Pot for sometime now and finally decided to buy the Rival 5445 because of the stainless steel look and because it was oval. The shape is excellent for putting a whole chicken in but don't expect to leave it in there all day because it can get very hot even on \\"low\\". It was not very well insulated so the pot was even very hot to touch. The steel or metal got so hot the knob cracked off and broke altogether. I don't have children now but it can be very dangerous if you do. I will definately return this one and get one that is better insulated and cool to touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality, not what I expected","review":"I own a smaller Rival crock pot purchased a year or two ago (model 3351). I was so pleased with it that I decided to explore a larger model. This year's products are cheaper, and more cheaply made. What a disappointment.The lid does not fit properly. It rocks back and forth on the ceramic pot so that making a seal is impossible. If you left this cooking all day long, you would loose all the moisture from the meal. The base is constructed more cheaply, with less insulation. The result is that you can burn yourself by touching the outside surface. The newer programmable model is a bit more substantial, but still not up to the standards of our older unit.If you are looking for a good crock pot, I would recommend that you search out a used model. The new Rivals are so cheaply made that I cannot recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Crock I've Ever Used~","review":"While it's a fashionable design, its best quality is sitting on the counter. Never buy a slow cooker with only two heat settings -- low and high. All foods I've cooked have had to cook on the high setting for 6-8 hours. The low setting is below a simmer, and it cannot possibly cook food properly.Also, it's not heat resistant on the outside, and it gets soo hot! Stay away from this model. I'm currently searching for another slow cooker myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I owned this unfortunate model for 1 year. The front nob broke off within 2 months.

I thought I was reading my own words when I read the other customer reviews. Looks great, cooks okay, but the lid doesn't fit. It clanks and drips hot steam all during cooking. To top it off, the outside gets dangerously hot causing the handles to crack and break. Praise the Lord, I was not trying to lift the pot at the time the handles started cracking and breaking off in pieces. It could have been hot wassail all over grandma this Christmas! I'm thinking we may have grounds for a law suit. Reckless endangerment or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing is right","review":"I've had three of these in three years (all gifts sad to say). All three had broken handles after just a few months of use. All three heat too high even on low. The beauty of the '70's Crock Pot was all day cooking and food generated its own liquid. Not so with these newer ones.

Really USED! At least 5 times a week. Dinner ready every evening. It has worked great. No broken handles. Yes, the stainless sides get hot. I have kids around so I place my crockpot - ANY CROCKPOT - on my (not being used) stovetop where everyone expects hot things to be. No one (ages 2 - 50) has been hurt. I cracked/broke the original black crock once and replaced it. When running on HIGH, the moisture around the lid does get too deep and it starts burping/rattling, so I tipped the lid a tiny bit and it stops the burp/rattle. This isn't necessary when it is on LOW (unlike my newer, hotter crockpot). However, the heating unit stopped and I am left with only the crock and lid. A very sad day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Educational DVD","review":"I find this DVD very educational and interesting. All my grandchildren have enjoyed watching this DVD and are fascinated by it. As a retired English teacher, I recommend the DVD since it covers uppercase, lowercase letters and phonics. Each video segment is accompanied by the spelling of each word which facilitates word-recognition. The kids enjoyed all the animals shown in the DVD. At the end of a few letters, a recap of the letters helps the kids remember what they just watched. It definitely helps reinforcing their abcs and is great for preschool learning. I also noticed the dvd has a calming effect on the kids. The DVD is long - over 40 minutes - so well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Like many other parents I bought the whole DVD set hopeing that it would help my children.

My 20 month old daughter watched for a little while but some of the odd graphics actually upset her to the point of tears.

As a digital graphic artist, it's very important to me that the colors are strong and vibrant.

Yes, generic ink costs less, but why take a chance on poor quality, poor pictures, or leaks?The yellow ink cartridge was well packed and shipped within a reasonable time frame. It's easy to install this cartridge and easy to replace. I have noticed that the printer alerts me to change the cartridge way before it's time. Often I'll have that blinking light warning for weeks before the ink actually runs out.

What I mean by that is that the ink level seems to go down on its own even if you don't use the printer. At first I though it was just my imagination but now my son is saying the same thing and after paying more attention, it appears that on some of the tanks that is true. Some of that might have to do with the printer cleaning its print head automatically but I suspect that the ink just sloooowly drains out over time. Also if the little chip goes bad, the ink tank will not work and you will not be able to print until the tank is replaced. That happened to my printer and that is why I bought the replacement tanks. In conclusion - the ink is more expensive than you might think unless you use the printer a lot and then the leakage/evaporation/print-head cleaning becomes a minor consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Canon MP980","review":"I ordered a Canon MP980 printer and purchased the recommended ink 4 pack CLI- 8.

I had this printer for 2 years now and has been confirmed by me several times.

Its a great series, the characters are well thought out and each is different enough to add the interpersonal interest long running series need between it's characters. The first 10 episodes are not really related to the main story, they are more like separate x-files style episodes used to introduce you to all the characters before the main story kicks in around episode 10, this isn't to say the first 10 episodes aren't interesting.. they're a great deal better than your typical x-file episode (but then what isn't with the way that show went downhill).Charles Solomon's covers the basics in his description above pretty well, if you can mentally remove the pompous remarks.

I have to be honest and admit I'm quite stymied as to why anyone would endorse buying her CDs. Yes, Ms. McCorkle can sing. Many people can sing but that doesn't mean they should be selling CDs. Maybe seeing her in a small caberet would be more appropriate. The only \\"jazz\\" I hear is in the fine instrumentals, not in her voice which seems to lack depth or versatility. At times her clear and succinct diction is very painful to listen to. \\"No More Blues\\" is the only decent song on this album; \\"Foodaphobia\\" sounds so strained and out of tune, it's difficult to endure.

While I understand there is a lot of blending in torts among the various theories, it feels as though the editor does little to really distinguish them. There is usually little explanation (even for a casebook) either leading up to or following the cases. It often feels like the furthest outlier case is used to create a \\"rule\\" with little attempt to synthesize it with the other cases in a section, making it difficult to parse out what the editor is really trying to say/show, or what the theory actually posits.

How Evan Broke His Head.... is another fabulous book.At first, it was a little hard to get into. I think it was because it was so different. Different than I; different from other books; I don't know. I have so many books now that I'm torn between choosing. I am so glad that I persisted. Not long after the start, for me it was when Evan takes Dean to the Whitman Memorial, it gets more and more interesting and compelling.The continuing revelations were realistic, and they went deeper and deeper over time. His writing is realistic, too. Believable dialogue; believable imperfections.It is very fun to imagine living with Evan in Seattle and forging a difficult, but honest life together.

But if you are looking to get these to wear out and about I would order down a size. After I got them I read that yes, this is the way they should fit - meant to be large. They seem to be just what I needed and have a nice thick sole that seems to hold up well on the slippery steam room, pool, or shower floor. Recommended for comfort too. But let's face, these are not pretty shoes. In my case I am willing to give up a bit on the style side as I was strictly looking for function."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have!","review":"I just purchased my second pair of crocs - after having the first pair for years I was horrified to learn I'd left them behind when on vacation!I love, love, love these. Wear them in the summer, wear them beachcombing and in the ocean (although you have to be a bit careful there - despite the back strap, a big wave has knocked one off on occasion - but they're easy to see and retrieve) - wear them in the winter about the house with socks.My siblings, who generally go for sneakers and, honestly, were a bit uncertain about the look of them, eventually purchased crocs to try and are now converts. The material and construction provide such a great cushion for the feet. And while I suppose I wouldn't wear them if I were on a serious hike, both I and my husband have worn them camping, \\"tourist\\" walking, walking the dogs, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"CROCS","review":"CROCS are CROCS what else has to be said, they arrived in good shape and they are being used for what they were purchased for"},{"rating":"1","title":"comfortable but really ugly","review":"I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might. In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these. I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable. I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor. The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocs","review":"Wifes second pair.

I picked the same size as my running shoes and they fit fine. Crocs look how they look so expect women to show their appreciation with laughter and furrowed brows. They are very light and comfortable, but I do find that my stride changed to compensate for lower arch support and heel support. After a long walk, you may find calluses on the balls of your feet, largely due to the need to push off from the toes. I haven't had any trouble with slippage, and they seem very durable after a few months of regular wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente articulo!","review":"Estas sandalias son un regalo para mi padre!

They fit fairly well, more comfortable with socks, size 14, black. The right is a bit bigger that the left. I wear them for the most part in the house, wood, tile and carpet flooring. You would expect them to wear slow on those type of surfaces but I noticed that after only two months of use, 4-5 hours per day, the tread has worn away about the heel and beneath the big toes. I do not drag my feet so I should expect a longer lasting shoe. I don't expect them to last more that 6 months. Based on comfort I give 5 stars, for lasting quality 3 stars. For the $44.95 you would expect them to last a year. I'll let you know if your willing to sit there and wait.

They were pretty good. Finally, they wore out and I found Crocs for a pretty good price on Amazon. The difference is astounding. Every step is like a foot massage, and they are much more comfortable than the old ones ever were.

The length is exaxt, and while I do understand the sizes were unisex, these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot. My foot slides side to side in them. I also thought there would be at least a 1/2\\" lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole, however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel. There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe, and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in. The strap can swing frontward or backwards, however when it's backwards, it barely touches my heel since it's so long. It's not as cushy soft as other crocs I've tried on. They are something to kick around in, but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store.

So I order a size 10 from Crocs through Amazon (because I trust them). It arrived 4 days later, labeled size 10 and with the size 10 imprinted on the shoe, but the shoe was 2 sizes too big! After calling Crocs customer service, the rep tells me that it is a manufacturing mistake. So now I have to pay to ship this pair back, and hope I can find a store with a size 10 that I want.

One number is size for men and another for women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocs!","review":"They arrived in 6 days with super saver shipping. I was very excited to try them on, after the wait, since I had heard so many good things about them. The shoes are very lightweight, and they are very comfortable. I have the same complaints as everyone though. I tried on a 9 in a store, which was a great fit, when I received mine, they were a little big. They're kind of difficult to wear as a sandal, but as a clog, the straps really stick to your ankle, and they're pretty comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order Extra Rivets","review":"Shoes are very comfortable, great for wearing around the house and for running errands. Be sure to order extra rivets since they tend to break if you catch the strap on something. Crocs will send you straps or rivets for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sandals!","review":"These are the best sandals I have ever worn! They are great for people with foot or knee problems. I have already ordered another pair. Sizing is tricky but the service was A-1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crocs went from good to bad. Not the product it once was.","review":"Shoe is now a harder material. Not cushy like the original Crocs. Also foot bed has huge nubs that hurt the soles of my foot. 2 pair, navy and black are being sent back. Sad that the company tweaked their shoe, but went the wrong way."},{"rating":"2","title":"crocs Classic Clog,Black,Men's 9 M/Women's 11 M","review":"crocs Classic Clog,Black,Men's 9 M/Women's 11 M; I never thought I would see the day I would by crocs! I think it might be middle age, and my back injury, lol. They are decently comfortable and easy to slip on and off.They also clean easily in the sinkThe sizes are near exact so if you wear a half size, like 10 1/2, order an 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing Has Changed","review":"I purchased the exact same style and size as my last pair of crocs and this pair was significantly smaller. Unfortunately I had taken all the tags etc off before I went to wear them the first time. Before I even put them on I noticed they looked smaller, so I checked the size, which was right according to my old pair but they were significantly smaller. Now I have a pair of Crocs I can't wear. Definitely try them on before you detag them to make sure they will fit the way you are expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Shoes Are Great","review":"I have feet problems and these shoes are wonderful. They are so comfortable that I hardly know I have shoes on. I recommend that everyone buy not one but several pairs in differnt colors because you will like them so much you will want to wear them everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THEM!!!!!!","review":"I bought this product at a CVS drug store for the beach/pool and they are so comfortable and this is my first try I am 24yrs old going to buy two more pairs tomorrow. Great item and cheaper at CVS for around $7"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product.","review":"Nice product but they must run small. I wear a men's size 12 and I ordered a men's size 12. It feels like I should have gotten a 12.5 or 13. My foot feels as thought it is right on the heel ridge instead of being INSIDE the heel ridge. However, they are still very comfortable. My daughter loves hers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked them so much I ordered another pair!","review":"Title says it all. They fit very well and I use them for gardening or other outside work. The price was half of what you will pay at retail stores (thank you Amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now worth the price","review":"When Crocs where a hype I stayed away, but at price they are now they are much better for walking around the yard than flip-flops here in hawaii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Savers","review":"These crocs are incredibly comfortable. I got them for my husband who steps heavily around the house and they have helped loads. The color is very versatile also. He loves them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes","review":"This item arrived earlier than committed to by the vendor and as described. I would gladly purchase additional items in the future from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Converted croc lover","review":"At first I had such a mixed opinion of crocs and I swore that I would never buy them until I needed lightweight sturdy sandals to take with me on camping trips. I can now say I am a believer! The crocs are so lightweight and easily cleaned and dried not to mention the comfort is incredible. I now use them at my job where I am a server and am on my feet 7-8 hours a day. After long shifts like that and my feet feel no soreness in addition they are skid proof so I am not slipping around the kitchen like I was in previous work shoes. All in all these are great shoes. I will definitley be purchasing Crocs again although I don't know when because they seem to be very sturdy and likely to last a long time.PS They are perfect for boating as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SIZING","review":"I first purchased Crocs about 6 yrs ago - loved the comfort, feel, non-slipping bottoms, so I bought 3 more in different colors. Just recently wanted a new pair so read reviews about sizing which can be a problem. My first Crocs were made in Canada - Sz W6-7 for my Regular Sz 8 to 8-1/2 wide feet. These new Crocs - made in Mexico - SZ W8. I recall reading a review about different sizing depends where they are made. Putting one old shoe and one new shoe on my feet, they feel exactly the same, except new shoe has the snug feel a new shoe should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Not a good fit for my feet, which are long and thin; my toes scrubbed against the front of the shoe, so I had to send them back :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I wear a size 8.5 to 9.0 men's shoe. I read the reviews on here and people said to round down,so I did. I ordered a size 8 croc. The shoe arrived on time,actually early. But! Rounding down one size was incorrect,these shoes are HUGE. My son wears a size 10 and they fit ok on him. I received them today and they are being returned today. Even with socks they are so big they will not stay on my foot. That includes using the strap,they are just to big. I have no idea who measures the size of these things but they really need to learn how to read and measure. They are way off. Now to top it off I am being charged to return these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Before I ordered I read all the bad reviews about the sizes so I was skeptical, but when I recieved my crocs, they fit perfectly! I wear a size 15 mens and the 14-15 size was perfect. I noticed mine were made in Mexico and not China like some others, so Im not sure if that has anything to do with it. As far as comfort, there is nothing more comfortable than crocs! I don't even think walking on air would be as comfortable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happen to crocs","review":"Recently I purchased a new pair of crocs as I need a choco color. I have had a pair for several years. I sent the new pair back as they were uncomfortable, stiff and hard. What happen to the soft rubber soles that soften each step. I wish products that were good to excellent would not use lower quality material that changes the comfort level they once had. I will not purchase crocs in the future. There is a huge difference. My four dollar off brand for gardening felt more comfortable than those new shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent shoe sizes","review":"I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7. However, when they arrived, while the Thongs fit perfectly, with room to wiggle, the Caymans were way too small (I'd almost say a full size too small). The Thongs were \\"made in China\\" and the Caymans \\"made in Mexico\\". I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries. It would appear to me that there is no \\"standard\\" mold used. So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size, depending on where they are manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious sizing problems","review":"These shoes are at least one size larger than the \\"normal\\" size should be. I had to return my order and pay shipping. After reading the other reviews, I found that my problem is obviously not unique. Since there is no way to try out these shoes in local stores and buy the same size at Amazon (sizing inconsistent, depending on origins of manufacturers), I would NOT advise anyone buying them online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocs","review":"Crocs are the greatest. I now own three pair. Love the Pearl color and the style of this one is not so \\"clunky\\" looking.They are the greatest for saving tired feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"gives me great arch support","review":"I bought these for the advertised arch support and they do that for me. The strap however is a pain and I removed them... These are a bit over priced or I would get a 2nd pair.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cayman Sandal","review":"crocs Cayman SandalComfortable is the best I can say. I Ware mine most of the time with or with out socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a \\"croc\\"!!!","review":"Everything is fine with my recent purchase of a pair of crocs......I bought these for one of my daughters.....She is very happy with them..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent producto","review":"I have bought other Crocs through Amazon before. Again, this purchasing experience was excellent. No problems with size, color or delivery time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good product","review":"Crocs are the most comfortable shoes ever. They are therapeutic for tired aching feet and they are low in cost. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, lightweight shoe. As a bonus, Crocs come in a variety of colors to match a variety of outfits and personalities. Whether working, walking, or just kicking around, Crocs are a comfortable, cozy, and colorful way to dress your feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"Excelent, this was a gift and it arrived at the time they said and what I ask, will buy another one for my girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad shoes","review":"Shoes were not delivered very quickly. Upon examination, they were two different sizes. Returned them for exchange, the new shoes lasted only a few days before the strap broke. Not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!!","review":"These Crocs have been good so far, but I don't think that there are ANY shoes that don't hurt my feet after standing on concrete for several hrs!!!.....but for wearing around town and to work, they are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Comfortable sandals, classic Croc design (not so pretty but you'll get use to it) but in my opinion kinda overpriced for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what i wanted","review":"Perfect fit, perfectly white color. Hard to find in stores but super fast shipping, arrived in perfect condition, at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat ugly crocs","review":"This was my first pair of crocs, planned to use them for gardening and expected to find them very comfortable as per reviews and friends' opinions. There are very wide - the box said roomy fit or some similar word. They are supposed to be M but are quite wide and I have narrow feet, so my feet slip around in them, they are bulky and with the red, I look ridiculous in them but do wear them in the muddy garden when watering etc. Disappointed in the fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beach.","review":"We travel to Sanibel Beach every May. It is famous for its shelling. Great, but not great for walking/wading in the water. The shells HURT! Saw a man fishing in Crocs and thought what a great idea. Waterproof, don't hold the water, protection against the shells. Like I said,Perfect for the Beach (and comfortable anywhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn! Wrong Size","review":"Wanted to be in the five star review group, but that was not to be this. I just got my Crocs - excited as I have not been able to find them locally. I live on the beach and walk everywhere miles a day, so this silly looking shoe has become a must have for me. I am a convert won over by there comfort and durability, but they are not a comfort when they run a size small. I returned mine, with the usually no problems return from Amazon and I have ordered more in size 9 instead of size 8. Lets hope the 9 fits, or I swear I will go back to sneakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"Crocs Cayman Shoe for Adults:This was the 2nd pair of Crocs Cayman shoes that I bought on line. The first pair was perfect. This pair was made out of hard rubber and had no give to them at all. They are not able to be worn. Also, I felt the shipping charge was excessive. The first pair of Crocs I ordered were the exact same price and included free shipping. I will not be doing any more business with Amazon, unless you people resolve my complaint to my satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Their Stock","review":"I'm a little bitter because their stock tanked right after I bought in. That's the last time I ever use a Magic Eight Ball for stock picking. Before that, it told me that Google was overpriced at $95 a share.So anyhoo, these shoes are really comfortable. They are kinda like walking on air, except that you can't walk on air because that's impossible. But if you could walk on air, I imagine that it would feel like a nice pair of Crocs.Believe the hype!!!!!11111!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable shoes.....Made in the USA","review":"These shoes are of great quality and very comfortable. I was also very happy to see that this pair was made in the USA....I know all of them are not but I was happy to have a pair. I plan to get more colors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we expected.","review":"We weren't sure what size to get, and they are a little big. However, my son is only 11 and still growing, so we intentionally bought big. Overall very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slip on and go shoes!","review":"I typically wear an 8 1/2 in most shoes, but the size 8 fits me perfectly. I ordered the aqua color, and the color of the shoes is very true to the picture. The only bad thing about the color is that it gets dirty very easily. A quick rinse with soap and water gets them clean again with no problem. I wear them mostly when I'm cleaning around the house or running a quick errand, and they are extremely comfortable. All in all I'm very happy with my crocs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Croco-mania","review":"Surprisingly comfortable. Love to wear them when watering plants in my backyard. I wear size 13 shoe but 12 in a Croc. My German Shepherdloves them also..so beware..they must be kept out of your dog's reach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great foot wear","review":"The pair of Crocs that I purchased are very comfortable, fumctional, and exceed the expections I had when I considered everyday foot wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous!!!!","review":"After my favorite \\"jeans shoes\\" fell apart, literally and at a social function much to my mortification, I began to wear my Crocs knock-offs that I bought at Dollar General about five years ago. They are dark purple and look pretty good with jeans and with some dark thick socks. I decided once and for all to get myself some REAL Crocs. Well I could have saved myself time and money by just sticking with my cute little DGs. I could not believe how ugly these Crocs were when I opened the box. I have a wide foot but these are ridiculously wide. I have a new-found respect for my DGs now and have brought them in from the front porch where they've been for five years, washed them, and placed them in my closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care how comfortable they are...","review":"These shoes just look ridiculously stupid on anyone who wears them. So, unless you are a little kid or a clown - please stop the madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLIEST PIECE OF CLOTHING EVER CREATED!!!!","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who has such severe foot pain and discomfort that they would have to actually wear these horrendous looking shoes in public.If you own a pair of these, do yourself a favor and LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR before you go out in public wearing these unsightly things. If you can't see how ridiculous you look, I just don't know what to tell you.... Other than that everyone else can see just how dreadful you look wearing these hideous shoes, and we're laughing our @$$es off at you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please. Everyone. Stop! Please stop wearing thses.","review":"Let's get one thing straight. These things are ugly as sin. I'm not a fashionista or a shoe snob by any means. I mostly tend towards sneakers, and I own Teva flip-slops. I care very little for fashions. Crocks, however, make my eyes bleed just a little whenever I see them.Yes, they are comfortable. That does not make it OK to wear them. Many, many, many other shoes out there are also comfortable and also have the benefit of not being a crime against humanity. Wearing them with jeans or slacks is twice as bad, and makes baby Jesus cry. And if there are any hipsters out there considering them, it is also not OK to wear them ironically.Please. For the good of all humanity, do not wear these. Ophthalmologists everywhere will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not shoes","review":"I first saw these abominations on a 6 year old and I thought, it won't happen again; surely this is just a one time thing-but no. Then I saw another person wearing them and another and another, and I said \\"oh no\\" \\"no no no\\" \\"please, no\\". They are a complete fashion disaster. If good fashion had an evil twin brother, they would name him crocs. I won't even acknowledge anyone wearing these....things. Anyone seen wearing these catastrophes will be removed from my will. When I get one. Horrible, just horrible. If you purchase these, don't even look at me.
